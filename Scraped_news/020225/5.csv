Fears over his ties to Russia and China abound (for instance, he met with China’s Vice President Han Zheng last month). His lack of caution raises eyebrows, not to mention his reported drug use. Then there's his various business interests: Tesla, SpaceX, X, XAI, the Boring Company, and whatever other entities he's quietly created. How much can he really balance alongside government work with the Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), and without manifold conflicts of interest?"", ""Some believe he's already putting American secrets in danger of exposure. Alarm bells have gone into overdrive after his attempted takeovers of USAID, where DOGE was reportedly seeking access to classified material and which has previously signed contracts with SpaceX; the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which holds personal information on every federal worker; and of the Treasury payment system that pays out trillions for Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a whole lot more. Raising concerns about the level of care being applied to that data, according to Wired, a 25-year-old coder who’d been employed at two of Musk’s businesses, is one of those who has been granted access and even the power to rewrite the codebase of the systems responsible for sending payments from federal agencies."", 'As one federal government worker wrote on Slate, the OPM and Treasury systems are akin to the valet sheds of federal government, holding the keys to a wealth of personal information.“Now, there’s a ham-fisted goon in an ill-fitting valet attendant’s coat rummaging in broad daylight through all of the keys—all of that private information, previously given in trust, handled with care, and regulated by law,” the worker wrote.', 'Senator Ron Wyden fretted, “These payment systems simply cannot fail, and any politically-motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy.” In a letter to Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Wyden wrote, “I am concerned that Musk’s enormous business operation in China — a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems — endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk.”', 'Famed tech reporter Kara Swisher has been even starker in her warnings on BlueSky: “The unlawful seizure of data, payments, hiring and even real estate control by an unelected & unfettered digital narcissist at the behest of a power grabbing chief executive is the only story right now… this is a hostile takeover and our nation’s lawmakers are sleeping through it.', 'DOGE’s work is already inviting legal challenges. Senator Senator Ed Markey, D-Mass., has introduced a bill to prevent any individual from gaining unauthorized access to the Treasury’s central payment systems. The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions have also sued the Treasury Department in an attempt to block DOGE’s access.', 'Got a tip on surveillance or cybercrime?

Musk and his allies have also been busy firing the federal workforce, offering “deferred resignations” and replacing longtime civil servants with his personal lackeys. The Office of Personnel Management, the key staffing agency for the entire federal government, is being run by a cadre of Musk cronies.', 'The Treasury’s payment system is responsible for delivering trillions in Social Security payments, Medicare benefits and more to millions of Americans across the country.', 'And Friday, the highest-ranking career official at the Treasury Department, David A. Lebryk, reportedly resigned after refusing to hand Musk’s lackeys the keys to the government’s entire payment system and the $6 trillion in payments the system processes annually.', 'The Treasury’s payment system is responsible for delivering trillions in Social Security payments, Medicare benefits and more to millions of Americans across the country. It’s not yet entirely clear what Musk plans to do with this system, which has historically been overseen by a small number of career officials. But a few possibilities have emerged.', 'First, accessing the Treasury’s payment system could be a path to freezing government funding, as the administration attempted earlier this week. Musk could halt payments to programs like Medicaid, Meals on Wheels, Head Start and more, maneuvering around the courts. Musk has already directed his engineers to find ways to turn off the flow of money to programs he and President Donald Trump oppose. With the keys to the Treasury’s payment system, he can unilaterally cut off these funds right at the source.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'Musk could also get his hands on the “Do Not Pay” system that lists individuals or contractors the government has blacklisted, theoretically granting him control over whom the government does business with. Government contracts have been central to Musk’s $400 billion net worth; his companies have signed billions of dollars’ worth of government contracts. He could easily place his rivals on the Do Not Pay list or turn the spigot back on for friends who have been blacklisted.', 'While the Trump administration has sworn up and down that it will not touch Social Security and Medicare, it’s hard not to question whether this access would put these payments right in DOGE’s crosshairs. Initially, Musk pledged that DOGE would cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. Achieving that goal is nearly impossible without going after Medicare and Social Security. And though Musk has since tempered expectations on the commission’s cost-cutting goals — saying there is “a good shot” at cutting $1 trillion — even a reduction of that size would do incredible damage to our country’s social safety net.', 'Nor is Musk chasing these cuts for their own sake. He’s helping congressional Republicans attempt to pay for a new round of tax breaks for corporations and the ultrawealthy — including Musk himself.', 'Luckily, Americans see right through this grift.', 'It’s nice to believe in a fantasy in which Musk and DOGE work alongside civil servants to improve technology and services for Americans and save a few bucks along the way. But all evidence points to the contrary. The richest man in the world, whom no one elected to any government position, is seeking unprecedented access to confidential information, including information pertaining to his own business interests, and seems hell-bent on cutting off as much funding as possible for the programs that matter to the rest of us.', 'Luckily, Americans see right through this grift. An AP-NORC poll found that 52% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Musk — and less than a third of Americans approve of DOGE. Americans don’t want an unelected and unaccountable billionaire dictating what working families can and cannot afford. If Musk is going to continue running the government like one of his failed businesses, perhaps someone should force his “resignation” too.', 'Lindsay Owens is executive director of Groundwork Collaborative and author for the forthcoming book, ""Gouged.""', '© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

"Colorado Democrats call recent actions by Elon Musk, President Trump illegal as Boebert cheers USAID gutting",https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/03/colorado-elon-musk-donald-trump-jason-crow-usaid-congress/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Digital Replica Edition', 'TRENDING:', '', '', 'Colorado’s congressional Democrats criticized Elon Musk’s efforts to gut the U.S. government’s foreign aid agency and access sensitive federal data in recent days, calling the efforts by the “unelected billionaire” unlawful and pledging to take action to curb it.', '“These actions are dangerous, reckless and unlawful,” U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette said in a statement, “and I believe we must utilize every legislative tool available to investigate, prevent and oppose these efforts.”', 'But U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican and longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, praised Musk’s work to hobble the United States Agency for International Development. Created by President John F. Kennedy and later reaffirmed as an agency and funded by Congress, it has now been placed under the authority of the U.S. State Department.', 'The agency, colloquially known as USAID, has been targeted by Musk and a small group of allies from Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump created via an executive order to cut government spending.', 'USAID, which accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget, provides aid overseas to fund education and fight starvation and disease. Staff members — as well as federal lawmakers — have been barred from entering the agency’s building, programs have been shut down and thousands more employees have been laid off.', 'Trump has accused the agency of fraud, without providing any evidence.', '“President Trump campaigned on aggressively cutting wasteful government spending that doesn’t benefit Americans, and we’re seeing that play out now with President Trump directing Elon Musk and the DOGE initiative to investigate federal spending in a safe, legal manner that also respects the privacy of Americans,” Boebert, who represents the Eastern Plains and Douglas County, said in statement to The Denver Post.', '“I’ve worked for years to convince members of Congress to take a closer look at where our taxpayer dollars are going, as well as whether we truly need the gargantuan federal workforce we currently have,” she said, “so I’m glad we are finally seeing some progress when it comes to finding out how our money is being spent.”', 'Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have been less enthusiastic about Musk’s seemingly unchecked gutting of a federal agency.', 'U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, who represents Aurora and several southern Denver suburbs in Congress, told reporters at a local event Monday that Trump didn’t have the authority to shutter USAID.', '“(Congress) created it, we mandated it,” he said. “We have funded it. So a president has the authority to change policies within congressionally created agencies, but the president does not have the authority to destroy or dismantle agencies that have been created by Congress. That would be a violation of the law and usurping congressional power. So that goes into the category of things that we’re going to be pushing very hard on when I go to Washington.”', 'Neguse, who represents northern Colorado and is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, echoed Crow. In a statement, he said that Trump “does not have the authority to eliminate statutorily authorized agencies, impound funds lawfully appropriated by the Congress, or to give unfettered access to core government financial payment and personnel systems to his billionaire campaign donors.” He was referring to the access that Musk and his staff have gained to sensitive U.S. Treasury information.', 'U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, who represents Denver, told its City Council during a meeting Monday morning that Musk’s efforts regarding USAID and the U.S. Treasury Department — where the billionaire has reportedly gained access to Social Security and Medicare customer information — should “be blocked by legal action.”', '“I can’t sugarcoat how bad the situation really is,” DeGette told Denver councilmembers. Later, in a statement issued by her office, she said Trump was “letting Elon Musk run rampant.”', 'U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who represents central Colorado’s 7th Congressional District, wrote on X that Musk was acting as “an unelected billionaire.”', '“This is an unprecedented abuse of power by a dangerous, unelected and unhinged person,” she said in a follow-up statement sent by her office. “Nobody voted for Elon Musk, and neither he nor anyone he deputizes have any business anywhere near sensitive personal information about Americans or federal workers.”', 'Pettersen noted that the U.S. Constitution “gives spending authority to the people’s representatives in the U.S. House.” She added: “I’ll do everything I can in Congress to fight back against this illegal, unprecedented, and reckless abuse of power he has neither earned nor been authorized to have.”', 'Musk’s team, whose involvement similarly has not received congressional approval, has sought to access secure areas and information within federal agencies, prompting a senior Treasury Department official to resign in recent days, according to the Washington Post.', 'Crow said Musk and his staff’s efforts pose “very real national security concerns.”', 'U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, wrote on X that the reported “meddling in important Treasury payment systems is incredibly dangerous and risks severe damage to our country and economy.” He said he would seek answers “alongside my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee.”', 'A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a freshman Republican who represents the Western Slope and Pueblo, said Trump “is within his constitutional prerogative to ask an individual or individuals to assist in recommending policy and personnel changes to the government.”', 'The office’s statement added: “Congressman Hurd is looking forward to engaging with the President and his team to cut through the government’s red tape and unleash American innovation.”', 'In a Tuesday morning statement, U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said that “violating our laws is not the way” to make government more efficient, and he pledged to fight Trump and Musk’s efforts “in the courts, on the Senate floor, and anywhere else we can to defend Colorado and the Constitution.”', 'Messages sent to Republican freshmen U.S. Reps. Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton on Monday were not returned.', 'Staff writers Elliott Wenzler and John Aguilar contributed to this story.', 'Stay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2025 MediaNews Group']"
ELON MUSK IS PERMANENTLY DELETING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-elon-musk-deleting-government-agencies-usaid-1235254897/,"['By ANONYMOUS', 'The following commentary was written by a USAID employee, who has requested anonymity for fear of retribution. ', 'Working for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) — the conduit for American soft power across the globe — demanded I prepare for frightening things that thankfully most Americans don’t need to worry about. Defensive driving techniques to escape from a terrorist attack. How to spot where landmines might be in the field. Emergency first aid in the event of a shooting or other attack, including in extremely remote geographies. How to identify possible victims of human trafficking. ', 'One thing they never taught us? What to do if you find yourself on the leading edge of a corrupt billionaire’s coup in America.', 'Since Jan. 20, President Trump — or, more accurately, Elon Musk, the religious zealots, and far-right activists behind Project 2025 — have been enacting a hostile takeover at the heart of the American experiment and dismantling the bureaucratic machinery that is the last bulwark against fascism in the United States. While the focus predictably has been on Trump’s never-ending cascade of absurdist claims and the unprecedented overreach of an aborted freeze on all federal spending, USAID has been ground zero for a different set of parasites riding the MAGA wave. ', '', 'Since Trump’s slim victory in the 2024 election, these hangers-on have been telegraphing that USAID would be the test site for how to destroy the U.S. government. They’re led by Musk, the richest man in the world; Stephen Miller, a White House adviser who architected the Muslim travel ban and child separation policies at the border; and Peter Marocco, who during the first Trump administration bounced around the Departments of Defense, State, Commerce, and USAID before reportedly turning up at the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.', 'It started right out of the gates on Jan. 20, with an executive order freezing all foreign aid that shocked even the most seasoned diplomats. For public purposes, the series of moves now wears the face of freshly minted Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with support from Musk acolytes who are spreading across the government like roaches, including at the already-captured Office of Personnel Management (OPM).', '', 'Musk’s allies and other unelected members of the administration’s transition team quickly began and continue to demand lists. Lists of projects and employees working on vaguely defined DEI-related activities. Lists of civil service employees in their vulnerable probationary years. Lists of employees working on statutorily mandated programs that could be targeted for conversion to Trump’s beloved Schedule F, a new classification of federal employees created by executive order that strips them of their labor protections. ', 'In the first week, an agency-wide gag order barred USAID employees from talking to anyone outside of the Agency, including foreign governments wondering if programs will continue, critical private-sector partners co-funding agency activities, and even other federal agencies.', 'The second week kicked off with the removal of USAID’s senior career executive leadership, with nearly 60 civil servants put on administrative leave without cause and with no promise of due process, in what we all quickly started to call the “Monday Afternoon Massacre.” They got 30 minutes of notice.', 'Contractors representing more than 25 percent of the Agency’s workforce were furloughed or, in the case of many of those working for USAID’s Bureaus of Global Health and Humanitarian Assistance, outright fired. This means the White House and Marco Rubio’s promises to restore life-saving aid through a waiver system is ultimately an impossible lie: There’s no one left to actually deliver the aid. ', '', 'This was followed by the administration’s embarrassing and now-infamous “Fork in the Road” email, a naked attempt to purge frightened civil servants with the empty promise of a deferred resignation and a pinky swear that they wouldn’t just fire us anyway. The email was strikingly similar to one that Musk once sent to Twitter employees, and suggested we “sign” the template resignation letter by replying simply with the word “Resign” — to the illegal and reportedly unvetted email server that federal employees allege was connected directly to classified OPM systems by Musk’s allies.', 'By the end of week two, the cuts got deeper: Any career civil servants with the word “gender” in their job titles or position descriptions were put on administrative leave — even those championing work started under Ivanka Trump’s pet project, the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. USAID’s flag and logo were removed from offices in the D.C. area as rumors began swirling of an imminent — and illegal — absorption into the Department of State. They even took down the memorial wall at our headquarters honoring the USAID personnel who have died in service to our country. The USAID system for collecting the results of America’s investments, the Development Information Solution, was unceremoniously “terminated.” On Saturday, Feb. 1, the USAID website and its vast wealth of taxpayer-funded research and reports was taken offline.', '', 'None of us know if we have jobs to return to today — a USAID press email address notified all personnel overnight that our headquarters is closed and “[f]urther guidance will be forthcoming.” The actual sender was identified as Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Gavin Kliger. Early today, Musk said on X that he was shutting the agency down, with Trump’s support. ', 'If we try to log in to our computers or enter our offices and are rejected, does that mean we are on administrative leave? Or are we outright fired? ', 'Staff have been encouraged to take out professional liability insurance policies given the growing likelihood former USAID contractors with outstanding invoices sue. This is a terrible deal for the government and taxpayers too: Those invoices are all quickly gathering interest thanks to laws that compel agencies to issue payments promptly. In other words, the myriad things Congress funded USAID to do, and which have been done, all just got more expensive for no reason.', 'Federal employees swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. We are not partisan, regardless of our personal political views. We do not — and should not — swear oaths of loyalty to President Trump, Shadow President Musk, their enablers, or the feckless legislators who have decided to stand by while the radical Project 2025 obliterates Congress’ rightful authority and lines up their constituents for slaughter.', 'USAID is a small agency, representing just 0.7 percent of the federal budget last year, yet for more than 60 years it has been punching above its weight. My colleagues and our predecessors were instrumental to eradicating smallpox, have been at the forefront of treating and preventing the spread of HIV, and shipped millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries. We’ve revolutionized water, sanitation, energy, and communications infrastructure in more than 80 countries. We’ve built democratic institutions and ensured free and fair elections on every populated continent. We’ve been on the ground providing food, clean water, shelter, and hope after every major disaster, disease outbreak, and war since 1961. We’ve helped teach hundreds of millions of children to read.', 'When we’re gone, who will fill the void? ISIS? The cartels? China? When we’re gone, where will an emboldened Trump and Musk strike next? The Department of Energy and its engineers stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, the Department of Education and the more than $119 billion it doles out every year to keep public schools afloat, the Environmental Protection Agency and its clean air and water regulations that have saved millions of American lives?', 'And given the value Musk is providing to foreign powers — including countries like China, where he has vast fortunes on the line — will anyone capable of assessing the damage and self-enrichment currently unfolding in real time even be left?', '', 'USAID is the guinea pig. After us, there will be more. Many more. And then, eventually, there will be none. Elon Musk and the DOGE, a made-up meme of an organization with no congressional mandate to exist, has started to replace more than 2 million experienced experts who have dedicated their careers to helping everyday Americans with untrained, inefficient, and incompetent tech bros.', 'And in those same two weeks, they have also managed to force their way into the government’s most sensitive and highly classified systems — the dangers of which may take decades to realize.', 'The richest man in the world and his allies have used his influence with the president of the United States to seize control of government procurement data (including intellectual property of many of his competitors); gain access to the names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and performance records of millions of Americans that he specifically denounces — including USAID employees Musk describes as being part of a “criminal organization”; and, with this cabal’s parallel efforts at Treasury, grab the reins of the very mechanisms that deliver every cent of the trillions the government spends, including on Social Security, Medicare, and SNAP payments.', 'Musk is treating the U.S. government like another company that he can bring to its knees while stealing its best ideas and lining his already comically overflowing pockets — but this time, it’s with taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars.', 'President Trump’s loose leash on Musk, meanwhile, is demonstrating that he is willing to sit in the Oval Office while smarter men use his banner and power to drive this country to ruin.', 'When will congressional leaders stop cowering in fear of billionaire overlords and remember their dereliction of duty leaves over 330 million people more vulnerable by the day?', 'USAID makes America stronger, safer, and more prosperous, and we make the world a better place.

Signs of the fight emerged this week.', 'The top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left unexpectedly on Friday after Trump-affiliated officials expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.', 'WIth Lebryk out, Musk’s DOGE associates at Treasury now have full access to the government’s payments system.', 'According to one person familiar with the department, Trump-affiliated employees had previously asked about Treasury’s ability to stop payments. But Lebryk’s pushback was, “We don’t do that,” the person said.', '“They seem to want Treasury to be the chokepoint on payments, and that’s unprecedented,” the person added, emphasizing that it is not the bureau’s role to decide which payments to make — it is “just to make the f-ing payments.”', 'Before Trump’s inauguration, members of his transition landing team wanted to know granular details about the bureau’s proprietary computer systems, including “each step in the disbursement process.” They also wanted to visit field offices where government workers, in Philadelphia or Kansas, work on computers that disburse payments.', 'The requests puzzled many career officials initially. The transition operation hadn’t requested substantive briefings on any of Treasury’s other critical areas of operation, multiple people familiar with the matter said. Veterans of past transition efforts, representing presidents of both parties, couldn’t recall precedent for the Trump team’s entreaty.', 'The arcane process of cutting the government’s checks is normally overlooked by political leadership, though the incoming administration exhibited an odd interest in its inner workings, sources said — raising suspicions among career officials about the intent to tinker with a crucial financial pipeline that keeps the nation’s economy running.', 'Tension between Lebryk and Trump political appointees, including those affiliated with DOGE, had been mounting, with sources telling CNN that things escalated this week after the Office of Management and Budget on Monday ordered a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal spending.', 'At the time, Lebryk was the acting Treasury Secretary. Trump’s pick to lead Treasury, Scott Bessent, was sworn in Tuesday. OMB rescinded that order a few days later after an uproar that’s still being litigated in court.', 'Lebryk’s departure, which he announced by email to his team on Friday morning, has shaken up career Treasury officials, several sources have told CNN this week. With Lebryk gone, Bessent signed off on access to the payments system for the DOGE team detailed to Treasury by Friday evening.', 'DOGE officials, in the lead up to Bessent’s decision to sign-off on their access, had been operating from the position that Trump’s Inauguration Day executive order establishing their agency had already authorized their access. That order, in part, directs the heads of federal agencies to take “all necessary steps” within the law to ensure Musk’s group has “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.”', 'Lebryk’s exit was first reported by the Washington Post, but the full scale of the tension inside the Treasury Department has not been previously reported.

Not even once.”', 'The post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system’s value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation’s economy lies in its reliability.', 'Jack Lew, who ran the Treasury Department during President Barack Obama’s second term, said any attempt to disrupt payments made by the BFS would be dangerous to the world’s markets.', '“The American people should not have to worry about political interference when it comes to receiving Social Security and other payments the fiscal service makes,” Lew told CNN. “And as the world’s reserve currency, it is crucial to maintain confidence around the globe that the US Government will make timely payments on its obligations.”', 'Some of the members of Trump’s landing team present for the initial transition meetings are now working at the Treasury Department.', 'Among them is Baris Akis, a Musk ally who is the co-founder of a venture capital firm, Human Capital. Akis’ presence raised alarms among some of the Treasury officials present for those early meetings, since he was not an official member of the incoming Trump administration and didn’t have a security clearance at the time, the sources told CNN.', 'Akis, along with a few others affiliated with Musk’s DOGE, has been in the Treasury building in recent days. Sources familiar with the department tell CNN they “rove around as a pack” — emphasizing how the group is working in the building in a way that is separate from the rest of the department’s staff.', 'Akis did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.', 'Meanwhile, several blocks away in downtown Washington, Musk has asserted significant influence at the Office of Personnel Management, with at least one other employee formerly with Human Capital. The agency, which serves as the overarching human resources headquarters for the federal government, has historically been an operation driven by career officials who have worked across administrations of both parties.', 'Political appointees have long played a role, but according to one long-time official, the current iteration “is like a different world.”', 'That world is now populated with a number of Musk acolytes.', 'Amanda Scales, who previously worked for Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI after working for Human Capital, arrived at OPM as the agency chief of staff on Inauguration Day and has been the central figure identified with the agency’s sweeping efforts to restructure the federal workforce, multiple agency officials said. She previously worked at Akis’ company.', 'Brian Bjelde, the human resources chief for SpaceX, and Anthony Armstrong, a Morgan Stanley banker who worked on Musk’s purchase of Twitter, have also taken on substantial roles. Musk worked out of the OPM headquarters – with his surrogates by his side – last week, the officials said.', 'Trump’s nominee to run OPM, Scott Kupor, is awaiting confirmation but also holds deep ties to the Silicon Valley universe integral to Musk’s DOGE operations.', 'Nonprofits and Democrat-led states are already suing to try to block the Trump administration’s attempts to freeze federal spending. Despite the rescission of the memo directing the pause, they say the lawsuits need to continue, because of evidence the funding is being withheld.', 'On Friday, a federal judge in Rhode Island told the Trump administration it couldn’t block payments to states, nor could it try to revive stopping payments in any agency under Trump. More hearings are to come, including on Monday morning in a separate federal court, in DC.', 'The court fights show how any action by the administration that tampers with congressionally mandated funding could attract aggressive litigation.', 'The lawsuits haven’t yet touched upon the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s work inside the Treasury Department.', 'This story has been updated with new reporting.', 'CNN’s Alayna Treene contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

There can be a legitimate debate about whether the US should fund those programs in part because we know, thanks to transparency, that the US government is funding those programs.', 'But his method of taking over the bureaucracy is much less transparent than the bureaucracy itself.', 'When Bill Clinton offered buyouts to federal workers, in 1993, for instance, he did so after getting buy-in from Congress. Trump’s administration is banking on a slim majority of Republicans in the House buying in to his plan, assuming they get a chance to have a say.', 'The New York Times and others reported this week that three former Musk employees have taken top positions at the Office of Personnel Management, the formerly obscure HR department for the federal government.

Despite encouraging workers to return to the office, Musk also sees getting rid of government real estate or leases, and dispersing remaining workers throughout the country, as a cost saving technique.', 'Trump has twice referred to federal workers being fired if they’re not in offices after a February 6 deadline. “If they don’t agree by February 6 to show up back to work in their office, they will be terminated,” he said during a speech at the White House this week.

', 'The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses roughly 88% of all federal payments, totaling around $5.4 trillion in fiscal year 2023, according to the agency’s website. A senior Treasury official left the agency after a confrontation with Musk’s team on Friday. ', '“Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal spoke with Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, about the role of this payment system and how control over it could threaten the economy. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. ', 'Kai Ryssdal: The Bureau of the Fiscal Service. What, just so everybody understands, does it do?', 'Wendy Edelberg: It is the part of our government that makes sure all the money gets to the right place, all the money coming into the federal government from our tax payments, and all the money, most of the money, coming out of the federal government for payments for Social Security benefits, payment to doctors who are treating patients on Medicaid and Medicare, payments to agencies. It is like our huge checkbook.', 'Ryssdal: All right, so on a scale of like 1 to 10, your level of concern about this, please, with untrained and unprofessional people in charge of this account.', 'Edelberg: I mean, 10. So it’s not that Elon Musk and the people who work with Elon Musk are the first people to worry about the integrity of this system. Congress has worried about this, and it’s passed legislation to improve the system. There are a lot of very responsible eyes on this system making sure it works well, and so having just folks willy-nilly with their hands at the dials — no, that is not responsible.', 'Ryssdal: I’ll point out here that we have been since the 21st of January, I believe, in what the Treasury Department calls extraordinary measures because there is the debt limit. Congress has to figure out what it wants to do about that. And this is the office that, almost literally to the penny, figures out how the United States doesn’t default on its debts. Is that right?', 'Edelberg: It is. So the way to think about the debt limit, and, you know, we are in a period where the U.S. Treasury is not allowed to increase the amount that it is borrowing. So it’s doing, you know, some payment management to make sure that it always has enough money.', 'Ryssdal: We last spoke, you and I, when we were doing the show we did on the independence of the Federal Reserve and the importance of that when it comes to monetary policy. And you pointed out that if the Federal Reserve is politically cowed, the entire global economy is at risk. This seems to be somewhat analogous. If the United States government, if we don’t know who’s paying the bills and what bills are being paid because that’s what’s happening here, the global economy, then, is at risk. Is that an overstatement?', 'Edelberg: If we’re going to worry about the whole global financial system, I am more worried about interest and principal payments on Treasury bonds not being paid on time. I mean, [the U.S. Agency for International Development] has already not received any money since early last week, so there are already payments it looks like being improperly withheld against the wishes of Congress, who enacted laws and appropriated money into USAID. So already there are probably some shenanigans. I wouldn’t worry about the global financial system until we get to a point where somebody decides or somebody threatens that it would be clever if we just didn’t make interest payments to, let’s say, our foreign creditors or something stupid like that.', 'Ryssdal: Which, honestly, we don’t know, right? ', 'Edelberg: I mean, what frustrates me to no end is that there are so many people all over the United States who have been worrying for, in fact, decades about the risk of a fiscal crisis, and they’ve just been looking under the wrong lamppost. They’re worried about the risk of a fiscal crisis just from grindingly higher federal borrowing and I think the real risk of a fiscal crisis is political malpractice.', 'Ryssdal: I paused there, Wendy, because I was looking for a follow-up, but I’m not sure there is one at this point, right? We leave it right there?', 'Edelberg: I mean, if it’s helpful, I can talk more about how, you know, when it comes to the debt limit, they’re not going to reinvest money in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund —', 'Ryssdal: But we just don’t — the point of this entire conversation that you and I are having, and the issue with Musk and his acolytes being in charge of this facility, or at least having the access that we now believe them to have because there’s been no confirmation or statement of fact from anybody, there’s just lots of really good reporting — we just don’t know, right?', 'Edelberg: That’s right.

Private corporations and competitors need to take note. And anyone who thinks that surely won’t happen has not been paying attention.”', '***VIDEO HERE***', 'Washington, D.C. — Today, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, joined Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to sound the alarm over Elon Musk and his team at the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” being granted access to the federal government’s central payments system, which handles $6 trillion and the vast majority of all federal disbursements each year. Musk and his associates were granted access to the U.S. Treasury’s payment systems the same weekend they threatened their way into the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and seized Office of Personnel Management (OPM) computer systems. New reporting indicates they are now forcing their way into Small Business Administration (SBA) systems, as well. ', 'Murray and her colleagues outlined the threat of Musk and the administration abusing the Treasury’s payment system to illegally block funding and payments, the danger of allowing Musk access to Americans’ most sensitive personal data, and how this administration’s historic corruption and illegal funding freezes are putting our country’s economy and national security in jeopardy. ', 'Senator Murray’s remarks, as delivered, are below and video is HERE:', '“Well we’re two weeks in, and it’s already painfully clear that this is the most corrupt administration in our history, and it’s putting our economy, our government, and our most at-risk communities in serious jeopardy.', '“In particular, we learned that Elon Musk now has access to the Treasury Department’s most sensitive payment system handling six trillion dollars every year and managing nearly all federal disbursements. It’s a system that contains extremely sensitive personal and commercial information, and I’ve been hearing from people across my state who are truly alarmed about what Musk and his associates having access to this system could mean for their data—and for funding that they count on. ', '“Let’s not mince words here. An unelected, unaccountable billionaire—with expansive conflicts of interest, deep ties to China, and an indiscreet axe to grind against perceived enemies—is hijacking our nation’s most sensitive financial data system and its checkbook so that he can illegally block funds to our constituents, based on the slightest whim or wildest conspiracy. Funds—mind you—that Congress passed on a bipartisan basis. ', '“Some Republicans are trying to suggest that Musk only has ‘viewing access’ to Treasury’s highly sensitive payment system as if that’s acceptable either. But why on earth should we believe that—particularly when he is saying the exact opposite loudly and repeatedly for everyone to see? ', '“What funds will Elon target next—life-saving medical research? Housing assistance? Food banks? We already know he is falsely attacking faith-based organizations that help people—and promising to cut off funds based off conspiracy theories.', '“The world’s richest man has vowed to cut off funding that helps the least among us. Think about that. And next—think about how many dollars he himself makes from government contracts. And the Trump Administration is handing the keys of the Treasury over to him? It does not get more blatantly corrupt than that. ', '“And let me underscore just how dangerous this is—because now that Trump has handed over Treasury’s checkbook, what if Elon decides he doesn’t like how Ford is getting federal funds to build an EV battery plant, what’s next? All Elon has to do is say ‘oh, they’re woke,’ and he can convince Trump to illegally cut off those funds.', '“Maybe Elon will decide he doesn’t like that Blue Origin—and not SpaceX—gets a contract, so he wants to gum up the works on their payments. Private corporations and competitors need to take note. And anyone who thinks that surely won’t happen has not been paying attention.', '“Now, make no mistake: Trump and Musk have absolutely zero legal authority to hold up any federal payments that are law, but that has not stopped them so far.', '“This country is still reeling from the chaos of last week’s blanket spending freeze and Trump’s illegal executive orders to withhold funds are still not yet revoked. Trump and Musk have yet to find a law they think applies to them.', '“That is not how things work in this country. We have a democracy. We have checks and we have balances—where the President is accountable to Congress, where we pass the laws, and he implements them.', '“But some of my colleagues across the aisle seem to be forgetting that our democracy does not work by magic. We have to do our part to hold the President accountable. Our job is not to say ‘yes’ to everything any President does—no matter how lawless or harmful. ', '“Democrats are pushing back with the tools that we have. We will speak out, we will press this administration, we will open investigations, and we will demand accountability. The one tool we do not have is the majority in this Congress. ', '“So that means our Republican colleagues have to say ‘enough.’ We need them to join us. We need them to stand up to the corruption and lawlessness and stand up for the people they represent.”', '###', 'Sign up to receive Senator Murray’s newsletter and get updates on the work\nshe’s doing on behalf of Washington state.

That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money. "", ""While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers."", '""There\'s no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president\'s billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,"" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch. ', 'There are ""quite real risks"" that DOGE ""could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,"" he added.', 'Musk\'s access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging ""unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information"" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants. ', '""Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to \'unilaterally\' — and illegally — cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent. ', 'She added, ""It could also give them access to millions of Americans\' personal and financial information that is protected by law.""', ""The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

', ""Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. "", ""The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year. "", ""The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division."", 'In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according to the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted. ', 'The executive order signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given ""full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems."" DOGE itself is not a federal department. ', ""Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported. "", 'On Sunday, Musk stated that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees. ', 'Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.', ""Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried. "", 'Musk and DOGE ""now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary — and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,"" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. ""Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits — or their personal data.""', 'Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he\'s concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, ""whether intentional or unintentional.""', '""It appears that Musk\'s behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump\'s goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,"" he wrote.', ""Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients. "", 'Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn\'t respond to requests for comment but did repost an Associated Press article on X with the comment, ""No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances."" ', 'Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.

Treasury says Musk’s DOGE has not rejected payments in first attempt to clarify access granted to critical system,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/politics/treasury-payments-system-musk-doge-access/index.html,"['', 'The Treasury Department said Elon Musk aides detailed to the agency have “read-only” access to its sensitive $5 trillion US payments system and that no payments have been suspended or rejected as part of an ongoing review.', 'The information, provided in a letter to lawmakers from a Treasury official, amounts to the first substantive effort to detail the role Department of Government Efficiency staff detailed to the agency have in the operations of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.', 'Efforts to gain access to the systems, which are closely held and the lynchpin of federal government payments, have rattled career Treasury officials and raised significant concern among lawmakers and former government officials in recent days, as CNN has reported.', '“The ongoing review of Treasury’s systems is not resulting in the suspension or rejection of any payment instructions submitted to Treasury by other federal agencies across the government,” an unnamed official said in the Tuesday evening letter. “In particular, the review at the Fiscal Service has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed.”', 'The letter marks Treasury’s first public acknowledgment and explanation of the role held by Tom Krause, the chief executive officer at Cloud Software Group with ties to DOGE. Krause was described in recent weeks as the central DOGE-connected staffer driving the effort to secure access to the payment systems. Krause clashed with career officials over the request and was eventually granted access by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.', 'Krause is now a Treasury Department employee with “read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems in order to continue this operational efficiency assessment,” the letter states.', 'The actions of Krause and other DOGE representatives sparked widespread concern among career officials, who were puzzled by the intensifying requests for access to detailed payment systems data and code. David Lebryk – the career civil servant who led the bureau and served as acting secretary while Bessent awaited Senate confirmation – was placed on administrative leave before departing the agency after resisting the DOGE team requests.', 'Bessent, after his confirmation and Lebryk’s departure, granted access to Krause and his associates, people familiar with the matter said.', 'But Treasury has said nothing publicly about the behind-the-scenes struggle – or the scale of the access DOGE associates were granted – and lawmakers were left in the dark about what was happening. At the same time, Musk claimed on his social media platform X that his team was canceling payments.', 'The Treasury official said Krause is conducting the review of the payment systems, which cover 90% of all federal payments totaling 1.2 billion transactions per year, with “veteran career Treasury officials, and all operational processes continue to be conducted only by career Treasury staff in accordance with all standard security, safety and privacy standards.”', 'The letter also confirms Krause has joined Treasury as a “special government employee” – the same designation that applies to Musk – which means he can only work for the government for 130 days or fewer over the next year.', '“This role involves a hiring process that includes a review of a candidate’s credentials and background, and demands the same ethical standards of privacy, confidentiality, conflicts of interest assessment, and professionalism of other government employees. These assessments are conducted by career legal and ethics officials,” the letter states. “Mr. Krause is subject to the same security obligations and ethical requirements, including a Top Secret security clearance.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Musk and DOGE took responsibility Monday for the administration’s efforts to shut down USAID, which has for decades been the country’s primary method of distributing international humanitarian aid, writing on his social media site X, formerly Twitter, that he’d spent the weekend “feeding USAID into the wood chipper.”', 'Last week, the Associated Press reported DOGE employees had gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. Acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk was reportedly placed on leave and later resigned after resisting efforts by individuals working for Musk to access those systems.', 'DOGE’s increasing access to sensitive federal data has set off alarm bells across the government and drawn harsh rebukes from Democrats in Congress. On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, urged the federal government’s top auditor to launch an investigation into whether Musk and DOGE were violating federal privacy laws.', '“It is not clear why these individuals were granted unfettered access to such data, what they could do with it once inside these systems, and what protections are in place to ensure the Department has been complying with its legal obligations under the Privacy Act, 26 U.S.C. 6103, as well as other statutes and Treasury regulations that protect such sensitive information about millions of Americans,” Warren and Wyden wrote in a letter to Comptroller General Gene L. Dodaro, who heads the U.S. Government Accountability Office.', 'On Monday, an advocacy organization representing millions of American retirees and the nation’s largest federal workers union filed a lawsuit in federal court in D.C. arguing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had violated the law by giving Musk and DOGE access to sensitive personal and financial information. The lead plaintiff, the Alliance for Retired Americans, said it represents more than 4 million members who receive Social Security benefits, government pensions, veterans benefits and payments and medical support under the federal Black Lung Benefits Act.  ', '“The scale of the intrusion into individuals’ privacy is massive and unprecedented,” the lawsuit reads. “Millions of people cannot avoid engaging in financial transactions with the federal government and, therefore, cannot avoid having their sensitive personal and financial information maintained in government records.”', 'The suit seeks an order declaring Musk and DOGE’s access to Treasury records is unlawful and an injunction barring the department from continuing to permit such access.', '“People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his ‘DOGE,” the lawsuit reads. “And federal law says they do not have to.”', 'Musk has been undeterred in the face of criticism of DOGE, which claimed to have cut more than $1 billion in federal spending as of last week. On Tuesday, he posted a poll on X asking followers if they would would like DOGE to ""audit the IRS."" Musk has also taken aim at other federal agencies, including the Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a watchdog agency created by Congress following the 2008 financial crisis that has long been a target of Republicans.', 'The Alliance for Retired Americans suit was filed by attorneys for the public interest law firm Public Citizens Litigation Group and State Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit government watchdog organization. The two organizations are also representing the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the plaintiffs in the suit filed Monday, in a separate case challenging DOGE’s composition under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'IN OTHER NEWS', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
