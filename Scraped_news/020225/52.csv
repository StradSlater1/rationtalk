Then, the Raiders broke the bank to bring in Chip Kelly, making him the highest-paid coordinator.', 'In the wake of that move, ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter appeared on The Pat McAfee Show, sharing his thoughts and reaction on Chip Kelly returning to the NFL and the record-breaking contract that the Raiders gave him.', '“I think he wanted to get back to the NFL and the Raiders made a lot of inquiries and a lot of background checks to see what they were trying to do,” Adam Schefter said. “Again, I think everyone would agree on Chip’s offensive prowess and brilliance. They were trying to see, okay is there a reason we shouldn’t move in that direction? Is there another candidate that’s more qualified? They were looking at some other people as well. But, ultimately, the recommendations on Chip’s offensive mind came back in such a way that they felt this was the move to make.”', 'Chip Kelly has long since made his name as an offensive mind. That goes back to his time as the head coach at Oregon, which he would parlay into jobs in the NFL with the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers, going 38-35 over four seasons before returning to college.', 'The Las Vegas Raiders have a massive task that they’re up against. They sit in a now highly competitive AFC West that is highlighted by the Kansas City Chiefs. So, moving up from the bottom of the division is a tall task that the new staff is being tasked with, especially given the current roster construction and apparent need of a new quarterback.', '“They’re at a disadvantage in that division with those coaches and those quarterbacks in the AFC West. It’s loaded,” Schefter said. “He [Pete Carroll] comes in with energy and enthusiasm and a defensive expertise. So, they need somebody to run that offense and Chip Kelly is certainly capable of doing that.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The Raiders are now, reportedly, giving Chip Kelly $6 million a year. That’s a massive number for an assistant coach and it would be hard for anyone to turn down. It marks a sign that the Raiders are now willing to spend to get the job done.', '“They identified him. This is where the new money and the limited owners that the Raiders have come into play because Mark Davis got an infusion of money from the limited owners that included Tom Brady and they now can go out and spend that money on guys like Chip Kelly. There’s no salary cap for coaches. You’re capped off for what you can and can’t spend on players, but there’s no cap on coaches. So, if you want to go pay Chip Kelly $6 million a year to bring him into Las Vegas you can go do that, and having cash — and the Raiders clearly have some cash — that they can throw around on coaches and that they’re going to be able to use in the form of guaranteed money and signing bonuses to upcoming free agents,” Schefter said.', '“So, that’s going to be something that I think the Raiders lean into as they try to make up ground on teams in the AFC West and the rest of that conference.”', 'Chip Kelly left UCLA, where he was the head coach, to go to Ohio State as an offensive coordinator.

You’re Nuts: Which former Buckeye would you like to see as an Ohio State coordinator?,https://www.landgrantholyland.com/2025/2/4/24358190/youre-nuts-college-football-former-ohio-state-buckeyes-offensive-defensive-coordinator-alumni,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Your (almost) daily dose of good-natured, Ohio State banter.', 'Heavy is the head that lies the crown. After winning the national championship a few weeks ago, head coach Ryan Day now has to replace both his offensive and defensive coordinators, as well as the team’s offensive line coach. It all started when defensive coordinator Jim Knowles couldn’t pass up returning to his home state, taking the same position at Penn State.', 'Over the weekend, it was announced Justin Frye would be the new offensive line coach of the Arizona Cardinals, followed by the Las Vegas Raiders coming to terms with offensive coordinator Chip Kelly.', 'So where does Ryan Day look to replace the departed trio of assistants? Does Day promote from within? Maybe there are some experienced coordinators who are on Day’s radar, much like how Bill O’Brien was following last season. Then there is the possibility that Day decides a hungry Buckeye alum would be right to fill one of the positions.', 'Currently a hot name to replace Frye and lead the offensive line troops is former Ohio State center LeCharles Bentley. Even though Bentley is light on experience coaching at the college level, his passion for the game could be appealing to Day.', 'Seeing former Buckeyes return to Columbus to take positions on Ohio State’s coaching staff always adds some excitement to the program. Just look at the response after Brian Hartline was named wide receivers coach, and more recently when James Laurinaitis joined Day’s staff and was named linebackers coach prior to last season.', 'Today we are going to throw around some ideas for coordinators, and these options don’t need to be for the current hiring cycles. Maybe there is a name out there that could use a little more seasoning before taking on such a big role. Really we are looking at a name that could make the fan base pop with excitement.', 'For as good as J.T. Barrett was at quarterback for Ohio State, it became obvious early on that Barrett would be a tremendous coaching prospect in the future. Even former Buckeye head coach Urban Meyer thought Barrett would make a great coach, telling Barrett that he would hire him to his coaching staff as soon as his playing career was over.', 'Even though years ago Barrett didn’t see coaching in his future after he hung up his cleats, it didn’t take him long to find work in the coaching circles after he announced he was retiring.', 'After suffering an injury while training with the Edmonton Elks of the CFL in March 2022, Barrett retired a couple months later. Barrett was hired as an offensive assistant under Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell in July 2022. Following the 2022 season, Barrett was promoted and given the title of assistant quarterbacks coach.', 'After spending two seasons as the assistant quarterbacks coach in Detroit, Barrett recently was hired by new Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson, who previously was the offensive coordinator in Detroit, as the quarterbacks coach in Chicago.', 'With how he is moving up the coaching ladder, it feels like only a matter of time before Barrett is the offensive coordinator of a team. In a way, Barrett’s coaching path is similar to that of current Ohio State head coach Ryan Day, who was a quarterback in college and would eventually move on to be a quarterbacks coach in the NFL before being hired by Meyer as co-offensive coordinator at Ohio State.', 'Just imagine the type of pitches Barrett could make when recruiting some of the top offensive talent in the country as Ohio State’s offensive coordinator. Along with being a national champion, Barrett holds a bunch of school records for his production on the field during his time as a Buckeye. Hartline and Laurinaitis have been crushing it recruiting since returning to Ohio State, so there isn’t any reason Barrett shouldn’t be able to do the same.', 'While Barrett returning to Ohio State to be the offensive coordinator isn’t something that is going to happen this year, it feels like something that would be a home run in about five years. Who knows, by that time maybe Ryan Day is near the end of his Ohio State coaching career, so there could be a path of succession that could even see Barrett take over. It just makes too much sense!', 'The easy answer here would obviously be Eddie George, who is currently the head coach at FCS Tennessee State. The former Ohio State unanimous All-American and Heisman Trophy winner has gotten off to a great early start in his coaching career, leading the Tigers to a 9-4 record in 2024 and being named Big South–OVC Coach of the Year. Like Chip Kelly, George’s knowledge of running the football alongside Ryan Day’s passing concepts could create a dynamic offense for the Buckeyes.', 'However, since Brett already went with Barrett on the offensive side of the ball, I have decided to shift my focus to defensive coordinator. As such, my pick isn’t exactly someone who could come in and take over the reins of the Silver Bullets just yet, but I think could be a star in the making after spending a few years as a graduate assistant: John Simon.', 'Simon played at Ohio State from 2009-12, and was a two-time First Team All-Big Ten honoree as well as the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year in 2012. The Youngstown, Ohio native was incredibly dominant in that senior campaign, posting 15 tackles for loss to go along with a team-high nine sacks over 11 games played. He was selected in the fourth round by the Baltimore Ravens in 2013, playing nine seasons in the NFL and winning a Super Bowl with the New England Patriots.', 'With 154 total tackles and 20.5 sacks under his belt during his time as a Buckeye, Simon knows a thing or two about helping lead a defense. The former defensive star has also returned to Columbus in the past to train with the new wave of Ohio State players during his time in the NFL.', '“Once OTAs and everything starts I won’t be there for a couple months, but in the offseason I live in Columbus so I’ll be there seven days a week, going in the morning to train with a lot of the former players and we try to get our work done.” Simon told Eleven Warriors back in 2015. “I see a lot of the coaches and stuff on a daily basis in the offseason.”', 'It is unclear what Simon is up to now, having last played in the NFL back in 2022, or if he has any interest in getting involved in the coaching world. However, getting an Ohio guy in the room who has experience winning at both the collegiate and the professional level is always a good thing. He won’t jump into a defensive coordinator position at a big time program like Ohio State right off the bat, but it would be cool to see him work his way up the ranks much like Brian Hartline and James Laurinaitis have done.', 'Ryan Day has a lot of calls to make this offseason, but I’d love to get Simon involved as a GA in the near future and see where it goes.', '', 'Gambling Problem?

That includes a four-star quarterback commit to Oregon, who USC is now attempting to flip. Jonas Williams showed up as a visitor during the Feb. 1 event that hosted multiple ’26 and 2027 prospects. The Trojans are now using the visit to coax Williams to decommit and turn to USC instead, recruiting insider Steve Wiltfong of On3.com reported Monday. Williams verbally committed to the Ducks on Aug. 3, 2024 out of Lincoln-Way East High in New Lenox, Ill. Williams’ father John, however, unveiled they’re keeping their recruiting options open in their conversation with Wiltfong. “Just keeping our eyes open,” John Williams said. “In recruiting, it’s an evolution so to speak. It’s time to explore and see what destination and what university is truly best for him.” The father of the talented dual-threat passer added that USC “was nice,” and an “impressive university.” The Trojans are facing competition from one university led by a former USC head coach. Ole Miss and Lane Kiffin offered Williams on Sunday. Flipping Williams, though, becomes a massive recruiting coup for the Trojans. Head coach Lincoln Riley and company will end up pulling off a second consecutive flip if it happens. Riley and USC helped convince Husan Longstreet of Centennial High in Corona, Ca. to leave Texas A M for the Trojans. Longstreet then became a five-star signing at QB for USC’s 2025 class. Williams is the top prospect for the state of Illinois' 2026 class per 247Sports."", ""New reports coming from NHL insider Frank Seravalli reveal that many Vancouver Canucks players are not happy at all that J.T Miller was traded away from the team. Daily Faceoff insider Frank Seravalli spoke on SN960 radio show recently about Friday's blockbuster trade sending J.T. Miller to the Rangers. The Canucks traded Miller, defenseman Erik Brannstrom and Jackson Dorrington's player rights for Filip Chytil, defenseman Victor Mancini and a 2025 first-round selection (protected for a top-13 selection). The move, Seravalli insisted, was one that Vancouver simply could not avoid, even with a three-game winning streak in tow. Two weeks ago, a similar arrangement had been in motion but collapsed over complications in negotiations with the Rangers, Seravalli disclosed. Although Chytil is the headliner in terms of return, Seravalli advised patience with regard to projecting an impact for him. Most importantly, he insisted, is that the biggest ripple impact will fall to Elias Pettersson, who must shoulder the full brunt of being the undeniably top center for the team. Elliotte Friedman also revealed the latest update on the team's plans for him. Seravalli says many Canucks players felt the wrong guy was traded Aside from its on-ice implications, Seravalli added, many Canucks skaters have been grumbling about the move, feeling it wasn't one that the team necessarily required or wanted. With Miller, a vocal presence and key player, gone, the tension in the room has developed in the form of frustration with management for not getting a different type of move accomplished, Seravalli added. Former NHL player Ryan Whitney also chimed in, saying if he were a Canucks fan right now, he would be absolutely furious that Miller was traded, adding that the wrong guy was moved out ... perhaps hinting Pettersson should have been gone? Now, with cap room cleared, Seravalli predicted additional activity out of Vancouver's brass. Next, eyes will be focused on how management reshapes the roster, and, most particularly, Pettersson's acceptance of increased responsibility."", 'It was reported back in the middle of January that the New York Mets\' re-signing of outfielder Jesse Winker showed the club was pivoting away from possibly retaining All-Star first baseman Pete Alonso. However, the situation took a turn when Mets owner Steve Cohen resumed conversations with Alonso’s camp last week amid rumors suggesting the Toronto Blue Jays were engaged in serious talks with the ""Polar Bear."" On Monday, MLB insider Andy Martino of SNY explained why it still makes plenty of sense for the Mets and Alonso to reunite before spring training games get underway later this month. ""On Jan. 16, I was one of several reporters who heard and relayed that the Mets expected Pete Alonso to sign elsewhere,"" Martino noted. ""According to league sources, the organization reached that conclusion because Alonso turned down their offer of a three-year contract that contained opt-outs and included deferred money that would have elevated the total to well over $70M. If he said no to that, the Mets thought, he must have a better deal elsewhere. But now it is February, and Alonso is still a free agent."" It\'s unknown exactly how much money Alonso expected to receive months ago, but it\'s also no secret his free-agency journey hasn\'t gone as he hoped. Martino directly said Monday that Alonso is now ""without a publicly known suitor"" after he and the Blue Jays failed to come to an agreement to his liking. Meanwhile, the Mets\' re-signing of reliever Ryne Stanek followed by their signing of utility infielder Nick Madrigal to an inexpensive deal seemingly left available space on the club\'s payroll for a proven commodity such as Alonso. Martino mentioned that Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns ""always preferred to have Alonso"" on the roster for at least the 2025 season, in part so the slugger can serve as lineup protection for All-Star outfielder and offseason acquisition Juan Soto. Meanwhile, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reported last week that ""it feels like Alonso desperately hopes to return"" to Queens. Bob Nightengale of USA Today later repeated that take and said that it\'s ""almost inevitable that a resolution will be reached"" between Alonso and the Mets. ""It’s hard to see anything that would prevent a warm reunion,"" Martino added about the Mets welcoming Alonso back after Cohen said that the negotiation process has been ""an exhausting"" one. At this point, both the Mets and Alonso probably need each other coming off the club\'s trip to the 2024 National League Championship Series.', ""The Boston Bruins captain Brad Marchand was linked to a top Canadian contending team ahead of the trade deadline. In the very competitive Atlantic Division, the Boston Bruins have fallen to the sixth spot, officially out of playoff contention, following a rocky season. Months have passed since Jim Montgomery was replaced as head coach by Joe Sacco, but results are yet to turn around for Brad Marchand's team. Multiple reports were released in the past months revealing that the Bruins could end up being sellers at the upcoming trade deadline. If that ends up being the case, many players who've been on the team for a long time could end up on the trade block, including the team captain Brad Marchand. Elliotte Friedman talked about that possibility in a recent 32 Thoughts podcast episode: 'I think that [trading Marchand] only becomes a thing this year if Boston kind of falls out of the race. Right now, they're out of the playoffs. Their math isn't great, either. They played more games than anybody else in the race. Now, there's still lots of time... But if Boston takes on water, I'm really going to be curious to see where this goes. There was a time in this year where I didn't think there was a chance that Marchand was going to be out, and now I think it's not as certain, depending on what happens here.' An anonymous league executive even confided in The Athletic's Fluto Shinzawa that it could happen if management believes it'll help the team: 'If they think it'll help the team, all bets are off.' In another report, we learned that if the Bruins decide to trade Marchand, it could be to the Edmonton Oilers. Here's what Allan Mitchell wrote: 'Discussing Marchand's exit from Boston is a difficult subject and there's every chance he plays the balance of his career with the Bruins. Even if Marchand agreed to a trade, his destination may well be a city other than Edmonton. Driving the unlikely scenario is the idea of having a rugged, tenacious outscorer with a range of skills playing on one of the Oilers' top two lines. If he does become available, Bowman and Edmonton should be aggressive in pursuing Marchand.' The Bruins will be an interesting team to follow ahead of the deadline.

But when you look back at his history… they've had really good defenses here. They've been through some different coordinators, but they have always had good defense.”"", 'Knowles is one of three assistants who have left Ohio State since winning the national title.

Raiders Hire Chip Kelly As OC,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2025/02/raiders-hire-chip-kelly-as-oc,"['10:01pm: Kelly is leaving Columbus for a historic coordinator sum. As the team told candidates it was prepared to make a “serious” cash infusion with help from its new ownership pieces, SI.com’s Albert Breer reports Kelly will become the NFL’s highest-paid coordinator — on a salary of $6MM per year. This price triples what Kelly was earning at Ohio State, The Athletic’s Dane Brugler adds.', 'An AAV higher than $5MM has not previously been mentioned for coordinators, as the Buccaneers were prepared to venture toward the $4.5MM-per-year number to retain Liam Coen. Kelly has been out of the NFL for the past eight seasons; his return will bring a stunning salary.', '4:36pm: The Raiders are continuing to add to new head coach Pete Carroll‘s staff, hiring longtime college and NFL coach Chip Kelly to be their next offensive coordinator, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter.', 'Kelly recently won a national championship as Ohio State’s offensive coordinator after a six-year stint as UCLA’s head coach. His last NFL job was as head coach for the 49ers in 2016, though he lasted just one season after a 2-14 finish. Before that, he spent three years as the Eagles’ head coach.', 'Carroll seems to be prioritizing experience for his new staff. He already retained defensive coordinator Patrick Graham and is now adding the 61-year-old Kelly, who is entering his 35th season as a coach between the NFL and college levels. Kelly also was closely tied to the Raiders last year, when he interviewed twice to be Antonio Pierce‘s OC. Luke Getsy wound up with the job Kliff Kingsbury declined, but a Tom Brady-led housecleaning brought Kelly back into the Vegas mix.', 'The two veteran coaches have spent time as rivals, both in the Pac-12 and the NFC West. Kelly’s time at Oregon overlapped with Carroll’s tenure as USC’s head coach, and the two also coached against each other in 2016 when Carroll was the Seahawks’ head coach. The 49ers lost both games to the Seahawks in 2016, but Kelly’s Oregon squad upset Carroll’s No. 5 USC in 2009.', 'Kelly will have his work cut out for him in Las Vegas. The Raiders finished 27th in points and 29th in yards last season, due in no small part to an unstable quarterback situation and the midseason departure of Davante Adams. 2024 first-round pick Brock Bowers quickly established himself as one of the league’s best tight ends, but the rest of the Raiders offense lacks high-end talent.', 'Kelly’s first order of business will be finding a new quarterback. Gardner Minshew is still under contract for the 2025 season, but will be coming off a season-ending broken collarbone suffered in October. Even when healthy, though, Minshew struggled, making it clear that he is not the future of the franchise. With the second-most cap space in the NFL as well as the sixth overall pick in April’s draft, Las Vegas has the resources to substantially improve their quarterback situation this offseason.', 'Prior to this Kelly hire, it was looking like a Carroll-Darrell Bevell reunion was close. The Raiders had interviewed Carroll’s former Seahawks OC, and after an initial offering suggesting the veteran assistant was the lead candidate to end up as Las Vegas’ play-caller, a Saturday report did not disrupt that. Despite Kelly only being linked to the Jaguars and Texans in this year’s cycle, he will have a big opportunity to help Carroll’s Raiders stabilization effort take shape. Bevell remains on the Dolphins’ staff as quarterbacks coach.', 'Although Kelly flamed out in Philadelphia after an eventful 2015 in which Jeffrey Lurie gave him personnel power by demoting GM Howie Roseman, he posted two winning seasons with the team prior to that seminal setback. The Eagles won the NFC East in 2013, and they went 10-6 in 2014, doing so despite a season-ending Nick Foles injury. Kelly went 6-9 before being fired after Week 16 during the 2015 season. His immediate 49ers hire continued the NFC West franchise’s mid-2010s descent, and Kelly ended up at UCLA two years later.', 'OC interest formed for Kelly last year, but he opted to leave a head coaching post — as the NIL and transfer portal components have wreaked havoc on the college game — for a coordinator gig in Columbus. That turned out to pay dividends, as Ohio State stormed back from a Michigan loss to close the regular season en route to a national title.', 'Kelly’s move to the NFL from the Buckeyes will also stir speculation about the Raiders’ draft plans. Kelly may want to target some of his former players, especially on the offensive side of the ball. That list could include projected first-rounders offensive tackle Josh Simmons and wide receiver Emeka Egbuka, as well as quarterback Will Howard and running backs TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins on Day 2. Kelly will have significantly more information and familiarity – along with a proven track record of success – with those players than any other NFL team.', 'With Kelly hired, the Raiders can now fill out the rest of their offensive staff. He may want to bring some assistants with him from Ohio State, though some of the current coaches in Las Vegas could be retained as well.', 'Sam Robinson contributed to this post.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

It’s a development that’s only shocking in the sense that it’s a shock to Ohio State’s system – Day anticipated such events the day after the Buckeyes won the national title.', ""“I just think there should be great opportunity for all these guys,” Day said of his coaching staff on Jan. 21. “We'll work hard to make sure that they have an opportunity here at Ohio State, but if they have opportunities to go other places and do other things, then that's part of the reward of winning a championship.”"", ""Day’s hiring abilities will be tested this offseason as he replaces both of those coaches and offensive line coach Justin Frye, who took a job as the Arizona Cardinals’ offensive line coach. It’s not Day's first rodeo in what will be his seventh season as Ohio State’s head man. But it will be the first time he makes such critical decisions after a national title."", 'There’s a comfort and a caution that comes with sitting upon a lonely throne. The comfort is the warmth of the gold-plated CFP national title trophy that will sit forever in the WHAC and the banner that will hang forever in the Horseshoe. At a place with less patience than a hungry toddler, such an afterglow could make the viewing public more willing to wait for things to click again in Columbus.', 'No doubt Day will be urgent in getting his team ready to compete for a national championship again in 2025, even as just three starters return from his 2024 defense and four from his original offensive starting lineup prior to the team’s injury-related shuffles on the offensive line. But the pressures of job security and unachieved ambitions – at least outside the Michigan game – is lifted from the program.', ""That’s the comfort a national title provides, the maneuverability to bring in new coordinators with a slew of new faces in key roles and have the patience for everyone to coalesce, especially as a really good Texas team rides into Columbus with revenge on its mind to open the season. One spring and summer after a two-loss Ohio State squad took home a national title, a loss in that game wouldn't sting as bad, not in the 12-team CFP era.

Alabama OC Steve Sarkisian took Texas’ head coaching job after the Crimson Tide’s title in 2020.', 'Where the caution enters after a national championship run is in being OK with the status quo. Especially as Day has embraced his CEO role and left play calling in the past – a move that clearly worked for Ohio State in 2024 – getting his coordinator hires right is critical.', 'One only has to look at the year following the Buckeyes’ previous national title to see where bad coordinator hires hurt them severely. Offensive coordinator Tom Herman left to become head coach at Houston after Ohio State took the 2014 college football crown. Urban Meyer tried to recreate him in the aggregate (that’s a Moneyball reference) by promoting offensive line coach Ed Warinner to OC and hiring Nebraska’s Tim Beck to be co-OC.', 'Both men were out of Columbus within two seasons. A super-talented 2015 Ohio State squad returning most of the biggest pieces from its title-winning team saw its offense implode in a 17-14 loss to Michigan State at home, costing the team its chances at a repeat.

But it shouldn’t be an internal hire just to maintain said status quo. The appeal of that is understood when Caleb Downs returns on defense and Jeremiah Smith on offense, but Ezekiel Elliott, Michael Thomas, both quarterbacks and more returned for Ohio State’s offense in 2015 and they fell short in the same system as 2014, just run by different people.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Pete Thamel first reported the news on Sunday.', 'Kelly was the offensive coordinator on Ohio State’s national championship team this past season after previously serving as the head coach at Oregon and UCLA as well as the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers.', 'This was the second major personnel decision made by new Raiders coach Pete Carroll. He also retained defensive coordinator Patrick Graham last week.', 'In hiring Kelly, the Raiders will try to spark an offense that was fourth worst this past season with 303.2 yards per game and last in rushing with a 79.8-yard average.', 'Among the priorities will be trying to find a quarterback in an AFC West that includes Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert and Bo Nix — all who took their teams to the playoffs this season. Mahomes is in the Super Bowl for the third consecutive time as Kansas City tries to capture an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy.', 'But the Raiders’ offensive problems are wide-ranging. They failed to adequately replace running back Josh Jacobs, who signed with the Green Bay Packers. The Raiders also lost a game-changer at wide receiver when Davante Adams was traded during the season to the New York Jets.', 'But there are some areas of optimism. Brock Bowers had a historic season for a rookie tight end, Jakobi Meyers put together his first 1,000-yard receiving season and offensive linemen Jackson Powers-Johnson and DJ Glaze proved to be strong building blocks as rookies along with tackle Kolton Miller.', 'Kelly established himself as a creative offensive mastermind as Oregon’s offensive coordinator in 2007 and 2008 and then as the Ducks’ head coach the following four seasons. He went 46-7, appearing in the Bowl Championship Series national championship game in 2010 season and finishing in the top four of the AP poll his last three years.', 'Oregon finished in the top three offensively all three of those final seasons, averaging more than 500 yards per game each time.', 'The Ducks ran a high-tempo offense designed to wear out opposing defenses and limit the ability of opponents to substitute players before rules were later established to more level the playing field.', 'Kelly then went to Philadelphia for three seasons, going 10-6 each of his first two seasons. He was fired after going 6-9 in 2015.', 'The 49ers then hired Kelly, who lasted just one season after posting a 2-14 record.', 'RECOMMENDED•OREGONLIVE.COM', 'Oregon women’s basketball locks down No. 16 Michigan State for signature win of seasonJan. 30, 2025, 8:08 p.m.', 'Oregon women’s basketball blown out on the road at Michigan, splitting road tripFeb. 2, 2025, 1:43 p.m.', 'He returned to college football in 2018 at UCLA, but got off to a slow start with losing records in each of his first three seasons. The Bruins went 25-13 over his final three years, though Kelly’s job security was regularly in question.', 'He left after the 2023 season to direct Ohio State’s offense.

In fact, his predecessor, Antonio Pierce, wanted much of the same. But the neophyte head honcho couldn’t install a much-needed identity and was one and done as a full-time lead man.', 'Now, Carroll enters the fray.', 'With him comes a reputation for culture setter and identity instiller. And we saw a resounding slash in that regard when Carroll and the Raiders landed Chip Kelly to lead the offense. The Ohio State Buckeyes offensive coordinator is taking that same position in Las Vegas.', 'Joining Kelly on the offensive side of things is Carroll’s son Brennan Carroll, who will coach the offensive line.', 'Carroll’s intent to run the ball melds perfectly with Kelly’s offensive philosophy. If there’s a play caller that loves to ground and pound as much as Carroll, it’s Kelly.', 'During Kelly’s four-year stint in the NFL — three as the Philadelphia Eagles head coach and play caller, one with the San Francisco 49ers in the same capacities — Kelly’s offenses were in the Top 10 in rushing attempts and yards gained in all but one year — 2015 in Philadelphia. His highest ranking was his first year as Eagles boss in 2013 (fourth in attempts, first in yards, and second in touchdowns).', 'Most recently, Kelly orchestrated Ohio State’s offense that finished 18th in the nation in rushing yards (2,662).', 'RELATED', 'Before that, he was UCLA’s head coach and chief play caller from 2018 to 2023. His highwater mark was leading the Bruins to the sixth ranking in the nation with 3,097 rushing yards in 2022.', 'Kelly’s arrival in Las Vegas comes at an opportune time as he and Brennan Carroll take charge of a Raiders team that finished dead last (32nd) in rushing yards (1,357) and 30th in rushing attempts (380).', 'The well-compensated Kelly is going to roll up his sleeves and get to work installing his philosophy and scheme this offseason. And fortunately for Kelly, there’s nowhere to go but up. The Raiders finished 29th in points scored (309) and 27th in yards gained (5,154) in a trying 4-13 campaign that resulted in another regime reset.', 'But the key question for Kelly, Pete Carroll, and general manager John Spytek — when it comes to the ground game — do they have the horses to run that kind of race?', 'The optimist wills say perhaps. The pessimist a resounding hell no.', 'Take a look:', 'Running backs under contract for 2025', 'Of that group, White and McCormick produced 183 rushing yards, respectively. McCormick’s output was more impressive considering he did so on 39 carries and gained 10 first downs. White, meanwhile, trudged along with 65 attempts and a meager four first down carries.', 'Laube was a sixth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft but couldn’t shake fumble-itis and registered exactly one carry for zero yards and coughed up the ball on the lone tote.', 'Collier was a late add that got five carries (for 12 yards) while McAllister is a tailback/receiver hybrid who had two carries for 11 yards.

"Chip Kelly follows Jim Knowles out the door, and Ohio State football will be just fine",https://www.dispatch.com/story/sports/columns/2025/02/03/ohio-state-football-finds-itself-needing-new-coordinators-after-title-chip-kelly-jim-knowles/78178291007/,"[""Ohio State keeps losing by winning. The Buckeyes just lost offensive coordinator Chip Kelly to the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders a week after losing defensive coordinator Jim Knowles to Penn State. Winning a national title opens the door to such departures, as assistant coaches are at their most marketable."", 'Both Kelly and Knowles are easily replaceable; dozens of qualified coaches will want those jobs, and OSU’s level of talent makes it hard to fail as a coordinator or position coach. But of the two, Knowles is the bigger loss. Kelly had a positive impact in his only season at Ohio State, especially during the four-game playoff when the offense finally cut loose, but he also must be held accountable for the horrendous coaching job against Michigan. ', 'Ryan Day took most of the heat for that 13-10 debacle, but Kelly was a co-conspirator. Between the two, the offense bogged down because the play-calling played into the hands of Michigan’s defense. Rather than use the full arsenal of offensive talent geared toward a lethal passing attack, Kelly called a run-centric game that went nowhere.', 'Otherwise, most of the offensive statistics improved from 2023, when Day called the plays, mainly because OSU opened things up during the playoff. In 2023, the Buckeyes averaged 30.5 points, 138.8 yards rushing (4.2 per attempt) and 269.1 yards passing. This season, OSU averaged 35.7 points, 166.4 yards rushing (5.0 per attempt) and 263 yards passing.', 'The run game improved under Kelly, largely because quarterback Will Howard was more proficient with his legs than his predecessor, Kyle McCord. Howard averaged 14 yards a game on the ground, while McCord was minus-5. The two-back system of TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins kept both players fresher into the playoff, but their cumulative rushing yardage of 129.75 was not substantially better than the 123.7 combined yards gained by Henderson and Chip Trayanum in 2023.', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'Again, the playoff made the difference. Ohio State averaged 36.3 points, 158 yards rushing and 288 passing in the four games against Tennessee, Oregon, Texas and Notre Dame, impressive numbers considering those were above-average defenses. ', 'So Kelly came through during the playoff, but don’t forget the uptick might not have happened if the players had not called a heated team meeting three days after the Michigan loss that held both players and coaches accountable for the Michigan mess. Day, the only coach to attend the meeting, got the message, and passed it to Kelly: Time to let the play-calling rock ’n roll, not roll over dead like it did against Michigan.', 'So I ask, who deserves more credit for the offensive turnaround? Kelly or the players? Certainly, the coaching adjustment should be credited to Kelly and Day, who were willing to adapt, but does that even happen without the player “uprising?” ', 'Why did Kelly leave? Like with Knowles, money was a big factor. Kelly reportedly will get $6 million as offensive coordinator of the Raiders, working under new coach Pete Carroll. The pay raise triples what Kelly made at Ohio State. But money was not the only reason Kelly departed for the pros. The 61-year-old had his eye on an NFL assistant coaching job in the weeks before he joined the Buckeyes last February, reportedly seeking employment with the Seattle Seahawks before leaving his head coaching job at UCLA for Columbus. ', 'Unlike Knowles, Kelly is not headed to one of Ohio State’s competitors. Knowles leaving for Penn State is a lateral move at best, and smacks of something more than him wanting to move closer to his boyhood home of Philadelphia. Whatever the reason, whether the bump in salary, from something approaching $2.75 million at OSU to $3.1 million at PSU, or looking for a new challenge, or miffed by Day calling out the defense after the Oct. 12 loss to Oregon, Knowles wanted out of Columbus as much as he wanted into State College. ', 'Kelly’s situation is similar, i.e. more money, but less controversial. Day said on FOX college football analyst Joel Klatt’s podcast that he and Kelly talked about the future months before the Buckeyes won the national championship.', '“We talked about the fact that we had a really good group here and the dream would be to win a national championship and then he decides whether he wants to stay or have an opportunity to go to the NFL,” Day said. “And that’s exactly what happened. To be able to have a beer in a few years and talk about the year we had together is going to be special, because we all started together.”', 'Kelly coached Day at New Hampshire, where Day played quarterback, and they reunited in 2015 when Kelly coached the Philadelphia Eagles and hired Day as his quarterbacks coach. The two moved to the San Francisco 49ers in 2016 before Day joined Ohio State in 2017.', 'Ohio State fans should not begrudge Kelly for leaving for the NFL. He served his purpose with the Buckeyes, both by overseeing the offense effectively and providing a security blanket of trust for Day, who handed over play-calling to his mentor and friend.', 'It may turn out that Kelly leaving after one season is best for the program. From the onset I wondered if the Day-Kelly bond might prove detrimental at some point, either by creating resentment among other staffers (Knowles?) or because the former student would hesitate to overrule or reprimand his mentor. Or, as might have happened against Michigan, the two New Englanders forging ahead with a fateful conservative game plan like friends hell bent on making it work.', 'Ultimately, Kelly came through for the Buckeyes. As did Knowles. Ohio State got its national title. Would the pair have left if OSU failed in its mission to win it all? Only they know for sure. But they were the right coaches at the right time in the right place.', 'roller@dispatch.com', '@rollerCD']"

He was detailed—if not captivating—when asked to talk about actual football."", '""It\'s been great,"" Kelly said about his time in Columbus, having assumed the role of offensive coordinator the previous offseason. ""We have an amazing staff and the guys you work with on a daily basis. I\'ve really enjoyed this last—I don\'t know how many months I\'ve been her— eight, nine months. It\'s been awesome.""', ""As it turns out, Kelly had one foot out the door at this exact moment. While it's hard to know exactly when he agreed to become the offensive coordinator for the Las Vegas Raiders, it would appear that Kelly will do just that next season."", ""And according to Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, he will be paid $6 million dollars to do so."", ""No one can blame Kelly for leaving. Not for the opportunity to return to the NFL or the possibility to boost his already robust salary by nearly 300%. But Kelly's departure is yet another piece of a very complicated puzzle currently blanketing all programs trying to win a national championship in these strange times."", 'Win now, or else. Because the only guarantee is that change is the new constant. And the money will be spent no matter what.', ""Kelly wasn't the only meaningful departure hitting the Buckeyes in the afterglow of one of the greatest moments in program history. Defensive coordinator Jim Knowles didn't even make it to the team's celebration before taking the same position at rival Penn State for a reported $3.1 million per year for the next three years."", ""To put this in the appropriate context, LSU's Blake Baker was the highest paid assistant coach this past season with a total salary of $2.5 million, according to USA Today's assistant salary database. Knowles came in third at $2.2 million."", ""A raise of nearly one million dollars didn't just provide a shakeup in the conference. It was a complete reset of the assistant coaching market. More specifically, it was another instance of money—enormous, Scrooge McDuck piles of money—serving as the difference between being great and being elite."", ""The hope for Penn State is that Knowles will do what he did for Ohio State, and he'll be paid more than an assistant coach in the history of the sport to do just that."", '', 'The departures of Kelly, Knowles and offensive line coach Justin Frye, who has been a catalyst for this team, are just a piece of the puzzle. Ohio State will also say farewell to a litany of critical players—running backs TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins, quarterback Will Howard, wideouts Emeka Egbuka, defensive linemen Jack Sawyer and JT Tuimoloau, offensive lineman Donovan Jackson, cornerback Denzel Burke and others.', 'The best roster in college football cost a reported $20 million to assemble. The coaching staff, which was the most expensive in college football, was equally vital. And the culmination of the time and investment was indeed a national title.', ""Although that's perhaps all that was earned."", ""In a report released by the NCAA, the Buckeyes' athletic department showed a deficit of $37.7 million in 2024."", ""The math behind it is a bit complicated. Ohio State had only six home games in 2024, which certainly didn't help these figures. The year prior, it had eight."", '', 'In general, revenue was $254 million versus $279 million in 2023. Included in this was more than $9 million in severance payments to former staff members.', '""While last year\'s budget impact is not ideal and there were unique circumstances at play, we have a robust expense and revenue plan that has been implemented and have made great progress in this ever-changing landscape of college athletics,"" said Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork in a release. ""We will make sure we operate with a balanced budget moving forward.""', 'Whether the shortfall was a surprise or not, one thing is clear. Winning in college football is more expensive than it has ever been.', 'Was it worth it? That depends on who you ask.', 'Building a team costs money. Building a staff costs more money. Replacing a staff costs money. Keeping your players costs money. Replacing your players costs money.', 'Ohio State was the face of this new era of college football. It showcased how resources could build a team and keep it together. And it delivered in a way that will resonate for generations. It ended in smiles and celebrations.', 'It built a blueprint for others, including Penn State, which has committed incredible resources to keep its talented roster together while elevating its staff in hopes of taking that next, next step.', ""It's fair to question, however, if such a blueprint is sustainable. For all the support and money universities are able to generate, the results that this championship season produced don't exactly inspire a lot of confidence, regardless of the circumstances."", '', 'This model, of course, has been broken for some time. The booming salaries of coaches and the landscape of NIL have only elevated the stakes. Now schools will be allowed to directly pay players this year rather than go through a collective.', ""This change is a dramatic one. It's also likely to be a sizable part of all major college football programs moving forward. Like most everything else, the schools that directly allocate the most money will likely fare far better in recruiting. And for all the changes blanketing college football, the programs with the best players will still beat the others more times than not."", 'At a time when expenses are at an all-time high, this is yet another disruption. And to truly compete for a national title, it will demand everything and more.', ""The Ohio States of the world won't suddenly go broke, but something has gotta give. Although television money and new revenue streams have provided these schools with more ways to make money, the cost to be elite and stay elite have outpaced the influx of cash."", 'So, is it worth it?', 'Is the chase for a national championship worth the many millions it will require?', ""Ask an Ohio State fan, and they'll tell you emphatically yes. They'll thank Kelly for his services as offensive coordinator and wish him well in the NFL. They'll respond to your critical remarks about their budget with a story they'll tell their grandkids one day."", 'The celebration has only just begun. Let them be. As for the team, the chase to rebuild a roster and staff with many millions of dollars is underway.', ""Ask a Penn State fan, and they'll tell you the same. Only they'll do so without the euphoria in hand."", ""They'll tell you that it's been nearly 40 years since they've seen a team win a national championship, and they would do whatever it takes to fill that void. They'll tell you that Ohio State spent more and others in their situation, and there are plenty, are doing the exact same."", ""They would tell you that it's only money, and they would be right about that, too.
