Before the final bracket was set, the Lynx were at +1000 odds and have come down to +800.', '', '', 'Pickman: New York Liberty — The Liberty enter the postseason playing far from their best basketball. However, New York has been the league’s best team in the regular season overall, is abundantly talented, has home-court advantage throughout the playoffs and worked all season to overcome last year’s WNBA Finals scars. It’s not easy to flip a switch come playoffs, but New York knows it has to elevate its level and has the talent to do so.', 'Merchant: Minnesota Lynx — Assuming the Lynx can get past the Sun, they’ve matched up well against the Liberty and Aces all season.', '', '', 'We have another tier of three at the top of the odds for Finals MVP: A’ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart are seen as most likely to make it to the Finals with their team and then absolutely show out.', 'Wilson is having an all-time great season, never seen before in this league (or officially in the NBA): most points (1,021), most rebounds (451) and most blocked shots (98) in a season.

If you want more of a value play, however, look to Jonquel Jones at +1200 odds. Jones, who herself is a former league MVP, was New York’s most consistent and dominant player during last year’s playoffs and could be again during this year’s run.', 'Merchant: Kayla McBride — The best player on the winning team doesn’t always snag this award (see: 2021 and 2022), and it’s easy to imagine McBride having a couple of big shooting nights that propel Minnesota.', 'Pickman’s pick: New York in two — Throw out the regular season finale loss against the Dream. It would be a monumental upset if New York lost in the first round.', 'Merchant’s pick: New York in two.', 'Pickman: Minnesota in two — The Lynx have been the WNBA’s best team since the All-Star break, dropping just one game since play resumed.

The Sun won the season series over Indiana 3-1, but all three of their wins came within the first five weeks of the season when Indiana was still figuring itself out. What pace the series is played at will go a long way in determining the winner of this matchup. Indiana could be the first lower seed to upset a higher seed in the new format, but it’s also hard to bet against the Sun’s playoff experience.', '', 'Merchant: Connecticut in two.

The stars will be out in full force in what has the potential to be a historic month."", ""Ahead of the playoffs, The Sporting News' WNBA experts share their predictions for how the next few weeks will play out."", ""MORE: Is Diana Taurasi retiring? Mercury continue to hint at WNBA legend's last game"", 'Steph Noh: There’s really only one choice here. The Fever have been way better than an average No. 6 seed, going 10-4 after the All-Star break. They already beat the Sun three weeks ago, and Caitlin Clark has been playing out of her mind during this stretch.', ""David Suggs: It's gotta be the Fever. Clark and Kelsey Mitchell are as frightening a backcourt as there is in the W, while Aliyah Boston has come into her own in the past few months. Expect a competitive series between the two Eastern Conference standouts."", ""Kyle Irving: The Fever. They're going to be a common answer, but the praise is earned."", 'Indiana looks like a different team coming out of the Olympic break and Clark is the head of the snake. She averaged 24.3 points, 8.9 assists, 5.5 rebounds, and 1.1 steals per game in that span, solidifying her place as one of the best players in the WNBA already. With Mitchell and Boston also playing the best basketball of their careers, the Fever will be a tough out.', ""SN's WNBA HQ: Live WNBA scores | Full WNBA schedule"", ""Steph Noh: While the Fever have a chance to pull off the upset, don't discount this Sun team. They have the No. 1 defense in the league, and Alyssa Thomas has led them deep in the playoffs for five consecutive years, including two finals appearances. I don’t feel great about it, but I’m picking the Sun in that first-round series."", ""David Suggs: Clark could very well lead Indiana past Connecticut in Round 1. I just don't see it at the moment."", ""The Fever have been as good as anyone since returning from the Olympic break, with Clark, Mitchell, and Boston showcasing a level of consistency that eluded them during the first half of the season. Nevertheless, experience is king in the postseason. Alyssa Thomas, DeWanna Bonner, and the Sun have that in abundance. Couple that with an Indiana defense that can look porous at times and it's hard to pick against Connecticut. At least at the moment."", 'Kyle Irving: Even if the Fever are the ""most likely"" to pull off a first-round upset, I don\'t think the Sun will let it happen.', 'Connecticut is an experienced team that has not been stopped short of the semifinals since 2018 and made two WNBA Finals runs in that span.

The Lynx center plays hard, hits big 3s and is in contention for Most Improved Player for the second straight season. She’s been a great developmental story for one of the league’s best teams.', ""David Suggs: Leonie Fiebich. The Liberty wing has impressed off the bench in her maiden WNBA season, sinking 42.9 percent of her 3-point attempts this year. At 6-4, Fiebich has center-like height, but it's at the perimeter where she can wreak the most havoc. New York has two of the W's best playmakers in Sabrina Ionescu and Courtney Vandersloot. Expect both of them to get Fiebich involved time and time again."", ""Kyle Irving: DiJonai Carrington. No player has disrupted Clark more than Carrington and she'll be in the spotlight as the star rookie's primary defender in the first round. Carrington stepped into a full-time starting role after finishing runner-up for Sixth Woman of the Year last season and has been one of the best perimeter defenders in the W. She's also averaging a career-high 12.7 points per game to round out her skillset."", ""MORE: A'ja Wilson breaks WNBA single-season scoring record"", 'Steph Noh: The Liberty. They were ousted in four games in last year’s finals. This team is better, and the Aces are worse. Las Vegas had six of its players participate in the Olympics, and that fatigue is going to make their path much harder this season.', ""David Suggs: The Lynx. Minnesota has bested Las Vegas in three of its four matchups this season. Cheryl Reeve's side has the best defense in the West and more depth than the Aces. Wilson is the best player in the world, but Collier isn't too far behind, having put forth a season that will likely result in a top-three finish in MVP voting."", ""Kyle Irving: The Liberty. Everyone expected to see a WNBA Finals rematch between New York and Las Vegas. Instead, we might see the matchup unfold in the second round. That could be bad news for the Liberty's best regular season in franchise history, but it could also spell the end of the Aces' three-peat hopes."", 'Steph Noh: The Liberty. They have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs, they have the talent and they have the playoff experience. Jonquel Jones and Ionescu have grown as passers, Stewart continues to be a two-way force and Sandy Brondello is looking like one of the top coaches in the league.', ""David Suggs: The Lynx. Reeve's side might not have the star power that the Aces and Liberty have. It's a damn good roster, though, spearheaded by Collier and Kayla McBride. Courtney Williams, Bridget Carleton and Alanna Smith are as good a supporting cast as there is in the W, while Myisha Hines-Allen — acquired at the trade deadline from Washington — has offered the Lynx a bruising presence in the paint."", 'Minnesota has been efficient and effective through 40 regular season games. A similar showing in the postseason could bring a championship to the Great Lakes.', ""Kyle Irving: I'm still riding with the Aces. Even with a bumpy road in the regular season, the back-to-back reigning champions will know it's time to flip the switch.

But the Liberty took one step toward their ultimate prize on Tuesday night, defeating the Washington Mystics on the road, thereby clinching the WNBA’s best record and home-court advantage throughout the postseason.', '“It was important for us as one of our goals,” said Sandy Brondello. “We set out trying to get that home-court advantage. Now, obviously, we still have to take care of our business in the playoffs, the first round, the second round. We know it’s going to be extremely hard, but getting home court, we have a great arena, we have great fans. We want to play in front of our fans as much as we can.”', 'New York could have clinched on Sunday afternoon, but suffered a doozy of a loss to the Minnesota Lynx, who thoroughly outplayed the hosts. In addition to the #1 seed dangling in front of them, Brondello called that performance another “big motivator” for the Liberty heading into Washington. The carrot and the stick.', 'There was also the possibility of a restful Thursday in the regular season’s final game, should the Liberty handle business on Tuesday. Whatever it was, New York’s starters came out plenty motivated, winning the first quarter 29-18. Though the 3-point shot for Brondello’s team never fully emerged, it didn’t need to. By way of transition opportunities, offensive rebounds, and plain old offensive execution...', '...New York outscored Washington 18-0 in the paint through ten minutes.

Ionescu once again struggled from the field, but shot a quiet 2-of-8 rather than the 4-of-21 she shot on Sunday, and dropped seven assists. Before Jones battled foul trouble in the second half, she frequently ran in transition and sealed for deep post position, a viable offensive threat once again...', 'The Mystics have been resilient all season though, 13-12 since their 0-12 start, and that quality reared its head again. Ariel Atkins would lead all scorers with 22 points, continuing her personal tradition of killing New York, as Washington cut the margin to seven points early in the third quarter.', 'Alas, that was all she wrote. The Liberty ripped off a 19-4 run, finally hitting some threes and continuing to capitalize on Washington’s sloppy play, flipping turnovers into beautiful transition sequences...', 'It was the Germans’ turn to shine, as Leonie Fiebich and Nyara Sabally joined three other Libs in double-figures.

The franchise found itself 3-10 to open the season, but caught fire after the Olympic break to claw its way back to .500 and secure a spot in the postseason.', '“Just really proud of their growth, their resiliency,” Fever head coach Christie Sides said after the game. “They went to work, they got better. We didn’t have the time early, but they just kept getting better as the season progressed.', '“They deserve the opportunity to play in these playoffs.”', 'The Mystics came into the game as the ninth seed, knowing that they would have to win to give themselves a chance of making the postseason.

Those best-of-three series, in which the lower seed can force a deciding Game 3 at home, will either produce extreme drama or be over before we can blink. From there, we move to a pair of best-of-five semifinal series and another best-of-five showdown in the Finals. ', ""The bracket is set, the schedule is out and teams know the path they have to take to lift the trophy. Which of them has the best chance to do so? Before the action gets underway, here are CBS Sports' final power rankings of the season, the annual pre-playoffs edition. "", ""The Liberty sort of stumbled to the finish line by losing two of their last three games, but that shouldn't overshadow their body of work this summer. They have been the best team in the league all season long, and finished with the best offensive rating (107.0), third-best defensive rating (95.3) and best net rating (plus-11.7). They boast an All-Star starting five led by one of the two best players in the world in Breanna Stewart and have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. They are the team to beat. "", 'What a season for the Lynx, who won the Commissioner\'s Cup championship and went 14-2 after the Olympics to grab the No. 2 seed in the playoffs. They may not have the star power of some other contenders, but as Coach of the Year frontrunner Cheryl Reeve put it earlier this month, the players ""believe in each other and they believe in our collective."" The Lynx finished second in defense (94.8 defensive rating) and led the league in 3-point shooting (38.0%). Plus, the Liberty and Aces are both on the other side of the bracket, which is a boost for their chances to get to the Finals. ', ""For much of the season, the Aces were in disarray. Candace Parker retired, Chelsea Gray missed the first month and struggled to find a rhythm upon her return and head coach Becky Hammon repeatedly called out their lack of effort on the defensive end. While some of their warts cannot be totally ignored, they certainly look like a contender heading into the playoffs. They won nine of their last 10 to close the season, have the best player in the world in A'ja Wilson and know what it takes to win it all. The quest for a threepeat is back on in earnest. "", 'The Sun started the season 13-1, but went just 15-11 the rest of the way. They were also 4-9 against their fellow top-five teams and 24-3 against everyone else. An offseason trade to acquire Marina Mabrey did not juice their offense as much as they may have hoped, and they took fewer 3-pointers than any other playoff team. And yet, no one will want to see them in the playoffs. They are big, they are physical, they are experienced and they had the best defensive rating in the league (94.1). They are, in short, absolute hell to play against, and that will always give them a chance. ', 'The Storm ""won"" the offseason by signing Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith in free agency, but the team never quite meshed in the way they may have hoped. Ironically, that was in large part due to a very poor season by franchise stalwart Jewell Loyd. They finished seventh in the league in offensive rating (102.1) and last in 3-point percentage (28.8), which was the worst full season mark by any team since the 2021 Fever, who won only six games. Much like the Sun, their inability to score on a consistent basis is a major reason they struggled against fellow top-five teams (4-10) despite boasting a strong defense. It\'s hard to write them off given their talent and experience, but they have a tough path that starts with the back-to-back champion Aces. ', 'The Fever are back in the playoffs for the first time since 2016, thanks largely to No. 1 overall pick Caitlin Clark, who put together one of the best rookie seasons of all time. After the Olympic break, they really started to click, and had the best offensive rating in the league (109.6) by a wide margin in that span. Their ability to go on incredible scoring binges is matched only by their inability to stop anyone on the other end. Their 106.5 defensive rating post-Olympics is the worst of any playoff team. ', ""A winter filled with so much promise ultimately gave way to a rather disappointing season. The Mercury showed some flashes of brilliance on the offensive end, but were far too inconsistent and finished ninth in the league in defensive rating (105.4). It also doesn't help that Kahleah Copper may not be 100% heading into the playoffs due to a back injury that forced her to miss games down the stretch. There is a lot of talent on this team, enough to make them dangerous in a short series, but it's hard to see them making any sort of playoff run. "", ""It is a borderline miracle that the Dream are even in the playoffs considering how rocky their season was at times. They lost 15 of 18 heading into the Olympics and then had another stretch where they lost eight of 10 after the break. In fact, they were minutes away from being eliminated a week ago. Now that they're healthy, they aren't as bad as their record might indicate, but they don't have enough offense to make any noise in the playoffs.

Even with those players back in the lineup after the Olympics, they were just .500 in the second half, and it took a win over the Liberty on the final day of the regular season to clinch a playoff spot. But Atlanta will enter its first-round series -- its second consecutive playoff appearance -- on a three-game winning streak, tied for its longest run of the season. One bright spot regardless of the ups and downs: All-time great Tina Charles has been a steadying force in her first season back in the WNBA since 2022, nearly averaging a double-double in her 13th campaign.', ""How they match up: New York dominated this regular-season series until Thursday, when the Dream looked like they were fighting for their playoff lives, while the Liberty looked like they knew they had nothing to gain or lose. Atlanta's defense has been more reliable than its offense this season, but can it really twice slow down a Liberty offense that has been best in the league all summer? On paper, the reigning WNBA Finals runners-up with a plus-11.7 net rating (first in the league) should comfortably handle the team with the minus-3.6 net rating (seventh) that hasn't won a playoff game since 2018. We'll see if Thursday ends up being a preview of a more competitive series than expected."", ""Biggest concern for the higher seed? Dropping two of their last three regular-season games (to the Lynx and Dream) wasn't the most confidence-instilling stretch for the Liberty. Ionescu hasn't been as efficient in the second half of the season, Jones not as dominant. And their defense left a lot to be desired in those losses.

This matchup features two recent No. 1 picks and U.S. Olympians: Ionescu (2020, 5-on-5 Olympian) and Howard (2022, 3x3 Olympian).

They've done it led by lottery picks: back-to-back No. 1's Aliyah Boston (2023) and Clark (2024) and No. 2 Kelsey Mitchell (2018). Clark seems a lock to follow Boston as Rookie of the Year; she leads the WNBA in assists and is in the top 10 in scoring. Clark's connections with Boston in the post and fellow guard Mitchell have steadily grown and made the Fever a fun team to watch when they are clicking on offense."", ""Forward NaLyssa Smith has had big games and can be an important factor on the boards.

For all the heat coach Christie Sides has taken from social media critics, she has kept the Fever's focus on improving."", ""How they match up: Their first matchup -- a 92-71 Sun victory -- was the season-opening game for both teams, as well as Clark's WNBA debut.

Mitchell and Clark have been a dynamic force in the backcourt, especially since the Olympic break."", ""Clark finished the regular season Thursday with 8 points, 8 assists and 5 rebounds in 20 minutes, playing limited time because the game had no impact on the Fever's seed. Mitchell played just 5 minutes, getting 4 points -- she was briefly shaken up and left the game. Sides said afterward Mitchell was fine but she didn't want to take any chances. For the season, both Mitchell and Clark averaged 19.2 points, with Clark adding a league-best 8.4 assists plus 5.7 rebounds."", ""What will most impact the series? Indiana really needs to prove it can defend well when it means the most. The Fever have shown growth in that area, and they do have individual players who are strong defenders.

The Portland team, set to begin play in the 2026 season, will be owned and operated by RAJ Sports, led by Lisa Bhathal Merage and Alex Bhathal. Portland is the third expansion franchise awarded by the WNBA during this round of expansion, following the Golden State Valkyries and a Toronto franchise, bringing the league from 12 to 15 teams.', '“As the WNBA builds on a season of unprecedented growth, bringing a team back to Portland is another important step forward,” said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. “Portland has been an epicenter of the women’s sports movement and is home to a passionate community of basketball fans. Pairing this energy with the Bhathal family’s vision of leading top-flight professional sports teams will ensure that we deliver a premier WNBA team to the greater Portland area.”', 'Lisa Bhathal Merage will serve as controlling owner and WNBA Governor, while Alex Bhathal will serve as Alternate Governor. The Bhathal family (Lisa, Alex and their parents, Marta and Raj) brings more than 50 years of experience in the professional sports industry, including serving as investors of the NBA’s Sacramento Kings and controlling owners of the National Women’s Soccer League’s Portland Thorns. Ms. Merage’s husband, Richard Merage, will also join the buyer group as an investor and Executive Board member of Portland WNBA. Mr. Merage is the Chief Executive Officer of MIG Capital, LLC, an investment management firm he co-founded in 2006 following the sale of his family’s business, Chef America, to Nestle.', '“For decades, Portland has been the global epicenter of sports lifestyle and today, we are now the global epicenter of women’s sports,” said Lisa Bhathal Merage. “We believe in the transformative power of women’s sports and are thrilled that the W will call Portland home. We know that Portland’s vibrant and diverse communities will highly support and rally around this team. Our goal is to grow this organization in partnership with the Portland community and we look forward to supporting the best women’s basketball players in the world when they take the floor at the Moda Center in 2026.”', 'The team will play its home games at the Moda Center in downtown Portland.

Ron Wyden', '“Today puts basketball fans in Portland and all across Oregon in the ‘W” column,” Wyden said. “Our city and entire state have consistently set the gold standard for supporting women’s sports, and I’m thrilled the Bhathal family is expanding its commitment to women’s sports locally by bringing Portland a much-deserved WNBA franchise. I know from hosting Commissioner Engelbert for a roundtable at the Sports Bra in February 2023 with women athletes, women’s sports executives and coaches that enthusiasm for women’s basketball is off the charts. And I can’t wait for this new team to tip off in 2026.”', 'Oregon Governor Tina Kotek', '“Portland has a passion for women’s sports and the teams who play in the Rose City, making us the ideal home of the next WNBA team,” Governor Kotek said. “From the Thorns to the Rose City Rollers to the Sports Bra, Portland embraces a diversity of athletes and fans. This is an exciting new chapter for our city and our state.”', 'Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler', '“We are thrilled to welcome the WNBA to Portland, a city renowned for its vibrant sports culture and deep commitment to fostering women’s athletics,” said Mayor Ted Wheeler. “This expansion marks a significant milestone in our city’s sports history and underscores our role as a burgeoning hub for women’s sports. It’s more than basketball; it’s about energizing our community, enhancing our local economy, and celebrating pride in our city.”', 'RAJ SPORTS', 'RAJ Sports, led by Alex Bhathal and Lisa Bhathal Merage, focuses on investment opportunities in sports and sports-related properties, drawing on the Bhathal family’s multi-generational experience and relationships in the industry. The firm seeks to leverage the power of sports to affect broader social and economic change through a variety of business and philanthropic strategies. Its deep experience in professional sports operations and large-scale real estate developments that create thriving community centers, positions the firm to deliver valuable assets that will support further growth for the players, staff, and fans. In 2013, the Bhathal family became investors in the Sacramento Kings (NBA); subsequently building the platform to include the Sacramento RiverCats (MiLB), Stockton Kings (NBA G-League) and several sports anchored real estate developments. The 2024 acquisitions of Portland Thorns (NWSL) and the WNBA Portland expansion team represents a milestone for the city of Portland and places it at the epicenter of growth for women’s sports.', 'About the WNBA', 'The WNBA is a bold, progressive basketball league that stands for the power of women. Currently in its 28th season in 2024, the W is a unique sports property that combines competition and entertainment with a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and social responsibility. Through its world-class athletes, the in-game fan experience, TV and digital broadcasts, digital and social content, and community and youth outreach programs, the league celebrates and elevates the game of basketball and the culture around it. In 2020, the WNBA and the Women’s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) signed a groundbreaking CBA that has charted a new course for women’s basketball – and women’s sports overall – with a focus on increased player compensation, improvements to the player experience, expanded career development opportunities and resources specifically tailored to the female professional athlete. Key elements of the agreement are supported through the league’s partnership platform, the WNBA Changemakers Collective, with AT&T, the WNBA’s Marquee Partner and inaugural Changemaker, as well as fellow inaugural Changemakers Deloitte and NIKE, Inc., and subsequent additions Google, U.S. Bank and CarMax. During the 2020 season, the WNBA and WNBPA launched the WNBA Justice Movement forming the Social Justice Council with the mission of being a driving force of necessary change and continuing work regarding women’s and maternal health and voting rights, among other important societal issues.', 'Copyright 2024 NBA Media Ventures, LLC.

Darron Cummings/Associated Press', 'Caitlin Clark will make her first appearance in the WNBA playoffs in the arena where she started her professional career.', 'The Indiana Fever will play in Connecticut on Sunday as the league’s postseason gets underway with four best-of-three series. The two-time defending champion Las Vegas Aces will host Seattle, top-seed New York will play Atlanta and Minnesota faces Phoenix.', 'Clark, who had a record-breaking rookie season, will try to lead Indiana to its first playoff win since 2015 when current Sun Coach Stephanie White was in charge of the Fever.', 'This is the third straight postseason the league will use a best-of-three format with the better seeded team hosting the first two games. A decisive third game would be played at the home of the lower-seeded team. Las Vegas aims to become the first team to win three consecutive titles since Houston won the first four WNBA championships.', '', 'Here’s a look at the four series that begin Sunday.', 'No. 1 NEW YORK vs No. 8 ATLANTA', '', 'The Liberty had the best record in the league and fell just two wins short of the franchise’s first championship last year, losing to Las Vegas in four games. The Dream are in the playoffs for the second consecutive season, led by Tina Charles.', 'The team’s chemistry has improved this season, the second with the core group of Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu, Jonquel Jones and Courtney Vandersloot playing together. Stewart has shown once again she’s one of the best players in the league and is a tough matchup. Atlanta is back in the playoffs for the second consecutive year – the first time that’s happened since 2013-14. Charles is a New York native, who played several seasons for the Liberty.', 'Season Series: New York won three of the four games with the lone loss coming in the season finale, when the Liberty had nothing to play for and the Dream were fighting to get into the playoffs.', 'A’ja Wilson leads Las Vegas in its quest to win three straight WNBA titles. Darron Cummings/Associated Press', 'No. 4 LAS VEGAS vs. No. 5 SEATTLE', 'A’ja Wilson has been the best player in the league this year, raising her already impressive play to another level. She became the first player in league history to score over 1,000 points in a season and has been dominant on both ends of the court. The Aces started off slowly this season, while Chelsea Gray was out recovering from a foot injury suffered in the WNBA Finals last year. The team has come on strong lately. They’ve won nine of their last 10 games heading into the playoffs, including a win over Seattle on Tuesday. The Storm added Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith in the offseason to add to their competitive edge.', 'The Aces are peaking at the right time to make a run at another championship, with Wilson, Gray, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young leading the way. Las Vegas added Tiffany Hayes midway through the season and she’s been a solid spark off the bench. Las Vegas knows how to win in the playoffs and will be a tough out. Seattle’s concern is the health of Jewell Loyd, who missed the last three games with a knee injury. Without Loyd, the Storm will be hard-pressed to knock off the champions.', '', 'Season Series: The Aces took three of the four games from the Storm this season.', 'No. 2 MINNESOTA vs. No. 7 PHOENIX', 'The Minnesota Lynx have been the surprise team of the season led by star forward Napheesa Collier. Minnesota took the Commissioner’s Cup title by defeating New York, indicating how good Cheryl Reeve’s team could be. Minnesota is one of the hottest team heading into the playoffs. The Lynx had won 13 of 14 games before losing a meaningless contest to close out the regular season. The Mercury have been on the other end of the spectrum, heading into the playoffs with seven losses in their last 10 games.', 'Diana Taurasi hasn’t said whether she’s going to retire at the end of this season or not, but Phoenix honored the league’s all-time leading scorer on Thursday as if it was the end of her career. The Mercury have the talent to make a run in the playoffs with Taurasi, Brittney Griner, Natasha Cloud and Kahleah Copper leading the way. They may just be hard-pressed to beat the talented Lynx, who have been playing extremely well. Since winning their last title in 2017, Minnesota has won only one playoff series, beating Phoenix in 2020.', 'Season Series: The Lynx won three of the four meetings this season, all by double digits.', 'No. 3 CONNECTICUT vs. No. 6 INDIANA', 'All eyes will be on Clark as she makes her postseason debut. The Fever struggled early in the season with a difficult schedule, but have really come on strong after the Olympic break. They had the first .500 or better season since 2016 – the last time the team made the playoffs finishing at 20-20. Clark, who set the league record for assists and the rookie mark for points, has help from Aliyah Boston and Kelsey Mitchell. Connecticut has been to eight straight postseasons – the longest active streak. Led by Alyssa Thomas and DeWanna Bonner, the Sun look to end Clark’s first year.', 'Major Storylines: Clark has always thrived on the biggest stage and is ready for her playoff debut. For the Fever to succeed, they’ll need other players to step up and help her. Clark averaged 16.3 points and 3.8 rebounds in the four meetings. The Sun are looking to get back to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2022.', 'Season Series: The Sun won three of the four meetings, but the Fever took the last one. The three Connecticut wins all came within the first month of the season.', '', '', '', 'Please sign into your Press Herald account to participate in conversations below.
