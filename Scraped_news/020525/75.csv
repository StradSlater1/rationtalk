The virus, named Camp Hill virus, was detected in shrews in the U.S. state of Alabama, marking the first known presence of this deadly virus family on the continent.', 'Henipaviruses are a genus of viruses known for causing severe and often fatal diseases in both humans and animals. Dr. Rhys Parry from UQ‚Äôs School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences emphasized the importance of this discovery, citing the historical dangers associated with henipaviruses.', '‚ÄúOne of the most dangerous is the Hendra virus, which was first detected in Brisbane, Australia, and has a fatality rate of 70 percent,‚Äù Dr. Parry explained. ‚ÄúAnother example is the Nipah virus, which has recorded fatality rates between 40 and 75 percent in outbreaks in Southeast Asia, including in Malaysia and Bangladesh.‚Äù', 'The discovery of Camp Hill virus suggests that henipaviruses may be more widely distributed across the globe than previously thought. Until now, these viruses were predominantly associated with regions such as Australia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. Finding one in North America raises concerns about its potential impact on human and animal health.', 'The Camp Hill virus was detected in northern short-tailed shrews, a small mammal with a broad distribution across Canada and the U.S. This finding is particularly concerning given that previous henipaviruses, such as the Langya virus in China, have demonstrated the ability to jump from shrews to humans.', '‚ÄúThis indicates that shrew-to-human transmission can occur,‚Äù Dr. Parry said. ‚ÄúHowever, more research is needed to determine whether Camp Hill virus poses a direct threat to people.‚Äù', 'While no human cases have been linked to the virus so far, scientists are closely monitoring the situation and working to assess potential risks.', 'Given the high fatality rates associated with henipaviruses, researchers at UQ are prioritizing the development of vaccines and treatments for this virus family. Dr. Ariel Isaacs, a co-author of the study, stated that understanding the virus‚Äôs structure is crucial to preventing potential outbreaks.', '‚ÄúThe next step for this work is to characterize key surface proteins on the virus that are involved in cell entry,‚Äù Dr. Isaacs said. ‚ÄúBy doing this, we can broaden our understanding of the virus family and identify better ways to protect against it.‚Äù', 'This research was made possible through collaborations with Dr. Naphak Modhiran and Professor Daniel Watterson from UQ, along with Professor Wendy R. Hood‚Äôs lab at Auburn University and the research teams of Professor Vera Gorbunova and Professor Andrei Seluanov at the University of Rochester.', 'As scientists work to learn more about the Camp Hill virus, public health officials are urging vigilance while also emphasizing that there is currently no immediate cause for alarm. Future studies will focus on whether the virus can infect humans and if so, how transmission might occur.', 'The study was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases and marks an important milestone in understanding the global spread of henipaviruses.
