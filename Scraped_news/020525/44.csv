“This Was Not Started by Us”: The ‘It Ends With Us’ Battle Hits the Courtroom,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/justin-baldoni-lawyer-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-court-bryan-freedman-1236125724/,"['', '', 'The first hearing in the high-stakes legal saga was held Monday in court in New York City over how much Baldoni attorney Bryan Freedman can share his case to the press.', '', '', 'U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ordered the attorneys in the legal standoff between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni on Monday to comply with a federal court rule barring lawyers from making statements to the press that could prejudice the case.', 'The court issued the order after Bryan Freedman, the attorney for Justin Baldoni and the studio that produced It Ends With Us, claimed he was facing a potential gag order proposed by Lively’s legal team. However, Michael Gottlieb, representing the actress, said he was not seeking a full gag order but rather a court order to comply with existing rules dictating trial publicity.', '', 'As evidence of the need for the order, Gottlieb pointed to statements Freedman had made in the press accusing Lively of a pattern of bullying and saying that he had the “receipts” that would prove the case in publications including People and on the Megyn Kelly Show. Gottlieb further pointed to a website recently launched by Freedman’s team, which lays out the timeline of the dispute between Lively and Baldoni but features an editorialized narrative, according to Gottlieb.', 'He further added that his team will move to dismiss the addition of that timeline and narrative to the amended complaint filed by Freedman. In turn, Freedman read out statements Gottlieb’s team had made to the press, though Liman cautioned “You went a bit further than that,” even as Freedman said his team had to respond to the initial New York Times article about Lively’s complaint.', '“This was not started by us,” Freedman said.', 'But he also agreed to follow court rules on engaging with press, even before the court order. Liman said he was adopting the rule as an order of the court “with some reluctance,” as he did not want the case to devolve into “satellite litigation” over statements made by the attorneys. If issues persist, he added that he could also move up the date of the trial so as not to prejudice potential jurors, but he was also reluctant to do that given the amount of discovery that needs to be completed before then. “Damage is done before a jury speaks,” Freedman argued.', '“That’s the reason you each have sued,” Liman countered.', 'This was the first court hearing on the lawsuits brought by Lively and Baldoni. The suits have been consolidated into one case, while the litigation between publicists Stephanie Jones and Jennifer Abel remains separate.', '', 'The March 2026 trial date still stands, even as both sides contend with discovery from multiple parties. Freedman recently filed a revised complaint, which added The New York Times as a defendant. Gottlieb said his team was also thinking of amending their own complaint with new parties and claims but didn’t elaborate.', '“I couldn’t be more pleased with how the case was handled today,” Freedman said in a press conference outside the court hearing. “We’re going to move as quickly as possible and prove our innocence.”', 'Monday’s late-morning session in lower Manhattan marked the first court hearing in the dramatic showdown. The hearing was originally scheduled for Feb. 12, but Liman — the brother of veteran Hollywood director Doug Liman — moved up the date after attorneys for Lively and Reynolds repeatedly raised concerns that the Los Angeles-based Freedman is potentially violating attorney conduct by litigating in the press (and tabloids in particular).', 'Baldoni, Lively and Reynolds were never expected to attend; rather, a small army of lawyers representing the various sides turned up.', 'In her lawsuit, which was filed over Christmas, Lively accused her It Ends With Us director and co-star of sexual harassment and launching a smear campaign against her in the wake of the movie’s release as a means of deflection and retaliation. She also named Jamey Heath, Baldoni’s partner at production company Wayfarer Studios, crisis PR exec Melissa Nathan and Wayfarer publicist Jennifer Abel in the suit. The actress-producer is represented by Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher.', '', 'Baldoni responded by filing a $400 million lawsuit against both Lively and Reynolds alleging extortion and defamation. (He also names Lively’s longtime publicist Leslie Sloane and L.A. publicist Stephanie Jones). He and Freedman are also going after The New York Times, which detailed Lively’s allegations in a lengthy expose.', 'The Lively-Baldoni feud has put a spotlight on “astroturfing,” whereby publicists harness the Internet to sway opinion on social media. According to Lively’s suit, the alleged organized attack against has had profound consequences by rendering her depressed, and harming her family and business ventures.', '“Through this complaint, Ms. Lively seeks to set the record straight, to hold the Wayfarer Parties and Associates accountable, and to shine a light on this new form of retaliation so that it will not be used against any others who seek to stand up and speak out against sexual harassment,” stated her lawsuit. “In sum, Mr. Baldoni has crafted a public image of himself as not just an ally, but also a fierce advocate for women. Contrary to this image, as set forth in detail above, Mr. Baldoni has spent the last several months and significant resources on his goal of wanting to ‘bury’ and ‘destroy’ Ms. Lively for raising concerns about his and his CEO’s harassing behavior and other disturbing conduct.”', 'Baldoni’s side has insisted that the social media attack against Lively in favor of Baldoni is organic, and that they did not engineer it.', '', 'The outspoken Freedman has repeatedly said his client is the true victim, and that It Ends With Us was wrested away from him by Lively in the post-production process because of the power she and Reynolds enjoy.', 'Instead of directly addressing Lively’s complaint regarding Baldoni’s behavior on the set of the film, Freedman has instead leaked texts, voice memos and video to the press to dispute her version of events as laid out in her suit, which alleges other women also felt uncomfortable.', 'In asking the court to intervene regarding Freedman, Lively’s lawyers argued prior to the hearing that his various leaks and comments are likely designed to obscure that Ms. Lively is in possession of numerous additional communications relating to her claims.', '“If Mr. Freedman’s conduct is permitted, it will only result in an arms race of selective public disclosures of text messages to the media — that is neither encouraged — nor permitted, by Rule 3.6 or the federal rules. The Wayfarer Parties initiated their own claims in multiple lawsuits against multiple parties, and in doing so, had a full and unencumbered opportunity to include in their pleadings any and all text messages or other context they believed supported their claims,” stated a Jan. 27 letter asking for the gag order.', 'Gottlieb and Esra Hudson, attorneys for Lively, said in a statement following the hearing, “We are pleased with the result of today’s hearing and eager to move forward immediately with discovery in this case. The Court granted our request that all attorneys in the matter actually follow the rule of law and not make any statements that could prejudice a jury. This case deals with serious allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation. We will hold the defendants accountable, and we are confident that once all the evidence is submitted in this matter, Ms. Lively will prevail.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"

Yet Baldoni’s own lawsuit suggests he wasn’t feeling so apologetic at the time of the call.', '', 'The voice memo was obtained first by The Daily Mail, accompanied by a story stating it was tied to the back-and-forth over the rewrite. While that would seem to be the case, there is no way for The Hollywood Reporter to verify when Baldoni sent Lively the recording.', 'It also remains a mystery how the voice memo made its way to the media. Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman hasn’t been shy about taking credit for leaking emails and footage, but in this instance is staying mum. Lively’s team went on the record with THR in saying, “we did not provide the recording to any outlet, including the Daily Mail.”', '“I’m really sorry I fucked up,” Baldoni says in the voice memo. “That is a fail on my part. One thing you should know about me is I will admit and apologize when I fail. I am far from perfect. I’m a very flawed man, as my wife will attest, and I’m going to fuck up. I’m going to say the wrong thing. I’m going to put my foot in my mouth,” Baldoni can be heard saying. “I’m going to piss you off probably, but I will always apologize and find my way back to center. That is one thing I can assure you of. I’m sorry I made you feel that way.”', 'Yet Baldoni’s $400 million lawsuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, reveals that Baldoni was reluctant from the beginning to let Lively take a pass at rewriting the scene and felt pressured to accept the changes after the actress invoked her husband’s name and friend Taylor Swift in saying how much they liked what she had done.', '“The draft of the rooftop scene that Lively sent Baldoni dramatically differed from what had been written originally,” states his lawsuit, which was filed Jan. 16 in federal court in New York days after Lively filed her own lawsuit in the same court accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the film and later of launching a post-release smear campaign. “Baldoni was hesitant about many of the changes, but thanked Lively for her passion and diplomatically told her that the scene would likely end up being somewhere between the original version and Lively’s version.”', '', 'The suit goes on to say that Lively, who was apparently “stung” by his suggestion, went silent for several days before sending Baldoni an email saying his comments about meeting somewhere in the middle “didn’t feel so great for me.” She also recounted in the lengthy email how she’d felt stymied in the past by other filmmakers in terms of her creative suggestions.', 'Baldoni, addressing her past experiences, says in the voice memo, “I am so sorry you have been through what you’ve been through with these other filmmakers and producers or whoever the people were that you worked with. It just pissed me off. Those fuckheads. I’m just still blown away that this is the industry that we’re in and that what you’ve experienced that as a woman. And I know I don’t need to say it, but that’s not at all going to be, or hopefully has been, the experience with me.”', 'He also says in the voice memo it’s amazing that she has such good friends as her husband and Swift, whom she calls her “dragons.” Yet in his lawsuit, he says he felt threatened at the time to accept the changes. “The message could not have been clearer. Baldoni was not just dealing with Lively. He was also facing Lively’s ‘dragons,’ two of the most influential and wealthy celebrities in the world, who were not afraid to make things very difficult for him,” states the suit.', 'Toward the end of Baldoni’s voicemail, he says, “I have so much more to say but I’m going to stop rambling because, Jesus Christ, it’s been six minutes and 30 seconds, so fuck me. I’m sorry. You probably have kids all over you and a baby on your boob and you’re listening to me ramble at 2 in the morning. I hope you’re feeling better and give Ryan my love.”', '', 'Read the voice mail in full below.', 'Hey, Blake it is 2 in the morning. Hopefully this does not wake you up. Whew. Wow. There’s so much I want to say to you and I hope that we can FaceTime or see each other in person soon, and get to talk more. But I’m just going to send you a few thoughts and hopefully it’s not going to be more than a few minutes but I don’t have the best track record — I don’t think either one of us have the best track record for our voice memos. I want to start with an apology. Man, reading the second part of your message, my heart sank. I’m really sorry.', 'I for sure fell short and you worked really hard on that and the way you framed it and how that made you feel. I just want to say thank you for sharing that with me. That takes a lot of trust and vulnerability and I feel really grateful that you feel safe enough to tell me that that’s how you feel and share that with me. I’m really sorry. I fucked up. That was a fail on my part.', 'One thing you should know about me: I will admit and apologize when I fail. I am far from perfect. I am a flawed man, as my wife will attest. And I’m going to fuck up. I’m going to say the wrong thing. I’m going to put my foot in my mouth. I’m going to piss you off, probably, but I will always apologize and find my way back to center. That is one thing I can assure you of. I’m sorry I made you feel that way. That must’ve felt terrible and I will for sure do better. That was not my best weekend and I should have given it more time.', '', 'And damn right, you got great friends. If that’s how you felt and they knew that — and fuck!— we should all have friends like that. Aside from the fact that they’re two of the most creative people on the planet, the three of you guys together is unbelievable. Talk about energy — force — all three of you, but I just wanted you to know that I didn’t need that because it’s really good and it’s going to make the movie sing like you said, and I’m excited to go through the whole movie with you. I’m just excited to spend time with you. I’m excited to be in your sphere and your presence and for us to share creative juices together. Although that sounds terrible.', 'I think you and I have been trying to build a relationship, which I think we’ve done successfully. I mean here we are — talking like this — me into my phone at two in the morning, but largely via text and voice note. And I will be honest with you, that is not my biggest strength. I love being with people and being in somebody’s, in somebody’s space and being face to face and I feel like that’s where I excel and definitely fallen short at times in our text and voice note exchanges so much to communicate and there’s so much happening and all that to say, I’m just really looking forward to spending time together and I think that’s going to really go a long way for our chemistry, which I believe is there — has been there from the start. So I was stoked, damn excited when you wanted to do this film.', 'I felt it in the room when we met and, yeah, I think it does come from both of us being so fucking hardworking and having a vision and not settling, and I’m excited to have a creative partner in that with you. And it’s just really exciting. There’s so much more to say. There’s so much I want to say. Oh, and there’s one thing that I do need to say, which is I am so sorry you have been through what you’ve been through with these other filmmakers and producers or whoever the people were that you worked with. It just pissed me off. Those fuckheads. I’m just still blown away that this is the industry that we’re in and that you’ve experienced that as a woman. And I know I don’t need to say it, but that’s not at all going to be, or will be, and hopefully it’s not been the experience with me.', '', 'There’s nothing more exciting to me that I get to work with Blake Lively and have her all of her. I mean, that’s what I want. And so there’s been no hesitancy with me sending you the Final Draft file. I am totally fine with that. The only reason I didn’t send it today was because I was trying to implement and add your notes into my working draft, which is already, I’m all over that draft right now. So there’s a whole bunch of new stars that are going to be collated pages and I just haven’t had a chance to send it to you, but there’s no hesitancy. I’m happy to send it to you and I’m sorry that that has happened to you before and I hope after this experience there will be a new, I dunno, I hope it’ll be healing in some way because that’s all I want.', 'I want this movie to be healing. I want this movie to be commercial just like you and affect people and touch people. And I want to walk you through my whole plan and the work that we’re doing with the domestic violence partner that we found, No More. And just my vision. And I just know that this can be really, really special and it’s going to be special. And you’re the secret sauce and we are the secret sauce. And anyways, I have so much more to say. I’m going to stop rambling, because Jesus Christ, it’s been six minutes and 30 seconds, so fuck me. I’m sorry. You probably have kids all over you and a baby on your boob and you’re listening to me ramble at two in the morning. I hope you’re feeling better, and give Ryan my love.', '', 'Thank you for sending me, that means the world to me, that you trust me with your feelings and your thoughts like that.

He also claimed her and Ryan, 48, used their power in Hollywood to take control of It Ends With Us.', 'Justin claimed Blake fired his team of editors and cut her own version of the film. He said Sony agreed to release her cut despite his cut testing higher with test audiences.', 'The director also said Blake had him segregated from the cast and crew at the film’s premiere. Now, Justin revealed additional details of the alleged lengths Blake went to ice him out of the promotion.', 'At one point, Justin claimed Blake “continued to extort” him and his company, and “even Sony, threatening to abandon her contractual obligation to promote the film or approve marketing materials if she wasn’t awarded a producer credit, and through [Justin’s company] had refused long ago to accede to this request when it was made during initial negotiations.”', 'Later, he claimed Blake demanded “the coveted p.g.a. mark on her producer credit — a certified designation licensed by the Producers Guild of America to identify producers who have performed the majority of the producing work” on a film. Justin said he initially refused to write a letter in support of Blake being awarded the p.g.a. mark, which he claims led to her telling Sony to tell him that “any good will left between us is done.”', 'Justin claimed he eventually wrote a letter “in the fact of persistent threats and extortion.”', 'Around April 2024, Justin said his production partner was informed that Blake told Sony’s marketing team that she would refuse to approve trailers, TV spots and digital marketing assets if Justin’s acting credit appeared alongside hers.', 'Sony Marketing allegedly cited Blake’s contractual approval rights over her image and likeness in promotional materials and warned Justin’s partner that she could effectively block the release of “almost every piece of promotional content featuring her face or name — essentially all of it.”', 'Justin included an alleged email from a Sony marketing team member dated April 30, 2024.', 'The alleged email read, “I’m helping [redacted] tie up some loose ends as we near the launch of our trailer.

Last month, he filed a lawsuit against Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.', 'At the time, Lively’s lawyer’s told CNN in a statement that Baldoni’s suit “is another chapter in the abuser playbook.

Judge Issues Big Slap on the Wrist for Lawyers of Justin Baldoni & Blake Lively,https://www.jezebel.com/days-before-the-first-pre-trial-conference-justin-baldonis-attorney-followed-through-on-the-website,"['On Monday, the first court hearing in the public back-and-forth between It Ends With Us co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni took place in New York. The result? Judge Lewis J. Liman threatened that if both sides continued to litigate the matter in the press, he’d move their March 2026 trial date up. Just what we all need in these exceedingly unprecedented times! Lively and Baldoni weren’t present for the conference, but Liman warned their attorneys to avoid involving the public so as not to prejudice any future proceedings.', '“My clients are devastated financially and emotionally,” Baldoni’s attorney Bryan J. Freedman reportedly said in court, claiming that his clients (Baldoni; his studio, Wayfarer; the president of Wayfarer, Jamey Heath; and Baldoni’s publicists, Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel) have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in damages since the New York Times published their December 2024 report, “We Can Bury Anyone: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.” The 4,000-word story alleged that Baldoni not only sexually harassed Lively during the production of It Ends With Us, but participated in the orchestration of a smear campaign against her along with his publicists. According to Freedman, his clients hope for the case to proceed swiftly for the sake of their “future livelihood.”', '', 'Meanwhile, Lively’s attorney Michael Gottlieb called the “retaliation campaign” allegedly conducted by Baldoni’s team “devastating” for his client. “You’re not supposed to launch attacks on the other party’s character,” he said. Gottlieb added that he plans to file an amended complaint prior to February 14 that includes new claims and additional defendants.', 'Ahead of Monday’s conference, Lively and Ryan Reynolds moved to dismiss Baldoni’s case and Freedman finally debuted that website he’s been threatening to launch for weeks. TMZ reported on the site’s arrival on Saturday, which contains Baldoni’s 224-page complaint against both Lively and Reynolds and a 168-page “timeline of relevant events.” Included in the “relevant events” are a mass of text messages, emails, and other communications that appear to be between Baldoni and the couple (from their first meeting until the bitter end). Exchanges between Baldoni and his publicists, studio execs, and others involved in the production of It Ends With Us are also included.', '', 'But most of the communications have already been reported on—from Lively likening herself to Khaleesi to Baldoni’s apologies (via text and a 2 a.m. voice note) to Lively for alleged infractions like a disappointing response to her edits to the now-infamous rooftop scene. However, there is some new context in the form of text messages and notations that refute some of Lively’s most incendiary claims.', 'An example? Lively introduced Baldoni to her trainer and friend before production began in February 2023. According to the timeline—and when the working rapport between Lively and Baldoni still appeared, at the very least, civil and, at most, downright congenial—Baldoni ended up collaborating with the trainer on an exercise plan for the film. In an exchange with Lively around this time, she appears to joke about needing to lose 20 pounds; Baldoni “disliked” the text. Weeks later, Lively expressed concern about how her body would appear on screen.', '“As woke as we both are and work to be, this movie requires a certain aesthetic,” she wrote. Baldoni appeared to disagree, reassuring her that she “will look amazing” and needn’t “stress about her body.”', 'In March 2023, Lively wrote to Baldoni that she had strep throat. In response, he appeared to offer his holistic health coach who he said had “amazing gut health protocols that help after antibiotics.” The next month, she wrote that she’d fallen ill again. This time, Baldoni offered his health “intuitive” to help. You might remember that according to Lively’s complaint, these people weren’t a “health coach” or “intuitive” but weight loss specialists that she claimed were Baldoni’s way of fat-shaming her.', 'In April, Baldoni claimed that, because he has back issues, he was worried about a scene in which he was supposed to lift Lively. In preparation, he asked the trainer how to properly train his back to accommodate Lively’s weight. Days later, Baldoni claims to have been invited to Lively and Reynolds’ penthouse where Reynolds accused him of fat-shaming his wife.', '“How dare you fucking ask about my wife’s weight?

Baldoni’s public relations team that allegedly orchestrated the campaign to undermine the actress would then feed pieces of the manufactured content to reporters, with the goal of making it go viral in order to “influence public opinion and thereby cause an organic pile-on.”', 'Wallace — who described himself as a “hired gun” and purported to have a “proprietary formula for defining artists and trends,” per the complaint — was retained on behalf of Baldoni and his company Wayfarer, who also brought on veteran crisis PR exec Melissa Nathan of The Agency Group (Nathan is named in Lively’s lawsuit). Lively detailed efforts by Wallace to “seed and influence online forums” on Reddit attacking her and defending Baldoni.', 'And in a decision that signals it could be receptive to a gag order against Baldoni’s legal team, a New York federal judge moved up a hearing to address an escalating request from Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, to bar Bryan Freedman, the lawyer for the It Ends With Us star and director, from trying the litigation in the press and biasing potential jurors.', 'U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ordered that a pretrial hearing set for Feb. 11 be moved up to Feb. 3 hours after Lively and Reynolds’ legal team sent a second letter alleging Freedman continues to violate court rules by making certain comments to the media on behalf of Baldoni and Baldoni’s production company, Wayfarer, among other tactics. Lively and Reynolds are represented by Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who first asked for a gag order last week.', '', '“The endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end. It will not stop without this court’s intervention,” states the Monday filing from Lively. “The Wayfarer Defendants’ efforts are being financed by a billionaire, who has pledged to spend $100 million to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family. Mr. Freedman is using that money, his roster of current and former clients, and a blatant media and social media strategy to assassinate Ms. Lively’s character in advance of trial.”', 'The actress-producer is accusing Baldoni of alleged sexual harassment on the set of the film, as well as orchestrating a smear campaign following the film’s release. Baldoni later filed his own complaint against the actress and husband Reynolds, seeking at least $400 million in damages.', 'Liman also revealed that the court plans to consolidate the separate lawsuits and set a March 9, 2026, trial date.', 'Monday’s letter to Liman from Lively and Reynolds’ legal team was sparked by a lengthy statement Freedman provided to TMZ and other media outlets on Jan. 25, including that “when you accuse innocent individuals of something so disturbing as sexual harassment without thinking of the destruction it would cause to not only them, but the entire domestic violence community, this is where accountability for such mean-spirited actions must be taken. We will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts.”', '', 'Counsel for Baldoni and his associates have repeatedly argued that the unfolding events have been “utterly calamitous” for Baldoni and his company Wayfarer, which is backed by billionaire Steve Sarowitz, and that they have been “exiled from polite society” and suffered damages “totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively’s scorched-earth media campaign.”', 'Meanwhile, Lively and Reynolds’ lawyers are also taking issue with a planned website that Baldoni will use to bolster his case by providing certain video, along with text and email exchanges. Lively’s lawyers argue there will be no way of knowing what he has omitted, or even deleted. “Mr. Freedman has made it apparent that he is engaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool. He further has made it clear that his priority is to ‘torpedo Blake Lively’s career for good’ by, among other things, creating a website to release strategically selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni,” stated the Monday filing.', 'Freedman also represents Baldoni in a separate lawsuit against The New York Times, which published a detailed story about Lively’s time on the set of It Ends With Us. The film was financed by Wayfarer and distributed by Sony.', 'Responding to Monday’s letter filed on behalf of Lively and Reynolds, Freedman said, “The irony continues to be rich for team Lively/Reynolds. Our intention with the upcoming website is to do the exact opposite of what they themselves did when they gave provably false information to the New York Times. We will not be selective, we will not cherry-pick and we will not doctor text messages. Both Ms. Lively and Mr Reynolds do not yet understand that there isn’t one rule for them and one rule for everybody else. If they want to unethically gag the truth by threatening to wield their power in Hollywood, we will fight it every step of the way. We are not scared of them, we will not be silenced by them. Defending ourselves is not retaliation, it is a human right.”', '', '“If Mr. Freedman’s conduct is permitted, it will only result in an arms race of selective public disclosures of text messages to the media,” Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer for Lively, writes in the letter. “The Wayfarer parties initiated their own claims in multiple lawsuits against multiple parties, and in doing so, had a full and unencumbered opportunity to include in their pleadings any and all text messages or other context they believed supported their claims.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.']"

McCawley said Sloane and her company ""have been dragged into this as a finger pointing mechanism and we\'d like to get them out quite quickly.""', 'The issue of the case being litigated in the press was a major topic of discussion by both lawyers.', 'Gottlieb said Freedman\'s public statements have been defamatory and ""continue the campaign of retaliation"" against Lively, adding, ""You can\'t unring that bell."" He added that they are not seeking ""a gag order"" against Freedman, only for the judge to adopt the rules of professional conduct for lawyers that govern what can be said outside of court.', 'Freedman signaled he also wanted those rules adopted, saying, ""This has not been a one-way street.""', 'Both the Judge and Lively\'s attorney, though, took issue with an attachment Freedman included on a recently launched website, the document titled ""Timeline of Relevant Events.""', '""The law is pretty clear you can\'t just attach a factual narrative,"" Judge Liman told Baldoni\'s attorney of the lengthy attachment. The judge later stated that sanctions are possible, saying, ""The court does have sanction power if it looks like the docket is being abused.""', 'Last month, Judge Liman set a trial date for March 9, 2026, in the stars\' ongoing legal battle. At one point in Monday\'s hearing, the judge also stated that he has the power to move up the trial date if the case is litigated in the press to the point that it becomes untenable.

Mr. Baldoni\'s lawyers base their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong. The sleuths have noted that a version of the Lively state complaint published by The Times carries the date \'December 10\' even though the complaint wasn\'t filed until more than a week later. The problem: that date is generated by Google software and is unrelated to the date when The Times received it and posted it.""', ""Lively accused Baldoni of alleged sexual harassment and accused him and his publicity team of trying to destroy her reputation in a complaint she filed in December with the California Civil Rights Department, which included numerous text messages and communications she claimed were part of a campaign to attack her public image.

Later that month, Lively then filed a lawsuit in New York against Baldoni and other defendants, formalizing her allegations from her complaint.

All parties have denied the respective claims.', 'Posted to the website thelawsuitinfo.com, the texts are part of a 168-page file entitled “Timeline of Relevant Events”. What it contains is cringeworthy on all counts.', 'The texts include interactions between Lively and Baldoni where the actress refers to herself as a “ball buster” and describes her on-screen appeal as the character of Lily Bloom in It Ends With Us, saying: “If you knew me (in person) longer you’d have a sense of how flirty and yummy the ball busting would play. It’s my love language. Spicy and playfully bold, never with teeth.”', 'But the transcript is just as embarrassing for Baldoni, who is revealed to have texted Ryan Reynolds a long, multi-paragraph message requesting to be friends.', '“Hey Ryan, Justin Baldoni here.
