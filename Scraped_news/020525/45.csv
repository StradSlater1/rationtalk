In addition to Album of the Year, she also won Best Country Album and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.', 'Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone and Charli XCX received seven nominations this year, while Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan earned six nods. Lamar swept all five categories he was nominated in, winning both Record and Song of the Year. Roan was also a big winner, taking home the award for Best New Artist.', 'Comedian and former host of ""The Daily Show"" Trevor Noah returned to host the ceremony for a fifth straight year. Eilish, Roan, Charli XCX and Carpenter all delivered standout performances, along with a surprise appearance from The Weeknd, who ended a yearslong boycott of the award show that he once called ""corrupt.""

Throughout the show, Noah reminded viewers and corporate sponsors alike to donate to relief efforts, and air time was given to local business owners who lost their establishments in the fires.

Beyoncé finally won album of the year. Don't mistake this moment for her peak,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5285281/beyonce-grammys-2025-album-year-cowboy-carter,"['Sidney Madden', 'Beyoncé onstage Sunday night at the 67th Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, where her album Cowboy Carter received historic wins for best country album and album of the year.', 'After years of gagging us, something finally gagged Beyoncé. It all happened so fast: Seconds after the debutante smile she often wears at industry events gave way to genuine shock at hearing her name, Beyoncé was reminded by her eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, to get up and take the stage. As she stood at the podium of the 67th Grammy Awards, the first Black woman to win the award for best country album quickly caught herself up to the reality of the moment. ""I think sometimes \'genre\' is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they\'re passionate about,"" Bey declared. ""And to stay persistent.""', 'It wasn\'t long before the significance of those words doubled over on itself. At the evening\'s end, her 2024 album, Cowboy Carter, which had also won best country duo/group performance for the Miley Cyrus duet ""II MOST WANTED,"" turned Beyoncé into a first-time album of the year winner. The arena, of course, erupted: Bey\'s peers cheered for her victory in the crowded category against albums by André 3000, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx, Jacob Collier, Sabrina Carpenter and Taylor Swift. Beyoncé is now the fourth Black woman in Grammys history, behind Lauryn Hill, Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole, to win the top prize. During her acceptance speech, the Houston native dedicated the award to Linda Martell, the first Black woman to play at the Grand Ole Opry and a featured collaborator on Cowboy Carter. The nod to Martell was a reminder of the album\'s thesis: that there are color lines in music that have attempted to erase Black history, and that she won\'t let that history be erased.', 'Looking back, Bey\'s been working toward her thesis for a while — even longer than she\'s explicitly let on. Cowboy Carter is the fifth album from the 43-year-old\'s discography to be nominated for album of the year, and with each one, she has been uncovering, marinating, molding and refining the creative drive that brought her to this point. There was 2008\'s I Am… Sasha Fierce, the two-disc release that introduced an alter-ego and the first obvious breadcrumbs of her cross-genre aspirations. There was 2013\'s Beyoncé, the surprise album that diverged from the single-driven format and altered the entire music industry in its wake. There was 2016\'s Lemonade, the prophetic concept album that injected the sociopolitical with deeply personal pain and hopscotched between R&B, rock, blues and gospel. (It was the country track off this album, ""Daddy Lessons,"" performed at another award show that shunned her, that would later become Cowboy Carter\'s origin story.) Then, there was 2022\'s Renaissance, the post-pandemic disco and house party that reclaimed dance-floor joy and paid tribute to Black queer pioneers of the genres. With each album, she\'s dug deeper into her familial well, refreshed herself with new splashes of artistic weirdness and emerged more cleansed in the knowledge and spirit of her vision. If the Recording Academy\'s problem was failing to see that vision as essential, Cowboy Carter made it blisteringly clear.', 'The shockwaves of her snubs have compounded over the years, to the point of creating a lore around her relationship with the award. Time and again, we have watched her watching the stage, while the artists she motivates — ""You are our light,"" as Adele put it in 2017 through uneasy tears — accepted the honor. Cultural critics and the singer\'s fan legion, the BeyHive, have debated whether she should boycott the Grammys altogether in response. She referenced the narrative herself on Cowboy Carter\'s ""SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN,"" framing the slight as powerless to stop her artistry and hustle: ""A-O-T-Y, I ain\'t win / I ain\'t stuntin\' \'bout them / Take that s** on the chin / Come back and f*** up the pen.""', 'Still, the story of Beyoncé at the Grammys has been a perennial lightning rod for conversations about the institution\'s fraught relationship with Black music in general. Last year, as he accepted the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, Jay-Z chided the Academy onstage for failing to recognize Black artists, using his wife\'s omission from AOTY status as a prime example. During Sunday night\'s ceremony, there was at least one moment where the institution spoke back: Harvey Mason Jr., the CEO of The Recording Academy, made an appearance to welcome back another Black artist, The Weeknd, who had previously boycotted the awards in part because his music was not nominated. Though Mason distilled the Canadian musician\'s grievance to ""a lack of transparency,"" a tidy turn of PR speak, The Weeknd\'s broader appeal pointed clearly to the show\'s routine of marginalizing artists along race and gender lines. ""Over the past few years, we\'ve listened, we\'ve acted and we\'ve changed,"" the executive said, referencing a diversified voting pool and new initiatives like the Black Music Collective, Women in the Mix and Academy Proud.', ""While it's not clear what Beyoncé's big night means for the Grammys going forward, I have some guesses about the role it will play in her own mythology. Adding this year's wins to the tally, Bey holds the title of the most-awarded artist in Grammys history, with 35 awards. Trophies aside, she has been setting the standard for creating culture-shifting moments in music and pop culture for years now. Her influence, artistry and power have been certified. But when we look back on her career from this point on, many will label Cowboy Carter her magnum opus because of this win. Thirty years from now, in the inevitable biopics and documentary series about her life and work, this night will be immortalized as the moment of climax. Like Toni Morrison's 1993 Nobel Prize or Martin Scorsese's best picture win in 2007, this will be positioned as the long-overdue lifetime achievement, the institutional breakthrough of all breakthroughs."", 'The real gag is this: The scenes chosen as climactic by those who write history are often slightly ahistorical, slightly askew, blinded by the light of a superlative. So don\'t confuse this moment with Beyoncé\'s apex. Don\'t forget everything else it took to get her to album of the year — and don\'t forget the shaky history of the Grammys, the pricklier cultural story entwined with hers. Cowboy Carter is part two of a three-part suite rooted in the history and legitimacy of Black-birthed music genres. The superstar will head out on tour this year, after which she\'s expected to deliver the closing chapter, for now known by fans as ""Act III."" When she does, don\'t be surprised if the institutions tasked with recognizing and celebrating music are still getting their act together.', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor']"

So, the cat sitter can’t just vote.”', 'The EGOT winner continued, “Are you aware that when the Grammys began in 1959, there were only 28 categories, now there are 94?

You can’t do that. She earned it.”', 'Speaking directing to Arroyo, Goldberg added, “You want to hold on to country music like white people didn’t also buy her country album. Come on, man! People voted for it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don’t. Same with the Oscars. Sit down! … Music does not have the issues you have. Music is about the people.”', 'Cowboy Carter, released in March 2024, was not only a historic effort from Beyoncé, but it also put a spotlight on other Black artists in the country music space and ignited cultural conversations about Black artists reclaiming the genres they started, including country music. The singer has also been open about not feeling “welcomed” in the country genre when she initially tried to enter the scene years ago.', '', 'Last year, Beyoncé was also infamously snubbed from the CMA Awards, despite Cowboy Carter being one of the top albums of the year and spending four weeks on top of Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart.', 'On Sunday, she made history as the first Black woman to win the Grammy for best country album.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.']"

I didn’t see it because I went to sleep. I live on the East Coast and the award shows already run long but I also didn’t think that the Grammys were going to get it right; I assumed that Beyoncé, whose latest album “Cowboy Carter” was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, was going to lose (again) in the one category she has yet to own after a series of high concept, musically flawless projects since 2013’s self-titled surprise album drop. But it’s February 3, 2025, in African America and Beyoncé finally got her AOTY.', 'I suppose I should have known something was up when Beyoncé, much to the surprise of everybody but Blue Ivy, won the award for “Best Country Album.” The video of her realizing that she won was definitely me as well; I figured she had a shot at the AOTY, but country album? No way. The entire country music machine seemed to be out on Bey’s foray into what they believe isn’t her lane so the win seemed almost like an accident. But there she was winning in a category she didn’t even probably prepare to win, speaking about not being boxed in by labels and genre. Amen. If you want to see what a crash out looks like, the comments on a post that CMT posted about Beyoncé’s win should fill your “I knew racism was alive” quota for the year.', 'AOTY, though, she had a real chance to win, I just didn’t expect it. Beyoncé was up against albums by Billie Eilish, Charlie XCX, Chappell Roan, Jacob Collier, André 3000, Sabrina Carpenter and Taylor Swift. I’ve heard all of the albums in this list save for the one from Jacob Collier, and while there were some amazing albums in the running, you cannot convince me that Beyoncé’s album didn’t matter more. It wasn’t just an amazing body of musical work (which it is) but it was also political and symbolic and risk-taking.', 'While people love Beyoncé, many of those same people do not love the country music genre, or any other genre adjacent to it. I know this because I listened to “Cowboy Carter” on repeat for days and somehow that act put me in the top 1 percent of Beyoncé listeners in 2024 according to Spotify. There is no universe where that should be the case. The only logical conclusion is that people may love Beyoncé but “Cowboy Carter” was not getting the spins of prior records.', 'But you know what, none of that matters now. Beyoncé won and it felt like such a truly genuine moment. Even the award presenter who read out her name seemed so excited that she flubbed the album title. The AOTY Grammy was presented by representatives from the Los Angeles Fire Department, a group among other first responders who have been doing the hard work of assisting with fires that decimated several communities in the Los Angeles area. The first responders have worked tirelessly over weeks trying to contain the fire and help those impacted. As fire chief Anthony Marrone and Captain Sheila Berkoh stood up there, Captain Berkoh opened the envelope and then hugged it like it mattered to her that Beyoncé won, too.', 'Listen, I felt that elation even a day later re-watching the moment on YouTube. I don’t want to be too sentimental here, but I teared up a little. I realize how ridiculous it is to care this much about an artist who has no idea I exist, but you can appreciate the moments when people who work hard for the thing, get the thing, especially when you know it matters. I’m sure even the artists who lost to her, while not happy they lost, are probably happy that she finally was acknowledged by the Grammys with the award. Especially for a body of work as intentional and as well constructed as “Cowboy Carter.” Every choice made on the album was done with a purpose and that purpose was realized with every listen.', 'Knowing Beyoncé the way that we do, this win is likely to have her working even harder. Her “Cowboy Carter” tour dates and cities were just announced and there’s an “Act III” on the way to follow, “Renaissance” and “Cowboy Carter.” She has never seemed the type to rest on her laurels and now that she’s finally broken through her AOTY ceiling, perhaps she is going to hit the gas on the way to more exemplary bodies of work. For today, though, I hope that Beyoncé enjoys the win as much as the rest of us do. I’m proud of her like she’s my family.', 'I guess since we’re all Black, we kind of are.

Beyoncé’s album of the year win is a tip of the hat to those who snubbed her,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-win-rcna190425,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'After being snubbed by the Grammys for the better part of two decades, Beyoncé finally won Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter.” Despite having won more Grammys than anyone (Bey had won 32 times before Sunday night and had won 35 by the end of it) and having been previously nominated by the Recording Academy for album of the year four times, she repeatedly lost to other artists. Academy members’ refusal to vote for her in this category was emblematic of the academy’s systemic racism and misogyny, detractors argued — and it’s an argument I agreed with.', 'Academy members’ refusal to vote for her in this category was emblematic of the academy’s systemic racism and misogyny.', 'The Nation explored this phenomenon of the most decorated artist in Grammy history not winning the Grammy’s highest honor in a 2023 article, in which Kali Holloway interviewed voting members of the Recording Academy, some of whom explained why they hadn’t voted for Beyoncé. “[E]very time [Beyoncé] does something new, it’s a big event and everyone’s supposed to quake in their shoes — it’s a little too portentous,” one septuagenarian voter said.', 'Holloway explained there is a “counterintuitive idea on repeat here, which seems to be that Beyoncé is in danger of becoming too decorated.” Adding, “That her cultural impact has been too outsize, too disruptive. In short, that she should be penalized for taking up too much rarefied space. Once again, it’s misogynoir — the intertwined anti-Blackness and misogyny that pathologizes and stigmatizes Black women. Same refrain, different song.”', 'A Time magazine article entitled “Beyoncé’s Album of the Year Snub Fits Into the Grammys’ Long History of Overlooking Black Women,” also published in 2023, made a similar argument. “Among those emotions were anger, frustration, and resignation at the Recording Academy’s history of overlooking Black artists, and specifically Black women, in this major category,” Moises Mendez II wrote. “In Beyoncé’s case, each of the four times she has been nominated for album of the year, she has lost to a white artist whose album many argued was less culturally significant than hers.”', 'If you still have your doubts, take note of this: Beyoncé is only the fourth Black woman in history to win in this category, and the first since Lauryn Hill won for “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” in 1999.', 'After Beyoncé lost the album of the year category for a fourth time in 2023, she released “Cowboy Carter,” a country album, in 2024. It was a shrewd move to disrupt an industry and awards show which perpetuates racial inequities with its rigid categories/genres and excludes certain artists (namely women and people of color) from certain genres and spaces. Beyoncé was famously booed at the 2016 Country Music Awards, when she made an appearance with The Chicks. Audience members screamed racial epithets at her. These sentiments were echoed in online spheres, too.', 'Beyoncé is only the fourth black woman in history to win in this category, and the first since Lauryn Hill won in 1999.', 'In an Instagram post on March 19, 2024, Beyoncé described the process of making “Cowboy Carter.” “This album has been over five years in the making,” she wrote. “It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed … and it was very clear that I wasn’t. But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive.”', 'She infiltrated the country music space, which despite its original Black influence, has been mostly white, mostly male and historically anti-Black/racist and she rejected the industry’s imposed limitations, undergirded as it is by misogynoir. It was a deeply sophisticated and deliberate choice to use her music to make this point.', 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, despite the undeniable commercial and creative success of “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé did not receive one Country Music Awards nomination.', 'She made a nod to these structural inequities in her acceptance speech for country album of the year during the Grammys: “I think sometimes ‘genre’ is a code word to keep us in our place as artists. And I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about. And to stay persistent.”', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'This theme became the throughline of her messaging for the night, in which she implicitly wove her resistance to the industry’s constraining standards. In her acceptance speech for Album of the Year, Beyoncé said, “I dedicate this to Miss Martell,” referring to Linda Martell, the first Black woman to break through in country music, with notable and surprising success in the 1960s. “I hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors.”', 'Beyoncé broke the rules of the industry to defy its racialized and gendered constraints. The outrageous success of her country album — in a genre historically steeped in white supremacy and anti-Black violence (innumerable country music stars have publicly used the N-word, for example) — produced discomfort for some, but it also demanded attention in its disruptiveness and ingenuity. She is a potent reminder for us all, that, when the game is rigged,  sometimes you need to break the rules to win.', 'Noor Noman is a freelance journalist in New York City who has worked as a writer, editor, producer and presenter.

The wildfires were an elephant in the room that needed addressing, lest the awards show come off tone deaf, which is the last thing fans want tonight.

The song includes Lamar calling Drake a ""certified pedophile"" and the accompanying artwork for the track contained an aerial view of Drake\'s mansion outside of Toronto, with red sex offender symbols placed on the home.

The bus driver played a regional station and that station played country music. For an hour each day I stared out the window while Garth Brooks’s I Don’t Need Your Rockin’ Chair’ and Loretta Lynn’s Don’t Come Home a Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on your Mind) played like a soundtrack to the fields and squat bungalows rolling past. It was the mid-1990s. My class were rehearsing a choreographed line dance to Billy Ray Cyrus’s Achy Breaky Heart dressed in blue denim and our school uniform shirts. The coolest girl in our year, who wore Gap jeans her father had brought her back from the States, had taken actual lessons and was teaching us the steps.', 'The 1990s was a high point for country music in Ireland. A soundtrack for rural America, it found an outlet in mainstream media. Figures such as Brooks and Shania Twain were household names. Country’s appeal wasn’t only about the music. It gave an idealised version of Americana, with themes such as hard work, family values and small-town life resonating with global listeners.', 'The genre had a resurgence this year. Lana del Rey declared it to be popular music’s next frontier. And Beyoncé latest album, Cowboy Carter, was nominated for 11 awards in Sunday’s Grammy Awards, winning the prestigious album of the year gong. It all started with that cowboy hat at last year’s awards ceremony. Actually no, it began, Beyoncé says, with “an experience I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed”. In 2016, Beyoncé performed Daddy Lessons, a decidedly country track from Lemonade at the Country Music Awards to a hostile reception. Some viewers claimed that she “didn’t belong” on that stage.', '[ Beyoncé country: How a shy girl from Texas became a cultural icon\nOpens in new window\n ]', 'The irony of country is that while the frontman is a Midwesterner who works hard by day and drowns his sorrows in low places at night, the music betrays him in every measure. The banjo has its origins in west Africa, as do the bent or flattened notes that made their way from African music to blues notes into country crooning. Irish and Scottish immigrants brought their music traditions too, the lilting syncopated jigs and reels that underpin Appalachian folk and bluegrass. Spanish settlers introduced the guitar and ballad form. Jewish and eastern European populations brought polka and Klezmer. Then there’s Louisiana, where French-speaking Cajun communities blended Creole, blues and country into Zydeco. But yeah, okay, Beyoncé had no business on that stage in 2016. How can a picture this colourful distil to a white man in double-denim hugging a barn door? Maybe in the same way a country as culturally diverse as America can be governed almost exclusively by white men.', 'The 2025 country revival happens as Trump takes office and the US develops a hard stance on immigration and rolls back DEI policies, complicating the genre’s themes of nationalism and the frontier. Here Cowboy Carter serves to highlight black artists already at work in country music. Shaboozey – (Collins Obinna Chibueze), a black genre-bending country-music artist from Virginia – collaborated on several tracks from the album. In 2024, he was nominated for a CMA award in his own right.', 'Beyoncé rides side saddle on a grey thoroughbred in a fitted red, white and blue jumpsuit. If drag is an overblown performance of femininity, then Beyoncé‘s outfit is a caricature of Americana. She holds the reins firmly in one hand and flies her own tasselled version of the American flag in the other. Texas Hold’em was the first song by a black woman to debut at no 1 on the country music billboards chart. The instrumentation is typical country – banjo, guitar, ukulele – with Beyoncé‘s instrument layered beautifully on top. It’s redolent of a hoedown until close to last orders where, with the dreamy strains of a Wurlitzer, the sawdust floor is switched out for disco tiles. And it’s magic. In Sixteen Carriages, she turns over the tropes of the country ballad – travelling and the 9-5 grind – and centres a touring mother who is “overworked and overwhelmed”. There are several covers too, notably Dolly Parton’s Jolene. Where Parton prostrates herself at the feet of a beautiful adversary who can steal her man for thrills, Queen Bey never begs. “I’m warnin’ you,” she sings.', '“Genres are a funny little concept aren’t they? ... In theory, they have a simple definition that’s easy to understand. But in practice, well, some may feel confined.” This is Linda Martell, the first successful black female artist in country music, who can be heard on the track Spaghettii. Once an emblem of aspiration, the values tied to country music – patriotism, rugged individualism, the American dream – now feel, if not tainted by their ties to Trump-era politics, then at the very least complicated by the culture wars. The response to Cowboy Carter is also about more than just what we hear – it sounds out ongoing cultural tensions in America. It highlights the divide between those who see country music as an evolving, diverse space, and those who want to maintain its traditional (aka white, conservative) image.', 'The CMA failed to nominate Beyoncé‘s latest album for any awards, despite its commercial successes. And when Beyoncé took the stage at the CMAs in 2016, country music’s gatekeepers sent a clear message: You don’t belong here. Cowboy Carter answers with its own refrain: “I’m warnin’ you”. Country music is no longer a one-note song. And it never was.', 'As for Ireland, the last time country music was this cool, we all wanted Gap jeans from our friends who had been to the States on their holidays.

Yet again, because of the treatment of African Americans, the United States, and those that fled the South via the great migration, those who came from Texas to California, from Mississippi to Chicago, to escape the overt white supremacist nature that was happening in the deep South, there was almost this disassociation of Southern identity and southern heritage."", ""Because it wasn't seen as urban or a cosmopolitan. There was this almost washing away of anything that was southern and country and Texas and rural and you see it more in hip hop.

They even said that Southern rappers' tongues were too slow to rap. And for Beyoncé to, in my opinion, also be a phenomenal rapper."", ""She was rapping when she was in Destiny's Child.

So when she's making this reference, repeated times throughout her career that she is Southern, that she is Texas, that she's Louisiana, that she's Alabama, that she has all of this within her."", ""And in my personal opinion, it's her saying for every single person who's told me in the music industry or in pop culture that I cannot achieve all of these goals because I am from the South and I'm a Black person from the South."", 'Let me remind you that this is a birthplace of genius and innovation.', ""CHAKRABARTI: Without a doubt.

So let's listen to a little bit from Country Girl."", '(COUNTRY GIRL PLAYS)', ""CHAKRABARTI: That's Rissi Palmer's Country Girl from 2007."", 'Rissi, can you tell me a little bit about why country was the musical genre that called to you and sort of your path into the world, into that world?', 'PALMER: Absolutely. I am the child of two very country, very Southern people that grew up in Georgia and in small towns in Georgia.', 'And my whole life has been shaped by the Southern experience. And my mother in particular loved music, but really, really gravitated towards like Patsy Cline. And Dolly Parton, in addition to, you know, Phoebe Snow and Aretha Franklin. So when I was growing up, my listening was that, and I just always loved the stories.', ""I just absolutely fell in love with the stories and wanted to do that myself, like felt like that was the best way that I could express myself. And I have to give thanks to the two Black women that were my first managers, they were the ones that encouraged me to pursue it. I honestly didn't think that it was a viable route for me, because I had never seen a Black woman do it in the mainstream."", 'So they were the ones that encouraged me to do it and put me on this path.', 'CHAKRABARTI: Wow. Well Taylor, I want to bring you back into the conversation. Do you have any responses or want to add something to what Rissi says?', 'CRUMPTON: I love Rissi Palmer so much, because --', 'PALMER: I love you.', 'CRUMPTON: Everything she says is true, is that Beyoncé does have the benefit and the blessing of having done the hard work since she was a little girl, since she was 15. Of being able to create something like Cowboy Carter and be on country radio.', ""And have worldwide media look towards Black women in country music, like Rissi, like Holly, like Alice Randall, to comment about what's going on in the national music industry. But in that same breath and vein, I remember reading that when Texas Hold 'Em was being played on country music radio, then country music radio programmers and engineers would not play any other Black woman in country music."", ""And even if we look at the lineups right now, for a lot of country music festivals, there are zero Black women on the lineup. And that is the reality, that we can celebrate and hold space for Cowboy Carter and all this impact and what it's doing for women like Rissi Palmer, who have been on the frontlines advocating and holding space and sharing their experience about what it is to be a Black woman in an industry that is notoriously anti-Black and anti-woman."", 'However, here we are a year later, the Grammys are about to happen. And the country music industry and music row in Nashville have now gone back to its good old boy days, now that the eyes of the world are no longer on them.', 'CHAKRABARTI: I have to say, you know, when you said that, okay, so they would play one thing from Cowboy Carter and that was it.', ""That was, you know, they had one Black artist on there, so they couldn't play anyone else. I literally, my jaw literally dropped. I was like, like what?"", ""PALMER: Oh. It's horrifying. I think I just, I know you're asking the questions, but I just want to throw this in there. Last year at Country Radio Seminar, when right after Texas Hold 'Em and 16 Carriages had broken onto the chart and broken in at number one, you know, everybody was celebrating and patting themselves on the back and, oh, we're so innovative and we're so forward thinking and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."", ""In an article in Variety magazine, a person went on the record, I couldn't believe they said it, they were just like, well, we would support more Black women if we were presented with an actual star."", 'CHAKRABARTI: Oh my.', ""PALMER: And so, this is a quote, like I'm not, I literally printed it out and it's on my bulletin board on my desk."", ""Because anytime I get tired or angry or whatever, I look at that and I remember my why, of why I do this, why I'm doing Color Me Country, and all of that. And he said it on the record, and I'm like, you mean to tell me in all the years of country music, that you have never been presented with a superstar that is a Black woman."", ""Never. So that's what we're up against."", ""CHAKRABARTI: Also, that's just obviously not true, because we're going to talk in a second, we're going to talk in a second about the decades of superstars in country music who are Black women."", 'PALMER: Absolutely not.', ""CHAKRABARTI: But Rissi, if you'll allow me, I wanted to play a little bit more of your music."", ""Here's another track. This is from 2023. It's a song that you released with Americana singer Miko Marks, and it's called Still Here."", '(STILL HERE PLAYS)', ""Rissi Palmer there, 2023, it's a song called Still Here. Rissi, forgive me for just, I'm blurting things out today, but that song rocks. That song is amazing."", 'PALMER: Oh, thank you. Thank you.', ""CHAKRABARTI: I mean, I was just like, five seconds in, I'm like, give me the whole rest of it. But unfortunately, due to digital rights issues, we cannot play more than that on the radio."", 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'PALMER: I understand. I understand.', ""CHAKRABARTI: All right. So you actually, what you said about, you know, oh, the industry needs to be presented with a bona fide Black female country star, leads us perfectly to talk about how many they actually already have been in country music. So let me play another moment from Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter."", 'It is a moment that comes in the introduction to the 12th track on the album. And that track is called Spaghetti.', ""LINDA MARTELL [FROM SPAGHETTI]: Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? Yes, they are."", 'CHAKRABARTI: So that voice belongs to Linda Martell, and I believe she was the first commercially successful Black female artist in country, and the commercially successful part matters here, and the first to play in the Grand Ole Opry.', 'Taylor, do you want to talk a little bit about her?', 'CRUMPTON: I would be the wrong person to ask when you have Rissi Palmer on the other line.', 'CHAKRABARTI: Okay. No, I just want to be sure I give everyone an equal crack at it here, but Rissi, go ahead. Tell us more about Linda Martell.', 'PALMER: Okay. Well, Linda Martell, first of all, we call her the patron saint of my radio show.', ""It's named after her album, Color Me Country, which came out in 1968. Linda is, as you mentioned, she's the first Black woman to chart. Up until Beyoncé, she was the highest charting Black female at number 22 with her song, Color Him Father. There have been nine of us to chart. And she was the highest until Beyoncé."", ""She was signed to a record company called Plantation Records. Yeah. And her producer's name was Shelby Singleton. And she toured. She had an all-white band that she could not ride in the car with. Because if she was seen in the car with them, in the South, they would have assumed that she was a prostitute and arrested them."", 'CHAKRABARTI: Oh my.', ""PALMER: And so they had to travel separately. A lot of times they would put her on bills, and they would call this ghosting. Where they would put you on a bill, but they wouldn't say anything about you being Black or anything like that. Now, normally that wouldn't be on a bill, but they wouldn't put your picture on there."", 'So people would come, and they would expect, you know, a white lady and they would get beautiful brown skin, Linda Martell. And unfortunately, Color Me Country was her only album. She recorded a second album. The record company shelved it. In favor of promoting Jeannie C. Reilly and Harper Valley PTA, and she was effectively blacklisted in Nashville, moved back to Sumner, South Carolina, where she still lives, and raised a family, drove a school bus, and performed locally.', ""And yeah, that's Linda Martell's story in a nutshell."", ""CHAKRABARTI: Wow. Well, let's listen to A track from that first and only album that you talked about, Color Me Country. This is Linda Martell singing Bad Case of the Blues."", '(BAD CASE OF THE BLUES PLAYS)', ""CHAKRABARTI: Linda Martell there in Bad Case of the Blues. Taylor Crumpton, what do you hear in Linda Martell's story?"", ""CRUMPTON: It is the unfortunate reality of being a Black woman in any industry, whether that be education, politics, music, arts, culture, media, is you can be the first, the finest, and be at the forefront, an innovator, a leader, but if those in power do not respect you, or in Linda Martell's case, being a Black woman signed to a record label named after a plantation, there are always reminders, whether they be individual or on a macro level, that those people are seeing you as less than and are undermining you."", 'And I think the glory of Beyoncé being not only a student of Black music, but of American music and culture and her, too, having to experience racially charged mistreatment by the country music industry at the 2016 CMA Awards, is that for her to put Linda on Spaghetti.', ""But also, she had this one post on Instagram where she's wearing a Linda Martell shirt that she purchased off of a website that Linda Martell's granddaughter has, because the granddaughter is raising funds to make a documentary about her grandmother Linda Martell, shows that Beyoncé is not only including her on this track but is doing things out of the goodness of her heart. Because There have been so many Black entertainers that we have lost, that have died penniless and have been mistreated by the record industry."", 'So it did take a global superstar like herself to do what many in the industry would not do, is to give Linda her flowers while she is still alive.', 'CHAKRABARTI: Mm. Rissi, we have to take a break here in just a minute or so. You mentioned a couple of times, like, what really goes on, right, in Nashville. Has really so little changed?', ""Since the time of, you know, Linda Martell's first album?"", ""PALMER: No. No. I hate to, I hate to be that person, but I think that, well, okay, here's the positive. The thing that has changed is that we can now go directly to the audience. We can go directly to people via streaming and via social media. So you see a proliferation of Black and brown and Asian. And, you know, whatever you are, country artists, because there's more visibility, because we're all now connected with these little computers in our pocket."", ""But in terms of Nashville, no, because if you continue to try to market someone, the same way that you can't market Mickey Guyton the same way that you market Luke Combs."", ""You just can't. It's a completely different set of guidelines. And, I mean, not just aesthetic, like it's cultural. It's just different. And until they invest in figuring out how to create not only the country artists, but also reach across to Black people and make them feel safe and comfortable within the country music audience, then you're not going to, we're going to stay exactly where we were in 1968."", 'Part III', ""CHAKRABARTI: Rissi and Taylor, I want to just give a very, very, very big nod to another major voice in the history of country music. Beyoncé references her directly on Cowboy Carter. And it's, of course, Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She is the godmother of rock and roll. Not just country, but also the godmother of rock and roll."", ""Here she is in one of her most famous songs. It's called Down by the Riverside."", '(DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE PLAYS)', ""CHAKRABARTI: Sister Rosetta Tharpe there. Singing down by the riverside. Rissi Palmer, I mean, Rosetta Tharpe is a total legend, but for folks who don't know her, tell us a little bit about her."", ""PALMER: I mean, Sister Rosetta Tharpe is like, she was gospel, she was rock, she was blues. I mean, she was an incredible guitarist, like I don't think she gets enough, you know, we all know her as a singer and a purveyor of, you know, hymns and spirituals and things like that, but like she also was like a really, like a rocking guitar player, like a real guitar player."", ""CHAKRABARTI: All you have to do is just go on YouTube now and look her up. I mean, she is like shredding the guitar and I think it's this, you know, this is a mixture of her musical ability with the guitar. And then I just said that the country, the rock and roll and the gospel all coming together. Like I feel somewhat transported by her."", ""Like when I'm watching her sing with a bunch of singers behind her and playing the guitar at the same time. And that's how good she was."", ""PALMER: Absolutely. And she comes from a long line of the tradition in church, where if you didn't have a piano player, you had a guitar player, or you had a pedal steel player, or, you know, so all of these instruments that everyone always associates with country music that, you know, i.e. whiteness, a lot of times Baptist churches, if that's all you had, that's all you had. And so that's what you did. You had your guitar player. You had Sister Rosetta come up and play and sing. And, you know, and do the A and B selection."", ""CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Taylor, let me turn to you on this, because Rissi is getting to something really important and it reminds me of some conversations I've had with Rhiannon Giddens, right?"", ""And her, you know, long study and exploration of Black influences and Black foundational influences in Americana in general. I mean, when we think about distinctly American genres of music, I don't even know why we ever got to a point where we didn't consider, you know, Black Americans as being there at the creation of these genres, right?"", 'I mean, that actually seems so strange to me.', 'CRUMPTON: It is my belief and understanding of American music that once it became something that was a commodity, then we see what America does best and thinks about who is going to be the consumer, which American has disposable income. And then we see forces at play around racial segregation, but also class segregation.', 'Black country music has a different origin story, that is beyond the imagination of what the modern-day country music industry can commercialize and market. Black country music has a deep time connection, not only to the church and hymns and spirituals, but also Black country music has interacted with Tejano music, has crossed borders.', ""You know, there's a long history of Black entertainers who were blues entertainers and traveled the blues circuit. The blues circuit went down to Mexico and a lot of styles of Black guitar picking are actually influenced by the Mexican tradition of guitar picking. Black country music has always made space for different cultural influences of people of color to make this beautiful gumbo. And to quote sociologist Tracy McMillan Cottom, country music has now become the thing song for white nationalism. And we have seen this as recently with Carrie Underwood performing at President Trump's inauguration, but also historically when Ronald Reagan in the '80s said that country music was the music of America."", 'That was a dog whistle. Country music has never been white.', ""CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, you know, we could spend, like, three more episodes on what you just said, Taylor. Because, I mean, it's so big and so important and so unfortunate, I think. And Rissi, I'm going to turn this one to you because you know, not only do we have this racial element, but, from my understanding, when you look at the whole body of all the things that comprise country music, this sort of de facto political conservatism is not at all the story of this genre, right?"", 'Like, not just, you know, Black artists, but white artists as well. The country music for a long time has been the place where like, progressive working-class Americans found their home, right?', 'PALMER: Absolutely. I mean, it was the music, until 1920, when the genre was actually named, and it was hillbilly music then.', 'There was race music and then there was hillbilly music. This was the music that everybody, Black, white, indigenous, Hispanic, whatever. This is the music that everybody was sitting on their porch and singing. This was the music that people were singing in the fields while they were picking.', ""This is the music that masters were being entertained by enslaved people with. Like the initial, we don't talk about the fact that the initial string bands, what we now call bluegrass or old-time music, it was all done by Black people. It didn't become a white medium until minstrelsy. So we've been sold a really great marketing job, and we've believed it."", ""But that's why artists like Ray Charles can do modern sounds in country and western and make it sound the way that he did, and why it sounded so good. Because that music, country music, is also R&B. Country music is also blues. So, yeah, it's all interchangeable, and we've just been sold, just like with everything."", ""It's all in how you market it."", ""CHAKRABARTI: Well, let's take a couple of seconds to listen to two artists. One's actually a group, they are not explicitly mentioned on Cowboy Carter, but they have their place in country music history as well. Because for Martell, became the first Black woman to perform at the Grand Old Opry, as we talked about."", 'The Pointer Sisters became the first Black female vocal group to perform there, as well. The group released a country song called Fairytale in 1974, and in 1975 they won the Grammy for Best Country Group Vocal Performance. So here are the Pointer Sisters performing Fairytale at the Attic in Greenville, North Carolina.', '(FAIRYTALE PERFORMANCE)', ""That's the Pointer Sisters in 1981, and here's another one. Tina Turner. She performed on the chitlin circuit with her then husband, Ike Turner. Of course, they were called the Ike and Tina Turner Review. They did that from about 1960 to 1976. Tina Turner's debut solo album in 1974 was called Tina Turns the Country On!, the first track on that album is called Bayou Song, and it was written for her by Peter-John Morse."", '(BAYOU SONG PLAYS)', ""Incredible voice. Timeless. Alright, so let's move, Rissi and Taylor, if we can, to talking about, you know, the present and future of Black women in country music. And in order to do that, I want to go back to Cowboy Carter. Because the first time I listened through it, I didn't actually know anything about the album."", ""I just came to it with a completely, like new set of ears. And when Blackbird came on, I was really surprised. I was like, wow, Beyoncé is doing a Beatles cover. And at first, I was like, wow, this is also a very sort of honorable, if I can call it, she's honoring the original track pretty closely. But it included all these new voices that I had never heard before."", ""Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts, Tiera Kennedy and Tanner Adell. So let's listen to a little bit about from Beyoncé's version of Blackbird."", '(BLACKBIRD PLAYS)', ""It's Beyoncé's version of Blackbird from Cowboy Carter. Rissi, do you wanna talk about this track a little bit?"", 'PALMER: I mean, I really, I love the symbolism behind it. Originally, Paul McCartney wrote this song about the Little Rock Nine. And just basically about the Black women that were involved in the Civil Rights Movement. And, you know, were being yelled at and eggs thrown at them and things like that.', 'And so for her to choose this song, I think is a very cool nod to the perseverance and resilience of Black women. And all of the women that are featured on this song, we were all shocked when the album came out. You know, Beyoncé does secrecy really, really well.', ""And when it came out, I was on the phone, literally, three o'clock in the morning, talking to another friend of mine. And we're trying to decipher who is this? Wait a minute. That's Brittney. So we were trying to decipher who the women were, because they weren't on the credits yet. Like that's how fresh it was and how secret it was at the time."", ""And I'm so happy for each one of these women, because they're all very diverse artists. They do different individual things. Because as you know, Black women are not among them, but they represent the future. They represent the future of country music. And she picked some really good, some really good ones out of the bunch."", ""And it's been really cool to watch. Each one of them blossom as a result of this opportunity and to see. You know, where they're taking their respective careers."", ""CHAKRABARTI: You know, I will admit to both of you that I could not hold a note to save my life. And, but these voices are absolutely, to my ears, they're perfection. And I wonder, Taylor. Do you, I wonder if you have any thoughts about, like, for people who don't know who these artists, are Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts, Tiera Kennedy and Tanner Adell, what are they missing out on?"", ""CRUMPTON: All of these lovely ladies are not only the future of country music, But I think the future of American music, because the beauty of Cowboy Carter is that it introduced country music to a global audience who did not understand why Beyoncé was receiving so much pushback. And to bring Rissi into the conversation, around the time of Cowboy Carter's release, I remember her, and I were doing radio for BBC."", 'And one of the questions that the British audience had for us is, Why is there this pushback? Why is there this irritation? Why is this this controversy? And for Beyoncé to not only use Cowboy Carter as a Trojan horse to make global audiences aware about the conditions and the reality and the history of Black women in music, but to make these four women feature on the track.', 'Then be ambassadors of country music globally. In my opinion, the last ambassador of country music to a global audience was Taylor Swift. Now in 2025, the ambassadors of country music to a global audience are Black women of different shapes and sizes of variety. And even as Rissi said, they make different variations of country music.', 'That, to me, is really the powerful impact of this album, is that now these women can now tour as Black women country artists across the globe. That this will be some person in Great Britain, or Russia, France. Whoever this album was streamed, because it was streamed worldwide, that when they think of country music, now they will see a Black woman.', 'And I think that, to me, is the beauty and the glory and the splendor. Is that these women now can tour anywhere across the world and sing country music to a global audience and no one will push back or clap back at them, but instead embrace them in and welcome them on the stage.', 'CHAKRABARTI: Now, Rissi, I think Taylor just provided us with a mic drop there.', 'PALMER: (LAUGHS)', ""CHAKRABARTI: So I don't know if there's anything that you wanted to add to that as a last thought for today's show."", ""PALMER: The reality is, and we'll use these five women as an example. You know, right before this happened. Tanner Adell had just been dropped by her record label, and Tiera Kennedy had just been dropped by her record label, and so they have this opportunity now."", 'Yes, they are ambassadors and that sort of thing, but none of them are playing on country radio right now. I think that speaks more to the condition of country radio. And the, again, the Nashville industrial complex and less about their star power. After the Grammys are over next week, what comes of the Black women and Black men in Nashville that are making country music, that are continuing to try to forge ahead and create careers?', ""CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Well, you know what? I think what both of you have said, they work together in concert, if I can use that terrible pun. Because Rissi, you're truthfully describing the real present right now.

Will Beyoncé’s Country Grammy Wins Help Other Black Artists? Here’s What Nashville Execs Say,https://www.billboard.com/pro/beyonce-country-grammy-wins-nashville-executives-react/,"['Beyoncé became the first Black artist to win a Grammy for best country album on Sunday. Could she clear a path for more Black artists in the genre?', 'BY MELINDA NEWMAN', 'B\neyoncé made history Sunday night (Feb. 2) when Cowboy Carter won the Grammy for best country album, making the superstar the first Black artist to win in the category since it was reintroduced in 1995, after a nearly three-decade absence.', 'Earlier in the evening, she also captured the award for best country duo/group performance for “II Most Wanted” with Miley Cyrus, which was the first time a Black lead artist had won that award since The Pointer Sisters in 1975. Bey capped the evening by winning the night’s biggest prize, album of the year, an honor that had previously eluded her during her 25-year career as a member of Destiny’s Child and a solo artist, despite winning more Grammys than anyone in history.', 'Many in the country music community are applauding Beyoncé’s country wins and hope they will help lift up other Black artists in country music today, many of whom have been unable to get a foothold on radio or gain much traction within the genre.', '', 'Beyoncé’s wins for best country album and album of the year are overall wins for country music, says Big Machine Label Group founder/president/CEO Scott Borchetta. “Beyoncé made a brilliant album that was absolutely worthy of album of the year,” he says. “Every event and moment like this is a move forward and continues to widen the aperture and acceptance of what country music is and can be.”', 'Willie “Prophet” Stiggers, co-founder of the Black Music Action Coalition, agrees, telling Billboard: “Cowboy Carter pushed country music’s genre redlining into the public zeitgeist – but as Beyoncé herself has mentioned, Black artists and writers have been pushing against Music Row’s gates for decades. Cowboy Carter is such a powerful body of work that it finally broke some long-held barriers. [Recording Academy CEO] Harvey Mason jr. and the academy also deserve acknowledgement for working intentionally to foster a younger, more diverse voting membership, which helped to bring some of those barriers down. However, it’s important that the industry – and Music Row specifically – understand that this moment, this album, is a beginning, not a destination. … ‘Genre’ is still too often used as coded language for race, and it’s far past time for that to change.”', 'Others see Beyoncé’s win as an isolated victory. “I love that Beyoncé won for best country album and [album of the year] for Cowboy Carter last night at the Grammys, but it’s a win for Beyonce, not necessarily for Black artists in country music,” says Cameo Carlson, CEO of artist development/management services company Mtheory and manager of Black country singer Mickey Guyton, who received three Grammy nominations at the 2022 Grammy Awards but took home none.', '“The fact that Beyonce’s album wasn’t even nominated for other Nashville or country-centric awards, like the CMA Awards, is indicative of the work that still needs to be done in Nashville and in country music,” Carlson continues. “The Grammys are a global award for all intents and purpose; the hardcore country awards — and the large body of people that make up the voting bloc for those awards — did not embrace Beyonce or Cowboy Carter, decrying [the album] as ‘not really country’ or making the excuse that she didn’t ‘play the Nashville game’ by coming and investing time in the country music community or in Nashville.”', 'Beyonce had already rewritten the country rulebook with the album before her Grammy victories. Following its March 29, 2024, release, Cowboy Carter debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart, making her the first Black woman to reach the pinnacle, dating back to the chart’s January 1964 inception. Beyoncé, who took home the award for top country female artist at the 2024 Billboard Music Awards in December, also became the first Black woman to top Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart with “Texas Hold ‘Em,” which stayed at the top for 10 weeks. However, the song peaked at No. 33 on the Country Airplay chart.  ', 'While, as Carlson mentions, there had been much talk about the Grammy-winning Cowboy Carter not receiving a CMA Award nomination for album of the year (or any CMA Award nominations), such an occurrence is hardly rare. There have been more than a dozen records that have won the Grammy for best country album since the Recording Academy brought the category back in 1995 that did not receive a CMA nomination for album of the year, much less a win, including Shania Twain’s The Woman in Me (1996), the then-named Dixie Chicks’ Wide Open Spaces (1999) and Tanya Tucker’s While I’m Living (2020). The Grammy voters tend to nominate a wider variety of albums, often including legends who no longer receive commercial airplay, artists who belong to the broader country genre but aren’t in the mainstream, or artists who don’t necessarily, as Carlson said, “play the game.” (In addition to Cowboy Carter, the only country album to win the all-genre Grammy for album of the year and not receive a CMA nomination is The Chicks’ Taking the Long Way in 2006, which came out after much of the country community disavowed the trio for comments Natalie Maines made about then-President George Bush.)', 'The CMA declined to comment for this story.', 'Scott Stem, manager for Scotty McCreery at Triple 8 Management, doesn’t see the disparity as a bad thing. “I don’t think all the awards have to be the same — one artist can win the Grammy, one artist can win the CMA Award, one artist can win the ACM Award, and one artist can win the American Music Award,” he says. “It only widens the pot if more artists and their work are recognized instead of it being the same artists on each show.”', 'Unlike the CMA and ACM Awards, which draw from primarily the country community and may include industry members not involved in the creative process such as radio executives as voters, the 13,000 Grammy voters come from all genres and must be involved in the creative music-making process. Grammy voters are allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields in addition to the General Field categories, meaning that non-country voters could choose to vote in the country field in order to support Beyoncé. Beyoncé won none of the other Grammys she was nominated for in such genre fields as pop, rap or Americana, possibly indicating that non-country voters were inclined to vote for her in country but not spend their limited votes for her in other areas.', 'Not everyone felt the win was deserved, with some questioning whether the album belonged in the country category at all after Beyoncé herself said in March, “This ain’t a country album, it’s a Beyoncé album.” But there was no denying its homage to country’s Black roots with the inclusion of Black country pioneer Linda Martell and country’s history with the participation of Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, as well as a nod to its future by including rising Black country artists like Shaboozey, Willie Jones, Brittney Spencer and Reyna Roberts.', 'Big & Rich’s John Rich posited in a post on X that her win was a result of Sony Music swaying the vote, instead of merit. “Folks are asking me ‘how do music award shows work?’” Rich wrote. “Labels/publishers all have blocks of votes. They make deals with each other ‘you vote for mine, we’ll vote for yours’ type thing. It has ZERO to do with who made the best music, thus, Beyonce with ‘Country album of the year.’ Nice, right? The same thing is true with the CMA’s, ACM’s, Billboard, etc…all work exactly the same. Last night, the Grammy’s [sic] outed themselves in a big way.” [Editor’s note: The Billboard Music Awards are determined solely by Billboard chart performance, not a voting body.]', 'As the current presidential administration erases diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, many of which came to be following George Floyd’s murder in 2020, some hope Beyoncé’s win will show Nashville that listeners want to hear from more than the white men who dominate country music, especially mainstream country radio.', '“Beyoncé will move on and make another killer Beyoncé record in any genre she wants to, while Black and non-white country artists will continue to struggle to be heard and supported,” Carlson says. “Labels and the country infrastructure need to continue to invest in these artists, need to continue to invest in DEI programs, and support programs like Equal Access that are out here doing the work every day to make sure that Beyoncé is only the first Black artist to win a country album of the year Grammy, but certainly not the last.”', 'Beverly Keel, dean of Middle Tennessee State University’s College of Media and Entertainment, says all eyes will now be on the May 8 ACM Awards, for which first-round voting started Feb. 1 and ends Feb. 18. “I hope Nashville will now fully embrace the project,” Keel says. “This international superstar is taking her wonderful representation of country music around the world, introducing it to people who haven’t listened to the genre before. I hope the next Black female artist doesn’t have to be as successful as Beyoncé to have a big country album. I hope this is the beginning and not an anomaly.”', '—Assistance on this story provided by Jessica Nicholson', '', '', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.
