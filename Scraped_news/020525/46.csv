Beyoncé finally won album of the year. Don't mistake this moment for her peak,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5285281/beyonce-grammys-2025-album-year-cowboy-carter,"['Sidney Madden', 'Beyoncé onstage Sunday night at the 67th Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, where her album Cowboy Carter received historic wins for best country album and album of the year.', 'After years of gagging us, something finally gagged Beyoncé. It all happened so fast: Seconds after the debutante smile she often wears at industry events gave way to genuine shock at hearing her name, Beyoncé was reminded by her eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, to get up and take the stage. As she stood at the podium of the 67th Grammy Awards, the first Black woman to win the award for best country album quickly caught herself up to the reality of the moment. ""I think sometimes \'genre\' is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they\'re passionate about,"" Bey declared. ""And to stay persistent.""', 'It wasn\'t long before the significance of those words doubled over on itself. At the evening\'s end, her 2024 album, Cowboy Carter, which had also won best country duo/group performance for the Miley Cyrus duet ""II MOST WANTED,"" turned Beyoncé into a first-time album of the year winner. The arena, of course, erupted: Bey\'s peers cheered for her victory in the crowded category against albums by André 3000, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx, Jacob Collier, Sabrina Carpenter and Taylor Swift. Beyoncé is now the fourth Black woman in Grammys history, behind Lauryn Hill, Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole, to win the top prize. During her acceptance speech, the Houston native dedicated the award to Linda Martell, the first Black woman to play at the Grand Ole Opry and a featured collaborator on Cowboy Carter. The nod to Martell was a reminder of the album\'s thesis: that there are color lines in music that have attempted to erase Black history, and that she won\'t let that history be erased.', 'Looking back, Bey\'s been working toward her thesis for a while — even longer than she\'s explicitly let on. Cowboy Carter is the fifth album from the 43-year-old\'s discography to be nominated for album of the year, and with each one, she has been uncovering, marinating, molding and refining the creative drive that brought her to this point. There was 2008\'s I Am… Sasha Fierce, the two-disc release that introduced an alter-ego and the first obvious breadcrumbs of her cross-genre aspirations. There was 2013\'s Beyoncé, the surprise album that diverged from the single-driven format and altered the entire music industry in its wake. There was 2016\'s Lemonade, the prophetic concept album that injected the sociopolitical with deeply personal pain and hopscotched between R&B, rock, blues and gospel. (It was the country track off this album, ""Daddy Lessons,"" performed at another award show that shunned her, that would later become Cowboy Carter\'s origin story.) Then, there was 2022\'s Renaissance, the post-pandemic disco and house party that reclaimed dance-floor joy and paid tribute to Black queer pioneers of the genres. With each album, she\'s dug deeper into her familial well, refreshed herself with new splashes of artistic weirdness and emerged more cleansed in the knowledge and spirit of her vision. If the Recording Academy\'s problem was failing to see that vision as essential, Cowboy Carter made it blisteringly clear.', 'The shockwaves of her snubs have compounded over the years, to the point of creating a lore around her relationship with the award. Time and again, we have watched her watching the stage, while the artists she motivates — ""You are our light,"" as Adele put it in 2017 through uneasy tears — accepted the honor. Cultural critics and the singer\'s fan legion, the BeyHive, have debated whether she should boycott the Grammys altogether in response. She referenced the narrative herself on Cowboy Carter\'s ""SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN,"" framing the slight as powerless to stop her artistry and hustle: ""A-O-T-Y, I ain\'t win / I ain\'t stuntin\' \'bout them / Take that s** on the chin / Come back and f*** up the pen.""', 'Still, the story of Beyoncé at the Grammys has been a perennial lightning rod for conversations about the institution\'s fraught relationship with Black music in general. Last year, as he accepted the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, Jay-Z chided the Academy onstage for failing to recognize Black artists, using his wife\'s omission from AOTY status as a prime example. During Sunday night\'s ceremony, there was at least one moment where the institution spoke back: Harvey Mason Jr., the CEO of The Recording Academy, made an appearance to welcome back another Black artist, The Weeknd, who had previously boycotted the awards in part because his music was not nominated. Though Mason distilled the Canadian musician\'s grievance to ""a lack of transparency,"" a tidy turn of PR speak, The Weeknd\'s broader appeal pointed clearly to the show\'s routine of marginalizing artists along race and gender lines. ""Over the past few years, we\'ve listened, we\'ve acted and we\'ve changed,"" the executive said, referencing a diversified voting pool and new initiatives like the Black Music Collective, Women in the Mix and Academy Proud.', ""While it's not clear what Beyoncé's big night means for the Grammys going forward, I have some guesses about the role it will play in her own mythology. Adding this year's wins to the tally, Bey holds the title of the most-awarded artist in Grammys history, with 35 awards. Trophies aside, she has been setting the standard for creating culture-shifting moments in music and pop culture for years now. Her influence, artistry and power have been certified. But when we look back on her career from this point on, many will label Cowboy Carter her magnum opus because of this win. Thirty years from now, in the inevitable biopics and documentary series about her life and work, this night will be immortalized as the moment of climax. Like Toni Morrison's 1993 Nobel Prize or Martin Scorsese's best picture win in 2007, this will be positioned as the long-overdue lifetime achievement, the institutional breakthrough of all breakthroughs."", 'The real gag is this: The scenes chosen as climactic by those who write history are often slightly ahistorical, slightly askew, blinded by the light of a superlative. So don\'t confuse this moment with Beyoncé\'s apex. Don\'t forget everything else it took to get her to album of the year — and don\'t forget the shaky history of the Grammys, the pricklier cultural story entwined with hers. Cowboy Carter is part two of a three-part suite rooted in the history and legitimacy of Black-birthed music genres. The superstar will head out on tour this year, after which she\'s expected to deliver the closing chapter, for now known by fans as ""Act III."" When she does, don\'t be surprised if the institutions tasked with recognizing and celebrating music are still getting their act together.', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor']"

The 67th annual Grammy Awards are descending on the Crypto.com arena in beautiful downtown Los Angeles, weeks after the devastating wildfires that killed 29 people and burned down thousands of homes, making this a somber celebration. Grammy officials announced that the purpose of this year’s show wasn’t simply to award miniature record players to music’s biggest stars, hoping to raise “additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honor the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.” There is also a massive protest against President Trump’s immigration policy currently blocking Grammy traffic. But, while a “renewed sense of purpose” has charged the Recording Academy and world events have made award shows seem silly and insignificant, tonight remains about watching a select few nominees transform into Grammy Award winners.', 'Tonight, we’ll continue monitoring the escalating war of the pop girlies as Billie Eilish, Chappel Roan, Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Charlie XCX, and Beyoncé square off in numerous categories, including Album and Record of the Year. It was also a big year for country crossovers, with Bey leading a posse of Grammy nominees, including Shaboozey, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, and Post Malone, throwing their hats in the ring.

The only thing about her outfit was that there pretty much was no outfit.\n\nThe 30-year-old model ditched her undergarments altogether while revealing a completely see-through dress beside her husband and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West\n\nAfter their “attempt to replicate the album cover” of Ye’s 2024 Vultures 1 album that featured Censori, the couple were immediately ushered out by cops, a source claimed to Page Six.\n\nAnother source claimed to the outlet that they left of their own free will. “He walked the red carpet and then got in his car and left,” the source claimed.', 'Image credits: Recording Academy / GRAMMYs', 'Chappell Roan used her big moment on the Grammy Awards stage to say she has been “betrayed by the system.”\n\n“I told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially developing artists.”\n\nThe ""Good Luck, Babe"" singer spoke about being signed as a minor, only to be dropped and left struggling during the pandemic without any job experience or the means to afford insurance.\n\nCalling the experience “devastating,” she said she felt “betrayed” by the system and felt like she gave her all to her label but didn’t get the same treatment in return.\n\n“Labels, we got you, but do you got us?” she asked before exiting the stage.', 'Image credits: Recording Academy / GRAMMYs', 'Taylor Swift made space (literally) for actress Cynthia Erivo during the 2025 Grammy Awards.\n\nIn one viral clip online, Erivo was captured walking through the venue unable to find her seat as host Trevor Noah began his monologue. The Lover singer, with zero hesitation, called Erivo to her seat so they could share the chair.\n\nAnother clip captured the hitmaker grabbing Erivo’s finger, which seemed to netizens like she was recreating the viral “holding space” moment the Wicked actress shared with her costar Ariana Grande.\n\nThe “holding space” meme refers to the viral interview in which Grande solemnly held Erivo’s finger while the latter was having an emotional moment mid-conversation.', 'Image credits: CBS', ""Onlookers may have had to stifle their laughter when Jaden Smith made his entry into the 2025 Grammy Awards show.\n\nThe 26-year-old appeared to be the literal representation of “living in his own head” as he walked around the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles with a giant castle on his head. Unsurprisingly, Will Smith's son went on to be brutally roasted online.\n\n“Looks like a Halloween outfit for a 5 year old,” one said about it, while another said, “Whoever told him this was a good idea doesn’t like him.”\n\n“Feel bad for whoever is seated behind him,” another joked. \n\n“Knowing Jaden Smith somebody prolly told him he’s living in his own head so he said bet,” read another comment.\n\nThe Karate Kid star’s black suit carried a Louis Vuitton label while the “Vampire Castle” headpiece was a creation by ABODI.\n\n“Jaden Smith wore ABODI's iconic ‘Vampire Castle’ sculptural headpiece.

But right in the middle of the conversation, one of the reporters called out to Chappell Roan.\n\n“You guys wanna take that? Go do that then,” Babyface told the reporters ever so politely.\n\nThe reporters quickly said sorry as Babyface handed the mic over and walked away, creating the space for Chappell Roan.\n\nLater, the reporters were forced to properly apologize for the moment.\n\n“I’m really sorry about interrupting Babyface earlier,” Krysta Fauria said. “Chappell Roan had come up and there was a lot of commotion as there is on these carpets. But I’m a big Babyface fan, as are we all. And I just wanted to say that I really apologize.”', 'Image credits: Associated Press', ""Trevor Noah, who has been hosting the biggest night in music for five consecutive years, angered some viewers with his opening monologue.\n\nWhile introducing Shakira, the 40-year-old comedian said the singer was “the greatest thing to come out of Colombia that isn't a Class A felony.”\n\nThe comment sparked outrage online, with one saying: “We, the Colombians, are sick of being treated like criminals. We are waiting for an apology.”\n\n“I'm Venezuelan and that didn't sit right with me either,” another said. “These damn ‘jokes’ about Latin American countries are obnoxious.”\n\nNoah’s opening monologue also included another comment about “illegal immigrants,” where he said: “[W]e are honoring the best in music as voted on by the 13,000 members of The Recording Academy - and 20 million illegal immigrants.”\n\n“Trevor Noah already with an illegal immigrants joke and a Colombia joke in his opening monologue... This is going to be a LONGGGG night,” said one exasperated viewer."", 'Image credits: CBS', 'It was raining underwear onstage as Charli XCX gave a wild performance during the 2025 Grammys, but unfortunately, viewers reportedly couldn’t see the whole performance unfold.\n\nThe show apparently cut to a commercial break while the stage lights were still flashing and audience members were seen dancing to her performance of “Von Dutch” and “Guess.”', 'Image credits: Recording Academy/GRAMMYs', 'It would seem The Weeknd no longer has beef with the Grammys.\n\nFour years back, the artist said he was boycotting the awards show after his After Hours album received zero nominations in 2021. He said at the time that he would “no longer allow” his label to submit his music to the Grammys “because of the secret committees.”\n\nHis strong words and four years of absence during the last four Grammys made his appearance on stage this year an absolute surprise to fans.\n\nDuring the 67th Annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night, Grammys chief Harvey Mason Jr. said they “listened” to the “Blinding Lights” singer before welcoming him on. \n\n“I heard [the Weeknd] and I felt his conviction,” Mason Jr. continued. “What we all want is an organization dedicated to the well-being of all music makers, and one that reflects the entire music community, for now, and for future generations. So over the past few years, we’ve listened. We’ve acted. And, we’ve changed.”\n\nAfter Mason Jr.’s introduction, The Weeknd gave a surprise performance of his two songs, ""Timeless"" and ""Cry for Me,"" from his recent sixth studio album Hurry Up Tomorrow.', 'Image credits: THR/Recording Academy', ""As reported by Bored Panda, marking his first appearance at the awards show since his infamous “slap” at the 2025 Grammy Awards, the 56-year-old actor attended the ceremony and presented a tribute to the late producer Quincy Jones.\n\nNot all viewers were happy about his appearance, with one saying: “Not Will Smith being BANNED from the Oscars but at the #Grammys as a presenter,” another wrote.\n\n“I see they’re giving Will Smith all the screen time at the #GRAMMYs since he’s still banned from the Oscars for another 8ish years,” another said.\n\n“How is Will Smith at the #Grammys2025?” one asked “He shouldn't be allowed at ANY awards show ever again!”"", 'Image credits: Recording Academy / GRAMMYs', '“Great answer,” the internet called Clairo’s response to a red carpet interview question about Brooklyn’s bisexual men.\n\nThe interviewer asked her if she had anything to say to the “bisexual men of Brooklyn” who think she makes music for them.\n\nA long “Ummmmmm…” was all that Clairo could offer, to which the interviewer responded saying, “Exactly.”\n\n“How is she even supposed to react to that?” asked one netizen.\n\n“Can we get actual interviewers that ask actual questions please?” another asked.', 'Image credits: ELLE', 'During Sunday’s awards show, Beyoncé became the first Black woman to win a Grammy for a country music song since the Pointer Sisters won in a similar category in 1975.\n\nFollowing the music history-making moment, the internet rubbed their hands together and stirred some drama up by criticizing fellow category nominees Lainey Wilson and Kacey Musgraves for their “unimpressed” reactions.\n\n“The facial expressions of Lainey Wilson and Kacey Musgraves when Beyoncé won Country Album of The Year,” said one observer. \n\n“Kacey Musgraves is MAAAAAAD,” quipped another.\n\n“Kacey Musgraves…FIX your FACE,” another suggested.', 'Image credits: Recording Academy / GRAMMYs', 'Benson Boone took to the 2025 Grammys stage to give a stellar performance of his hit song ""Beautiful Things.""\n\nDressed in a fitting, bedazzled blue jumpsuit, the singer also sent the internet into a frenzy as he was seemingly caught grabbing his package onstage.\n\n“Why’d he grab his lil Boone like that,” a social media user asked following the strange moment.\n\n“Why do men fix that crotch in any situation no matter who around and watching,” asked another.\n\nMaybe “He is not comfortable,” one speculated.', 'Image credits: THR/Recording Academy', 'Advertisement', 'Advertisement']"

What’s unusual are the circumstances this evening,” Noah said. “Just a few weeks ago, we weren’t sure tonight’s show would even happen. This city has just been through one of the biggest natural disasters in American history.”', 'With several wildfires — including the Palisades and Eaton Fire — now 100 percent contained, Noah explained why the city of Los Angeles also deserves to be celebrated.', '“In the darkest of times, the best of humanity shines through, and the people of Los Angeles right now are the perfect example of that,” he said. “Tonight we decided we’re not just going to be celebrating our favorite music. We’re also celebrating the city that brought us so much of that music.”', 'Us Weekly kept track of all the best and worst moments on the red carpet and in the show (check out the full winners list here). Keep reading to see all the jaw-dropping memories that will have everyone talking:', 'Throughout the broadcast, the Grammys and CBS took steps to honor those affected by the wildfires in Los Angeles. In addition to inviting first responders, highlighting local businesses in commercials and raising funds for victims throughout the show, the Grammys also opened up the event with a special rendition of Randy Newman’s 1983 song “I Love L.A.”', 'Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard, Brad Paisley, John Legend and St. Vincent joined Dawes for the star-studded performance. Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith, who make up Dawes, both lost their homes in the wildfires and have since been involved in relief efforts.', 'Later on in the show, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars came together for a rendition of The Mamas & the Papas’ “California Dreamin’.”', 'For the record: Shakira, Chappell Roan, Janelle Monáe, Charli XCX and more artists brought the house down with their performances. Witnessing Carpenter’s dream of performing at the show come true, however, was extra special. While taking the stage, the singer performed a medley of “Espresso” and “Please Please Please.” While she started her set in a bedazzled suit, she quickly changed into a powder blue leotard for a theatrical, cabaret-inspired performance.', 'Moments after her impressive set, Carpenter won Best Pop Vocal Album for Short & Sweet.', 'After becoming the third woman to win the Grammy for Best Rap Album, the Alligator Bites Never Heal artist couldn’t hold back tears when she received the award from Cardi B, who previously won the honor in 2019. (Lauryn Hill was the first woman to win in the category in 1997 when she triumphed as part of the Fugees.)', '“I know there’s some Black girl — so many Black women — watching me right now. And I wanna tell you, you can do it,” she said through tears. “Anything is possible. Don’t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you.”', 'While accepting the award for Best New Artist, Roan called for music labels to give new artists a liveable wage and healthcare.', '“I told myself if I ever won a Grammy and I got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off artists would offer a liveable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists,” she said. “Labels we got you, but do you got us?”', 'After winning Record of the Year and Song of the Year for “Not Like Us,” his diss track against Drake, the Super Bowl 2025 halftime show performer dedicated his trophy to the communities of Los Angeles.', '“Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood, out to the Valley, Pacoima, IE, San Bernardino, all that,” he said. “This is my neck of the woods that held me down since I was in the studio scrapping to write the best raps and all that, in order to do records like these. I can’t give enough thanks to these places that I rolled around since high school. And most importantly, the people and the families out in the Palisades and Altadena. This is a true testament that we can continue to restore this city. We gonna keep rocking.”', 'To make the night even more special, Lamar experienced the whole crowd shouting out the line “A minor” as his Grammy-winning song played in the stadium.', 'Swift had the honor of presenting the award for Best Country Album. As soon as Beyoncé’s name was called as the winner for last year’s Cowboy Carter, nobody was more surprised than the Queen Bey herself. Her reaction quickly went viral on social media after she delivered a heartfelt acceptance speech in front of husband Jay-Z, daughter Blue Ivy and thousands of attendees.', '“I really was not expecting this. Wow!” Beyoncé said after making history as the first Black woman to win in the category. “I think sometimes genre is a code word to keep us in our place as artists and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about and to stay persistent.”', 'In a viral video posted to X during the show, Erivo was spotted wandering through the venue looking for her seat. Fortunately, she caught the eye of Swift, who waved her over to her table.', 'Once Erivo was seated on the chair next to Swift, the pair shared a laugh as they enjoyed Noah’s opening monologue.', 'Sometimes, they truly save the best for last. Los Angeles firefighters had the honor to present Beyoncé with her very first Album of the Year trophy thanks to Cowboy Carter.', '“I just feel very full and very honored,” Beyoncé said during her acceptance speech. “It’s been many, many years, and I just want to thank the Grammys and every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer — all of the hard work. … I just hope we keep pushing forward and opening doors.”', 'As West celebrated his nomination for Best Rap Song thanks to his “Carnival” collaboration with ¥$, Ty Dolla $ign, Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti, his wife quickly grabbed the attention of photographers when she took off her fur coat to reveal a completely sheer dress. (Censori wasn’t the only star going semi-naked on the red carpet, of course.)', 'A source later confirmed to Us Weekly that West and Censori departed “on their own accord” right after posing for photos. “They just got in their car and left,” the insider added.', 'According to multiple reports, the pair attempted to replicate the cover of West’s Vultures album.', 'While the red carpet can get a bit stressful and chaotic — especially during awards shows — fans were not impressed with how two reporters handled their interview with Babyface. As the 12-time Grammy winner was answering a question mid-sentence, Babyface was cut off as one red carpet reporter noticed Roan in the background.', '“You guys want to do that?” he asked before walking away. “Go do that.”', 'Although Grande likely has a perfectly good reason why she didn’t attend Sunday’s show, fans were hoping to celebrate her multiple nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Album thanks to Eternal Sunshine.', 'The singer, however, hasn’t been the biggest fan of the Grammys. In 2019, she criticized a Grammys producer who claimed she pulled out of the show because she couldn’t organize her performance in time. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” she later wrote via X. “I can pull together a performance overnight and you know that.”', 'Yes, we know it can’t be easy celebrating a whole year of music in just one awards show. But it’s hard for viewers to commit to more than 210 minutes of nonstop television — and stay up past 11:30 p.m. on a Sunday if you’re on the East Coast. While we’re not advocating for winners to have their speeches wrapped in record time, we can’t help but wonder if there’s a way to make the show just a little shorter.', 'Although Charli XCX was the final star to perform during the very long awards show, fans wish they could have witnessed the singer accept any of her three wins: Best Dance Pop Recording for “Von Dutch,” Best Dance/Electronic Album for Brat and Best Recording Package for Brat.

So even by your own metrics, that doesn\'t work.""', ""Beyoncé's latest record, Cowboy Carter, is a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. It's the sort of thing that delights Grammy voters, who traditionally prefer albums that elevate America's musical history over contemporary, cutting-edge productions."", ""But the album's excessive length - including a few weaker tracks in its latter half - could count against it."", ""Billie Eilish is currently the bookmakers' favourite with her third album Hit Me Hard and Soft. Mixing passionate power ballads with violent electronic shifts and hip-hop swagger, it marks a new evolution in the star's songwriting partnership with her brother, Finneas."", ""Charli XCX's Brat is a career-defining pop record that became a cultural phenomenon. The best-reviewed album of 2024, it's probably too abrasive for the Grammys' more conservative voters, but that's their loss."", ""And you'd have to be crazy to ignore Taylor Swift. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, was the biggest-seller of last year; a fact that will undoubtedly be taken into account, even if the record is one of her weaker efforts."", 'If she wins, Swift will collect her fifth album of the year trophy - more than any other artist in Grammy history.', 'One of the year\'s most stacked categories is record of the year - better understood as ""best single"".', ""Aside from a rogue nomination for The Beatles (see below), the shortlist reflects a stellar year for pop music, with Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso and Charli XCX's 360 up against Beyoncé's Texas Hold 'Em and Billie Eilish's Birds Of A Feather."", ""But the front-runner is Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. A furious take-down of his rap nemesis, Drake, it's as catchy as it is legally contentious. If it wins, it would be only the second hip-hop single to win the category, following Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019."", ""In the parallel song of the year prize - which recognises achievement in songwriting - the smart money is on Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With A Smile."", 'Both artists are perennial Grammy favourites, and their virtuoso ballad will be catnip to voters.', ""Their competition includes Shaboozey's A Bar Song (Tipsy), which was America's longest-running number one single of 2024. However, the fact that it's based on a previous hit (J-Kwon's Tipsy) is likely to count against it."", ""Chappell Roan's breakout single Good Luck Babe is another strong contender, notable for its soaring high notes and a piercing lyric that skewers internalised homophobia. Billie Eilish's gossamer ballad Birds of a Feather is a similar masterclass in songcraft - making this category one of the hardest to predict."", 'By contrast, the coveted best new artist prize is pretty much a two-way split between Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, both of whom established a dominant chart presence in 2024 after years on the pop sidelines.', ""That's bad news for the sole British nominee, six-time Brit Award winner Raye. But at least she's in good company, alongside breakout rap star Doechii and big-hearted pop singer Teddy Swims."", ""Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter has 11 nominations, potentially making it the most-rewarded album in Grammy history."", ""The record is currently held by Santana, who got nine trophies for his album Supernatural in 2000 (coincidentally, the same year that Beyoncé received her first Grammy nomination, as part of Destiny's Child)."", ""And if Cowboy Carter doesn't take home best album, Beyoncé still breaks a record, for the most nominations in that category without a win."", 'Billie Eilish could become the first female artist to win Record of the Year three times with Birds of a Feather. Paul Simon and Bruno Mars are the only other artist with three wins in the category.', ""Rapper turned flautist André 3000 is also poised to make history. If he wins best instrumental composition, he does so with the longest song title in Grammy history: I Swear, I Really Wanted To Make A 'Rap' Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time."", 'The current record holders, in case you were wondering, are Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips. In 2007, they won best rock instrumental performance for the magnificently-titled The Wizard Turns on the Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts On His Werewolf Moccasins.', '', 'More than 13,000 members of the Recording Academy vote for the Grammys every year - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write CD liner notes.', 'To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (£120). All former winners are also eligible to vote.', 'Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.', 'Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night.

The winners are not revealed until the ceremony.', ""The Beatles might have broken up 55 years ago, but they're up for two prizes on Sunday: record of the year and best rock performance."", 'Both nominations recognise Now and Then, a song that John Lennon demoed in the 1970s, and which was finally completed by his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr last year.', ""Grammy voters, with their eyes firmly trained on the past, rarely miss an opportunity to reward the Beatles. Eight years ago, for example, the band's documentary Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years beat Beyoncé's groundbreaking Lemonade for best music film."", ""In some ways, that's correcting an historic wrong. In their prime, the Beatles were nominated for record of the year four times - for I Want to Hold Your Hand, Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be - but lost every time."", ""A win in 2025 would prove that Beatlemania never fades - but voters may be put off by The Beatles' use of machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence), which was used to clean up Lennon's scratchy old cassette recordings."", 'The Recording Academy\'s rules on AI say that ""only human creators"" can win Grammys, and that ""the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful"".', ""That's true in the case of Now And Then, but many creators remain sceptical of the technology."", 'Quite a lot.', 'All the hoopla surrounding the Grammys has gone.

A big win can boost album sales and bump you up festival bills.', 'That said, the awards themselves are notoriously ridiculous.

Despite some speculation as to whether the show should go on after the devastating wildfires, host Trevor Noah set the tone early on in the evening: it was going to be a celebratory night but with a purpose. The A-list stars came ready to heed the call.', ""Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga were among the biggest names mingling inside Crypto.com Arena to celebrate what felt like music's best year in a long time. That meant the Big Four categories were a crowded field."", ""Was Swift upset that she went zero for six? How did the crowd react to Beyoncé's Album of the Year win? Did Kanye West and wife Bianca Censori really get kicked out after she showed up nearly naked? Yahoo Entertainment was inside for the almost four-hour show — here were some of the biggest moments you didn’t see on TV."", 'We all know that Swift is one to get up for an awards show — literally. The Grammy nominee is a fixture at ceremonies, dancing in the crowd, but she truly outdid herself with this one. (And we mean that in the best way.)', '', '', 'It was obvious early on that Swift was there to have fun, no matter how the trophy situation shook out. She was first on her feet when Billie Eilish performed ""Birds of a Feather."" She had her arms all over the place — and was playfully flipping around Margaret Qualley\'s dress — when Sabrina Carpenter performed a medley of ""Espresso"" and ""Please Please Please."" (Swift especially seemed to like her former tour opener’s tap-dance moment.)', 'Swift kept that same energy throughout the show, even in the categories she lost. When Kendrick Lamar took home Song of the Year and Record of the Year for the Drake diss-track ""Not Like Us,"" Swift was among the first stars celebrating. She was also among the more than 10,000 people in the crowd to sing along to Lamar\'s infamous ""trying to strike a chord and it\'s probably A minor"" line.', 'At the night\'s end, Swift was dancing with a champagne bottle in one hand and a glass in another during Charli XCX\'s show-ending performance of ""Von Dutch"" and ""Guess."" Despite having the year\'s bestselling album, Swift didn\'t walk away with a Grammy award on Sunday night. She didn\'t seem to be bothered about it, either.', 'Similar to 2024’s ceremony, Queen Bey wasn\'t sitting in the starry audience at Crypto.com Arena like the rest of us at 5 p.m. PT. She actually made her way through the crowd with daughter Blue Ivy during Chappell Roan\'s stellar performance of ""Pink Pony Club,"" about an hour into the show.', ""Famous heads swiveled, wanting to catch Beyoncé's arrival but also honor Roan, who had the entire crowd rocking. It's a good thing Beyoncé got there when she did because she picked up her first televised (and record-breaking) Grammy award for Best Country Album for Cowboy Carter. After Beyoncé won, she pulled a similar move and opted to hang away from prying eyes backstage until she returned to the crowd near the end of the evening ahead of the tribute to Quincy Jones."", ""Everyone was talking about their red carpet moment. After Ye's wife effectively went nude on the red carpet, rumors swirled the couple were escorted from the scene as they were never actually invited to music's biggest night. That rumor was amplified when they weren't spotted with other stars on the floor in the VIP section."", ""A well-placed sourced told Yahoo Entertainment the two were very much invited as the musician was nominated ... they just didn't want to go to the show. After the red carpet stunt, the couple got in their car and left."", 'More than once, the Grammys announcer during commercial breaks had to corral the famous crowd. Before the insane Best New Artists Medley, he repeatedly asked stars to ""sit in your seats"" and ""look toward the screen."" After the performances, a lot of people wanted to mingle again. ""We really need you to take a seat [we\'re] giving out Best New Artist,"" he said, sounding like Oz.', 'Beyoncé looked like she was enjoying the show, but one artist in particular really got her going: Shakira. The singer, who won Best Latin Pop Album, gave a sultry performance of ""Ojos Asi"" and ""Sessions."" For once, Beyoncé beat Swift in getting on her feet to cheer.', ""That's not to say Swift didn't have her own moment with the superstar. The two met and hugged during a commercial break."", 'Nothing got as big of a reaction from the crowd as when Cowboy Carter was announced the Album of the Year. The place exploded as Beyoncé has notoriously been shut out of winning the Grammys top prize year after year. Her fellow nominees — Swift, Roan, Carpenter — and everyone else in the room were on their feet cheering on the superstar. People were heard yelling all over the place.', '""YESSSSS!""', '""FINALLYYYYYYY!""', '""SHE DESERVES THIS!""', 'Before that, Lamar was among those who got the most cheers when his name was first called. The Best New Artists medley was another big crowd-pleaser.', 'When Beyoncé made her way back to her table ahead of the Jones tribute, she was happy to cuddle up with husband Jay-Z. He pulled out her chair for her when she sat down, and she leaned in to hug her husband.', 'Over the past several months, there have been plenty of headlines about these two, mostly because of how Jay-Z was dragged into one of the Sean ""Diddy"" Combs lawsuits. But don\'t let X theories fool you. These two seemed as ""Crazy in Love"" as ever.', 'Speaking of Diddy, the Grammys were the first major awards show since Combs was arrested for sex trafficking in September. He remains behind bars ahead of his May 2025 trial. There were no Diddy jokes like at the Golden Globes, but one protest group wanted to remind attendees of the entrepreneur\'s alleged crimes upon entering the Grammys. A small group of protesters positioned themselves near the drop-off area and shouted anyone who attended Combs\'s parties was ""going to hell.""']"
Every 2025 Grammy Performance Ranked,https://www.billboard.com/lists/2025-grammy-performance-ranked/,"[""Here's who hit the stage and highlighted Music's Biggest Night."", 'By Jason Lipshutz', '', 'The major headlines of the 67th annual Grammy Awards will naturally involve the major award wins: Beyoncé at long last winning the album of the year trophy, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” triumphing in both record and song of the year to give the superstar rapper his first Big Four category wins, Chappell Roan capping off a meteoric rise with a best new artist trophy. When we look back at these Grammys, those victories will loom large — but they’re not the whole story.', 'In fact, the 2025 Grammys included arguably the most consistent performance slate in recent memory, a collection of new artists, fast-rising superstars, industry veterans and timeless legends that all brought their A-games and kept the telecast humming along at a surprisingly brisk pace. The Grammys approached a four-hour run-time, but with artists like Benson Boone backflipping around the stage, Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder catching up in public, Sabrina Carpenter tossing out smash hits, and Charli XCX turning Crypto.com Arena into Los Angeles’ coolest club, the show never dragged, and often upended expectations.', 'Plugged-in pop fans got to see their favorite artists dominate the stage, while casual listeners were exposed to voices that have the power to truly excite. And while past years carried performance lineups that were too homogenous, the 2025 slate covered a wide scope of popular music, including a few surprise performers.', 'While every showcase at the 2025 Grammys was worthwhile, here is our ranking of the best of the best — all 16 performances, ranked.', 'After a handful of pop-spectacle performances, psych-rock trio Khruangbin made the most of their very short spotlight to kick off the best new artist medley, delivering a speedy rendition of their shaggy track “May Ninth.” The trio sounded nimble and game — not their fault that they only had a few seconds to appeal to primetime viewers, but the truncated performance unfortunately didn’t shed enough light on their aesthetic.', 'The “In Memoriam” segment of an awards ceremony typically calls for a current artist performing a mournful standard, but Coldplay frontman Chris Martin instead opted for his stadium band’s own recent song, the Moon Music track “All My Love.” With a small band supporting him, Martin delivered a muted take on a heartfelt song, soundtracking plenty of lump-in-throat images (none more emotional than the opening clips of One Direction’s Liam Payne).', 'During the cold open of the Grammys ceremony, host Trevor Noah told viewers around the world that, just a few weeks ago, no one was sure that the awards show would even happen, thanks to the wildfires that caused incalculable loss across Los Angeles. “And despite all the devastation,” Noah said, “the spirit of the city has emerged.” The 67th annual Grammy Awards would be celebrating not just the best music of the year, but the city that has been the ceremony’s longtime host city.', 'With that, an all-star collection of artists came together to kick off the ceremony, with folk-rock band Dawes (whose members suffered devastating losses in the wildfires) leading the supergroup through a jaunty rendition of Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.,” as clips of firefighters and first responders played on the screens behind them. Instead of commemorating the city’s hellish past month with a sorrowful tribute, the performance kept the occasion upbeat — and while Dawes effectively led the sing-along, one wishes the other members of the performance had their respective presences highlighted a bit more, other than exclaiming “We love it!” on cue.', 'In the middle of a best new artist medley that featured several crowded stages, Teddy Swims opted to stick to the basics — just keys and guitar behind him, a violinist to his right, and “Lose Control,” the biggest Hot 100 hit of 2024, front and center. Wearing a long white coat with huge red roses stitched in, and with close-up shots focusing on his tatted face, Teddy Swims allowed his voice to shine on a stage in the middle of the crowd, many members of which were swaying along with his ubiquitous hit.', 'Arriving with a spotlight shining bright behind him, Shaboozey launched into a few seconds of recent single “Good News” — but the entire arena understood that he had to perform the smash that helped him set Hot 100 history. Months into its chart run, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” remains a giddy delight to hear in a communal setting, and Shaboozey was grinning from ear to ear as he lightly two-stepped to his twist on country, while his backup dancers dipped their cowboy hats in time. At one point, he raised his hand to feel the crowd singing along to one of the biggest hits in recent memory — a young, talented artist who was relatively unknown this time a year ago, now getting to live out his dream.', 'In a truly unexpected appearance, The Weeknd graced the Grammys stage following Recording Academy head Harvey Mason jr.’s extended address of the positive changes that the Grammys have made in recent years, in light of Abel Tesfaye’s public boycott of the ceremony. The timing was perfect — The Weeknd’s just-released album Hurry Up Tomorrow was able to receive a primetime showcase, with “Cry for Me” segueing into a Playboi Carti-assisted performance of their shared hit “Timeless” as dancers spookily writhed between them — but more than an effective promotional strategy, The Weeknd’s performance signaled an overdue, and meaningful, return of one of pop’s biggest names to music’s biggest night. It’s good to have him back in the mix.', 'If you’re a U.S. music fan and only knew Raye through her breakthrough hit “Escapism,” chances are the British singer-songwriter’s powerhouse tone made quite the impression on the Grammys stage, as she closed out the best new artist medley with a full-band take on her song “Oscar Winning Tears.” Wearing a black sequined floor-length gown, Raye epitomized elegance as the string section heightened the drama of her melisma; even though she didn’t win best new artist, she made her presence felt in front of a much wider viewership.', 'Sometimes, a hit is big enough that you get invited to perform it at the Grammys, start singing it a few feet from Jennifer Lopez in the arena crowd, and get Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser to dramatically tear off your outfit to reveal a powder blue jumpsuit. Such was the case with Benson Boone, who has been ruling stages with his mega-hit “Beautiful Things” for a year, and whose Grammys performance was fittingly rousing even before the backflips started. Boone contains plenty of charisma as a performer, and he’ll likely use “Beautiful Things” as a springboard to a long run as a live act.', 'The pair of superstars currently resides atop the Billboard Hot 100 — but instead of playing “Die With a Smile” at the Grammys, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars continued the night-long homage to the city of Los Angeles by lending their pristine pipes to the Mamas & the Papas’ “California Dreamin’.” The move was the definition of class: by shrugging off self-promo for a cause more significant than their hit single, Gaga and Mars got to simultaneously posit themselves as thoughtful industry leaders, and have a ball duetting on a classic.', 'During an evening full of bright new talent, the image of Herbie Hancock playing a grand piano while Stevie Wonder sat alongside him and slowly lifted a harmonica to his lips represented a necessary tether to the Grammys’ past, a pair of icons wordlessly owning the stage. The collaboration was part of an extended tribute to the legendary Quincy Jones (who passed away in November), which also included Cynthia Erivo effortlessly belting out “Fly Me to the Moon” while accompanied by Hancock, as well as Jacob Collier stomping along with Lainey Wilson as they put a country twist on “Let the Good Times Roll.”', 'The tribute hit a bit of a lull as Wonder honored Jones with “We Are the World” and Will Smith told an extended story about the advice Jones gave him as a young actor, but the energy ratcheted back up when the segment reached its conclusion: Janelle Monáe embodying MJ for a riotous take on “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough.” The multi-hyphenate star nailed the dance moves, paraded through the crowd and sported a “I <3 Q J” t-shirt, punctuating the salute to an industry giant with undeniable vigor.', '“I had to find a way to put myself back together,” Shakira declared during a video testimonial that introduced her Grammys performance, her winding personal and professional life leading back to this coveted stage for the first time in over a decade. Shakira is no stranger to humongous pop moments after playing stadiums around the world as well as a Super Bowl halftime show, but her Grammys performance made for a nifty change-up: she began in the middle of the arena floor with an intimate understanding of the camera during “Ojos Asi,” then snaked toward the stage to join her dancers for an exuberant “Bzrp Music Sessions Vol. 53.” Even after arriving onstage, Shakira’s energy was looser than expected — instead of looking for pinpoint accuracy, she treated the Grammys set as a playful exercise, which ultimately made for a more satisfying viewing.', 'Billie Eilish always approaches her stage show with thoughtful visuals, and for her showcase of her nominated smash “Birds of a Feather,” the pop superstar continued the ceremony’s tribute to Los Angeles, playing alongside her brother Finneas and her backing band on transported hiking terrain that re-created San Gabriel Mountains and Eaton Canyon in Altadena. The sky moved behind her on the video screen, the trees swayed, and images flashes of the siblings’ shared childhood in the City of Angels, before Eilish concluded with an emphatic “I love you, L.A.” The result was a subtle yet genuinely touching tip of the Dodgers cap to the city that made Eilish who she is, as well as a gorgeous rendition of a months-long hit.', 'Arriving onstage covered in sparkles and oozing confidence, Sabrina Carpenter harkened back to soft-shoe showbiz before fumbling her cane with a wink, ditching the pseudo suit-and-tie and presenting “Espresso” as a big-band show-stopper, complete with a tap-dance breakdown. She then switched to a dreamy version of “Please Please Please” while surrounded by tuxedo-clad dancers before toggling back to the final chorus of “Espresso,” finishing with pyrotechnics exploding atop a towering staircase and fists proudly on hips.', 'Capping off a breakthrough year just minutes before winning her first Grammy presented on the telecast, Carpenter played the role of old-school hitmaker with plenty of self-deprecating humor, immaculate hits and oodles of pure fun. Her Grammys debut ultimately demonstrated why she’s become an in-demand arena headliner, and broke through to the mainstream after years of honing her craft.', 'Following a video segment that captured her journey from Midwest dreamer to global superstar, Chappell Roan underlined how she made that leap with a rocking, audacious rendition of “Pink Pony Club” — complete with an enormous pink pony in the center of her stage. Yet no oversized animal could overshadow Roan and her gaggle of rodeo clowns, who joined her for a choreo-heavy, full-throated take on the anthem about finding your community and yourself.', 'Wearing a bedazzled black leather two-piece and a look of unflinching determination, Roan whipped her hair to the screaming guitar solos, flaunted her gargantuan vocals and blew a kiss to the arena audience as they gave her a standing ovation. Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess started off slowly upon its 2023 release and became a word-of-mouth sensation throughout 2024; by Grammy Night in 2025, however, it was crystal-clear that she was born to be a star, and her command of the moment was never in doubt.', 'First, the party was too boisterous for the Grammys stage. Just like Charli XCX has been operating in her own lane for years without awards recognition, she kicked off her performance on Sunday evening within the guts of Crypto.com Arena, black fur wrapped around her shoulders as “Von Dutch” connected Charli to a collection of rabid onlookers backstage. Soon enough, however, the Brat experience spilled into the Grammys, with Charli arriving in time to crawl along the rave onstage, engage in some feral screaming as the “Guess” beat kept thumping, watch underwear rain from the sky (an onscreen message read “All unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence through I Support The Girls”), and give birthday girl Julia Fox a shout-out, with The Dare nodding along and Billie Eilish singing her heart out in the crowd.', 'If you’re among the many who have wrapped their arms around the bleary-eyed delights of Brat since its release, Charli’s Grammys performance was as unhinged, euphoric and secretly brilliant as you could hope for. We may never witness a Grammys performance like this again; it was a party frozen in time, even if Brat Summer lives forever.', 'When Doechii won best rap album during the Grammys telecast, making her just the third woman artist to win in the category, she was visibly emotional, marveling at the victory for Alligator Bites Never Heal and telling the world about the humble beginnings that brought her to the podium. Soon after, however, the Tampa native had sharpened her gaze, returned to the stage, and demonstrated why she belonged to an elite class of MC, and become one of the hottest names in all of popular music over the past few years.', 'Always an electrifying performer, Doechii maximized her Grammys slot by weaving high-concept visuals — dueling clones, twitchy choreography, ripped-away clothing and sliding floors — with breathless rhyming, opting to rip through “Catfish” and “Denial is a River” with a ferocity that no other performer on Sunday evening could equal. Jay-Z, SZA and Billie Eilish were among the stars blown away in the arena crowd, but millions watching around the world got to witness Doechii’s fusion of raw talent and action-packed execution. This was the sort of performance that levitates above everything around it, and is enough to convince that, right after a landmark best rap album victory, Doechii is just getting started.', 'Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

It all came together in a 225-minute telecast that mined emotions ranging from somber to delirious, reverential to iconoclastic.', 'As Grammys telecasts so often do, it felt a tiny bit endless and the presentation of the handful of actual awards felt mostly anticlimactic. But just when you thought that you might forget every bauble presented on Sunday night, Beyoncé won album of the year for Cowboy Carter, ending a snubbing streak that already felt unfathomable and could very possibly have culminated in rioting if she hadn’t won this one.', 'Having already contributed what is sure to become an eternally popular GIF with her surprise at winning country album of the year — handed to her with minimal flourish by Taylor Swift — Beyoncé’s response to the overdue top prize was a little understated and muted. Perhaps she knew better than to try to upstage the Los Angeles firefighters who handed her this trophy. Maintaining composure, she reflected on how it had been “many, many years” and wrapped the show. Her win will be remembered for a long time, but her speech may not be.', 'I think one or two men won Grammys on Sunday — native son Kendrick Lamar, fittingly for an evening dedicated to Los Angeles, took home record and song of the year — but one after another, it was the women who took the Formerly Known as Staples stage and held the spotlight.', '', 'Chappell Roan, moments after performing “Pink Pony Club” accompanied by dancing radio clowns and, of course, a pink pony, received her best new artist Grammy. After fumbling her princess hennin hat, she took out a diary and made a carefully considered plea for record studios to support up-and-coming artists with healthcare, referencing her own struggles without that necessity during COVID. Other people made political statements during the show, but those were directed out into the ether, into society at large. Roan’s advocacy directly addressed music bigwigs sitting on the arena floor and in luxury boxes.', 'In other speeches, Alicia Keys argued, “DEI is not a threat, it’s a gift,” Shakira made a call on behalf of immigrants, Lady Gaga made a call on behalf of trans visibility and Lamar made a call on behalf of Mustard.', 'We’re early in the 2025 awards cycle, but after the largely tepid sentiments at the largely tepid Golden Globes ceremony last month, this was a more topically pointed telecast, though most of its sentiment was directed toward traumatized residents of fire-ravaged Los Angeles.', 'The show started with an irony-stripped rewrite of Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.” by local boys Dawes and a backing band featuring John Legend, Sheryl Crow, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. The City of Angels was visually represented in the backdrop for Billie Eilish’s performance of “Birds of a Feather” and exhaustively referenced in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga’s duet of “California Dreaming.” Several ad breaks included commercials for local businesses rebuilding after getting lost in the flames, there was an extended montage of horrifying fire images and host Trevor Noah repeatedly urged people in the arena and at home to make donations through MusiCares in partnership with Direct Relief, the California Community Foundation and the Pasadena Community Foundation. I did, did you?', '', 'Noah, a veteran emcee who previously took on the difficult task of handling the socially distanced COVID Grammys, offered smooth bridges between the emotional tributes, bursts of musical abandon and attempted comic bits that were never sharp, but never belabored either. Working mostly from the audience — the better to make sure that Swift was in the background of every other shot — Noah kept things moving along and kept the mood light. He’s never my favorite awards show host but, especially when spikes of sentiment could have made things clumsy, he’s a pro.', 'Noah mentioned early on that winners were entitled to speak as long as they wanted, but anything over 90 seconds would cost them $1,000 per second in donations. I doubt that will be enforced and I’m not sure who would face the penalty anyway, but it was mostly a joke since the Grammys never care about running on time. There were so many little pieces of business in the telecast, like the interviews and clip packages introducing several performers, the long tribute to Keys, the longer tribute to the late Quincy Jones.', 'And there was, of course, one great performance after another, whether you knew the artists coming in or made discoveries as the show went along.', 'The back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back new artist performances by Khruangbin, Benson Boone, Doechii, Teddy Swims, Shaboozey and Raye were among the most astounding thing I’ve ever seen on an awards show. Each one had a different scale, tone and set, and a couple of them — Doechii and Raye stood out for me — were simply remarkable.', '', 'Truly, there was so much variety in what the evening offered. Whether it was the glamour humor of Carpenter’s “Espresso,” the queer Western fantasia of Roan’s “Pink Pony Club,” the Dante’s Inferno/Tower of Abel nightmare of the surprise appearance by The Weeknd, the intimate bellydancing done by Shakira or the aforementioned unworn undergarments of Charli XCX, there was close to something for everybody. And that’s without getting to Stevie Wonder duetting with Herbie Hancock on “We Are the World” or Janelle Monae’s chaotic yet delightful cover of “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough” or Cynthia Erivo’s showstopping “Fly Me to the Moon.”', 'There will always be some room for quibbles or personal preferences. I thought some of the tributes to the city paled in comparison to the FireAid concert earlier in the week, and several of the artists who did that telethon were missed onstage here. I didn’t think Chris Martin sounded great on the In Memoriam-accompanying “All My Love,” although, as regular readers will know, I’m almost never a fan of how that obligatory segment is executed at awards shows. The sound mix on a few of the earlier performances put the vocals so far in the background that they were almost inaudible. If I were the director of the telecast, I’d have put some effort into capturing how epic the venue and some of the performances were, since otherwise, why bother holding the event at What Was Once Staples?', 'In general, though, the Grammys delivered on most important levels. I found a few artists I’ve never heard of whom I’ll be listening to after finishing this review. Millions of dollars were raised for fire charities. Beyoncé will never again need to hear about her album of the year curse. And there were undergarments.

"Chappell, chaps, Brat or rap spats: what will – and should – win at the 2025 Grammys?",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/29/chappell-chaps-brat-or-rap-spats-what-will-and-should-win-at-the-2025-grammys,"['It’s tough to call the quality-stacked top categories, featuring Academy darlings such as Beyoncé, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift alongside pop’s new tyros', 'The Beatles – Now and Then\nBeyoncé – Texas Hold ’Em\nSabrina Carpenter – Espresso\nCharli xcx – 360\nBillie Eilish – Birds of a Feather\nKendrick Lamar – Not Like Us\nChappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!\nTaylor Swift – Fortnight (ft Post Malone)', 'Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there’s tended to be a bit of filler – but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many – and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour – but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyoncé has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold ’Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters – who value craft and chops – admiring Beyoncé’s capacity for making country music her own.', 'Will win Beyoncé\nShould win Kendrick Lamar', 'André 3000 – New Blue Sun\nBeyoncé – Cowboy Carter\nSabrina Carpenter – Short N’ Sweet\nCharli xcx – Brat\nJacob Collier – Djesse Vol 4\nBillie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and Soft\nChappell Roan – The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess\nTaylor Swift – The Tortured Poets Department', 'For the same reason, I think Beyoncé will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years – a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: “AOTY, I ain’t win / I ain’t stuntin’ ’bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,” as Beyoncé sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin’. Cowboy Carter isn’t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon – and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here – but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent.', 'Will win Beyoncé\nShould win Charli xcx', 'Shaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)\nBillie Eilish – Birds of a Feather\nBruno Mars and Lady Gaga – Die With a Smile\nTaylor Swift – Fortnight (ft Post Malone)\nChappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!\nKendrick Lamar – Not Like Us\nSabrina Carpenter – Please Please Please\nBeyoncé – Texas Hold ’Em', 'Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history – and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar’s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile’s lyrics are really hackneyed (“our love’s the only war worth fighting for”), particularly when compared with Roan’s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter’s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey’s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyoncé’s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we’re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us – the only song here with a single songwriter – is the diss track by which all others will now be judged.', 'Will win Kendrick Lamar\nShould win Kendrick Lamar', 'Benson Boone\nSabrina Carpenter\nDoechii\nKhruangbin\nRaye\nChappell Roan\nShaboozey\nTeddy Swims', 'Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It’s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan’s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there’s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there’s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves – puckish, vital, anti-mumbling – whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period.', 'Will win Chappell Roan\nShould win Chappell Roan', 'Beyoncé – Bodyguard\nSabrina Carpenter – Espresso\nCharli xcx – Apple\nBillie Eilish – Birds of a Feather\nChappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!', 'Given Brat’s success and Apple’s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here’s another category that Beyoncé has never won, though Bodyguard doesn’t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish’s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here’s hoping one of pop’s class of 2024 can net it: Roan’s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song’s groove.', 'Will win Chappell Roan\nShould win Sabrina Carpenter', 'The Beatles – Now and Then\nThe Black Keys – Beautiful People (Stay High)\nGreen Day – The American Dream Is Killing Me\nIdles – Gift Horse\nPearl Jam – Dark Matter\nSt Vincent – Broken Man', 'The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant – and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best – and the most purely rocking – is Pearl Jam’s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock’n’Roll to its opening riff.', 'Will win The Beatles\nShould win Pearl Jam', 'Cardi B – Enough (Miami)\nCommon and Pete Rock – When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos)\nDoechii – Nissan Altima\nEminem – Houdini\nFuture and Metro Boomin – Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar)\nGloRilla – Yeah Glo!\nKendrick Lamar – Not Like Us', 'Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That – the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio – increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem’s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There’s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery – much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter’s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival’s anatomy as “regular-degular” will have you spitting out your drink).', 'Will win Kendrick Lamar\nShould win Kendrick Lamar', 'Beyoncé – 16 Carriages\nJelly Roll – I Am Not Okay\nKacey Musgraves – The Architect\nShaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)\nChris Stapleton – It Takes a Woman', 'In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year’s winner White Horse – and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves’ song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll’s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyoncé winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on – but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song.', 'Will win Shaboozey\nShould win Shaboozey']"

After 15 years of near misses, her country-infused LP “Cowboy Carter,” an all-star trip through the Black roots of and modern influence on Americana, won for album and country album (perhaps an equally challenging feat for a Black pop crossover artist).', 'While “Cowboy Carter” didn’t dominate culture in the way that “Renaissance” or “Lemonade” did, the album spoke to deep questions about who the idea of America belongs to — and who built it.

It was a breezy and uplifting tribute to the City of Angels, if not a tad perplexing: Randy Newman wrote the 1983 tune as a sardonic sendup of the locale, contrasting the iconic sites and majestic landscapes with images of Botoxed vixens and a homeless man “down on his knees.” We might’ve preferred a medley that better showcased the breadth and diversity of LA’s music scene, but regardless, it’s hard to find much fault in something as well-intentioned as this.', ""Your favorite internet moments: Sign up for USA TODAY's Everyone's Talking newsletter."", 'The R&B/pop hitmaker brought out a visually remarkable light show for a surprise medley of songs from his just-released album, “Hurry Up Tomorrow.” But he unfortunately got a bit lost in the smoky extravaganza, perched at the back of the stage in a hood and sunglasses as rows of masked dancers flailed in front of him. Given that he’s boycotted the Grammys for years over a lack of diversity, we couldn’t help but wish for more from his triumphant return.', 'During this year’s “in memoriam” segment, the Coldplay frontman reminded viewers of his magnificent vocal range, with a simple yet effective performance seated at a piano. It was a tender moment, although it paled somewhat in comparison to poignant past tributes such as the 2022 Grammys, where Cynthia Erivo, Rachel Zegler, Leslie Odom Jr. and Ben Platt soared with a stirring medley of Stephen Sondheim ballads.', 'The brother-sister pair of Eilish and Finneas delivered a gorgeous take on their sentimental viral hit, taken from her third album “Hit Me Hard and Soft.” Eilish – who has been touring the globe since last fall – sounded even more subdued than usual, opting for a gentler belt of the final chorus. But it was a moving performance nevertheless, as she and Finneas sang against a picturesque backdrop of the LA foothills and canyons where they grew up, flashing childhood photos throughout the number.', 'Fresh off her win for best Latin pop album (“Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran""), Shakira dazzled with her first Grammys performance in nearly two decades. Dressed entirely in gold, the Colombian singer hypnotized the audience with a sultry, solo belly-rolling routine to “Ojos Asi,” before an army of dancers joined her onstage for the explosive, electronic “Sessions.” It was a welcome jolt of energy as the overlong telecast crept into its fourth hour.', 'The legendary late producer was honored with a lengthy, generation-spanning medley, which occasionally sagged in stretches featuring Wilson (“Let the Good Times Roll”) and – we hate to say it – Wonder (“We Are the World”). But unsurprisingly, Erivo wowed us with her heavenly vocal acrobatics on “Fly Me to the Moon,” and Monáe busted out a genuinely impressive moonwalk for her vigorous spin on Michael Jackson’s “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough.”', 'Gaga stunned fans with the premiere of her “Abracadabra” music video, which finds the singer making a spectacular return to her gothic, dance-pop roots. But earlier in the night, Gaga showed yet another facet of her immensely versatile range: teaming up with “Die with a Smile” collaborator Bruno Mars for a haunting, understated cover of folk-rock classic “California Dreamin’.”', 'The culture-shifting party girl was brazenly herself during her electrifying Grammys set. Charli XCX started her “Von Dutch” performance outside, strutting through the underbelly of the Crypto.com Arena in a black fur coat, and throwing a small rave with models and millennial revelers as the camera spun around her. She then made her way to the Grammys stage for “Guess,” writhing and crawling across the floor as underwear rained down on her flock of scantily clad carousers. Some uptight audience members may have been turned off by the uninhibited display – powered by flashing strobe lights and heavily AutoTuned vocals – but it was a brilliantly chaotic showcase for one of the year’s defining artists.', 'The pop star brought cheeky humor and playful showmanship to her debut Grammys performance, with a big-band rework of her frothy earworm “Espresso.” After disappearing behind a giant cascade of stairs, Carpenter shed her mini-tuxedo to reveal a flirty blue bodysuit, staging an Old Hollywood-style tap number with a throng of backup dancers. It was a delightful showcase for the actress-turned-singer’s theater kid sensibilities, rubber-stamping her status as a true triple threat.', 'After conquering festival stages last year, Roan proved yet again that she’s one of the best live performers we’ve seen in ages. Straddling a colossal pink steed, the Midwest princess turned the Grammys stage into a glitter-and-sequin-soaked jamboree, complete with cacti, tumbleweed and dancing rodeo clowns. Along with her powerhouse voice and indisputable charisma, Roan also proclaimed her unabashed queer pride, waving pink, white and blue flags in solidarity with the trans community. It was a loud and deeply necessary statement Trojan horsed within the night’s most joyous performance.', 'On Sunday, this year’s best new artist crop outshined many of their more established peers. Swims (“Lose Control”) and Shaboozey (“Good News” / “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”) brought gravelly vocals and easy charm to their medley, while Raye left the crowd gobsmacked with her insane belt on soulful ballad “Oscar Winning Tears.”', 'But it was Boone and Doechii who tore the house down with their athletic performances: Boone backflipped and grabbed his crotch in a swoony take on “Beautiful Things,” arrestingly calling to mind Queen’s Freddie Mercury. And Doechii was a force to be reckoned with on “Catfish” and “Denial is a River,” dexterously rapping and contorting herself with a chorus of preppy backup dancers, handily delivering some of the sharpest choreography the Grammys telecast has ever witnessed.

Shakira stopped mid-performance to hug Beyoncé. Alicia Keys sang along to Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club.” Taylor Swift and Cynthia Erivo held space for host Trevor Noah’s monologue. But star power alone was easily the least significant detail of the night. With every golden gramophone that was handed off, a vibe shift was happening. For the first time in a long time, I found myself working an awards show that actually ... felt fun?', 'That’s in large part thanks to the women of the Grammys. Without artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Chappell Roan, and Charli XCX releasing one banger album after another throughout the course of 2024, music’s biggest night would have quietly passed on, relegated to the shadowy ether of yet another negligible awards circuit.', 'Instead, what we got was the kind of awards show that I’d want to tell my kids about 10 or 15 years from now. Yeah, that time Chappell sang on a giant pink horse while surrounded by a crew of miming rodeo clowns? I watched that live. Or: Doechii casually backflipping in a sea of Thom Browne-clad backup dancers? Yup, I was there. That particular combination of Doechii, Roan, and Carpenter was especially electrifying; you could feel the hunger and passion for each of these Best New Artist nominee’s crafts radiate through the screen.', 'It also doesn’t go without notice that the biggest wins of the night went to women. Barring Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” the stage mostly saw the mic taken up by women, who righteously used their platform and influence to elevate issues of broader importance. Alicia Keys entered the DEI debate, slamming the politicized crusade against diversity initiatives. Shakira dedicated her award to immigrants, vowing to stand up for them as the U.S. threatens to increase deportations. Lady Gaga put the spotlight on trans people, uplifting a community that the current presidential administration is determined to hide. And Roan stood up to powerful music labels by demanding they give signed artists a livable wage and healthcare.', 'Naturally, the biggest feat of the night came from Beyoncé. Plenty of viewers watched the Album of the Year announcement with a pit of anxiety at the bottom of our stomachs—myself included. Would the award go to Beyonce, who had made it abundantly clear that she was aiming for it with a genre-shattering tour de force of an album? Or would the Recording Academy keep up its streak of refusing to grant Album of the Year to a Black woman, which stretches back to the last century? (Lauryn Hill took home the award in 1999; aside from her, Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole are the only other Black women who have ever won.) But at last, the Academy decided to give Beyoncé the recognition she never needed but still deserved, and now Cowboy Carter is officially an Album of the Year winner.', 'Not so long ago, awards season felt like a communal event, with seemingly everyone tuned in and poised to offer their commentary online. While that community has laid dormant for quite some time, the 2025 Grammys proved that there’s still an audience for awards ceremonies. They’re just waiting for the precise factors (and divas) to do the job right.', 'A Part of Hearst Digital Media', 'We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.', '©2025 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

"From Beyoncé to Kendrick, the 2025 Grammy Awards were one long apology to snubbed artists",https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/features/beyonce-kendrick-grammys-grammys-2025-snubs-b2691005.html,"['', 'The Grammys had quite a bit to be sorry about when it came to recognising and celebrating diversity. In 2025, they decided to make up with the best artists in the world before it was too late, writes Hannah Ewens', '', '', ""From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'W\nhen Beyoncé won Best Country Album at this year’s Grammys, she looked surprised. So surprised, there are already memes circulating of her wide-eyed reaction. She is the first Black artist to take home the award, but there is nothing else remotely unusual about her win. Beyoncé always gets the genre prizes, even when she’s dabbling in other spaces, like with her last genre record, 2022’s Renaissance, which won Best Dance/Electronic Album. But when Cowboy Carter was also announced as 2025’s best album winner – the grand prize for which Beyoncé has been snubbed so many times – she merely smiled.', 'Many fans scanning the list of winners this morning will be asking: why has she won this? And why now? Cowboy Carter was fuelled by a brilliant concept – a sonic ride through contributions of Black pioneers to country music – but compared to her other albums, all of which created seismic shifts in culture, the same could not quite be said for this record. Not only was this album part of a wider country trend in music, but the songs also feel too modest, too small for Beyoncé’s enormous vocals. Given how the Grammys voting works – with a tendency to reward established artists due to their big fanbases, and established network of relationships within the music industry – her win makes sense. Brat, meanwhile, may have been the culturally dominant album in that category this year, but it would never have been Charli XCX’s first Grammy Album of the Year win. Beyoncé is absolutely a deserving winner in this category. But still, why now?', 'The reason, to quote the song title of this year’s Best Metal Performance by Gojira, is that the 2025 Grammys were a major mea culpa for artists who have historically been snubbed. The overarching theme was one of apologies and rectifications; tensions had built to such a degree that this was the year it had to happen. The Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, even used his opening speech to address past snubs and a lack of diversity. “There’s still work to be done, but I firmly believe we’re on the right path,” he said, as he introduced a surprise performance from The Weeknd, who has famously boycotted the awards since 2021, when he was due to play but pulled out after discovering he didn’t get a single nomination.', 'Of all the major award shows across entertainment, the Grammys (along with the Oscars for film) face the most backlash for a lack of representation for marginalised groups. Black artists and genres like hip-hop, R&B and Latin music have not always been fully acknowledged in the major categories like Album of the Year or Record of the Year, where pop and white mainstream artists dominate the wins. Beyoncé, a prime example of this wonky inflection in voting standards, was – and is –the most nominated artist in Grammys history. She always loses out on the greatest honours, typically receiving genre nods instead (aka the booby prizes for an artist of her towering mainstream stature). Along with The Weeknd, other high-profile artists like Kendrick Lamar and Drake have directly spoken out about this diversity problem, in some cases refusing to submit work for consideration.', 'Never was this dissension louder than last year, when Jay-Z called out the Recording Academy while picking up a prize of his own, Dr Dre’s Global Impact Award. Poor Blue Ivy stood on stage next to her father, as he pointed to his wife Beyoncé’s past snubs. “I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year,” Jay-Z said of Beyoncé. “So even by your own metrics, that doesn’t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won Album of the Year. That doesn’t work.” Down on the floor, a cowboy-hat-clad Beyoncé was caught on camera giving a stoney reaction.', 'Of all the Beyoncé snubs, the greatest came in 2023, the year before Jay-Z’s challenge to the Grammys. Renaissance – an undeniably exquisite album for its front-to-back bangers, textured celebration of club music, and total reinvention of Beyoncé – failed to win the artist the best album prize. She lost out to Harry Styles for Harry’s House, which, sure. It was stylish and we all love Styles in Gucci, but it lacked any major substance.', 'The litany of rebuffs Beyoncé has faced started way back when she was in Destiny’s Child, who were lumped into the R&B category. When Beyoncé revolutionised the way artists release music with a surprise drop, began the trend of visual albums and offered a fresh mainstream feminist perspective and representation of Black womanhood, all with her self-titled 2013 album, she didn’t even get a best album nomination. To underline the horror of it all, the winners that year were Mumford and Sons. When Beyoncé made Lemonade, the most culturally relevant project of 2016 with its assessment of Black identity and trauma in America, she lost out to Adele’s 25, which was only embarrassing for both artists. That Lemonade won Best Urban Contemporary Album instead felt almost ironic. At best, it was flinchingly awkward.', 'Similarly, at this year’s Grammys, it was finally time for Kendrick Lamar’s moment in the sun. The godfathers of popular music were turning in their graves in 2018 when Lamar lost out on Album of the Year for his seminal record DAMN to Grammys favourite, Bruno Mars, for the latter’s vibeless 24K Magic (no, it’s not got “Uptown Funk” on it). To make up for what should have been a freak accident rather than a typical run of events, this year Lamar won best record for “Not Like Us”. Once again: sure, a good song, Lamar is deserving. But it’s too funny that he was finally properly recognised by the Academy for a diss track that accuses Drake of being a paedophile. (Thanks to this decision, the Academy is a footnote in this tedious lore that involves Drake bringing legal action against the track and denying said charges.)', 'The Grammys need the participation of artists to remain relevant or even to function', 'Ultimately, positive systemic change almost always happens with objection from the ground up, and this applies to award shows as much as it does to culture at large. The Grammys need the participation of artists to remain relevant or even to function. If Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Kendrick all chose to withdraw their support from the awards in the vein of Drake and The Weeknd – a highly likely reality – not only would it be shameful for the Academy, but it would trigger a chain reaction from sympathetic artists across the board.', 'This redressing of past mistakes could well continue to be a trend for the Grammys now that they’ve started to turn a corner. If so, why not give Lana Del Rey, one of the greatest songwriters of the 21st century, her first Grammy? How about following up Miley Cyrus’s one meagre Grammy with another? And when it comes time for Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar’s next best work to be considered, let’s slide some more awards in their direction, and give Queen Bey something to truly smile about – not just a commiseration prize.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

From Drake’s humiliation to Doechii’s coronation: the talking points from the 2025 Grammys,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/03/from-drakes-humiliation-to-doechiis-breakthrough-the-talking-points-from-the-2025-grammys,"['Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a ‘Canadian tuxedo’, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyoncé\nGrammy awards 2025: list of winners', 'It’s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: “My artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyoncé.” And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim – a “Canadian tuxedo”, no less – while half the arena seemed to chant “tryna strike a chord and it’s probably a minor”, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn’t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards – and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar – the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake?', 'For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there’s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she’s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That’s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers’ rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a “demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.” She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: “It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists’ health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to … Labels, we got you, but do you got us?”', 'As Donald Trump enshrines transphobia in American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: “Trans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.” She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars.', 'Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US – Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock – to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don’t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert’s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys’ stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where – with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan – she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal.', 'With her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night’s wackier outfits – think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre – she’s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music.', 'She may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format, Beyoncé not winning that category felt like a big snub – particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck’s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn’t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&B, pop or dance record – and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyoncé’s most imaginative and beautiful music – the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyoncé has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards.', 'Matt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win.', 'It’s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country’s popular music, wasn’t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm.', 'He lost to Beyoncé in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive – that’s 11 wins overall for him now. It’s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey’s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process.', 'Way after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied – last week he sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: “Mr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime … but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.” His win for best R&B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online – just as there has for Kanye West’s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare.', 'Two of the “big four” were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation – such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx’s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen – analysis by Akas found that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women.', 'Charli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn’t a great night for other Brits. Belfast’s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier’s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father’s album Mind Games).', 'This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce’s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck’s Morning Phase.']"

FEATURES,https://www.analogplanet.com/content/2025-grammys-winners-which-ones-make-grade-vinyl,"['', '', '', 'The 67th Grammy Awards — sorry, I meant the all-caps GRAMMY Awards — were handed out in Los Angeles last night, February 2, 2025, and we applaud the wide range of actual, great-sounding winning recordings, as evidenced by what we’ve heard of their vinyl incarnations. Over the past year(ish), we’ve indeed reviewed some of those key, Grammy-winning LPs and songs here on AP, so if you’re keen on finding out if they make the grade on vinyl and are worthy of your hard-earned dollars and/or valuable listening time, then read on. (The link graphic to purchase any of these Grammy-winning LPs and/or 45s from Music Direct follow each category summary. If any of them are sold out — perhaps due to #grammysfever — you can put in an order to reserve your copy once they’re restocked.)', '', 'BEST ROCK PERFORMANCE:\nTHE BEATLES: “NOW AND THEN”\nNo surprise, really. As I first reported here back on October 26, 2023, the double A-sided single on Apple/Capitol/UMG for “Now and Then” paired the “last” Beatles song with the first — i.e., The Fab Four’s 1962 debut UK single, “Love Me Do,” a truly fitting full-circle counterpart. (Remember, the Grammy calendar year essentially starts each November, hence the reason for this track’s eligibility, having been released on November 2, 2023.)', 'In addition to its various color-vinyl options as a standalone 45 (one of which is shown above; the black vinyl 45 purchase link is at the end of this review/recap section [SRP: $16.99; and yep, I have multiple versions]), “Now and Then” also appears as Track 1 on LP3, Side Five of what’s also dubbed The Bonus ‘Blue’ LP in the 50th anniversary 180g half-speed-mastered edition of The Beatles’ 1967-1970 (a.k.a. The Blue Album), which was released the following week on November 10, 2023. Mark Smotroff reviewed both 1962-1966 (a.k.a. The Red Album) sets here on December 1, 2023, if you’re interested to learn more. (And you can buy either/both of those LP sets here, for $69.99 apiece, or $79.99 per for the color vinyl options.)', 'The stats behind how “Now and Then” came to be are these, to refresh (and/or update!) your memory — and are worth revisiting in detail to understand its sonic merits, although opinions do vary on that subject.', '', 'In the late 1970s, John Lennon recorded a demo for “Now and Then” with vocals and piano at his home in New York’s Dakota Building. In 1994, his wife, Yoko Ono Lennon, gave the recording to Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr along with John’s demos for “Free as a Bird” and “Real Love,” the latter two of which were completed as new Beatles songs and respectively released as singles in 1995 and 1996, as part of the multi-volume The Beatles Anthology project. At the same time, Paul, George, and Ringo also recorded new parts and completed a rough mix for “Now and Then” with producer Jeff Lynne. At that time, “technological limitations” (to use official Beatles press release parlance) “prevented” John’s vocals and piano from being separated to “achieve the clear, unclouded mix” needed to finish the song.', 'Cut to 2021, and the release of The Beatles: Get Back docuseries that was directed by Peter Jackson. Using WingNut Films’ MAL audio technology, Jackson’s team had de-mixed the film’s mono soundtrack, managing to isolate instruments and vocals, and all the individual voices within The Beatles’ conversations, leading all involved to a most obvious question: Could something similar be done with Lennon’s “Now and Then” demo? Jackson and his sound team, led by Emile de la Rey, applied the same technique to Lennon’s original home recording to (in their words again) “preserve the clarity and integrity of his original vocal performance by separating it from the piano.”', 'In Los Angeles, McCartney oversaw a Capitol Studios recording session for the song’s wistful, quintessentially Beatle-esque string arrangement, written by Giles Martin, Sir Paul, and Ben Foster. Paul and Giles also added backing vocals from the original recordings of a trio of Beatles classics — “Here, There and Everywhere,” “Eleanor Rigby,” and “Because” — and wove them into the new song using the techniques perfected during the making of the LOVE show and album. The finished track for “Now and Then” was produced by McCartney and Martin, and it was mixed by Spike Stent.', 'As to the rest of the track’s DNA — besides Lennon’s vocal and electric and acoustic guitar recorded in 1995 by Harrison, Starr’s newly recorded drum part, plus new bass, guitar, and piano from McCartney that matches John’s original playing, completed the song.', 'Did they succeed? Depends on how you feel about the Beatles/“Threetles”/“Twotles” thing. Lennon’s now MAL-ified demo vocals certainly sound better here than they did on those two aforementioned Anthology tracks (and will official remixes of that song pair be forthcoming on vinyl, one wonders). I do like the clear distinction of who’s who in the Lennon/Macca vocal blend on the words “I love you,” the title phrase, and the choruses, plus the updated piano lines and Ringo’s always on-point, understated drumming. I’ll give the Music an 8.5, and the Sound an 8.', 'Given the other rock performances The Fabs were up against in this category — more contemporary-sounding and harder-edged tracks from The Black Keys, Green Day, IDLES, Pearl Jam, and St. Vincent — “Now and Then” getting the win here seems like a fitting, final anointment — until the next “last” Beatles track emerges, anyway. (“Carnival of Light,” anyone?) And if I make it through / It’s all because of you. . .', '', '', '', 'BEST ROCK ALBUM:\nTHE ROLLING STONES: HACKNEY DIAMONDS\nWell . . . it’s not exactly our favorite Stones album, truth be told, but I guess it does fit the category’s qualification as being awarded to “albums containing greater than 75% playing time of new rock, hard rock, or metal recordings.”', 'I had Mark Smotroff review the Hackney Diamonds 180g 1LP set on Rolling Stones Records/Geffen/Polydor here on December 1, 2023. Much like I did after spinning the LP myself — the black vinyl edition (SRP: $32.99), though there are scores of color variants available! — Smotroff found the music to be mostly in the classic Stones vein, with Mick Jagger’s voice sounding (quoting his review now) “generally remarkable, despite the unnecessary trendy processing effects.”', 'The crux for us both: “The sound here is far from ideal. [. . .] The bass is at least pretty fat, and there is overall a fair clarity of the instrumentation — but there is not a lot of mids and highs, for the most part. [. . .] I think you get the idea that this album isn’t a sonic masterpiece — certainly not on vinyl.” The Music gets a 7, and the Sound a 5.', 'Stones lovers/completists should have/get a copy of the Hackney Diamonds LP, as it will grow on you, though it certainly won’t serve as anyone’s demo disc anytime soon. (Addendum: A recently released 180g 2LP “1 Year Anniversary” Hackney edition, with an SRP of $45.99, adds a second clear-blue splatter disc with seven tracks The Stones cut live at Racket NYC at the album’s launch event on October 19, 2023.)', '', '', '', 'BEST FOLK ALBUM:\nGILLIAN WELCH & DAVID RAWLINGS: WOODLAND\nWhat an absolute thrill it was to see Woodland win here. As I wrote in my portion of our Top LPs of 2024 roundup that posted here on December 20, 2024, Woodland is an album that was, quote, “mastered directly from the original analog tapes through custom Ortofon amplifiers to a Neumann VMS-80 cutting system.”', 'That’s about as authentic as it gets, folks — and this Acony LP (SRP: $37.99) gets a 9.5 for the Music and a 9.5 for the Sound from me. Whether it’s the acoustic clarity of “Lawman” (Side A, Track 3) or the naked harmonies of “Here Stands a Woman” (Side B, Track 4), Woodland is as intimately rustic a set as you’ll ever spin.', '', '', '', 'BEST ENGINEERED ALBUM, NON-CLASSICAL:\nPETER GABRIEL: i/o\nOk, this is another one that the Grammys voting cognoscenti got right. All kudos to i/o engineers Tchad Blake, Oli Jacobs, Katie May, Dom Shaw & Mark “Spike” Stent, and mastering engineer Matt Colton, for sonically shepherding yet another Peter Gabriel masterpiece.', 'As I noted in my half of i/o our Top Albums of 2023 list that posted here on December 30, 2023, Gabriel initially doled out each of the tracks on this 180g 2LP set that ultimately appeared on his own Real World label digitally month-to-month — in addition to performing most of them live during his outstanding two-set 2023 tour, which I saw back on September 22, 2023 — before committing them to wax that December. (Remember the Grammys calendar “rule” that I cited earlier as to why this release qualified.)', 'Gabriel was never one to plow through song arrangements at a breakneck pace, so most i/o tracks unfurl like tightly wound blankets of layered sound, rich in instrumentation and vocal layering — the orchestral age treatise “So Much” (LP2, Side C, Track 2), the piano-and-synth-driven “Playing for Time” (LP1, Side A, Track 2) — that would only get bogged down in a single LP setting. As I concluded in my original assessment, “the aural rewards of i/o unfold even further upon repeat spins, once again bolstering Gabriel’s rightfully taken place in the pantheon of rock-era pioneers.”', 'The Music is a 9, and the Sound is a 9 as well. If you’re really into Gabriel, you can seek out both the Bright-Side Mixes and Dark-Side Mixes 2LP editions (SRP: $39.99 each; the latter is mainly instrumental-focused, in case you’re wondering), or go all-in and spring for the 4LP box set (SRP: $141.99) released in April 2024 that contains both 2LP sets, 2CDs, and a Blu-ray that houses the rightfully awarded Grammy for Best Immersive Audio Album, a truly mind-expanding Dolby Atmos mix done by immersive mix engineer Hans-Martin Buff and Gabriel himself, in his role as immersive producer, on what’s called the In-Side Mix.', '', '', '', 'BEST BOXED OR SPECIAL LIMITED EDITION PACKAGE:\nJOHN LENNON: MIND GAMES\nA truly, truly delightful package that won this Grammy for art directors Simon Hilton and Sean Ono Lennon. The 6CD+2BD presentation of John Lennon’s October 1973 solo effort Mind Games (SRP: $167.99) is a work of art both visually and, of course, sonically — and while we do indeed love that box both inside and out, we also love the companion 180g 2LP edition on Lenono Music/Universal Music Group International (SRP: $41.99) dubbed The Ultimate Mixes & The Out-takes that Mark Smotroff reviewed here on August 1, 2024.', 'For this release, engineer Paul Hicks and mixers/engineers Sam Gannon and Rob Stevens utilized high-definition 24-bit/192kHz audio transfers of the original first-generation multitrack recordings by Matthew Cocker at Abbey Road Studios to create the best possible recreations of the originals. All of the tracks on this edition of Mind Games were (per the official press release) “completely remixed from scratch from the 15 original two-inch multitrack session tapes using brand new 192-24 digital transfers.”', 'Smotroff gave the Music 8, and the Sound an 8 as well (and I concur). In his review, he noted that “There are many details on this new version of Mind Games that were not as apparent or emphasized in Lennon’s original mix. [. . .] Lennon’s vocals on ‘Intuition’ (LP1, Side 2, Track 1) sound far more relaxed and open than on the original, perhaps due to the breathy ‘ahhs’ that are now lifted up in the mix as a sweet counterpoint to his main layered vocals. The dead-quiet break after the first verse on the proto-metal-leaning closing track ‘Meat City’ (LP1, Side 2, Track 6) — when Lennon sings the first ‘Just gotta give me some rock ’n’ roll’ — is pretty breathtaking. It was there on the original, but the impact of the full-stop never sounded quite this defined and powerful. That moment just jumps out of your speakers. ‘Meat City’ always rocked hard, and it rocks harder than ever now — so I say turn it up!”', 'Me too.', '', '', '', 'BEST NEW ARTIST:\nCHAPPELL ROAN\nLast, and certainly not least — in Grammy lingo, the Best New Artist category “recognizes an artist whose eligibility-year release(s) achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and notably impacted the musical landscape.” Chappell Roan took the prize, and Mark Smotroff reviewed her 2LP debut release on Amusement/Island, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess (SRP: $32.99), in a Short Cuts review that posted here on September 27, 2024 (and he also anointed it as one of his Top LPs of 2024 in our year-end roundup here).', 'Smotroff gave the Music a 9, and the Sound an 8. “Roan’s voice is that strong,” he wrote. “Even though there is quite a bit of synthesized instrumentation on The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, I’m pleased how full and round it all sounds — much of it played by producer and co-songwriter Dan Nigro, with many supplemental players and backing vocalists, along with a small army of engineers and such. The recording is remarkably warm and at times feels a bit old school, in that sense.”', 'Nigro, we should add, also won another Grammy for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, for his work with both Roan on Princess, and with Olivia Rodrigo.', '', '', 'And those are our Grammy winners— well, mostly winners, that is. We’ll be back for more Grammys/GRAMMYs-on-vinyl talk after the 68th edition’s winners arrive in 2026!', '', '', '', '', '', 'And while this year was no different, I was impressed by the performances by a few that night. It may not be fair that this tiny, cloistered group of elitists pick from the same small gene pool every year, but then again, Americans voted for fucking Trump again. Let the entropy begin.', ""Chappell really blew me away with Pink Pony Club. It really is a pretty touching and dynamic song and a great message to anyone queer who wants to live free. And it really is a truthful statement on queer existence- they're just dancing, let 'em have fun! If I was in West Hollywood checking out the classic rock venues, I would go to The Abbey (club about the song) and party for sure."", ""It was great to see Peter Gabriel recognized again. I wasn't as impressed by Hackney Diamonds for exactly the production decisions mentioned above. It was heartening to see Welch & Rawlings hit it as well, though I am not as ga-ga over that album after 2 listens. Perhaps more time is needed. Sorta glad the Beatles hit it..? I guess I don't care despite liking the song."", 'Good stuff Mike!', ""and here all this time I thought this was a HiFi site, not a TDS therapy forum. I didn't vote for the man, or KH for that matter, and feel no need to advocate for or defend him but really?

"Final Grammy Predictions: Beyoncé, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan Poised to Rule Ladies Night",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/2025-grammys-predictions-ladies-night-1236120599/,"['', '', 'Top female talents will take on the Beatles at Sunday’s show, where THR expects they’ll prevail in the big four categories: album, record and song of the year and best new artist.', 'BY LORI MAJEWSKI', 'The Los Angeles wildfires may have muted the music business’ usual weeklong celebration leading to the 67th annual Grammy Awards, but maybe that’s served to shine a brighter spotlight on music’s biggest night and its nominated artists? In any case, this year’s competition is (Sasha) fierce! When Beyoncé struts into the Crypto.com Arena on Feb. 2, she does so with the most nominations, 11, including three in the top general categories — album, record and song of the year — a feat shared by Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter (the last two are also up for best new artist). Will Beyoncé finally win album and/or record, two trophies she doesn’t yet have in her case, despite being the winningest artist in Grammy history? Will Swift add a back-to-back AOTY to her collection (this would be her fifth!)? Or will Charli XCX have everyone seeing lime green? Our predictions for who’ll take the gold home …', '', 'Nominees: New Blue Sun by André 3000; Cowboy Carter by Beyoncé; Short n’ Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter; Brat by Charli XCX; Djesse Vol. 4 by Jacob Collier; Hit Me Hard and Soft by Billie Eilish; The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess by Chappell Roan; The Tortured Poets Department by Taylor Swift', 'You didn’t think Beyoncé premiered eight Cowboy Carter songs live on Netflix, thumbing her nose at the Super Bowl with an NFL Christmas Gameday spectacle that literally had her singing from the rafters, because she’s a Texans fan, did you? More likely: Nine months after dropping the album that made her the first Black woman to top Billboard’s country album chart, introduced the world to Shaboozey and rewrote “Jolene” as a warning shot for the titular adulteress, Bey knew the Recording Academy could use reminding — during voting season, ‘natch — that she doesn’t just make music, she makes history. They wouldn’t dare deny her again … would they?', 'WINNER Beyoncé', 'RECORD OF THE YEAR', 'Nominees: “Now and Then” by The Beatles; “Texas Hold ‘Em” by Beyoncé; “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter; “360” by Charli XCX; “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eilish; “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar; “Good Luck, Babe!” by Chappell Roan; “Fortnight” by Taylor Swift featuring Post Malone', 'Ringo Starr said he’d “love to win a Grammy” for “the last track ever by the boys” — one that took decades to complete. But if The Beatles couldn’t land record of the year for “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” “Hey Jude” (!) or “Let It Be” (!!), Starr and Paul McCartney — the only band members nominated for “Now and Then” — won’t get one for resurrecting John Lennon with AI. Plus, the Recording Academy likes its ROTYs to be smash hits (think: Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” or Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers”), which is why Eilish and her brother, Finneas (ROTY recognizes the artist, producer and engineer), will prevail. Grammy darlings, they’ve won this twice in the past five years (in 2020 for “Bad Guy” and ’21 for “Everything I Wanted” — presented by Starr!), and “Birds of a Feather” is their best, most ubiquitous record yet.', '', 'WINNER Billie Eilish', 'Nominees: “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” by Shaboozey; “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eilish; “Die With a Smile” by Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars; “Fortnight” by Taylor Swift featuring Post Malone; “Good Luck, Babe!” by Chappell Roan; “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar; “Please Please Please” by Sabrina Carpenter', 'Eilish (with Finneas) has also won song of the year twice — in 2020 for “Bad Guy,” and just last year for the Oscar winner from Barbie, “What Was I Made For?” Can she score a SOTY hat trick? No other artist in history has, but here’s why she will: Song of the year acknowledges the songwriter for a work’s composition, lyrics and melody. “Birds of a Feather” is a cross-generational gem because of the uplifting melody juxtaposed with Eilish’s vulnerable, non-clichéd lyrics that express a deep love and a desire for it to last “‘Til I rot away, dead and buried / ‘Til I’m in the casket you carry.”', 'WINNER Billie Eilish', 'Nominees: Benson Boone; Sabrina Carpenter; Doechii; Khruangbin; Raye; Chappell Roan; Shaboozey; Teddy Swims', 'Best new artist nominees don’t have to be, well, new. As Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. recently told THR, “For me, what it comes down to is when an artist rises to national or international prominence. It could be their first record; it could be their sixth.” None of these nominees are here on the strength of their debut, but Disney star Carpenter is a half-dozen albums in, having had modest success before her latest, the AOTY-nominated smash Short n’ Sweet and its ROTY hopeful, “Espresso” (i.e., Spotify’s second-most-streamed song of 2024). But good luck, babe — Carpenter will need it to beat Roan. In mere months, the latter morphed from virtual unknown into a “Femininomenon,” with memorable performances at Governors Ball, Lollapalooza and on Saturday Night Live. Plus, she’s an artist’s artist, having already jammed with Joni Mitchell, Elton John and Brandi Carlile — Grammys‘ kind of company.', '', 'WINNER Chappell Roan', 'Lori Majewski is the host of ‘Fierce: Women in Music’ and ‘Lust for Lists’ on SiriusXM.\nThis story appeared in the Jan. 29 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

What Are Our Bold Predictions for Grammy Night?,https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/grammys-2025-predictions-winners-performers-surprises-1235886100/,"[""This week's Five Burning Questions looks at some questions about Sunday's upcoming Grammys."", 'Music’s Biggest Night is just around the corner, airing this Sunday, Feb. 2. Though much is unsure about what the Grammys will look like this year, amidst the fires that have brought destruction and chaos to California this January, we know the nominees and we know (most of) the performers — enough to make educated guesses about some of the artists who might end up making for the night’s biggest stories.', '', 'SEE LATEST VIDEOS, CHARTS AND NEWS', '', 'Breakout superstars Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan are both nominated in each of the Big Four categories, and also making their debuts as Grammy performers on Sunday. Veteran pop leaders Billie Eilish and Charli XCX are also major nominees and expected performers, while Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are similarly up for the top prizes and expected to attend — but not to perform. And a big wildcard remains Kendrick Lamar, the seven-time nominee who will take the stage at halftime of Super Bowl LIX the following Sunday night.', '', 'Who will end up the night’s biggest winners among these A-listers? And who might surprise some folks elsewhere in the awards? Billboard staffers discuss all these questions and more below.', '', '1. With most of the biggest names in the last year in pop music up for one or multiple of the top prizes on Sunday night, which star do you think stands to gain the most with a win or two in the Big Four categories?', 'Katie Atkinson: I would say the most to gain would be Chappell Roan, because she’s obviously reached incredible heights over the past year, but she’s still the kind of artist that your mom has maybe heard about on a morning show but doesn’t know her music. A big night on Sunday – anything from winning best new artist to sweeping the Big Four categories, à la Billie Eilish in 2020 – could turn her into a household name. Of course, Beyoncé finally winning album of the year would be a huge storyline, but what does Queen B still have to gain, honestly?', 'Eric Renner Brown: Charli XCX. She’s a well-established artist who’s had barely any Grammy recognition in the past (prior to this year, her two nominations were a decade ago, for Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy”), and she’s defined by her penchant for creative reinvention – so the possibility that she’ll be nominated in future years feels less inevitable than it does for many of her Big Four competitors. Given Brat’s crossover, zeitgeist-seizing appeal, as well as the eight nominations she secured, 2025 could well be Charli’s best shot at adding “Grammy-winner” to her resume.', '', 'Kyle Denis: I think it depends on the category. If Beyoncé takes home AOTY, that’s probably far and away the biggest story of the night; she gains a highly coveted honor that often eluded her, the Recording Academy gains some credibility back. If Kendrick Lamar takes either ROTY or SOTY (or both) with “Not Like Us,” that’s a major moment for him (first General Field victory ever), hip-hop (second-ever hip-hop song to win these categories after “This Is America” in 2019) and diss tracks (stamps “NLU” forever despite ongoing lawsuits). ', 'Generally, however, I think Chappell Roan stands to gain the most with a win or two in the Big Four categories. Beyoncé and Lamar are already megastars, as are other GF nominees like Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga. A televised Grammy win gives Chappell an opportunity to win over the swaths of the public that still aren’t hip to her – and it’s the ultimate seal of approval for any musician. Between her incredible journey and what she means to so many young people across the country, any Chappell victory would be the night’s crowning moment. ', 'Nonetheless, if The Beatles pull off that ROTY win, perhaps the night’s biggest winner is actually AI. ', 'Jason Lipshutz: Beyoncé. While it’s tempting to say that fast-rising artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan would reach a new level of stardom with major Grammy wins, both are unquestionable A-listers who are going to be at the forefront of pop for a long time, regardless of Sunday night’s outcome. Similarly, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish have already taken home album of the year trophies (four of them for Swift!), and even if he goes home empty-handed, Kendrick Lamar gets to perform at the Super Bowl one week later. To me, Queen Bey has the most at stake, because this particular achievement remains the one box she has yet to check in a legendary professional career. If Cowboy Carter takes home album of the year, the win will feel momentous and career-capping in a way that it won’t for any other artist. ', '', 'Andrew Unterberger: Charli XCX. For someone who’s spent the better part of the last decade at the fringes of the mainstream to emerge victorious in the starriest pop year the Grammys has had in ages would make for a true career-peak victory lap, and would further cement her place in the ruling class for years to come.', '2. With so many big names in contention, at least one is almost guaranteed to go home empty-handed. Who do you think we’re most likely to be talking about as one of the night’s unfortunate shutouts?', 'Katie Atkinson: Though we now know she will be in the building, I think there’s a real chance Taylor Swift could go home empty-handed on Sunday. While she has six nominations, there just seems to be more buzz around so many other artists, especially in the top categories. That said, her clearest path to victory is in the best music video category, which she’s won twice before: for the cinematic “All Too Well: The Short Film” in 2023 and the star-studded “Bad Blood” video in 2016. It will be interesting to see if she does win in that category (for “Fortnight” with Post Malone) whether they’ll televise the typically pre-broadcast award to get Swift onstage.', 'Eric Renner Brown: When it comes to the Grammys, I’ve learned not to bet against Taylor Swift. So while I think that The Tortured Poets Department is a sharp decline from the quality of her previous Grammy-winning work – not to mention inferior to much of the other music she’s competing against – it’s still easy to envision Swift walking away with a bunch of Grammy gold this Sunday. Sadly, I’ve also learned not to bet on Beyoncé, after she seemed bound for album of the year victories that never came to pass in 2015, 2017 and 2023. Stiff competition or not, we’ve seen the most decorated artist in Grammy history walk away empty handed in this coveted category before – and beyond that category, this year, record and song of the year are both positively stacked.', '', 'Kyle Denis: I think that unlucky person might be Taylor this year. The Tortured Poets Department is the highest-selling album recognized across the show’s 90+ categories, but Grammys aren’t solely determined by commercial statistics. Of her three General Field races, Swift doesn’t appear to be a frontrunner in any of them. And last year’s AOTY victory for Midnights might spur voters to spread the wealth this year. ', 'Jason Lipshutz: Chappell Roan, sadly. The Recording Academy has a long track record of nominating, but not rewarding, popular music that is provocative to the point of challenging listeners — think recent albums by Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey and SZA, all of whom have yet to win a Big Four trophy. Roan’s daring approach to pop and unflinching public persona have connected with Gen Z and made her a superstar, but I predict they will not help her on Grammy Night.', 'Andrew Unterberger: Also Charli XCX. The competition is a little too stacked with longtime household names and/or artists with massive 2024 crossover hits; I fear Charli may still be just a little too fringey as an artist and figure to get the inside track here. (Not that this would be the worst thing for her either — maintaining a little underground edge will likely do her wonders in the long-term anyway.)', '3. The Grammys are just as much about the performances as they are about the winners and losers these days. Among the announced performers, who could you see really cementing or improving their star status with a really memorable performance?', 'Katie Atkinson: Chappell Roan has built up such a reputation as a game-changing live act, drawing record crowds to every festival stage she hit in 2024. But we’ve really only gotten two major TV performances from her so far: her Joan of Arc moment at the MTV VMAs singing “Good Luck Babe!” and her “Pink Pony Club” and “The Giver” twofer on SNL. There’s a big opportunity for her to make a lasting impression on the Grammy audience – both to the fans who’ve already bought in and to the many people who have heard her name but have no idea what she’s about.', '', 'Eric Renner Brown: Doechii, without a doubt. Her star continues to rise following August’s Alligator Bites Never Heal – she just scored her first solo Hot 100 entry – and I’ve heard lots of chatter about her recent charismatic Late Show and Tiny Desk performances. She’s enjoying a moment and I think she’ll win over the large network TV audience on Music’s Biggest Night.', 'Kyle Denis: Doechii, hands down. Every time she hits an awards show stage, Doechii ends the night as one of the most talked-about performers. In the past few weeks, Doechii’s performances on The Late Show, NPR’s Tiny Desk and Genius Open Mic have helped grow both her cultural capital and commercial pull. I expect the Grammys to be no different — and an undeniable performance would coincide beautifully with the steady streaming gains for her Alligator Bites Never Heal mixtape, which could take home the Grammy for best rap album. ', 'Jason Lipshutz: While casual pop fans are already familiar enough with artists like Carpenter and Roan, Benson Boone and Raye — two bold, talented live acts — have the opportunity to build upon the success of their respective breakthrough hits and elevate themselves in primetime. Raye can certainly deliver roof-rattling vocals; Boone is capable of backflipping into the arms of America. Each of them could walk out of the Grammys ceremony with a much bigger profile.', 'Andrew Unterberger: Ladies and gentlemen, once again: Charli XCX! While I think she leaves the awards empty-handed this year, I also think she leaves with the most dazzling performance, one that really pushes at the boundaries of what a Grammy performance can be — like Tyler, the Creator’s incendiary “New Magic Wand” from a half decade ago. It’s the win I think she should (and will) be most focused on for Sunday night anyway.', '', '4. Beyond the big stars in the Big Four categories, who’s a slightly lesser-known artist who you could see maybe making some headlines and attracting some notice with a notable win or two on Grammy night?', 'Katie Atkinson: While RAYE is nominated for best new artist, I don’t think that’s where she’ll make her mark on Sunday. I think a (maybe televised?) songwriter of the year win combined with a sure-to-be captivating performance (it’s what she does best) could be her biggest look Stateside yet after she was all but coronated as the U.K.’s next big thing with her record-breaking six wins at the 2024 BRIT Awards. The Grammys being perfectly timed with her current single “Oscar Winning Tears.” breaking onto the Pop Airplay chart this week could be the recipe for a big post-Grammys breakthrough.', 'Eric Renner Brown: Before this year, the electronic music veteran Four Tet had only received two Grammy nominations, both for remixes of other artists’ work; now, his sublime 2024 album Three is nominated for best dance/electronic album, and its single “Loved” is up for best dance/electronic recording. Four Tet’s profile has blossomed in recent years, as he headlined Coachella and Madison Square Garden alongside Skrillex and Fred again.., so much so that he feels like a serious contender against his competition this year – and a Grammy win (or two) would be a fitting capstone for one of the dance world’s most prolific and tireless innovators.', 'Kyle Denis: If RAYE can translate one of her three nominations to her a win, I think that would be an amazing, star-making moment for her. She’s already cemented herself in the UK with her 2024 BRITs sweep and acclaimed tour and festival performances, but a Grammy win coupled with a dazzling performance could help her make some real strides in the States – especially on the heels of her forthcoming “Born Again” collaboration with LISA and Doja Cat.   ', '', 'Jason Lipshutz: Doechii is a long shot for best new artist, but as a hip-hop artist who’s been crossing over to a greater listenership for months, and a scheduled performer at the Grammys ceremony, she could cause an eruption of attention regardless of how she fares in the category. And if she pulls off an upset in the best rap album category, as the only woman nominated this year against superstars like Eminem, J. Cole and Future? Get ready for one of the most memorable acceptance speeches of the evening.', 'Andrew Unterberger: Fontaines D.C. The toast of the adult alternative world leveled up commercially in a big way this year, and I could see the band walking away with either or both of best rock album and best alternative music performance. You won’t see them on the main telecast, natch, but it should make for some nice headlines (and maybe a memorable pre-show acceptance speech) for the ascendant Irish quintet.', '5. Outside of the educated guesses you’ve already made here, make one bold prediction for Grammy night.', 'Katie Atkinson: My hot take going into this year’s Grammys is that Doechii has a solid chance to be a spoiler in the best new artist category. I still think it’s Chappell’s to lose, but you can feel the buzz and respect around Doechii that’s been building for years. I vividly remember seeing her perform for the first time at the 2023 Billboard Women in Music event and being absolutely blown away by her talent, and she seems to have that effect on anyone who gets the chance to see her work her magic. She also has three other nominations down ballot, and if she could pick up one of those – maybe best rap album for the spellbinding Alligator Bites Never Heal and/or best rap performance for “NISSAN ALTIMA” – she has a real chance to make a lasting impression on Sunday night. And she’s performing too!', '', 'Eric Renner Brown: I love Khruangbin more than any of this year’s best new artist nominees. I also do not think Khruangbin should win best new artist – because Chappell and Doechii feel like generational talents; because several of these artists have had massive chart success, when Khruangbin has had virtually none; because Khruangbin has been around for more than a decade and a best new artist win for them would stretch the Grammys’ definition of “new” to a comical extreme. But the three things that are certain in life are death, taxes and the Grammys Grammy-ing – and Recording Academy voters disregarding all these arguments to award Khruanbgin best new artist would be such a classic example that it almost feels likely to me.', 'Kyle Denis: Whoever wins AOTY goes home with nothing else. ', 'Jason Lipshutz: Taylor Swift is the most nominated artist in the history of the song of the year category, with eight career nods — but zero wins. That last part changes on Sunday: although I don’t think an album of the year win for The Tortured Poets Department is likely, “Fortnight,” her somehow-underrated duet with Post Malone, snaps her song of the year losing streak.', 'Andrew Unterberger: Chappell Roan decides against delivering another run-through of her much-nominated “Good Luck, Babe!” and instead opts for a pointed performance of LGBTQ anthem “Pink Pony Club” — with a guest appearance from Sir Elton John.', '', 'Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

A few weeks ago, the thought of an awards show in Los Angeles, where entire neighborhoods went up in flames, seemed unthinkable. But the Recording Academy withstood considerable pressure to postpone or even cancel the show in light of this month’s devastating wildfires, so here we are.', 'Live from Crypto.com Arena in L.A. and hosted by Trevor Noah, Music’s Biggest Night will be broadcast live on Sunday (Feb. 2) at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS.

A Grammy performance this year is unlikely: Lamar is set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show on Feb. 9.', 'This year’s telecast will carry an added sense of purpose: raising funds to support L.A. wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders. A series of special performances will highlight the show, including a salute to the life and legacy of Grammy legend Quincy Jones, tributes to the spirit of Los Angeles, and the annual In Memoriam segment.', '', 'Swift, who won album of the year at the 2024 Grammy Awards, and Victoria Monét, who won best new artist on that show, are set to present on this year’s show.
