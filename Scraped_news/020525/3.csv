Can the President Dissolve USAID by Executive Order?,https://www.justsecurity.org/107267/can-president-dissolve-usaid-by-executive-order/,"['by Tess Bridgeman', 'February 1, 2025', 'Civil service, Congress, Department of State, Donald Trump, Executive Orders, Foreign Aid/Foreign Assistance, humanitarian assistance, Security Assistance, Trump administration second term, USAID', '', '', 'President Donald Trump may be preparing to issue an Executive Order (E.O.) purporting to dissolve the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and fold some or all of its functions into the State Department, according to reporting that emerged on Friday, Jan. 31. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Chris Murphy (D-CT), among others, immediately objected that the president does not have the authority to dismantle USAID without an act of Congress. As of Sat., Feb. 1, the USAID website appeared to have gone dark. Dissolving USAID would be a final assault on the foreign aid agency, where the administration already has issued a stop-work order for huge swaths of development assistance and other aid, abruptly put at least 56 of its senior career staffers on administrative leave, and laid off several hundred contractors working directly for the agency. ', 'Such an action, however, likely would go far beyond the executive branch’s actual legal authority. The bottom line: while some functions delegated from the president to the secretary of state, and in turn to the administrator of USAID, could likely be pulled back by executive action alone, wholesale dissolution of the agency or formal transfer of functions provided by Congress would require legislation. Let’s unpack why.', 'No, not lawfully. In 1961, USAID was created by an E.O. issued by President John F. Kennedy (E.O. 10973), based in part on authority provided in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. But a later act of Congress (The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, 22 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) established USAID as its own agency. In a section titled “Status of AID” (22 U.S.C. 6563) it states:', 'Unless abolished pursuant to the reorganization plan submitted under section 6601 of this title, and except as provided in section 6562 of this title, there is within the Executive branch of Government the United States Agency for International Development as an entity described in section 104 of title 5. (emphasis added)', 'The key language here is “there is within the Executive branch of Government [USAID]” (see sections 6562/6563). Those are the words Congress uses to establish an agency within the executive branch. It would take an act of Congress to reverse that – simply put, the president may not unilaterally override a statute by executive order.  ', 'The 1998 statute also transfers only certain functions of USAID to the State Department, and in essence requires USAID to handle all other pre-existing USAID functions described in the Foreign Assistance Act. This means that, at a minimum, Congress asserted a role for itself in such transfers of functions as well as early as 1998. ', 'Also in the 1998 Act, Congress gave the president a near-term, time-limited opportunity to reorganize these departments (22 USC 6601). Specifically, the Act provides, among other things, that within “60 days after October 21, 1998,” the president may, in a “reorganization plan and report” to be provided to Congress:', '“(1) … provide for the abolition of the Agency for International Development and the transfer of all its functions to the Department of State or (2) in lieu of the abolition and transfer of functions . . . provide for the transfer to and consolidation within the Department of the functions set forth in section 6581 of this title; and may provide for additional consolidation, reorganization, and streamlining of AID . . .”  ', 'President Bill Clinton submitted the statutorily-envisioned report to Congress on Dec. 30, 1998, within Congress’ specified 60-day window. In that report, the Clinton administration explicitly chose to retain the independence of USAID as its own agency (while providing for certain forms of coordination and resource sharing). It stated: ', '(d) United States Agency for International Development. Effective April 1, 1999, the United States Agency for International Development shall continue as an independent establishment in the Executive Branch.', 'Congress provided the president the opportunity to modify or revise that plan (6601(e)) until the effective date of the reorganization plan, which the 1998 Act specified as no later than April 1, 1999 with respect to some USAID functions, and Oct. 1, 1999, with respect to the opportunity for abolition of the agency (6601(g)(2)). No prospective modification or reorganization authority was granted to the president beyond those effective dates. ', 'Finally, a much more recent provision of law – section 7063 of the FY24 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (later incorporated into the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024) – explicitly requires both congressional consultation and notification to Congress for reorganizations, consolidations, or downsizing of USAID. Absent consultation and notification, actions to “eliminate, consolidate, or downsize” USAID or “the United States official presence overseas” would not be lawful.  ', 'In short, Congress established USAID as its own agency and asserted its role in transfers of functions between USAID and State. It authorized the president to abolish or reorganize USAID for a moment in time, in accordance with the plan it authorized the then-president to provide in 1998. That reorganization occurred, with USAID’s independence retained. And there is no additional authority granted by Congress to the president to abolish USAID as an agency. ', 'As even the brief overview above demonstrates, USAID and the State Department are deeply connected agencies, and there may be legitimate policy reasons to seek to reorganize or restructure their relationship in some ways. Some of those measures could be undertaken unilaterally within the executive branch (like ensuring USAID activities hew closely to the State Department’s country strategies at posts in the field, or even transferring certain presidentially-delegated functions as noted above). At the same time, there are also compelling policy reasons for USAID to retain its own, independent leadership structure, which is the choice made by Congress, and by the presidency when given an opportunity by Congress to decide this issue in the past. ', 'If the Trump administration wishes to engage in a process with Congress to justify its view that USAID should no longer exist as its own agency, and seek legislation to effectuate that policy, it can do so. But wholesale dissolution of USAID, without an act of Congress, should not be confused with real, policy-oriented reform. It should instead be understood as another component of the Trump administration’s broadside against foreign assistance and U.S. government institutions writ large.', 'USAID has ongoing activities in more than 120 countries, with dozens of field offices around the globe. It works in the poorest countries, in countries affected by conflict, and in geopolitically strategic areas for advancing U.S. interests. Especially in light of the Trump administration’s already deeply damaging freeze on foreign aid, impacting everything from counter-trafficking and counter-narcotics assistance programs, to programs aimed at conflict prevention and stabilization, strengthening democratic governance, improving global health and food security, and more, the consequences of this action could be devastating to U.S. national security interests and to the well-being of some of the world’s most vulnerable populations.', 'Litigation and congressional oversight are certain to follow, but the question is how effective either will be in the immediate term at stopping the most damaging impacts for USAID’s programs and its employees. The details of the E.O. will shape how specific challenges to the action unfold, but expect to see at a minimum suits brought by beneficiaries of USAID programs, impoundment act challenges, and more.

Elon Musk calls USAID ‘a criminal organization.’ Here’s the truth.,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-musk-usaid-doge-foreign-aid-rcna190671,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'After just two weeks in power, President Donald Trump and his top donor and adviser, Elon Musk, are declaring war on U.S. foreign aid.', 'Within hours of taking office, Trump issued an executive order suspending all U.S. foreign assistance. Days later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a stop-work order for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. ', 'Then, the purge started. Dozens of USAID’s top leaders were placed on immediate leave. Hundreds of support staff were let go, and those remaining were told not only to stop funding development work, but also cut off communication with partner organizations. USAID employees were told to stay home and the agency’s website was taken down. ', 'Across the globe, aid agencies have been forced to lay off staff, turn away the needy and even shut down operations.', 'Then, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — which isn’t an official department within the federal government — sent workers in their late teens and early 20s, with no federal government experience, to demand access to personnel records and classified material. Security officials who tried to stop them were placed on administrative leave. Now Washington is abuzz with speculation that Trump will try to shut down USAID or fold it into the State Department (two actions that he is forbidden by law from taking).', 'The impact around the world has been immediate and catastrophic. ', 'No country on earth is more affected by malaria then Uganda. Every single day, the mosquito-borne disease kills 14 children under the age of 5. Because of Trump and Musk’s actions, Uganda’s Malaria Council has suspended insecticide spraying and shipments of bed nets, one of the most effective tools in limiting the spread of the disease, have ended.', 'Medical supplies to help pregnant women and save babies from dying of diarrhea are no longer reaching villagers in Zambia.', 'Efforts to eradicate polio and stop an outbreak of the Marburg virus, which is similar to Ebola and has a death rate of up to 90%, have stopped. ', 'One of the most popular and effective U.S. government health programs, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has saved tens of millions of lives from the scourge of AIDS, is also halted. This includes the delivery of daily medications that are keeping alive 20 million people in 50 countries who are HIV-positive.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'In Sudan, staffers at a U.S.-supported aid agency faced an impossible choice — “defy President Donald Trump’s order to immediately stop their operations or let up to 100 babies and toddlers die.”', 'Thankfully, they chose to save the children in their care, but they still may run out of supplies in weeks or face reprisals from the Trump administration.', 'Across the globe, aid agencies have been forced to lay off staff, turn away the needy and even shut down operations. ', 'Meanwhile, back in Washington, Musk has sent out a host of tweets calling “USAID a criminal organization,” comparing foreign aid to “money laundering,” and calling USAID employees an “arm of the radical-left globalists.”', 'For good measure, Trump said the agency was “run by a bunch of radical lunatics.”', 'In all its forms, foreign aid is a crucial aspect of American soft power.', 'USAID is far from perfect. It’s too reliant on for-profit contractors when it should be working more closely with local groups in the countries it serves. But considering how little a percentage of the federal budget it represents (around 1%), it’s also an agency that punches far above its weight. For example, it’s the world’s largest supplier of humanitarian aid even though, in percentage terms, less of the U.S. federal budget goes to development assistance than in other Western countries.', 'However, the United States does not spend $68 billion on foreign aid simply out of the goodness of its heart. Foreign assistance has always been a tool for furthering U.S. national security interests. Indeed, the impetus for PEPFAR and fighting AIDS was that it was seen as a way to build goodwill toward the U.S. as the American military traversed the world after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, fighting the global war on terrorism. ', 'In all its forms, foreign aid is a crucial aspect of American soft power and for an expenditure 12 times smaller than the Pentagon’s $815 billion budget. ', 'But foreign aid does more than spread goodwill and positive attitudes toward the U.S. A world that is freer (USAID supports democracy promotion programs), more economically liberal (USAID fosters local entrepreneurship and economic growth), healthier and better educated is also less prone to conflict. That’s because countries that are democratic, enjoy higher living standards and are intertwined in the global economic system are less likely to go to war with their neighbors. As the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, has noted, “USAID’s efforts can do as much — over the long term — to prevent conflict as the deterrent effects of carrier strike group or a marine expeditionary force.” Or, as former Defense Secretary Robert Gates put it, “Development is a lot cheaper than sending soldiers.”', 'Taking USAID and U.S. foreign assistance off the global chessboard creates a political vacuum that other countries — like China — can fill. Indeed, it should perhaps not come as a shock that former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has publicly praised Musk’s efforts. Dismantling USAID is a gift to America’s rivals. ', 'However, the more significant danger is that without USAID, America risks creating instability and hardship that could lead to more conflict, greater migration flows and undermining potential trading partners.', 'What Trump and Musk are doing to USAID and foreign assistance in general isn’t just illegal and ill-conceived — but it’s also undermining U.S. national security.

A few days later it summarily dismissed the senior career leadership and then thousands of mid-level staff from USAID, essentially preventing the agency from carrying out its legislative mandated responsibilities. These decisions impact the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who manage our critical foreign assistance programs and tens of thousands of citizens in developing countries who either implement or are the beneficiaries of U.S. assistance—in many situations, depriving individuals of lifesaving medical care.', 'The damage to the U.S. reputation and image is so great that China and Russia do not have to do anything to benefit from this self-inflicted wound.', 'In addition, the administration appears to be in the process, contrary to law and without the consent of Congress, of moving USAID into the Department of State. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 established USAID as an independent agency with, what in an org chart would be represented by a dotted line, the administrator receiving foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State.', 'More recently, section 7036 of the 2024 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, states explicitly that Congress prohibits:', '… reorganization, redesign, or other plan described in subsection (b) by the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, or any other Federal department, agency, or organization funded by this Act without prior consultation by the head of such department, agency, or organization with the appropriate congressional committees. …', 'We have seen this act before, in the mid/late 1990s and again in 2017. During the Clinton Administration, Senator Jessie Helms led an effort to merge the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the U.S. Information Agency (USIA), and USAID into the Department of State. This occurred in the context of extensive and informed discussions within and between the two branches of government. The outcome was the 1998 law that folded ACDA and USIA into the State Department and statutorily established USAID as an independent agency.', 'In 2017, when the first Trump Administration was reported to be contemplating moving USAID into State, multiple organizations and experts reviewed alternatives of how to best organize the government to carry out foreign assistance and came up with innovative and thoughtful proposals—see here and here—which concluded that it was best to maintain a strong and independent American global development agency.', 'Why separate structures for diplomacy and development', 'Development and diplomacy are instruments designed to advance our national interests. They often pursue interlocking objectives, but have different missions, expertise, cultures, and timelines.', 'Diplomacy, development, and defense are the three-legged stool upon which the U.S. national security strategy rests. While sharing the same overall goal—advancing U.S. strategic interests in the world—their specific missions and how they function are quite different. Each requires well-trained professionals with differing expertise.', 'Diplomacy seeks closer relations with foreign governments so as to encourage alignment with U.S. foreign policy. USAID’s mission is to advance development, which requires working not just with government but also with civil society and business communities to advance the multiple nodes of economic, political, and social activity that comprise the complex nature of society. Diplomacy tends to have a short time and transactional horizon while development a medium/long-term horizon with emphasis on evaluating the achievement of results, sometimes putting the two missions at odds and limiting their ability to function well in the same organization.', 'Because USAID’s main focus is program design and oversight, most of the workforce is trained in specific sector expertise, like health, education, agriculture, and the management, compliance, and monitoring required to ensure programs are executed in a cost-effective and accountable way. USAID programs often extend throughout a country, allowing local staff and partners to have reach beyond capitals (the focus of diplomacy), which allows for deeper understanding of countries and communities and building relations at all layers of society.', 'As clearly explained in a blog by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition in 2017:', 'In practice, this means that the State Department is primarily concerned with state-to-state relations with foreign governments and short-term goals that enhance American security, while USAID often has closer ties with the broader population whose health, education, and economic prosperity are the focus of U.S. foreign assistance, with the goal of fostering long-term stability and economic growth in a country.', 'The folding of the foreign aid program into the foreign ministries of Canada and Australia has been assessed to have undercut the development function. Likewise, with the merger of the highly respected U.K. independent Department of International Development (DFID) with the Foreign Ministry into the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), the U.K. government lost expertise in program expertise and accountability.', 'As articulated by Andrew Natsios, administrator of USAID in the George W. Bush administration, in distinguishing between USAID and the Department of State:', '… beyond that they are dissimilar in every important way: The tasks they perform, what they value, their operating principles and how they carry out their work are profoundly different. ', 'Combining the two institutions would be comparable to merging Microsoft with ExxonMobil. And if this forced marriage were to occur, rather than creating “efficiencies,” it would make our development programs less effective and our emergency relief less responsive, while detrimentally politicizing our foreign aid.', 'The corporate rule is to separate disparate activities—in this case, defense, diplomacy, and development—into separate entities so as to have clear lines of authority and accountability. Following that practice, the smart and clear-cut reform actually would be to move all development programs into USAID so State can focus on its core mission of foreign policy and diplomacy.', 'There is a regular process for changing the structures of the executive branch. In the past, Congress has given administrations reorganization authority, under which the president proposes modifications to bureaucratic organizations in consultation with the Congress.', 'But until it deems otherwise, the Congress must insist that the administration uphold the law by maintaining the statutorily required independence of USAID—and that its staff be allowed to carry out the congressionally mandated responsibility to execute the foreign assistance policies and resources the Congress has authorized.', 'AUTHOR', '', 'The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.\nWe are supported by a diverse array of funders.

Yesterday, personnel at USAID were not permitted to enter the agency’s headquarters, and Elon Musk announced that President Donald Trump agreed to close the agency and move it under the State Department – which Trump has no legal authority to do. The Trump Administration, led by Mr. Musk, has also furloughed thousands of senior career civil servants, including two top security officials who denied Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency access to classified documents and systems.', '“…We are deeply concerned by reports of not only growing chaos and dysfunction at the Department of State, but the Administration’s brazen and illegal attempts to destroy the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Mass personnel furloughs of dubious legality and abrupt, blanket stop-work orders without regard to relevant appropriations laws are causing immediate harm to U.S. national security, placing U.S. citizens at risk, disrupting life-saving work and breaking the U.S. government’s contractual obligations to private sector partners,” wrote the 37 U.S. Senators.', 'The senators continued, “The Administration’s failure to consult with Congress prior to taking these steps violates the law and impedes Congress’s constitutional duty to conduct oversight of funding, personnel and the nation’s foreign policy. The Administration’s failure to expend funds appropriated on a bipartisan basis by Congress would violate the Impoundment Control Act.”', '“Foreign assistance is critical to supporting U.S. strategic interests around the world. Foreign assistance protects U.S. national security, advances U.S. values, and ensures the U.S. is the partner of choice for everything from defense procurement to cutting edge scientific research. China, Russia and Iran are already moving rapidly to exploit the vacuum and instability left by the U.S.’s sudden global retreat,” wrote the senators.', 'They continued, “Every Administration has the right to review and adjust ongoing assistance programming. However, attempting to arbitrarily turn off core functions of a critical U.S. national security agency, without Congressional consideration or any metric-based review and absent legal authority to do so, is unprecedented and deeply disturbing.”', 'In addition to Kaine, Reed, and Whitehouse, the letter is signed by U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Peter Welch (D-VT), Edward J.

Trump’s USAID Purge and Foreign Aid Turmoil Spark Global Security Concerns,https://www.csis.org/analysis/trumps-usaid-purge-and-foreign-aid-turmoil-spark-global-security-concerns,"['Photo: J. David Ake/Getty Images', 'Commentary by Noam Unger', 'Published February 3, 2025', 'Over the past fortnight, the administration has prohibited all new programming and issued a broad “stop-work” order on existing U.S. foreign assistance programs. In one fell swoop it removed more than 50 career civil and foreign service leaders of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and then suspended others for allegedly trying to maintain basic rules associated with employment terminations or security related to sensitive and classified information. In a whirlwind, the clamp down included the removal of USAID’s account from X and its website from the internet. Yesterday, the administration conveyed its intent to shut down the agency as rumors also swirled that President Trump will effectively force the battered organization into the Department of State. Today, employees were informed in the wee hours of the morning not to show up at USAID’s headquarters, and later in the day, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he is taking over as the agency’s acting administrator. In this same time period, hundreds of USAID contract employees have been laid off or furloughed. Nongovernmental organizations and other humanitarian and development enterprises that partner with the U.S. government through grants and contracts have laid off well over a thousand employees so far. While many humanitarian and development programs sputtered to a standstill, and as thousands of people working to improve lives, livelihoods, health, and freedoms internationally were separated from their jobs, vulnerable communities around the world began to feel the effects of a vanishing partner.', 'Although some administration leaders have harshly derided the agency based on caricatures, USAID has actually represented American ideas in action. I worked there during three presidential administrations, including the first Trump administration. The people who served at the agency across all different hiring categories, including foreign service nationals, contract employees, civil service leaders, and foreign service officers, struck me as a particularly dedicated and highly trained group. There was always a mix of conservatives and liberals, though such viewpoints seldom came through in the nonpartisan work of the agency, executed with bipartisan U.S. political support. These experts—many with years of experience in specialty areas of agriculture, economics, security, and public health—are exemplary public servants, and many routinely put their lives on the line. That’s why the entrance of USAID’s lobby has featured a solemn memorial to the employees who lost their lives doing such work on behalf of the American people.', 'There are real reasons to care about development and humanitarian aid. Its share of the federal budget, less than one hundredth, should not be one of them. Despite its relatively small size and a name that subtly belies its importance, foreign aid is critical to U.S. foreign policy, national security, and international standing. Through U.S. global health programs focused on AIDS and malaria, for example, the United States has saved more than 35 million lives around the world over the past couple of decades. Programs to strengthen health systems additionally identify and contain the spread of infectious diseases, work essential to any commitment to maintain or even improve the health of Americans.', 'Assistance focused on food, water, and agricultural markets to prevent hunger is another easily recognizable area of development and humanitarian support. After all, the United States is the largest provider of food assistance. But strategic financial support in this and other areas is about a lot more than direct service delivery. Better systems and information are key. Take, for example, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which was initially created by USAID during the Reagan administration in response to crises in Africa. That U.S. innovation developed into one of the world’s preeminent sources of information and analysis about impending food crises, demonstrating the value of such technology-fueled information management programs for U.S. efforts ranging from Sudan to Afghanistan. Such systems, drawing on satellite-enabled remote sensing data and collaborative networks across the U.S. government and globally, only become more important in a world of increasingly extreme weather impacts. As of this past week, FEWS NET and so many other valuable programs supported by U.S. foreign assistance were halted and pulled offline.', 'All of this is not to say that reforming foreign aid is unimportant. Rather it is continuously needed. Recent presidential administrations have each implemented numerous reforms to make U.S. foreign assistance operate more effectively and efficiently. Whether it was to make programs faster, more transparent, or more likely to strengthen a stricken community’s ability to pick itself back up in the future, working with Congress was always a key ingredient for successful reform. The Bush administration’s establishment of the Millennium Challenge Corporation enabled bigger, longer-term infrastructure investment partnerships with promising country partners, while the first Trump administration stood up the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. These investment-oriented innovations, developed closely with Congress, are worth continuing to build upon while leveraging USAID’s private sector engagement programs and its on-the-ground presence in countries around the world.', 'With regard to USAID’s future, Musk has said it is “time for it to die,” and that President Trump has agreed to shut it down. Every administration over the last 75 years has wanted to shape foreign aid in line with its goals, but making an imprint on U.S. foreign assistance is one thing, turning it into a fossil is another. Hollowing out and then strangling the system into extinction through executive actions is akin to throwing away our toolbox or unilaterally disarming at a time of mounting geopolitical competition for partnerships globally. It does not make us safer or well-positioned to influence the world for the better.', 'In reaction to the Trump administration’s early steps, news coverage is increasingly drawing attention to transnational threats mitigated by foreign assistance, like corruption, conflict, and criminal networks connected to the trafficking of people and drugs. Some Democratic members of Congress held a press event at the front doors of the agency headquarters to voice their concerns. Well-researched news stories on community impacts and U.S. global standing will surely follow. The damage from an ongoing bureaucratic purge, and the associated chain reaction, however, will already be severe.', 'We should all care about foreign aid—we should care enough to make it better, not kill it. While a more measured approach to sharpening U.S. tools of foreign assistance and national security investments would be prudent, that does not seem to be in the offing. Republicans and Democrats in Congress, the branch of government that should have the authority to establish, fund, or dissolve entire agencies of the U.S. government, should demand it.', 'Noam Unger is the director of the Sustainable Development and Resilience Initiative and a senior fellow with the Project on Prosperity and Development at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.', 'Commentary is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

As originally conceived, the agency was meant to distribute aid in a way that advances U.S. interests, ideally without antagonizing the local population.', 'But, for decades now, the agency has apparently strayed from that mission.', 'In 1994, whistleblower Paul Neifert revealed that the agency was distributing U.S. aid based on race in violation of federal law.', '“As far as I’m concerned, Mr. Musk is quite correct in calling USAID a criminal organization,” Neifert told National Review. “Their misconduct goes back years in my case and is not surprising to those familiar with USAID methods. This apple is indeed rotten.”', 'Stationed in South Africa three decades ago, Neifert accused senior USAID officials of violating procurement laws and the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act that authorized U.S. assistance to the country following the end of apartheid in 1990. On top of being illegal, it was also a self-defeating policy, Neifert explained.', '“In bizarre fashion, it was in conflict with the non-racial ideals of pre- and post-Mandela South Africa, which held that abolishment of the raced-based system of apartheid was for the benefit of all members of its ‘rainbow’ coalition,” he said.', '“USAID instituted its twisted version of a race-based, spoils system, which required its staff to circumvent U.S. procurement laws by providing USAID funding on a racialized basis to USAID’s favored recipients both in the U.S. and South Africa.”', 'Neifert went to the press and Congress with his allegations while fighting against the agency in court. He ultimately settled for monetary compensation and agreed to leave USAID after twelve years. The whistleblower left in “disgust,” he said.', 'More recently, USAID continued its track record of working against U.S. interests by awarding the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance millions of dollars in grants, which ended up helping to fund risky bat coronavirus research at a lab in Wuhan, China — research that is now widely believed to be responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'The agency planned to renew EcoHealth’s funding even after the pandemic until it was forced to cut off all funding under immense political pressure last year.', 'Senator Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) pushed to suspend the flow of American taxpayer dollars to EcoHealth.', '“From funneling tax dollars for batty studies with the Wuhan Institute in China, to sending Ukrainians to Paris Fashion Week, USAID has been one of the worst offenders of waste in Washington,” Ernst told NR.', '“The agency charges roughly 50–60 percent for ‘negotiated indirect cost rate agreements,’ which is Washington speak for shady contractors lining their pockets through overhead costs and charging taxpayers for fancy dinners. It is long past time to put the American people first and stop the wasteful and dangerous spending by USAID.”', 'In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed about $43.4 billion on foreign assistance programs primarily related to sectors such as governance, humanitarian, and health, per an updated January report from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service. The third largest sector, health services, received $7 billion in funding.', 'Because USAID receives foreign policy guidance from the State Department, the agency will reportedly fold into State if the administration gets its way.', '“There are probably some arguments to be made about what could be important work that falls under USAID, but the fact of the matter is, it has been overshadowed by these bad actors,” Ernst said on an X Spaces livestream that Musk hosted. “If there are truly good pro-American programs, then let’s move them to the State Department. Let’s make sure we have proper oversight.”', 'Another controversial funding area involved $230 million that USAID sent to support the Palestinian people, contributing to the $2.1 billion total in humanitarian aid provided since October 7, 2023. At least some of that funding was expected to fall into the hands of Hamas terrorists, according to an October 2023 letter from the House Oversight Committee to then-USAID administrator Samantha Power. The letter pointed out that Palestinian aid had been cut under the Trump administration because it couldn’t be safely accounted for, only for the Biden administration to open the tap on it once again.', 'In addition to those big-ticket items, like Palestinian aid, USAID spends relatively small amounts of money on bizarre cultural projects that appear to have no purpose other than to promote niche left-wing ideologies around race and gender.', 'White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cited a few such programs in a recent statement to reporters: $1.5 million to “advance DEI in Serbia’s workplaces,” $70,000 for an Irish DEI-centric musical, $47,000 for a “transgender opera” in Colombia, and $32,000 on a “transgender comic book” in Peru.', '“As an American taxpayer, I don’t want my dollars going toward this crap, and I know the American people don’t either,” Leavitt told reporters. “And that’s exactly what Elon Musk has been tasked by President Trump to do — to get the fraud, waste, and abuse out of our federal government.”', 'While Republicans are on board with shutting down or otherwise merging USAID with the State Department, Democrats are pushing back.', 'Start your mornings with expert political insights from NR’s Jim Geraghty.', 'Hours after the agency’s doors were closed for the day, Senator Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) placed a blanket hold on Trump’s State Department nominees to protest what congressional Democrats called an illegal shutdown of USAID.', '“Dismantling USAID is illegal and makes us less safe,” Schatz said before explaining that Congress needs to pass a law to eliminate or fundamentally change the agency. “This is self-inflicted chaos of epic proportions that will have dangerous consequences all around the world.”', 'Meanwhile, Trump is pushing the narrative that because USAID is run by “radical lunatics,” executive action needs to be taken. When asked if Congress is the only one that can “do away” with USAID, Trump suggested that may not be the case if USAID is found to have engaged in fraud.', '“I don’t know, I don’t think so. Not when it comes to fraud,” the president told reporters. “These people are lunatics, and if it comes to fraud, you wouldn’t have an act of Congress. I’m not sure that you would anyway, but we just want to do the right thing. It’s something that should have been done a long time ago.”', 'While Musk called USAID a “criminal organization” that needs to “die,” the agency is a creation of Congress and it’s unclear just how far Musk can go in dismantling it without congressional approval.', '“Elon Musk, you didn’t create USAID. The United States Congress did for the American people,” Representative Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said during a press conference outside the agency’s closed headquarters. “And just like Elon Musk did not create USAID, he doesn’t have the power to destroy it. And who’s going to stop him? We are!”', 'If USAID does survive in some form, along with some of its existing workforce, Secretary of State Marco Rubio could have a hard time bringing the agency to heel, as Mark Moyar knows from experience.', 'Moyar was a senior political appointee at USAID during Trump’s first term.
