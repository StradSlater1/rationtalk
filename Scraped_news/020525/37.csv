Monster Hunter Wilds: everything we know about the open world Wilds,https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/monster-hunter-wilds-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-wilds/,"['What to expect from the newest addition to the Monster Hunter series', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""Monster Hunter Wilds is launching in February, so now is the perfect time to get to grips with what to expect the next time you head out on a hunt. It's been a long wait for those of us desperate to play ever since the game was announced in 2023, and even though we've seen a reasonable amount of trailers since its reveal, there's still a lot to know ahead of launch."", ""Whether you're just looking to brush up your knowledge on the series, or you're keen to learn ahead of your first ever hunt, here's all the important information about the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds so you'll know how to prepare for your next expedition ahead of time."", '', ""The Monster Hunter Wilds release date is February 28, 2025, and it'll release simultaneously on PC and console. You'll be able to download the game through Steam, but it's currently unclear as to whether or not it will be Steam Deck compatible. It's the first mainline game from the Monster Hunter series to launch on PC day one, as well."", ""Unfortunately, there is no early access for PC players, even if you participated in either of the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta tests. If you pre-order the game ahead of its launch, you will get a number of in-game rewards like avatar cosmetics too. If you've got save files in Monster Hunter Worlds and Iceborne, you'll also receive a set of armour for your Palico for each save file."", 'Monster Hunter Wilds was announced with a reveal trailer shown at The Game Awards in 2023. With plenty of sweeping shots of what we now know as the Windward Plains and a stampede of Doshaguma, our first introduction to Monster Hunter Wilds was pretty much just a teaser.', ""Luckily, there have since been five promotional trailers for Monster Hunter Wilds. Each has shown a different landscape and a different monster, with the fifth featuring the Oilwell Basin and three new monsters. We've had a trailer for each weapon, a beginners guide to Monster Hunter video, and some general videos about the mechanics of the game. With a handful of new mechanics to learn such as Focus Mode, these videos are great for anyone who missed either of the beta tests."", '', ""Monster Hunter Wilds has fourteen different weapons confirmed, and we don't expect any more to be announced ahead of its release. They're all weapons that fans will recognize as standard for the series but there are new moves for a select few weapons and new ways to use both monsters and the surrounding environment to your advantage within a hunt with things like natural traps."", 'Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.', ""A new addition for the game is Focus Mode, which allows you to aim your attacks or guards rather than dashing in all guns blazing. This mode can also highlight any wounds or weak points on the monster worth targeting to make your attacks more successful. While in Focus Mode, you'll also be able to perform Focus Strikes on these wounds and weaknesses to deal significant damage and potentially stunning the monster."", ""There are also a few encounters worth keeping in mind while you are hunting. For example, you may engage in a power clash with a monster when blocking against certain attacks. If you successfully defend yourself, you'll push the monster back and knock it off balance to open up the opportunity for a few more attacks before it regains its balance. Offset attacks also act similarly, knocking the monster off balance and opening up the opportunity for you to follow up with unique attacks to this scenario."", '', ""One of the biggest changes in Monster Hunter Wilds compared to previous games is the open world. Rather than taking on a quest from a board and being met with a loading screen before you head out on your hunt, you'll wander from your camp right out into a hunt. On paper, it doesn't sound like a drastic change, but from what we've experienced in the beta test, it helps to immerse yourself into the Forgotten Lands even further thanks to the seamless transition between preparing for a hunt and heading out without any clunky loading screens taking away from the tension."", ""The world also has a changing climate with dynamic weather which you'll have to adapt to and prepare for each time you head out. There are two distinct seasons, Fallow and Plenty, which both offer a variation of creatures to hunt. Fallow is described on the Monster Hunter Wilds website as a period where predators roam the land for food, while Plenty is the complete opposite and the land is rich with life and monsters of all shapes and sizes. As it stands, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to how often these seasons will change. Between the two seasons there is a transitional period referred to as Inclemency. During this time, the apex predator of each area will appear."", ""In terms of different environments, currently we only know about three: the Windward Plains, Scarlet Forest, and the Oilwell Basin. We expect at least one more to be revealed closer to, if not at launch, but those details haven't been shared yet. We're still yet to receive a full list of every monster you can find across each biome too, so there are bound to be some surprises kept hidden until we can track them down ourselves."", '', ""You'll still be able to fire an SOS signal while you're already hunting to invite three players to join you. But, you'll be able to join a lobby from the main menu too. This means you can jump right into co-op without having to queue up a hunt first and recruit players into it."", ""If you aren't gearing up to play with your pals, you can also join a recommended lobby which adds you to the most popular lobby based on your preset preferences. You'll be able to adjust your lobby preferences by playstyle, skill level, and language."", ""Firing an SOS flare isn't exclusive to inviting other players either. You can also call NPC Support Hunters to help you out. So, even if you're enjoying the experience alone you won't have to face every single beast with no assistance. Support Hunters will automatically join your party if a certain amount of time passes without enough players joining your party. But if you want to alter this, you can set the maximum number of players to call or even turn off Support Hunters at the Quest Counter."", 'Kara is an evergreen writer.

Hopefully it's not always so dark and dingy there."", 'Capcom also expanded on the details of this week\'s open beta test. It\'ll be the same as the last one for the most part, but Capcom\'s dropped in a few new hunts, including our first chance to fight Wilds\' flagship monster, Arkveld.

"The Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark is here, and my poor RTX 3070 is now crying sub-60 fps tears",https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/the-monster-hunter-wilds-benchmark-is-here-and-my-poor-rtx-3070-is-now-crying-sub-60-fps-tears/,"[""Monster Hunter Wilds is forcing me to make some difficult sacrifices, though DLSS 4 looks like it's going to help my aging GPU."", 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'Is there a PC gaming experience more universal than poking at graphics settings one at a time, dropping anisotropic filtering and rendering distance from high, to medium, to low, in the forlorn hope of seeing the framerate counter inch over the 60 fps line? I found myself in that familiar spot this afternoon when Capcom released the Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark on Steam. It promises to offer a sense of how well the game will run on our PCs at launch, and made me face the harsh reality that my RTX 3070 isn\'t going to let me keep nearly as many of those settings on ""high"" as I\'d like. Painful choices lie ahead.', ""I'll admit I'm hoping for a lot from a four-year-old graphics card that has only 8GB of VRAM (which was stingy then, and feels particularly stingy now!); I use a 1440p monitor, and that resolution isn't compatible with running many cutting edge games at 60 fps without some settings dropped right down to the floor."", ""Enter DLSS, hopefully my saviour. On Wilds' default high settings with DLSS set to Balanced, I got a respectable 54.43 fps average; sounds good on the surface, but that average number is close to meaningless for a benchmark that runs as long as this one does. Some scenes in the benchmark are significantly less demanding, sending the framerate up into the 70s and 80s; but when the weather effects and complex monster animations start popping off in large, detailed environments, it drops a whole lot lower than 54 frames per second."", ""So I started tinkering. I turned down texture quality and gave up some fur fuzziness and made the sky a little bit uglier and sacrificed rendering distance, even though it pained me for a game that's all about the sweeping plains and wide-open deserts... but doing all that at least brought my average fps up by a whole... two! It looked like I was going to need to sacrifice on image quality and use DLSS Performance, or else pinch my nose and really turn down some signifcant settings to low."", ""There was one other option, though: using DLSS Swapper to switch to the new DLSS 4 upscaler. The Monster Hunter benchmark was using the older 3.7.10, and early impressions have pointed to DLSS 4's Performance mode looking as good or better as the older Balanced setting. So I swapped it out with a couple clicks in DLSS Swapper, reapplied my same graphical compromises, and was rewarded with an average of 64.24 frames per second. Now we're talkin'!"", '', ""Except, well, that's still an average of a very long benchmark, and even DLSS 4 Performance (which did look impressively clean to my eye) couldn't stop Wilds from dipping down to around 50 fps when the dramatic weather effects kicked off. It feels like I found a compromise I can live with, even if I'm sad to see 60 fps slip out of reach for my RTX 3070 unless I make some more dramatic sacrifices."", ""Ray tracing isn't even on the table, and I'm worried that in a real fight in the middle of a storm I'm going to see even lower frames than this controlled benchmark lets on. I think Capcom may be instigating more questions than it is offering reassuring answers by putting this in the hands of PC players a few weeks ahead of launch. But it does at least seem to indicate we're not looking at disastrous performance on day one."", 'Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.', ""Our hardware team will have much, much more to say about Monster Hunter Wilds' PC performance when we get our hands on the full game."", ""Wes has been covering games and hardware for more than 10 years, first at tech sites like The Wirecutter and Tested before joining the PC Gamer team in 2014.

This benchmark tool will allow you to test the game and see whether you are able to run it or not. As such, I highly recommend downloading and running it.', 'I’m downloading the tool right now, so I’ll be sure to update the article with a video and some first impressions. So, make sure to re-check the article after a few hours.', 'In Monster Hunter Wilds, hunters will have two weapon states. These two states are Sheathed and Drawn. In Sheathed Mode, you can run faster and use items. In Drawn Mode, your movement is limited but you can use your weapon to fight your enemies.', 'Players will be able to use the Seikreit as a means of travel. The Seikret is a creature that players can mount at any time. This creature can guide you automatically to the target monster for your current quest. While mounted, you can also recover your health, sharpen your weapon, gather useful hunting items and materials, or switch your primary and secondary weapons.', 'Players will also have access to the Slinger and the Hooker. The Slinger will allow you to fire various types of ammo that you can gather from the environment. On the other hand, the Hooker will allow you to gather items from a distance or interact with the environment.', 'As the devs have noted, Focus Mode will add a new layer to the hunt. Players will aim attacks or guards, and hit wounds that are highlighted in this mode for extra damage. Thus, you can use Focus Strikes to unleash special attacks for big damage to wounds and weak points.', 'You can download the PC benchmark tool from this link. This tool is around 23GB in size. Let’s also hope that it will run better than its Open Beta build.', 'Capcom will release Monster Hunter Wilds on February 28th. You can also find its official PC system requirements here. Finally, here is a new trailer that came out a few hours ago.', 'Stay tuned for more!', '', 'So I’ve tried the benchmark tool and I have mixed feelings about the game’s performance.', 'For these tests, I used an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D with 32GB of DDR5 at 6000Mhz and an NVIDIA RTX 5090. I also used Windows 10 64-bit, and the GeForce 57216 driver. Moreover, I’ve disabled the second CCD on our 7950X3D. That’s the ideal thing you can do for gaming on this particular CPU.', 'Let’s start with 1440p/Max Settings. Monster Hunter Wilds supports Ray Tracing for reflections so I’ve also enabled them. At Native 1440p/Max Settings/RT, I got an average of 96FPS. And when I enabled DLSS 3 Quality, I only got a boost of 6FPS. Ouch.', 'At Native 4K/Max Settings/Ray Tracing, I got an average of 72FPS. And that’s without using Frame Generation. Then, with DLSS 3 Quality Mode, I got 87FPS. For 4K with RT, these results are fine. But the performance difference between 1440p and 4K is only… 15FPS? Yes, the game is still very CPU-bound in cities but even during GPU-heavy scenes, the performance difference between 1440p and 4K is really low. So, I don’t know what’s going on here.', 'I also tried an 8K resolution with DLSS 3 Performance Mode and Frame Gen. The game does not support Multi-Frame Gen but even without it, it can push an average of 68.48FPS. I obviously do not recommend something like that.

It has been a wild Tuesday afternoon in the NHL, and Elliotte Friedman keeps on adding to it, as the NHL hockey insider revealed that the Nashville Predators are cutting ties with veteran center Vinnie Hinostroza and are placing him on waivers. It spells the end of the veteran\'s time with the Predators where he played in only 13 games and registered two points. The 10-year NHLer has seen his playing time drop significantly over the past few seasons, and it\'s unknown if a team has any spot for him at this time. The man affectionately known as ""Cousin Vinnie"" was drafted in the sixth round by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2012 and managed to carve out a role as a gritty defensively sound center who can score at times, but is better suited for playing defense and disrupting opponents. He was then traded to the Arizona Coyotes where he exploded for a 16-goal, 39-point season in 2018-19, but he has since bounced around to Florida, back to Chicago, then Buffalo, Pittsburgh and finally Nashville. Hinostroza was a standout for Notre Dame in his two seasons there. He was a point-per-game player there with 76 points in 76 games, and was named to the All-Rookie team as well as a First-Team All-Star. For his career, Hinostroza has 54 goals and 99 assists in 387 games while averaging 13:14 TOI. He signed with the Predators this season on a two-year, one-way deal worth $1.5M. Hinostroza could offer some insurance depth to a team looking for an extra body for the playoffs or to be a veteran presence to Nashville\'s youngsters down in Milwaukee if he clears waivers. It\'s unknown if teams will have a spot for the pivot.', 'NHL insider Frank Seravalli released his new updated trade board, and with the Maple Leafs needing some defensive help, one name could be a massive help on the blue line. GM Brad Treliving has to make some type of deal to help the Maple Leafs get to that next level, and whether it\'s a trade for a premium center or a shutdown defenseman, there are definite holes that need improving. Speculation abounds about who can be brought in, and Seravalli has been keeping an eye on things. His latest trade board has a litany of targets, but one who could help Toronto lands himself at No. 14: Connor Murphy. Connor Murphy could be Jake McCabe 2.0 for Maple Leafs Seems familiar, eh? Toronto trades for a veteran defenseman from Chicago who ends up being a stud. It happened with Jake McCabe and it should happen with Murphy. The 6-foot-4, 212-pound blueliner is exactly the remedy for a struggling Morgan Rielly. He blocks tons of shots, throws his huge frame around, can contribute a bit offensively, has a high hockey IQ and can give Rielly a break if he pinches up, knowing Murphy has his back in transition. Seravalli gave a bit more insight into why Murphy makes sense: ""Remember when the Blackhawks retained half on defenseman Jake McCabe\'s deal and knocked him down to just $2 million to send him to Toronto? That deal worked out great for the Leafs. Chicago could do it again with Murphy. There is a reason the Blackhawks preserved their final salary retention slot in the Taylor Hall/Mikko Rantanen trade. It could be to potentially retain Seth Jones, though that isn\'t preferred, or it could be to get creative on a deal like one for Murphy - who is a perfectly serviceable if not flashy No. 4 defenseman. The youth movement is on the way in Chicago."" Maybe Toronto can look to Chicago again and snag Murphy this year. He costs $4.4M, but if it can get retention, a shutdown defenseman for Morgan Rielly at $2.2M is an absolute steal. With the Blackhawks rebuilding and Murphy already 31, it doesn\'t seem like the best fit. He shouldn\'t cost too much, either, and certainly won\'t be a Fraser Minten or Easton Cowan level of player. It\'s possible Toronto can trade away Nick Robertson and Topi Niemala with its 2026 third-round draft pick to get things done. Murphy would be the perfect addition to a Maple Leafs blue line that, while older, is meant to be a brick wall between the opponents and the net. Toronto needs one more piece to build the strongest protection possible not only in the regular season but the playoffs.', ""New reports coming from NHL insider Frank Seravalli reveal that many Vancouver Canucks players are not happy at all that J.T Miller was traded away from the team. Daily Faceoff insider Frank Seravalli spoke on SN960 radio show recently about Friday's blockbuster trade sending J.T. Miller to the Rangers. The Canucks traded Miller, defenseman Erik Brannstrom and Jackson Dorrington's player rights for Filip Chytil, defenseman Victor Mancini and a 2025 first-round selection (protected for a top-13 selection). The move, Seravalli insisted, was one that Vancouver simply could not avoid, even with a three-game winning streak in tow. Two weeks ago, a similar arrangement had been in motion but collapsed over complications in negotiations with the Rangers, Seravalli disclosed. Although Chytil is the headliner in terms of return, Seravalli advised patience with regard to projecting an impact for him. Most importantly, he insisted, is that the biggest ripple impact will fall to Elias Pettersson, who must shoulder the full brunt of being the undeniably top center for the team. Elliotte Friedman also revealed the latest update on the team's plans for him. Seravalli says many Canucks players felt the wrong guy was traded Aside from its on-ice implications, Seravalli added, many Canucks skaters have been grumbling about the move, feeling it wasn't one that the team necessarily required or wanted. With Miller, a vocal presence and key player, gone, the tension in the room has developed in the form of frustration with management for not getting a different type of move accomplished, Seravalli added. Former NHL player Ryan Whitney also chimed in, saying if he were a Canucks fan right now, he would be absolutely furious that Miller was traded, adding that the wrong guy was moved out ... perhaps hinting Pettersson should have been gone? Now, with cap room cleared, Seravalli predicted additional activity out of Vancouver's brass. Next, eyes will be focused on how management reshapes the roster, and, most particularly, Pettersson's acceptance of increased responsibility."", 'The Golden State Warriors have been active in trade talks ahead of the Feb. 6 deadline. While Golden State has yet to agree on a deal, ESPN insider Shams Charania has explained that the Warriors have been eyeing a deal to pair All-Star guard Stephen Curry with another star. Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant has been deeply involved in those discussions. According to Brett Siegel at ClutchPoints, the Warriors have made Durant their ""main priority"" in the trade market. Siegel also mentioned that Golden State also has their second option in line, the Miami Heat\'s Jimmy Butler. Durant previously played for the Warriors from 2016 to 2019. During his time in Golden State, he helped lead the team out West to two NBA titles in 2017 and 2018. While Durant (36) and Curry (36) are both on the tail end of their careers, the Warriors seem confident that their championship window is still open. The two-time champion is currently averaging 26.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. The Warriors currently stand at No. 10 in the Western Conference standings with a 25-24 record. Golden State has a short window to get a deal done, with two days remaining before the window for a midseason trade to be an option during their hunt for an NBA title.', 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.

By turning it down to the ‘high’ preset (which still looks pretty fantastic), I was able to eliminate that pop-in and reach an average of 56fps. Certainly not completely optimal, but I’m satisfied that with some more minor tweaks, I can bring it up to 60fps without sacrificing too much quality.', '', 'I’m not alone in my testing either.

"Monster Hunter Wilds Interview: Meet Nu Udra, Apex of the Oilwell Basin – IGN First",https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-meet-nu-udra-apex-of-the-oilwell-basin-ign-first,"['From dry deserts, bustling forests, blazing volcanos to even frozen tundra, a variety of environments appear throughout the Monster Hunter series, each with its own unique ecosystem created by a diverse cast of monsters. The experience of adventuring through an unknown world, walking across its lands as you hunt, is one of the great joys when playing Monster Hunter.', '', ""This holds true for Monster Hunter Wilds, the newest game in the franchise. After the Windward Plains and Scarlet Forest, hunters will take their next step into the harsh lands of the Oilwell Basin, a place covered in flames and oilsilt. Once there, they'll find their path blocked by dripping, viscous oil and all-blazing magma. While it may seem to be a sterile, lifeless place, one can see the sluggish movements of small creatures wriggling around in the mire. And here and there in the Oilwell Basin sits what looks like the remains of some ancient civilization."", 'Yuya Tokuda, director of both Monster Hunter: World and Monster Hunter Wilds, describes the Oilwell Basin to us.', '""During the Fallow, the Oilwell Basin is a place filled with mud and oil. When the Inclemency known as the Firespring comes, it burns away that oilsilt, and at times during the Plenty the burned-away oil and soot vanishes, revealing the minerals, microorganisms and the original color of the manmade artifacts hidden underneath,"" he says.', 'What kind of concept did the development team have in mind when constructing the Oilwell Basin? We ask Kaname Fujioka, director of the first Monster Hunter as well as executive director and art director for Wilds.', '""We had two horizontally broad locales in the Windward Plains and Scarlet Forest, so we decided to make the Oilwell Basin a vertically connected place,” he says. “The environment there changes slightly when you travel between the top, middle and bottom strata. Sunlight reaches the top strata, where oil gathers like mud, and the lower you go, the hotter the place becomes, with lava and other substances.""', 'Tokuda continues: ""From the middle to bottom strata, you\'ll find creatures not unlike aquatic life that may remind you of the deep seas or underwater volcanoes. In World, we created the ecosystem of the Coral Highlands using the idea of what it would look like if aquatic creatures lived on the surface, and we\'ve used the knowledge we gained in the process to create the Oilwell Basin\'s creatures and ecosystem.', ""It's a blazing and barren wasteland that becomes filled with vitality once the Plenty comes. Fujioka says he wants players to enjoy this contrast."", '""During the Fallow and Inclemency, smoke comes out of everywhere in the Oilwell Basin like it\'s some sort of volcano or hot spring,” he explains. “But during the Plenty, it takes on a clear, marine-like tone as we just mentioned. Look closely at the environmental biology and you\'ll find that it\'s even a region inhabited by the kinds of creatures you\'d expect to find on the ocean bed.""', ""The Oilwell Basin's environment is made in a way that differentiates it from other locales. While it may look lifeless when covered in oilsilt, not only do shellfish like shrimp and crabs live under it, so do small monsters that provide raw meat. Large monsters eat small monsters, small monsters filter out and consume microorganisms from the environment and oilsilt, and microorganisms derive energy from the heat of the earth. If the Windward Plains and Scarlet Forest are ecosystems built upon sunlight and vegetation, the Oilwell Basin is an environment belonging to creatures that live by way of geothermal energy."", ""The large monsters that live in the Oilwell Basin are distinct from those found in other locales as well. One such monster is Rompopolo, a globular and noxious creature with a mouth resembling thin needles. What ideas could have led the developers to Rompopolo's bizarre design? Fujioka explains"", '""We designed it as a tricky monster that lives in swamps and creates chaos for players by using its stored up toxic gas,” he says. “The idea of a mad scientist came up often when we were trying to depict this trickiness. We were inspired by this concept when giving it a slightly chemical purple color and glowing red eyes. The equipment you can craft from it is surprisingly cute, though. So is its Palico equipment.""', 'While Tokuda categorizes the Rompopolo Palico equipment as ""amusing,” I could see exactly what they both meant when I got to play with it myself. I hope you\'ll craft the equipment and check it out, too.', ""Another new monster appearing in the Oilwell Basin is Ajarakan, a monster that feels like a massive gorilla enveloped in flames. That said, unlike the Scarlet Forest's Congalala, it seems to have a slimmer sort of silhouette."", ""Another new monster appearing in the Oilwell Basin is Ajarakan, a monster that feels like a massive gorilla enveloped in flames. That said, unlike the Scarlet Forest's Congalala, it seems to have a slimmer sort of silhouette."", ""While we saw many scenes of Rompopolo and Ajarakan fighting for turf in this video, we actually see it grab Rompopolo's body with both arms to give it a bear hug. Its martial arts-inspired movements make frequent use of its fists, giving it a charm unlike that of fanged beasts we've seen before."", '""Normally when we design fanged beasts, their hips are low to the ground, putting their heads at about eye level with the hunter,” says Tokuda. “We thought that this can make it harder to sense the threat that the monster poses. That\'s why we were conscious of giving this monster a more top-heavy and towering silhouette. We then added flame elements that are at home in the Oilwell Basin, as well as grabbing attacks reminiscent of a wrestler that highlight its physical strength. It\'s a monster that combines strength, physical attacks and flames, like its attack where it melts something and tosses it at you.""', 'Fujioka also comments on Ajarakan\'s design: ""With one unique monster after the next making an appearance, we thought that this might be a good time to add a monster whose strengths are easy to understand. That\'s how we got Ajarakan. It just punches or slams its fists on the ground to make flames shoot up, making it the kind of monster that\'s strong by way of all its super-straightforward attacks.""', ""Ajarakan occupies a fairly high position in Oilwell Basins's ecosystem. Compared to Rompopolo, which makes full use of poison gas and oilsilt, Ajarakan really does stand out with its flashy appearance, with flames and magma accompanying each one of its attacks, making you very conscious of the area's pecking order."", '""At first it was just kind of a physically powerful monster,” says Fujioka. “That\'s why I talked quite a bit with our artists and designers about giving it more personality in some way. It\'s a monster in a fiery location, so I wanted to make use of flames and heat. That said, I didn\'t want it to simply breathe fire or create flames. That\'s how we ended up with a design where the monster seems to be wearing flames on its back, similar to the Buddhist deity Acala. From there we got the idea of Ajarakan\'s rising internal temperature giving it enough heat and power to melt anything in front of it, which seemed to give it so much more personality. Ajarakan will grab the hunter or hug Rompopolo, and we wanted to make players think about how much they\'d want to avoid getting hugged by an absurdly hot creature. We decided to make it seem scary by making it so hot that it\'ll melt anything and everything around.""', ""Unlike the tricky Rompopolo, Ajarakan's design focuses on straightforward power. As there's the risk of its concept of depicting simple strength leading to no-frills movements, Fujioka says the team kept giving it flashier and flashier moves as they reached the end of development."", '""We kept adding lots of different interesting techniques, like it jumping into the air, balling itself up and falling to the ground,"" he says.', ""Ruling over the Oilwell Basin's ecosystem as its apex predator with octopus-like tentacles is the “Black Flame,” which we can finally name for the first time: Nu Udra. With its slimy body covered with the flammable oil it secretes, it stretches and wriggles around the Oilwell Basin in every direction. Just as the Windward Plains' Rey Dau controls lightning and the Scarlet Forest's Uth Duna envelops itself in water, Nu Udra coats itself in flames. The two developers say that apex predators in Wilds are designed with the element of their region strongly in mind. Of course, finding an octopus in a scorching hot area is odd. Was this really the animal that inspired the monster?"", '""Yes, it was octopuses,” says Fujioka. “We also wanted its silhouette to be striking when it rises up and gave it what look like demonic horns, but we also tried designing it in a way where you can\'t tell where its face is.""', 'Tokuda explains that even the music that plays when fighting Nu Udra is based on demonic imagery.', '""We had the composers include phrases and musical instruments reminiscent of black magic,” he says. “I think it ended up being a unique and good piece of music.""', ""The squirming movements of Nu Udra's tentacles apparently follow in the footsteps of monsters like Lagiacrus, which appeared in Monster Hunter Tri. A tentacled monster like this is a concept that both Tokuda and Fujioka have long wanted to make a reality."", '""One of the concepts in Tri was underwater combat, so I did write a proposal for an octopus-shaped monster at the time, emphasizing its distinctive underwater movements,” says Tokuda. “I had fun coming up with all kinds of ideas, like \'It has lots of legs, which means lots of parts you can sever!\' There were challenges keeping us from making that a reality, though, including technical ones. But even so, I\'ve been holding onto that proposal for all this time.""', ""We've seen monsters in the past such as Yama Tsukami and Nakarkos that wriggle around as they use appendages like their tentacles. I ask Fujioka if they took the movements of these past monsters into consideration when developing Nu Udra."", '""We\'re always interested in using monsters who move like that in moments where they\'d stand out, as their silhouette and the impression they give are nothing like standard monsters with limbs and wings,” he says. “While including too many unique monsters will cause players to get tired of seeing them, dropping one in at just the right moment leaves such a strong impression. That\'s why we had Yama Tsukami appear in the game the way it did,” he says, referring to the scene in Monster Hunter 2 (Dos) where you encounter Yama Tsukami floating over the mountains in a deep forest. “You glance up, see it flying above you, and think, \'What the heck is that?\' I think there\'s a kind of adventurous feeling you get from seeing something a bit odd, similar to cryptids.""', 'Hearing this, Tokuda adds with a nostalgic tone, ""You know, I\'m the one who put that (Yama Tsukami) there."" While they weren\'t able to create the same kind of actions for Yama Tsukami as they have for Nu Udra due to the technology at the time, they say they wanted to find some way for it to leave an impression.', ""A constant feeling I get throughout this interview is one of just how sincere Monster Hunter's team is throughout the development process about creating monsters, and that they make use of so many techniques in the process. Even if it can't be done with current technology, these creators have countless ideas in their heads about how they want to use a monster. Then when they develop a new title, they draw on this stockpile when creating new monsters. In that sense, you could call the realization of a monster that makes full use of its tentacles like Nu Udra a major accomplishment for both Tokuda and Fujioka."", '""While Yama Tsukami and Nakarkos were monsters that attacked you with their tentacles while fixed there in a stage, Nu Udra makes use of its physical traits as a cephalopod to freely move around the area. In that way, the gameplay it enables could be seen as something we\'re trying for the very first time here.""', 'Fujioka continues: ""Monsters with tentacles like that pose a lot of technical challenges, like controlling it with respect to the terrain and its target. When we began development on Wilds, the technical department\'s tests went incredibly well, and so we felt like we could really make it happen this time.""', '""When we saw the tests, we also thought to make it the apex predator of the Oilwell Basin,” adds Tokuda. “That\'s just how much of an impact this monster has.”', '""While there are countless proposals that I\'ve had rejected due to technical reasons, it feels like I\'m finally getting to attempt one of those this time around.""', ""Even outside of hunting, I get the sense that fine attention was placed on Nu Udra's animations. After you deal it enough damage, it wraps itself around what looks like an ancient ruined pipe in order to wriggle its way around the area. It even enters into small holes in the terrain without any trouble at all. Every one of Nu Udra's movements posed a challenge to the art team led by Fujioka."", '""We did quite a lot of work on depicting flexible bodies this time with Nu Udra,” he says. “At the start of development, we try coming up with pretty unreasonable ideas, whether or not we can actually achieve them. It\'s a challenge to ourselves in a way, and while it does cause a lot of challenges for our artists, the final product looks so amazing if we\'re able to actually make it take shape.""', ""The team uses new technologies to make possible the ideal expressions they've accumulated as the series progresses. They give it a try even if they aren't sure they can make it happen. I even get a sense of what it feels like to be on the Monster Hunter development floor when I hear these two talk."", '""When we first implemented the movement of it going inside a hole, an animator told me, \'When you weaken it and it starts heading back to its nest, please wait here for a moment!\',” says Tokuda. “Apparently they wanted me to see it going into its little hole, and I still remember replying, \'Oh, that really is amazing!\' The animator looked so satisfied as well.""', '""It might not be easy to get the chance to see it, but the way it squirms around while wrapped around a pipe is so well made too,” says Fujioka. “I do hope you check it out. Only games are able to depict things like that in real-time instead of as some premade scene. I\'m incredibly proud of it as a crystallization of the staff\'s efforts.""', ""Fujioka's tone of voice gives me a strong sense of just how satisfied he is with the level of detail of Wilds' monsters and how proud he is of the team who created this game."", 'Once I actually try taking on Nu Udra, I have significant trouble finding an opening on its flexible and ever-changing body. If I let my guard down and stick too close to it, it uses its head to launch a powerful counterattack. While I struggle, I somehow manage to focus enough of my attacks to successfully break a tentacle part, only for its severed tip to thrash around on the ground. Is it possible to destroy all of its many legs?', '""You can cut off so many tentacles,” Tokuda explains. “While I suppose it depends on how you count them, all of the parts that resemble legs that touch the ground can be severed. While the tentacles do move right after they\'ve been cut off, they begin to rot after some time passes. If you try to carve a part that\'s rotten and no longer moving, you won\'t get good materials from it. The same also applies for breakable parts of other monsters, like tails.”', '“Nu Udra uses its tentacles to launch attack after attack on its target. We were conscious to give its attacks a unique tempo through a combination of focused attacks, and area-of-effect attacks using its head and flames. We wanted to make it a massive monster that still seemed to launch a barrage of attacks. With all of its tentacles, though, it\'s possible that it becomes difficult to tell who it\'s targeting in situations like multiplayer hunts. That\'s why we\'ve made it so that it has sensory organs at the tips of its tentacles that use light to indicate when and who it\'s going to attack.""', ""At times, Nu Udra will hold its tentacles in the air and slam them into the ground as an attack. Like Tokuda says, its area that would correspond to the palm of a human hand gives off light when it does this. This light-emitting section of its body is Nu Udra's sensory organ. But as it doesn't use vision to understand the world around it, Flash Bombs don't affect it."", 'Nu Udra poses a significant challenge. I ask Tokuda what players can do to start working toward defeating it.', '""Its body itself is fairly soft, and it has lots of breakable parts,” he replies. “I think hunters should think about how to determine where to attack. Cutting off a tentacle will also shorten its area of effect attacks, making it much easier to move around. You could also call it a monster made for multiplayer, as that means its targets will be split up. You may be able to enjoy it even more by using SOS flares, Support Hunters included.""', 'Fujioka expands further. ""As we designed this monster, I thought it\'s one that can be tackled in a way that\'s very much like an action game in the sense that destroying its parts can help you get closer to defeating it. Gravios is another monster where you discover a way to defeat it as you destroy its tough armor, right? The ability to carefully watch a monster\'s movements and use that to make a decision fits perfectly with Monster Hunter\'s overall approach.""', ""In his answer, Fujioka brings up the name Gravios. That's right, players can reunite with Gravios, who hasn't been seen since Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, in the Oilwell Basin. As a monster covered in what looks like a rocky carapace and which emits hot gas, Gravios really is a perfect monster for the area."", 'I ask Tokuda what led them to decide to have Gravios make another appearance (for more details, check out this Gravios interview as well).', '""When we were thinking of monsters that match the Oilwell Basin\'s environment, make sense in the game\'s overall progression and don\'t play too similarly to any other monsters, we thought that we could make Gravios seem like a fresh challenge and decided that it would reappear,"" he says.', ""As Tokuda says, the reappearing Gravios had become a monster with an even harder body than I remembered. Its massive presence is overwhelming when compared to the other monsters in the Oilwell Basin. When I somehow figure out a way to attack its rocky carapace, I'm able to form red wounds on its body like any other monster and unleash a Focus Strike."", '""When bringing Gravios over to this game from previous titles, above all else, we wanted to make sure it still had its distinguishing features like its hardness,” says Tokuda. “From a game design perspective, we also wanted it to be a monster that appeared after you\'ve progressed a good bit and had gone through everything the game\'s design has to offer. That\'s why I came up with the idea of it being a monster where it\'s difficult to figure out a way to defeat its hard body at first, only for hunters to find more and more clues as they make good use of the wound system and part breaking.""', 'If Gravios is making an appearance, does that mean we\'ll also be seeing its juvenile form, Basarios? I ask the question, only for Fujioka to simply reply, ""Sorry, but Basarios will be taking this one off."" It seems like the time isn\'t quite right yet, and we\'ll have to wait longer before we see Basarios again.', ""As the two explained during our interview about monster selection, the Monster Hunter team is careful to not make offhanded decisions about having monsters reappear, only doing so if they can be used to their fullest in a game. That means that the team must have decided to not include Basarios in this game after multiple discussions. Though a bit unfortunate, many other monsters not touched on in this article will also make an appearance in the Oilwell Basin. I can't wait for the day when I get to go hunting there, Cool Drink in hand."", 'Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on February 28.
