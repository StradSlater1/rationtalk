It was preceded by the installation last December of three more underwater seismographs inside the Kolumbo crater and five in the sea area of Kolumbo and Anydros basin.', 'The selection of the area to carry out the mission had already been made in the context of the research project, as it is an area with a history of numerous volcanic eruptions and seismic events in the past. However, the current juncture will help scientists have more scientific data at their disposal.', '“The research mission was scheduled to take place, however the scientists who work in the area are present and constantly analyse the data resulting from the seismic activity in order to inform the authorities and the residents,” Evi Nomikou told the state-run Athens-Macedonian News Agency. These seismographs will remain in the subsea space for four days and then be retrieved to analyse the data. The survey will be repeated as long as seismic activity continues.', '“Our goal with these measurements is to collect in a short period of time data on the microseismicity of the area, which will be combined with the terrestrial seismographs, so that we can have better results in the analysis of earthquakes,” she added.', 'From January 27 onwards, the earthquakes noted are located in the sea area northeast of Santorini, in an area adjacent to the underwater volcano of Kolumbo. “During the crisis of 2011-2012, the seismic activity we had inside the caldera of Santorini for 14 months did not lead to a volcanic eruption. Intense seismic activity next to an undersea volcano can weaken without leading to an undersea eruption. However, the need to monitor the underwater volcano by installing special instruments that measure the changes in the chemical composition of the gases and liquids released from the hydrothermal vents at a depth of 500 meters is imperative,” Nomikou explained.', 'The survey results will be combined with measurements from the SANTORY underwater observatory, which has been collecting data since December 2022, and analysed to find differences in the volcano’s behaviour. SANTORY’s digital platform provides the scientific community and the public with valuable information about the Kolumbo undersea volcano.', 'The specific research program, which is led by NKUA, was completed in November 2024 and, as Nomikou said, its funding had been requested from the municipality of Thera (Santorini), a request that remained pending. Nomikou has once again requested that the state continue financing SANTORY.', '[AMNA]', 'Enter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.', '', '', 'PROPERTY OF: NEES KATHIMERINES EKDOSEIS SINGLE MEMBER S.A. © 2014 - 2025', 'Powered by']"
