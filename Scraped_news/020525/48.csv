Despite those being two of his biggest songs, he might want to devote more time to songs that haven\'t had the grand stage yet.', 'It\'s hard to imagine him not incorporating the intro to ""m.A.A.d city,"" but other intros can still get the crowd hyped.', 'The ""Not Like Us"" music video used the ""Squabble Up"" intro, so it makes sense to ""wake up and look for the broccoli"" out of the gate. I\'d say the intro, chorus, and the song\'s back end would be about one minute.', '""Why do you rap if it\'s fictional?"" and ""Let the wolves out. I\'ve been a dog."" They feel like they need to be rapped on the big stage.', 'It may be the least bold prediction on this list, but I\'m sure the NFL would have loved Swift as a surprise guest. With Travis Kelce\'s Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl, you can still expect her in the stadium, just not singing ""Bad Blood.""', ""But that doesn't mean Lamar can't rap his part of the song. It's a 25-second rap verse that could segue nicely between songs. (Plus, many Swiftie eyes will be on the halftime show, which seems like a fun shout-out.)"", 'It SHOULD be ""Not Like Us,"" but as a sports fan, the song ""DNA"" has always been used for promotional reasons in different leagues. It\'s a big-time hype song; lyrically, it could be the best ""clean"" version of any of his songs.', 'One of my favorite Lamar memes is when he discusses his ""wackest"" song on BigBoyTV, and when he listens to his old music, it\'s hilarious. It\'d be a hilarious callback, but odds are, no time will be dedicated to this masterpiece.', 'I\'m sure he will not be the first to remix or sample ""Oh When The Saints Go Marching In,"" but it\'d be an incredible homage to Louis Armstrong (born in New Orleans).', 'Bring out those trumpets!', 'Visually speaking, I bet whatever is planned for ""Humble"" will be intense. Looking at past performances, Lamar does not shy away from visually striking set designs.', 'His setlist has become so vast that he could skip ""Humble"" entirely, but it feels too mainstream to pass up.', ""My boldest prediction is the number of songs on the setlist. With guest spots included, we may hear up to 13 different songs. That's the advantage of being a rapper. He can breeze through the songs and still leave the beats in as a transition into the next."", ""We saw it done in Dre's hip-hop lineup for the Super Bowl LVI, who performed 11 songs. And each of them needed intros for individual performers. Lamar can power through his setlist and beat those numbers."", ""Expect a million Easter eggs about Lamar's city of Compton. Road signs, architecture props, you name it. The man is proud of where he comes from and will share his culture with New Orleans."", 'Lamar has emphasized the game of football in teasers for his big show. New Orleans has three HBCUs, so why not give one (or all) a call to perform at the big game?', 'Imagine a cold opening of ""Not Like Us"" or ""Humble"" via a marching band.', '""TV Off"" is one of Lamar\'s most popular songs on his latest album, GNX. This creates a strange problem: The NFL isn\'t going to love the idea of Kenny repeatedly yelling at people to ""turn his TV off, turn his TV off.""', ""I don't know how, but I feel like this song might be on the chopping block for those lyrics unless there's a workaround: staying away from the chorus."", 'If we DO get ""TV Off"" on the setlist, DJ Mustard better be there to take in the crowd screaming \'MUSTARDDDDDDD!\'', 'Lamar has some slower jams, excluding any SZA hits, but ""Euphoria"" might be the closest thing we get to that for the big game.', ""I don't know how heavy he will lean into the diss tracks, but he mentions field goals in it. Football game? Field goal? No?"", 'With the combo of ""Humble"" and ""DNA,"" the album DAMN will use up most of the time for the Super Bowl halftime show. This would be bold since so many popular tracks on GNX could be featured on the setlist, but I think they\'ll be done in snippets versus these two songs.', 'It SHOULD be one of the songs, but I have a weird feeling the time crunch and popularity of more mainstream songs will bump this out of the show entirely.', 'Despite having six collaborations with Lamar, the man will need a breather. To give time for a set/costume change, I could see SZA performing a portion of ""Kill Bill"" or a big hit.', 'Alternative R&B will be a nice change of pace, too.', 'With all the animosity between Lamar and Drake, Lil Wayne is still the most prominent New Orleans name that could appear. Although Wayne might be salty (and has every right to be) about not being the headliner, the Super Bowl was never about the biggest ""local"" name. It should always be the biggest name in the game that year...and it was Lamar\'s year.', ""An appearance by Wayne could help put money in his own pocket, so why not swallow your pride and have some fun in front of your hometown? Maybe he won't rap, but my bold prediction is that he'll have some kind of presence."", 'I know people joke about him playing ""Not Like Us"" for 13 minutes straight, but this moment is for Lamar as an artist. He is now a 22-time Grammy Award winner, so he has given a lot to the music industry that goes beyond a diss track feud.', 'Many Vegas odds have this as the first song, but I think it\'s better to save it and make people believe he was asked not to play it. Even doing a fake ending to the show would be legendary, and then speaking the ""I see dead people line"" to revive the show.', 'It will be fascinating to see what is kept within the song lyrically.', 'At ""The Pop Out: Ken & Friends"" concert, Dr. Dre delivered the opening line to ""Not Like Us."" If it\'s not broken, don\'t fix it. This will be the perfect way to introduce the song to the masses.', 'But who will do it? Lil Wayne? Taylor Swift? DJ Mustard? Barack Obama? A significant name would be the perfect way to introduce the ""Song of the Year.""', 'As we saw at the Grammys, people adore this song. What better way to throw a Super Bowl bash than inviting all the friends out to the party? Who? I don\'t know, but I bet we will see something similar to ""The Pop Out: Ken & Friends"" concert for Juneteenth in 2024.', ""Or perhaps it's just his closest friends from Compton. Either way, expect a party onstage."", ""Because who wouldn't?"", '']"

And the people who helped put him onstage aren‚Äôt shying away from the hype.', '‚ÄúEveryone will agree this is a halftime show like none other in Super Bowl halftime history,‚Äù Jesse Collins, the executive producer of the show, told NBC News. ‚ÄúThe creative concept is really something brilliant, spectacular and special. In all of our years of doing this ‚Äî and I think every show that we‚Äôve done has been amazing ‚Äî but I have never seen an artist take this creative approach to it.‚Äù', 'Roc Nation, the entertainment company and NFL partner that produces the halftime show, first tabbed Lamar to headline the Super Bowl last summer. He was already a critically acclaimed rapper, and his stardom reached another level after the May 4 release of ‚ÄúNot Like Us,‚Äù the knockout blow in his feud with Drake, the Canadian rapper.', ""The song broke multiple streaming records and earned Lamar five Grammy awards, making it the most decorated rap song in the award show's history."", 'Not long after the song was released, Lamar got a phone call from Roc Nation founder Jay-Z asking him whether he would perform at the Super Bowl.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like the stars aligning,‚Äù Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez told NBC News. ‚ÄúWe would hope that every single year someone accomplishes what Kendrick has accomplished this particular year. You can‚Äôt even really plan for something to align so perfectly.‚Äù', 'Lamar‚Äôs halftime performance will also be the first since the NFL and Roc Nation extended their partnership ‚Äî which encompasses both live music and social justice efforts ‚Äî in October. Roc Nation‚Äôs halftime shows have been well-received, with the 2022 show featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J. Blige becoming the first Super Bowl halftime to win an Emmy.', 'Perez said the NFL has been very trusting as a partner, never once questioning a decision about the artist selection.', '‚ÄúWhat we bring to the table is not just booking the show; it‚Äôs also understanding the environment that we‚Äôre going into and understanding what‚Äôs going on now,‚Äù Perez says. ‚ÄúUnderstanding the pulse of culture at the moment when the show is going to happen and doing that with precision is what I think we‚Äôve been able to master.‚Äù', 'Planning for a Super Bowl halftime typically begins immediately after the previous one, which means Roc Nation has been in meetings for Sunday‚Äôs show since last February. During the week of the game, preparation will reach a fever pitch.', 'Lamar will have at least three days on the field to rehearse before Sunday, and on those days the performers will run through the entire set multiple times. The halftime show is unique in terms of timing and staging ‚Äî Lamar has exactly eight minutes to get on the field and six minutes to get off, without damaging the surface where the game is supposed to take place. (Simply getting the stage on and off the field takes more than 100 people, Collins said.)', 'As for what to expect during the show itself, everyone is predictably tight-lipped. Perez said that whether or not other artists will be involved is entirely up to Lamar, though she said there will be ‚Äúa few surprises that we haven‚Äôt seen in the past.‚Äù', '‚ÄúKendrick is one of the most creative, incredible artists of our lifetime, and ... he is not going to disappoint,‚Äù she said when she was asked directly what fans should be excited for.', 'Collins said: ‚ÄúRoc Nation, Jay, Kendrick and his whole team, we‚Äôve all really busted our ass to figure out something different. And I think people are going to be blown away.‚Äù', 'Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. ', '¬© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Who is Kendrick Lamar?

Since then, the show has expanded into one of the biggest attractions ‚Äî featuring some of the most popular names in music.', 'The halftime show has featured artists such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, and The Rolling Stones. It has also given fans some iconic moments such as Prince performing Purple Rain ‚Äî in the pouring rain ‚Äî Beyonc√© reuniting with Destiny‚Äôs Child, Rihanna‚Äôs baby bump, and Janet Jackson‚Äôs wardrobe malfunction.', 'This year‚Äôs halftime show will most likely give fans even more iconic moments. Rapper Kendrick Lamar will perform with special guest singer and songwriter SZA. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about Lamar ahead of his Super Bowl LIX halftime performance.', 'This question has quite a few answers. Kendrick Lamar is also Kung Fu Kenny, K-Dot, Mr. Morale, and Pulitzer Kenny. Lamar goes by many aliases and G.O.A.T. may be his favorite one ‚Äî but for the sake of this story, we‚Äôll call him Lamar.', 'Lamar is a 22-time Grammy-winning hip-hop recording artist from Compton, Calif. He‚Äôs the only male rapper in history to win five Grammys in one night ‚Äî and he‚Äôs done that three times (2016, 2018, 2025). And he‚Äôs the only rapper to ever win a Pulitzer Prize for his 2017 album DAMN. Lamar has immensely impacted the hip-hop industry. He was named one of Time‚Äôs 100 most influential people in the world in 2016.', 'The rapper was previously signed with Top Dawg Entertainment and recorded five studio albums with Top Dawg, before founding his own record label, P.G. Lang, in 2020. His most recent album and the sixth studio album, GNX, was released through P.G. Lang and Interscope Records. The album features various West Coast recording artists and breathed new life into his long-existing beef with Canadian rapper Drake.', 'The easy answer to this question can be that the beef began with the release of the song Like That in 2024. This was a song by Future and Metro Boomin that featured a verse from Lamar where he delivered a sharp diss to both Drake and J. Cole in response to their song First Person Shooter ‚Äî claiming there‚Äôs a ‚Äúbig three‚Äù in hip-hop, Drake, Cole, and Lamar.', 'But this entire beef really started years ago when Lamar dropped his verse on Big Sean‚Äôs Control song in 2013.

Like That was the first time Lamar really called out Drake‚Äôs name again.', 'But there wasn‚Äôt always a beef between the two rappers. Lamar joined Drake on his ‚ÄúTake Care‚Äù tour in 2011 and the artists collaborated on Lamar‚Äôs song Poetic Justice in 2012. Another Drake and Lamar collab seems like a long shot now after the multiple diss tracks they‚Äôve dropped this past year.', 'After Like That was released, Drake responded with a diss track of his own, titled Push Ups. But it didn‚Äôt stop there; 11 days later, Lamar released another furious six-minute diss called Euphoria. Days later, he dropped another song called 6:16 in LA, which led to Drake releasing a song called Family Matters. But once again, it didn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî Lamar dropped two more diss tracks on the same day, Meet the Grahams and Not Like Us.', 'Not Like Us has grown in popularity, racking up 96 million streams in one week and recently winning five Grammys ‚Äî including Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Rap Song, Best Music Video, and Best Rap Performance.', 'Fans can expect to hear the five-time Grammy-winning song during Sunday‚Äôs Super Bowl performance. How many times will Lamar perform it? That should be a prop bet of its own. The last time Lamar performed Not Like Us on stage was during his Pop Out concert in California on June 19. The rapper performed the song five times as everyone joined in dancing ‚Äî including NBA players Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, both from Los Angeles.', 'But if you miss Lamar‚Äôs performance on Sunday, you can catch him in concert during his stadium tour with SZA beginning in April.', 'Since the release of Not Like Us, Drake has filed a lawsuit for defamation and harassment against Universal Music Group ‚Äî which represents both artists. The lawsuit accuses UMG of defamation by publishing and spreading a ‚Äúfalse and malicious narrative.‚Äù', 'The lawsuit alleges that UMG ‚Äúapproved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track that falsely accuses Drake of being a pedophile and calls for violent retribution against him.‚Äù Now, Drake is seeking nominal, punitive, and compensatory damages.']"
