Female Pilot in Crash Trump Blamed on DEI Was Top 20% Army Cadet,https://www.thedailybeast.com/female-pilot-in-crash-trump-blames-on-dei-was-in-top-20-of-army/,"['The brilliant Army career of the female helicopter pilot killed in the Washington D.C. plane crash—which Donald Trump blamed on “DEI”—has been revealed.', 'Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, a native of Durham, North Carolina, was identified late Saturday by the U.S. Army’s Public Affairs office despite a previous request from her family to withhold her identity.', 'She had been in the top 20 per cent of Army ROTC cadets nationwide and picked for a prestigious role as a White House social aide. Her awards include the Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal and Army Service Ribbon.', 'Her distinguished career was at apparent odds with President Donald Trump suggesting that DEI hiring practices could have been to blame for the mid-air collision. He was backed up by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who had railed against “women in combat roles” before a sudden conversion to praising their service ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing.', 'Her family said in a statement that she had planned to pursue a career as a physician. Both her parents are doctors.', 'Lobach, who began her career as an aviation officer with the Army in July 2019, was one of the 67 people who died earlier this week when the Black Hawk helicopter she was co-piloting collided with an American Airlines jet coming in to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, causing both aircraft to plummet into the Potomac River.', 'Despite an earlier request for anonymity, the Army reported that they were sharing Lobach’s name “at the request of and in coordination with the family,” who also provided an official statement. It read, in part: “Rebecca began her career in the United States Army as a distinguished military graduate in ROTC at the University of North Carolina, and was in the top 20 percent of cadets nationwide.', '“She achieved the rank of Captain, having twice served as a Platoon Leader and as a Company Executive Officer… With more than 450 hours of flight time, she earned certification as a pilot-in-command after extensive testing by the most senior and experienced pilots in her battalion.”', 'Lobach also served as a White House social aide during the Biden administration.', 'Military news site Task & Purpose spoke with several of Lobach’s friends and colleagues, who described her as a uniquely talented pilot.', '“She was passionate about leadership, passionate about mentorship, and passionate about being a master of her skill craft,” 2nd Lt. Lexi Freas said. “Everything she did, she put 100 percent of her heart and effort into. No task was too big or too little for her to handle for her soldiers and the people that she mentored and loved.”', '“It just rips my heart out that she is gone, violently and publicly,” 1st Lt. Samantha Brown said. “It is a colossal loss of human life. My heart goes to everyone impacted. It is absolutely terrible.”', 'When it was later discovered that one of the helicopter pilots was female, MAGA activists and online agitators began pointing the finger specifically in Lobach’s direction—even before she was identified, and even though the investigation is ongoing and no official cause has been determined.', 'The president has made no public comment since Lobach’s name was released.', 'The other two members of the helicopter crew had been named by the Army as Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia.', 'Got a tip?

Among the passengers of the jet were members of the U.S. Figure Skating team, several Russian figure skaters, coaches and family members, according to U.S. Figure Skating and Russian state media.', 'Minutes before the collision, controllers can be heard on their radios directing multiple planes taking off and landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.', 'Amid this heavy but normal traffic for the busy airport, the Black Hawk helicopter approaches airspace shared with multiple planes making their way in and out of Reagan.

Everyone dined on chicken, steak, salmon and vegetables, and there were two cakes with ""Good Luck"" written on them -- one chocolate, the other vanilla -- from a much-loved nearby bakery.

But the connections formed between elite-level skaters, particularly those based at the same club, become something akin to family.', 'How could they not? At many clubs, skaters spend up to 12 hours a day, six or seven days per week at the facility. In between on-ice sessions, they do fitness work or dance together. They eat and attend virtual school together. They play cards, write papers and read books together. They get hurt together; they rehab together.

America’s Air-Traffic Control System: An International Disgrace,https://www.city-journal.org/article/reagan-national-airport-crash-faa-air-traffic-control,"['After the Reagan Airport disaster, will we finally reform the FAA?', 'We still don’t know how many mistakes led to the collision of a helicopter with an American Airlines passenger jet making its descent at Reagan National Airport last week. But one thing has been clear for decades: America’s air-traffic control system, once the world’s most advanced, has become an international disgrace.', 'Long before the Obama and Biden administrations’ quest to diversify staff in control towers, the system was already one of the worst in the developed world. The recent rash of near-collisions is the result of chronic mismanagement that has left the system with too few controllers using absurdly antiquated technology.', 'The problems were obvious 20 years ago, when I visited control towers in both Canada and the United States. The Canadians sat in front of sleek computer screens that instantly handled tasks like transferring the oversight of a plane from one controller to another. The Americans were still using pieces of paper called flight strips. After a plane took off, the controller in charge of the local airspace had to carry that plane’s flight strip over to the desk of the controller overseeing the regional airspace. It felt like going back in time from a modern newsroom into a scene from The Front Page.', 'It was bad enough to see such outdated technology in 2005. But they’re still using those paper flight strips in American towers, and the Federal Aviation Administration’s modernization plans have been delayed so many times that the strips aren’t due to be phased out until 2032. The rest of the system is similarly archaic. The U.S. is way behind Europe in using satellites to guide and monitor planes, forcing pilots and controllers to rely on much less precise readings from radio beacons and ground-based radar.', 'Overseas controllers use high-resolution cameras and infrared sensors to monitor planes on runways, but many American controllers still have to look out the window—which is why a FedEx cargo plane almost landed on top of another plane two years ago in Austin, Texas. It was a foggy morning, and the controller couldn’t see that a Southwest airliner was on the same runway waiting to take off. At the last minute, the FedEx pilot aborted the landing, missing the other plane by less than 100 feet.', 'The basic problem, which reformers have been trying to remedy since the Clinton administration, is that the system is operated by a cumbersome federal bureaucracy—the same bureaucracy that’s also responsible for overseeing air safety. The FAA is supposed to be a watchdog, but we’ve put it in charge of watching itself.', 'Nearly all  other developed countries sensibly separate these roles, so that a federal aviation agency oversees an independent corporation that operates the control towers and the rest of the system, functioning as a public utility. This independent operator can be a state-owned company (as in Australia, Switzerland, Germany, and Scandinavian countries), a nonprofit corporation (as in Canada), or a company with private investors (as in the United Kingdom and Italy).', 'In 2017, the Trump administration and Republican congressional leadership tried creating a similar system in the U.S., operated by a not-for-profit corporation. The bill was backed by some Democrats and by a broad coalition that included even the union representing air-traffic controllers, which had previously helped block reform but finally decided that this was the only way to fix the system. The legislation also enjoyed support from unions representing pilots and flight attendants, the major airlines, and a bipartisan array of former officials at the FAA and the Department of Transportation.', 'The bill went nowhere, partly because many legislators, especially Democrats, wanted to retain Congress’ control over the system—and the campaign contributions and pork-barrel opportunities that came with it. But the effort was doomed mainly because of opposition from private plane owners, who pay a pittance for the services they use. Though the legislation guaranteed that they would not be charged new user fees, their lobbyists scared enough lawmakers to quash it.', 'Now, after the Washington collision, could the second Trump administration and a new Republican Congress finally create a state-of-the-art system? “The public and opinion leaders now know a lot more about the FAA’s shortcomings,” says Robert  Poole of the Reason Foundation, who has been leading the reform campaign for five decades. “With DOGE and the Trump administration shaking things up, perhaps the time for real reform has finally arrived.”', 'Trump’s executive order last week for a review of aviation safety focused on investigating and eliminating DEI practices in hiring controllers. Unsuccessful applicants for those jobs have sued the FAA, contending that the agency practiced racial discrimination by introducing a “biographical questionnaire” to favor minorities at the expense of other applicants, including those better prepared because they had taken college courses in air-traffic control. “The FAA affirmative-action scandal is indeed a scandal,” says Marc Scribner of the Reason Foundation. “The biographical questionnaire was gamed to rig the application selection for a limited number of training spots. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it caused unqualified controllers to be certified, which some have alleged following the latest accident.”', 'The safety review that Trump ordered should shed some light on the competence issue, and the investigation of the D.C. crash could reveal whether the controller bears any responsibility for the helicopter flying into the airliner. (Critics have said that the warning to the helicopter pilot failed to specify where to look for the plane.) Whatever evidence turns up, the FAA has already been ordered to scrap identity politics and hire controllers based strictly on merit.', 'Eliminating diversity mandates is just one small step in the right direction. The system will remain mired in mid-twentieth-century technology until it’s run by an independent corporation accountable to regulators but freed from congressional micromanagement, annual budget battles, and the federal bureaucracy’s convoluted hiring and procurement regulations. Experience in Canada and other countries shows that an independent corporation, able to issue its own revenue bonds because it’s funded directly by user fees instead of taxes, can modernize air-traffic control far more efficiently and cheaply than a government agency.', 'Reforming the system is an ideal issue for the new administration, particularly Elon Musk and his team at DOGE. It would help drain the D.C. swamp, shrink the federal budget deficit, improve aviation safety, reduce flight delays, conserve fuel, lower carbon emissions, and save money for airlines and passengers. It’s inspiring to dream of sending Americans to Mars in a new Golden Age, but the ones flying closer to home are still stuck in the Stone Age.', 'John Tierney is a contributing editor of City Journal and coauthor of The Power of Bad: How the Negativity Effect Rules Us and How We Can Rule It.', 'Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images', 'City Journal is a publication of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research (MI), a leading free-market think tank.
