St. John's Is Going To Mop The Floor With Marquette,https://www.outkick.com/betting/st-johns-going-mop-floor-marquette,"[""Marquette vs. St. John's, 6:30 ET"", ""Marquette vs. St. John's, 6:30 ET"", ""I continued to roll in College Basketball last night with another win. This has been an very good stretch with losses few and far between. If only I could replicate that success in the NBA right now, I'd be very happy. I suppose that's the difference between betting on teams that actually care and don't mess around with injury reports. Enough complaining, let's be happy that I'm cashing these plays for you as we take on the game between Marquette and St. John's in a Big East showdown."", ""Marquette entered the season with a reasonably high ranking and has shot up and down the board this year. They are currently ranked 11th in the country and they are 18-4 for the season. Their losses have come against Iowa State, Dayton, Xavier, and UConn. The first two losses were on the road and now the next two were at home. They fell against the Cyclones by 11, at the time they were playing like one of the best teams in the country. The loss to Dayton was justifiable as well because the Flyers, although unranked, looked amazing at the time. Most Big East battles are tough, so the losses to Xavier and UConn were understandable as well. Xavier isn't ranked, and probably is a team that Marquette should've defeated. Even that game wasn't a blowout, they lost by just two points. Saturday they hosted UConn and dropped that game by eight points. Maybe it was UConn's defense, but Marquette shot really poorly overall. They hit just 40% from the field, and they only hit 54.5% of their free throws. The other part of it was the UConn shot extremely well, hitting almost 60% of their shots and 63.2% of threes from beyond the arc. The game has a wild box score - Marquette had 21 more field goal attempts and 17 fewer turnovers than UConn and still lost by eight."", ""St. John's has been climbing the rankings all year and is slightly behind Marquette in the ranks today with a 12 next to their name. At 19-3 there haven't been too many challenges this season that St. John's hasn't been able to conquer. For their Thanksgiving tournament they lost two of three games, dropping a game to Baylor in double overtime. They ended up falling by just one point. The other game was a loss to Georgia by three points. They ran off six straight wins and then dropped a game at Creighton. Even the Creighton loss was a close one. They dropped that game by one point. That brings a total of three losses by a combined five points. Since that loss against Creighton, St. John's has run off eight straight wins. They did have a close call against Providence in their last game, and it could be a matter of them looking forward a bit, but a win is a win. It also could be that Providence plays them well. Both games were decided by two points with St. John's winning both. They've only had a handful of games that have been within 10 points, everything else has been big wins."", ""This should be a nice matchup between two of the better teams in the nation, and two Big East clubs. Normally I would like to take the team that is coming off of a loss, but I think Marquette isn't playing great right now, and is likely to struggle against a good defensive club in St. John's. I'm going to take St. John's in this one to cover the short spread, I actually think they win by seven or more points as well.

#11 Marquette Men’s Basketball Big East Preview Primer: at #12 St. John’s,https://www.anonymouseagle.com/2025/2/3/24357878/marquette-golden-eagles-mens-basketball-big-east-game-preview-st-johns-red-storm-pitino-ejiofor,"['FILED UNDER:', 'The Golden Eagles travel to face the Red Storm for the first time in the season in the wake of a weird loss to UConn.', 'Date: Tuesday, February 4, 2025\nTime: 5:30pm Central\nLocation: Madison Square Garden, New York, New York', 'The Stakes: Marquette is looking to shake off Saturday’s home loss against Connecticut and attempting to pull themselves back into a tie with St. John’s atop the Big East standings. St. John’s is, of course, looking to expand their lead over Marquette to two full games in the standings, although if STJ wins, Creighton would still be only one game back until the Bluejays play on Wednesday.', 'Points: Kam Jones, 19.0 ppg\nRebounds: David Joplin, 5.2 rpg\nAssists: Kam Jones, 6.2 apg', 'Points: RJ Luis, 17.5 ppg\nRebounds: Zuby Ejiofor, 8.1 rpg\nAssists: Kadary Richmond, 4.8 apg', 'Marquette: #19\nSt. John’s: #16\nGame Projection: Marquette has a 38% chance of victory, with a predicted score of 72-68 favoring St. John’s.', 'So Far This Season: How you think this season is going for St. John’s depends on what you thought St. John’s was going to be this season. Did you think that they were going to be a top 20 team like KenPom’s algorithm did when the Red Storm were at #19 on Opening Night? Then this is kind of going about like you thought it was going to go as STJ is at #16 in KP’s rankings as of Monday morning.rankings Were you more like the AP voters, with the majority of the ballots leaving the Johnnies unranked? Then this is going better than expected, as St. John’s is now up to #12 in the country. It’s also not going perfectly well, as all three of their losses — in overtime against Baylor and against Georgia, both in the Bahamas, and at Creighton on New Year’s Eve — qualify as Quadrant 1 losses, leaving them with a 1-3 record at the moment in the biggest determiner of NCAA tournament seeding.', 'But still, barring The World’s Stupidest Collapse, head coach Rick Pitino has the Red Storm pointed towards the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2019 and most likely towards their first non-First Four tourney appearance since 2015. The fact that they’re alone in first place in the Big East right now as well as riding what is, on Monday, tied for the sixth longest active winning streak in the country is just icing on the cake for where the Johnnies are headed this year.', 'Tempo Free Fun: St. John’s has all the makings of a ballclub that is going to give this current right now in the moment iteration of Marquette absolute fits on the court. Even if you throw out the fact that the Red Storm love generating turnovers — #16 in the country in rate per KenPom.com — because MU is terrific at keeping track of the ball, then everything else the Johnnies do on defense is primed to be a problem for the Golden Eagles. They do a solid job pushing you off the three-point line into the teeth of their two-point shooting defense, which is top 10 in the country at the moment. Part of that is because they block shots at an elite clip, with 16.1% of shots getting turned back, and that’s also top 10 in the country. 6’9” Zuby Ejiofor is going to be the primary generator of those blocks in the middle, as he’s just past the top 100 in terms of rate, but Kadary Richmond’s no slouch for a guard/wing with a rate rank in the top 400 per KenPom. STJ is a little bit shaky on the defensive glass, but 1) Marquette’s shakier on the offensive glass and 2) I suspect that the high block rate is working a tiny bit against the Red Storm on the rebounding front. After all, according to the rule book, whoever grabs the ball after a blocked shot is credited with a rebound, and it’s hard to end up with the ball after you get the rejection.', 'On the other end of the floor, yes, St. John’s does have a notable flaw as an offensive basketball team. Yes, they’re a really bad three-point shooting team. Deivion Smith is about the only one on the roster that you could trust to shoot a three-pointer at a 38.9% shooting percentage this season, but 1) he missed three of the four games before coming off the bench to play 28 minutes last time out against Providence and 2) The 6’0” Utah transfer is only shooting 30% against Big East foes.', 'St. John’s knows they have a problem there. That’s why they’re bottom 20 in the country in terms of attempt rate from behind the arc. Remember that old Patrick Ewing clip? “Do you practice that shot? When?” Well, even if they are practicing it, they aren’t good at it, so the Johnnies turn to other options. Here’s the problem for Marquette: The two things that STJ does instead are giant blinking red light flaws with the Golden Eagles. Being #6 in the country in turnover rate is hiding MU also being #254 in the country at two-point defense. The Red Storm aren’t an elite shooting outfit inside the arc either, but they’re better at scoring it inside than MU is at defending, so advantage to the home team in this game.', 'The other they’re they’re doing to make up for not being so hot at shooting the ball from anywhere is getting offensive rebounds at an elite rate. St. John’s stands at #16 in the country in offensive rebounding rate, pulling in 37% of their own misses. They’re a little bit down from that number in league play, but still the best offensive rebounding team in the Big East. Ejiofor rears his head here as well, ranking #43 in the country at scooping up his teammates’ missed shots.', 'The good news out of all of this is that it’s unlikely that Marquette lets St. John’s splash threes at the same clip that UConn did on Saturday. The Huskies converted 63% of 19 attempts — one of the 10 worst three-point defenses in the KenPom.com era, so that’s statistically unlikely to happen again anyway — and the Johnnies have just three games this season where they did better than 39%….. and one of them was the loss to Baylor and none of them are against Big East squads. What really got Marquette into trouble was UConn hitting 57% of their two-pointers as well, and that’s a thing that St. John’s is absolutely capable of recreating if the Golden Eagles aren’t properly causing problems on the defensive end. Even if they do cause some missed shots, the Red Storm want to get that second chance real bad, and so Marquette has to find a way to both stop a quality shot from going in the air but also making sure you’re putting a body on a body in red and white while the shot’s in the air, too.', 'There’s also the general “Marquette’s gotta stop being weird” thing, too. MU lost to UConn not really because of the hot shooting per se, but because they fell behind by 22 points. Same with the loss to Xavier, except that was a 19 point margin at one point. Trailed Butler at the half. Trailed DePaul at the half and had to rally to avoid losing and then got dragged to overtime. Gave up a 23-3 first half run to Georgetown. You get the point. At some point, Marquette has to buckle up and play 40 straight solid minutes of basketball. Like I said earlier, St. John’s seems designed to be a problem for Marquette this year. The last thing that you need to do against a team that looks like a problem for you is dig yourself a hole in the first half.', 'Marquette Last 10 Games: 8-2, with Saturday’s loss to UConn snapping a three game winning streak.', 'St. John’s Last 10 Games: 9-1 and riding an eight game winning streak.', 'All-Time Series: Marquette leads, 29-16', 'Current Streak: Marquette has won six straight against St. John’s after taking the season sweep last season, and the Golden Eagles have won nine of the last 11 encounters.', 'Follow Anonymous Eagle on social media', 'Facebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle', '', 'Gambling Problem?

Empire State of Mind: Rick Pitino has St. John's dreaming big amid historical stretch,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-basketball/empire-state-mind-rick-pitino-has-st-johns-dreaming-big-among-historical-stretch,"['', '', 'NEW YORK — Though the students had been standing for the better part of three hours, the whole of Madison Square Garden joined them with 2:04 remaining in a game that was nearly finished amid a season brimming with possibility. Two free throws from hulking center Zuby Ejiofor gave way to a two-handed slam from lanky forward Aaron Scott, the result of which was a three-possession lead for St. John’s. And when point guard Kadary Richmond swooped through the air to block an attempted 3-pointer at the other end of the court, crossing his arms and clenching his fists in celebration, a roar from the crowd of 16,521 rattled this historic building with a vigor not conjured by Red Storm faithful in nearly 40 years.', ""Nights like this were exactly what the university envisioned by plucking Hall-of-Fame coach Rick Pitino from nearby Iona two seasons ago, entrusting a once-proud program to one of the shrewdest minds college basketball has ever seen. Pitino’s first campaign produced 20 victories and a near-miss on Selection Sunday, when the Red Storm were controversially left out of the NCAA Tournament after three years without a prayer of qualifying under former coach Mike Anderson. But 11 months later, when 12th-ranked St. John’s welcomed No. 11 Marquette to The World’s Most Famous Arena on Tuesday evening, the ramifications for a midweek regular-season game couldn't have been greater. Not only was first place in the Big East at stake after UConn defeated the Golden Eagles over the weekend, but it was also the first time St. John’s would be involved in a top-15 matchup since Jan. 30, 1999, before everyone on the current roster was born."", 'That kind of historical context appealed to Pitino’s whimsical side on a night when defense, rebounding and brute force propelled his team to a 70-64 win, the ninth consecutive victory for St. John’s and the 15th in its last 16 games overall. Three players chipped in double-doubles as the Red Storm (20-3 overall, 11-1 Big East) finished an astounding plus-22 on the glass, demoralizing the Golden Eagles with 21 offensive rebounds that resulted in 16 second-chance points. Neither foul trouble nor heinous outside shooting could derail them in the first leg of what might be remembered as the most pivotal week of St. John’s season with a trip to No. 19 Connecticut looming on Friday night. ', '""This is a very unique team,"" Pitino said. ""They defy statistical data. They just defy all statistical data almost every single game. Their effort level, though, is so incredibly high. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen something like this effort level-wise. A long time. I’m real proud of that.""', 'What Pitino described as the defiance of statistical data might also be viewed as raw coaching prowess, a mountain of which he’s leaned on while authoring 29 seasons with at least 20 victories after adding another by knocking off Marquette. How else to explain the incredible roster-building efforts that assembled the No. 4-ranked transfer portal class in the country and replaced all five starters from the 2023 campaign? Or the 15-0 record at home this season despite ranking 335th nationally in 3-point field goal percentage (29.6%) and 292nd in free-throw percentage (68.7%), a ranking that will surely drop after St. John’s missed 14 of 31 attempts against the Golden Eagles? Or the fairly thin bench that has only played 27% of available minutes this season and included just one player — Utah transfer Deivon Smith — who logged more than five minutes on Tuesday night?', 'Pitino’s ability to shroud all that, to reel off so many wins that St. John’s cracked the top 10 in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll for the first time this century is why this week’s two-game stretch against Marquette and UConn feels like the program’s most noteworthy moment in decades, with St. John’s now matching its best start since program legends Mark Jackson and Walter Berry orchestrated a 20-3 start for head coach Lou Carnesecca during the 1985-86 campaign. The last time St. John’s climbed this high in the rankings was 25 years ago when polarizing forward Ron Artest — now known as Metta Sandiford-Artest — led the Red Storm to a Big East Tournament title. ', 'That team, which was led by former head coach Mike Jarvis, who is now retired, enjoyed one of the most memorable stretches in program history with four victories over ranked opponents across 10 days in February 2000. St. John’s toppled No. 9 Syracuse, No. 18 Connecticut, No. 2 Duke and No. 23 Seton Hall by 23 combined points to foreshadow a postseason run that would include both the school’s third conference tournament championship and its most recent NCAA Tournament victory, a 61-56 escape against 15th-seeded Northern Arizona in the Round of 64. An 18-foot jumper by Bootsy Thornton with 13 seconds remaining against Duke remains an indelible highlight in the St. John’s canon, as the Red Storm became just the third non-conference opponent to win at Cameron Indoor Stadium since 1983 — a span of 129 games. ', '""When they were on the court,"" Jarvis told FOX Sports earlier this week, ""they were all about one thing — and that was winning. They fought like cats and dogs off the court. We had more drama than you can imagine. But on the court, at times, it was like beautiful music, poetry in motion. It was special. It was really a special group of guys that just seemed to be in-sync with one another and complement each other so well.""', 'For Jarvis, who had previously guided the Red Storm to an Elite Eight in 1999, the reanimation of St. John’s by Pitino comes with a groundswell of emotion given the longevity of their relationship. They first crossed paths during the late 1970s, in Boston, when both men were first-time head coaches: the former was working at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (CRLS); the latter was transforming long-dormant Boston University into an NCAA Tournament team. ', 'Jarvis was so enamored with Pitino’s teaching methods and drills that he used to bring his high school team to watch the Terriers practice, scribbling down notes in an effort to ""copy as much as I could,"" from someone who is now the only coach in NCAA history to lead two different programs to national championships (Kentucky, Louisville) and three different programs to the Final Four (Providence, Kentucky, Louisville). He says Pitino later offered him an assistant coaching job at BU during the recruitment of transformative center Patrick Ewing, who played for Jarvis at CRLS and won three consecutive state championships from 1979-81. And while the two never wound up working together — Ewing ultimately committed to Georgetown; Pitino soon joined the New York Knicks as an assistant — their years in close proximity gave Jarvis the chance to ""witness what he could do with a team up close and personal.""', '""I think that Rick Pitino is perfectly situated,"" Jarvis told FOX Sports, ""and he’s at St. John’s at just the right time. I mean, when I came to St. John’s [in 1998], I inherited some great players that [former coach] Fran Fraschilla had recruited. And you know, it was just a matter of me getting those guys to take it to the next level, which we were able to do. But with the NIL and the portal and Rick’s business experience, I think that he’s the perfect fit for St. John’s at this time.""', 'And the city agrees. Pitino was greeted with a standing ovation when he took the floor at 6:21 p.m., his entrance serenaded by Jay-Z’s hit song ""Empire State of Mind."" The juxtaposition between Pitino’s finely tailored suit and the trademark polo over a long-sleeved shirt donned by Marquette head coach Shaka Smart was equal parts comical and a reflection of just how perfectly the former fits this city. Pitino is the reason why celebrities like actor Steve Schirripa from ""The Sopranos,"" New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone and former New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz decided to spend their Tuesday evenings courtside for college basketball. He makes everyone believe. ', 'It is why the student section at one end of Madison Square Garden unleashed such a gutsy chant in the waning seconds of such a satisfying victory. ""We want UConn!"" they shouted in unison, repeating the phrase a half-dozen times. And they’ll get their wish on Friday night when Pitino leads his gritty team into Gampel Pavilion against the two-time defending national champions, the reigning kings of the Big East. ', '""I’m so proud of this damn team,"" Pitino said. ""I’ve been proud of a lot of teams, but I’m so proud of this team. They just are so refreshing with the way they play, how hard they play. They deserve all the credit in the world.""', 'Michael Cohen covers college football and basketball for FOX Sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten.

Greatest college basketball coach of all time? Rick Pitino making his case at St. John's,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/columnist/dan-wolken/2025/02/04/rick-pitino-goat-coach-case-st-johns/78227779007/,"['UCLA coach Mick Cronin joked during a press conference last week that if he had Rick Pitino’s money, “I’d be on a private plane for Cabo right now.” ', ""Well, Rick Pitino has Rick Pitino’s money and he’s not on a plane to Cabo. On the contrary: He's about to win the Big East in Year 2 at St. John’s. "", 'At 72 years old, Pitino’s contemporaries are pretty much gone from college basketball. Jim Boeheim talks on television. Mike Krzyzewski does a podcast. Roy Williams sits in the stands at North Carolina games like a fan. Leonard Hamilton announced Monday he’s calling it a career. ', 'And here’s Pitino, about to take a sixth school to the NCAA Tournament and maybe make his case as the best college basketball coach of all time. ', 'St. John’s, ranked No. 10 in this week’s USA TODAY Sports men’s basketball coaches poll, beat No. 11 Marquette 70-64 on Tuesday to establish a clear lead in the Big East regular season race. And it was classic Pitino, his team running and hustling and guarding like maniacs, winning with grit and pace and 21 offensive rebounds even when 3-pointers (3-for-16) and free throws (17-for-31) weren’t falling. ', 'Watching the game on television, it struck me that I don’t remember any part of my life as a sports fan that doesn’t include Pitino coaching big games and being a relevant figure in March. I had just turned 12 years old when Pitino’s Kentucky Wildcats lost to Christian Laettner and Duke on arguably the most famous buzzer-beater in NCAA Tournament history. ', 'Next month, I’m going to celebrate my 45th birthday, and Pitino will bring yet another team to March Madness with a legitimate chance to make the Final Four. ', 'Sometimes you have to take a step back and appreciate the sheer improbability of such a long, productive run. As much as college sports have evolved, as big as the generation gap has grown, one thing hasn’t changed at all. No matter what, Pitino is going to win — and win big — even as his contemporaries have mostly decided that they’re incapable of navigating the modern era. ', 'For a guy who’s won national championships at Kentucky and Louisville, getting St. John’s to 20-3 with a Big East championship in sight may be as impressive as anything he’s done. ', 'And if you’re an administrator at any major conference school that had an open coaching job over the last five or six years and passed on the chance to hire Pitino, you have to ask yourself: What were you doing? ', 'Yes, Pitino was fired in the fall of 2017 when the sport of college basketball was consumed by fears of an FBI investigation into illegal recruiting that ensnared Louisville recruit Brian Bowen among others. And coming on the heels of another scandal at Louisville, where a female escort claimed she was paid by a staff member to have sex with recruits, it’s obvious why Pitino had to be fired and held accountable — even if it was never proven that he had involvement in, or knowledge of, those misdeeds.', 'But right after the Final Four in 2019, I wrote that UCLA should hire Pitino, who at the time had gone to Greece to coach a pro team in Athens. Yes, there were issues and never-ending controversies. But he had paid his penance, and it was obvious he still had more to give. ', 'The only school willing to give Pitino a chance was Iona, and he rewarded that faith with two NCAA Tournament bids in three seasons. ', 'Even then, it’s not like he was a hot commodity. College administrators largely viewed him as too old, too toxic, too much of a novelty at a time when the sport was looking toward a name, image and likeness future and the coaches in Pitino’s generation were headed toward retirement. ', 'Whoops. Hate to say it, but I told ya so. ', 'Credit St. John’s for being ready to capitalize on the moment. ', 'For all the 1980s romance around the Johnnies and the allure of playing in Madison Square Garden, it has been a pretty terrible program with a clueless administration for a very long time. Over the last 20 years and five coaches, it has made the NCAA Tournament just three times, never advancing beyond the round of 64. The last time St. John’s won a tournament game? It was 2000 — before anyone on its roster was born.', ""Now the Johnnies are 20-3, having just won their ninth game in a row. Only a couple teams in college basketball are on a more impressive streak. Not only is St. John’s a postseason lock now, but it's playing for the kind of seed that could position it for a very, very deep run in March — even with a roster that may not have a future NBA player. "", 'New York City is invested. The Garden is rocking every night. Something special suddenly seems possible. ', 'And only Pitino could have made that happen. ', 'You can relitigate all the controversies and personal embarrassments in his long life and career if you want, but none of those things are relevant to the bottom line here. Nearly every great college coach we’ve seen from Nick Saban to John Calipari has either lost a step or walked away as they’ve reckoned with changes in the sport and their own level of hunger to keep going. ', 'Pitino, by contrast, is still pulling off miracles, still turning around programs, still showing that he’s got a unique ability to pull the absolute best out of players who are tough and well-conditioned enough to play in his system. ', 'And if somehow he can get a fourth school to the Final Four — which suddenly looks like a realistic possibility — he will have an excellent case as the best coach in the history of college basketball.

The St. John's guards are relentless in pressure. Help defense readily and actively swarms to the ball when needed. At the rim, Kansas transfer Zuby Ejiofor has emerged as a force."", ""Over a larger sample size, you'd expect a team with St. John's offensive limitations to have a lower ceiling, yet time and time again, the Johnnies have proven they can stay in games and win with stops on the defensive end."", ""Marquette is the least turnover-prone team in the nation. Even the intense St. John's defense isn't going to make Shaka Smart's veteran lineup crack. Marquette won't lose this game with empty possessions."", 'Instead, the Golden Eagles will continue to be one of the more 3-point focused offenses in the Big East.
