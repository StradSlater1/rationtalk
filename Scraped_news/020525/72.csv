Anderson, MD, MAS, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and primary care physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a press release. “Moreover, long-term aspirin use carries small but serious risks of bleeding.”', 'The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on ASCVD primary prevention, published in Circulation, limited its recommendations for preventive aspirin use to patients with increased ASCVD risk who were aged 70 years or younger without elevated bleeding risk.', '“When it comes to medications, more is not always more,” Anderson said in the release. “Clinicians are increasingly seeking to optimize medication usage by deprescribing medications with little proven benefit or elevated risks. It’s important to know who those efforts are benefiting and who we need to work harder to reach.”', 'To determine whether the updated aspirin recommendations impacted appropriate use per the guidelines, Anderson and Linnea M. Wilson, MPH, clinical researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, conducted an analysis of five cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2023, including 18,294 nonpregnant adults aged 40 to 79 years (mean age, 57 years; 52% women; 68% white).', 'During the study period, aspirin use for secondary prevention in patients with ASCVD remained stable (P = .86), and there was a decline in reported aspirin use for primary prevention after the guidelines were updated in 2019 (23.5% vs. 17.2%; P < .001).', 'Among primary prevention subgroups, the researchers reported an average 11.7 percentage point decrease in aspirin use among adults aged 70 years or older (P < .001) and an average 5.7 percentage point decrease among adults with ASCVD risk less than 10% (P < .001).', 'However, among individuals for whom aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention, there was no significant change in use among Asian, Black or Mexican American individuals or those without a routine health care location, insured by Medicaid or without health insurance, according to the study.', 'Moreover, among individuals with ASCVD risk of 10% or greater for whom primary prevention aspirin may still be recommended, the researchers reported a decline in use after the 2019 guidelines (5.8 percentage points; P = .04).', '“Following landmark clinical trials and changes in guideline recommendations, self-reported primary prevention aspirin use decreased among older adults and adults with low ASCVD risk for whom aspirin was not recommended, but also decreased among adults with higher ASCVD risk for whom aspirin may still be recommended,” Wilson and Anderson wrote in the study. “Furthermore, historically disadvantaged groups were less likely to reduce aspirin use. ... Further attention to reducing low-value aspirin use is warranted given 2022 recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force against initiating primary prevention aspirin in patients 60 years and older, which may have also contributed to observed change.”', 'As Healio previously reported, in 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued its final recommendation against low-dose aspirin initiation for primary CVD prevention in adults aged 60 years or older and issued a C-grade recommendation that low-dose aspirin for primary CVD prevention be considered on a case-by-case basis among those aged 40 to 59 years with a 10% or higher ASCVD risk.', 'Collapse', 'Wilson LM, et al.

', 'New findings from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania show that 48% of adults believe the heart health benefits of taking a low-dose aspirin — 81mg or less — are greater than the risks of bleeding in the stomach, intestines and brain. However, research has shown this is only true for people who have a higher likelihood of heart attack or stroke. ', '""Habits backed by conventional wisdom and the past advice of health care providers are hard to break,"" Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, said in statement. ""Knowing whether taking a low-dose aspirin daily is advisable or not for you is vital health information.""', 'For years, health care providers had recommended people take a low-dose aspirin as a blood thinner to reduce clotting in arteries. Clots can stop blood flow to the heart and brain, trigging heart attacks and strokes. It was believed that aspirin could help prevent these outcomes.', 'However, in 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association stopped recommending daily aspirin for adults over 70, because it can prevent clots in wounds. That risk, particularly for gastrointestinal bleeding, was deemed higher than the heart health benefits of aspirin. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force made a similar recommendation in 2022, advising that adults 60 and over should not begin a low-dose aspirin routine unless they have signs of heart disease or a family history of it.', 'Despite this, almost 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. without a history of heart attack or stroke take a low-does aspirin regularly, the Annenberg Center found. Of that group, 10% said they take it ""basically every day,"" 2% take it a few times a week and 6% a few times per month.

By contrast, only 11% of adults ages 40 to 59 and only 7% of people age 60 and older believe that. The Annenberg Center said this may be because older patients are more familiar with earlier guidances. ', ""A daily dose of aspirin is still a good strategy to prevent heart attacks in people with heart disease – as long as they don't have a higher risk of increased bleeding, the Annenberg Center said.
