The vaccine assessed in that study – ERVEBO®, Merck’s single-dose Zaire ebolavirus vaccine – uses the same recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) viral vector platform as IAVI’s Ebola Sudan vaccine candidate. ERVEBO® is licensed in more than a dozen countries.', 'More about IAVI’s investigational Ebola Sudan vaccine candidate', 'In 2023, IAVI initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of its rVSV-based Ebola Sudan vaccine candidate.
