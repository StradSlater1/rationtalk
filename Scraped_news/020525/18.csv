You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.,https://www.democracynow.org/2025/1/30/gaza_ceasefire,"[""Sign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day."", 'We speak with Palestinian writer and analyst Muhammad Shehada about the ceasefire in Gaza, which has allowed half a million displaced people to return to what’s left of their homes in the north of the territory, as Israel’s ban on UNRWA goes into effect. Hamas militants released another three Israeli captives Thursday, as well as five Thai nationals, all of whom were taken to Gaza during the October 7, 2023, attack. In exchange, Israel will release another 110 imprisoned Palestinians, including 30 children. But while the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire continues to hold, Israeli forces are ramping up attacks on the occupied West Bank, particularly in the Jenin refugee camp. “Israel is trying to turn [Jenin] into a clone of Gaza — ethnic cleansing, pushing people out and destroying homes systematically, one after the other. All of it is to explode the West Bank, to use it as a pretext for a major war to push Palestinians out,” says Shehada.', 'AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.', 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: Israel is scheduled to free 110 Palestinians, including 30 children, from its prisons, after Hamas released three Israelis and five Thai nationals held hostage in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The exchange took place as Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel and became the first senior American official to enter Gaza in nearly 15 years. Witkoff toured the Israeli-occupied Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, embedded among Israeli soldiers. Witkoff is also meeting today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who’s scheduled to visit Trump at the White House next week. Netanyahu’s trip comes just two months after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.', 'AMY GOODMAN: We’re joined right now by Muhammad Shehada, writer and analyst from Gaza. He’s chief of communications at Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, joining us from Copenhagen.', 'Muhammad, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you talk about what unfolded today in Gaza and, as of the time of this broadcast, what is expected to unfold when it comes to the prisoners released by Israel, Palestinian prisoners?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Sure. Thanks for having me, Amy.', 'So, today, Hamas released an Israeli soldier that was captured from Nahal Oz, Agam Berger, in addition to two other civilian Israeli hostages that were released in Khan Younis and five Thai workers.', 'There’s a significance in the way that the release was conducted. Agam Berger was released, basically, in Jabaliya, an area that Israel has wiped out over a process of over a hundred days of systematically destroying every single building in the city. Nothing is left standing. And in Khan Younis, the other hostages were released right in front of Yahya Sinwar’s house, also an area that Israel invaded, wiped out systematically, bombed indiscriminately. So, in both, there is the attempt to say that Israel had no clue throughout these 15 months how to get the hostages out militarily, and the only way to get them out is through a ceasefire, which has been the position mediators have been reiterating for over 15 months.', 'The other thing is that Netanyahu is trying desperately to use any loopholes in the agreement to collapse the ceasefire. We saw that last Saturday when he was supposed to open up the Netzarim Corridor and allow people to go to northern Gaza, and he withdrew from that last minute, postponed it indefinitely, until mediators pressured him. And it happened on Monday in return for hostages that were released today outside of the framework. Today he’s delaying and procrastinating the release of Palestinian captives and prisoners, citing that Hamas’s release of one of the hostages or two in Khan Younis was overcrowded and hostile to the hostages themselves. So he’s demanding a “safe passage,” quote-unquote, which, in other words, as Israeli media is warning us every single day, Netanyahu is trying everything he could to sabotage the deal from this early on. This is why you had Steve Witkoff go to Gaza to see it with his own eyes yesterday, before he even met with Netanyahu, to signify how little trust he has in the Israeli prime minister, to see the progress of the ceasefire on the ground himself and also to emphasize to Netanyahu that the deal has to be seen through.', 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: And so, Muhammad, could you talk a little bit more about that, the significance of Witkoff’s visit? He was in Saudi Arabia before he came to Israel. He’s the first senior, as you said, U.S. official in years to actually go into Gaza. And today he met with Netanyahu, but also with his far-right Cabinet minister, Finance Minister Smotrich. So, you know, what do you make of this? And your assessment of his work on the ceasefire agreement that was reached, that could not — that the Biden administration failed to reach?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Thanks, Nermeen. Very good question. So, basically, with Witkoff, as you said, it’s the first visit in over 15 years. The last time we had a similar visit was John Kerry, when he was a U.S. senator, in 2009, very brief, didn’t even continue for over a day, so only border areas in Gaza and then left immediately. There was not even the pretense by any U.S. official ever since to want to see what’s inside Gaza. So, this is monumental in the sense that he broke a taboo that has been established for over a decade.', ""The other thing is that with Witkoff’s visit to Gaza, there’s also, as you said, the meetings with far-right Israeli ministers. The parallel track that he’s working on is the issue with transferring a million and a half Gazans to neighboring countries. And Israeli media, until last night, have been saying that this is a dead-serious topic that he’s discussing seriously with Netanyahu and his ministers. At the same time, we got the pulse of different sources in Israel, like a Cabinet minister who told The Times of Israel that this talk, this rhetoric about transferring Gazans outside, might appease the Israeli far right and allow Netanyahu to carry on with the deal. It might give Israel the alternative victory image, that it couldn’t destroy Hamas militarily, but now they want to maintain Gaza as an uninhabitable territory to push people to leave. So that might give them this alternative victory image. But on the other side, you have Palestinians saying immediately, “We’re not going to leave, no matter what.” Israel tried that repeatedly in 1951. That’s when they first started trying to convince Egypt to take 12,000 Gazans and resettle them into Sinai. Gazans protested, rioted in an intifada in '55 and killed it. My own family were kicked out of Gaza in ’67 to Egypt, and they were living there for about 27 years. They never forgot. They went back to Gaza as soon as there was an opportunity with the Oslo Accords. So it's not something that is going to be workable for Trump to carry out. You have even people from his own camp, like senators, that are saying that this is unworkable, this is improbable."", 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Muhammad, also, you know, before we move to other issues, the significance of Trump inviting Netanyahu, just as this is occurring, next week to the White House?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Well, it has two significances. Number one is that the U.S. is signaling that international law is obsolete, that they tossed it into the garbage. The international rule-based order is no longer valid, because you have here someone with arrest warrants on his head by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity being honored in Washington, D.C., and in the White House, the highest executive branch of government.', 'At the same time, the other significance is Trump has been showering Netanyahu, lavishing him and his far-right extremist ministers with an enormous, unprecedented gift bag from the moment he walked into office. Some of these gifts are under the pretext of bribing Netanyahu to agree to the ceasefire, but other elements in there have to do more with an extremist, messianic pro-Israeli agenda. So, for example, you have a U.S. immediate lifting of all sanctions on Israeli settlers and extremist groups that the Biden administration imposed. You also have an immediate process to sanction the International Criminal Court and collapse it because it dared to go after Israel. You have that visit to Washington, that Biden was reluctant to extend to Netanyahu despite Biden’s full complicity in the Gaza genocide. And you have other gift bags that are being showered on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir and Netanyahu to buy their complicity and silence.', ""AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about UNRWA. International staff working for the U.N.'s main agency serving Palestinians have been forced to leave Israel after its ban on the agency came into effect. This is the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United — I want to go to the UNRWA spokesperson, Jonathan Fowler, who said Israel's decision could trigger a collapse of humanitarian aid to Palestinians."", 'JONATHAN FOWLER: We’re responsible for over half of deliveries inside the Gaza Strip, over half of the aid coming in. You know, UNRWA, I mean, has been described repeatedly — not by ourselves, but, you know, by others — as the backbone of the international aid operation, because the rest of the aid operation is just — the U.N. presence is just a few hundred people. A few hundred does not equal 5,000. Without UNRWA being able to operate, there’s a very real risk of this — the humanitarian operation collapsing.', 'AMY GOODMAN: So, this is extremely significant, Muhammad, UNRWA out as all the Palestinians are flooding into northern Gaza. If you can talk about both of these issues? Of course, UNRWA is larger than Gaza. It’s serving millions of Palestinians throughout the Middle East.', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Precisely. Well, UNRWA is Gaza’s lifeline. If you take it out, this is a death sentence to Gaza’s population. Since the ceasefire was enacted, my inbox has been flooded with messages from colleagues, from family members, from friends and loved ones, who are literally begging to help to find them any place to stay, to help to even find a tent in northern Gaza, to help to find food to put on the table. If you take UNRWA away, it gets only way worse than this. Whatever rudimentary, basic level of survival that is sustained in Gaza now with the little aid that’s coming in, a lot of it is going to be explicitly banned by Israel, because the Israeli legislation, it bans any imports to Gaza with UNRWA’s label on it, as well as dismantling UNRWA’s network also in Lebanon, for example, where Palestinians are living in refugee camps in abysmal conditions. UNRWA is a vital lifeline there.', ""But it’s not only a matter of service provider. UNRWA has played a transformative role for many Palestinians. My own father, whose family were kicked out in '48 by Israel to a refugee camp, the Shati refugee camp in Gaza, he would have been a barefoot child with no life, with no income, with no purpose, if it wasn't for — in part, for UNRWA providing the infrastructure for education that brought him up as the doctor that I was very proud of until his death because of Israel’s blockade. I myself wouldn’t be standing in front of you now and speaking English and even knowing about politics or the history of the conflict or the history of the Holocaust, if it was not for my UNRWA educational system. I would have not had an educational opportunity. So, if you take all of that away from Gazans, it falls into Israel’s plan to prevent any capacity in Gaza to maintain organized human life, so that people would have to leave, so that Gaza is being emptied out completely. And that’s the main concern."", 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Muhammad, finally, if you could talk about the continuing Israeli assault in the West Bank, in particular, on Jenin?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: So, basically, part of the gift bag that Netanyahu gave to his extremist minister Bezalel Smotrich to agree to the ceasefire in Gaza was to extend the war goals, under the radar, quietly, to include the West Bank. So, now the West Bank, from Israel’s perspective, is a war zone. So, that’s why you have, for example, Israeli checkpoints booming and skyrocketing all across the West Bank, despite the IDF chief of staff, who is a settler himself, Herzi Halevi — he is not a pro-Palestinian left wing, but that IDF chief of staff, he warned Netanyahu and Smotrich. He said, “Don’t put these checkpoints. It will lead and push Palestinians to take to arms, to armed resistance, to resist Israel’s occupation.” But Netanyahu overruled him. In Jenin, you have a way worse dynamic than the rest of the West Bank, where Israel is trying to turn it into a clone of Gaza — ethnic cleansing, pushing people out and destroying homes systematically, one after the other. All of it is to explode the West Bank, to use it as a pretext for a major war to push Palestinians out. That’s the agenda of Israel’s extremist ministers at the moment.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Muhammad Shehada, we thank you so much for being with us, writer and analyst from Gaza, chief of communications at Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor. And that does it for our show. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. Thanks so much for joining us.']"

The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.', '“I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision,” said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. “We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding.”', 'Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it.

No title found,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/waiting-on-a-friend-will-netanyahu-get-a-sweet-deal-or-a-raw-deal-from-trump/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By Shalom Lipner', 'Monty Hall, the legendary host of television’s Let’s Make a Deal game show, was a patron of the Jewish state. But it’s US President Donald Trump—the co-author of Trump: The Art of the Deal, and a person not to be upstaged—who claims unabashedly to be the “best friend that Israel has ever had.” That title will be put to the test on February 4, when he hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.', 'Trump’s pre-presidency was frenetic. Never a disciple of the “one president at a time” school, he injected himself aggressively into the spotlight, dispatching Steve Witkoff, his new Middle East envoy, to that region within weeks of the November election and threatening (amorphously) that there would be “ALL HELL TO PAY” unless hostages in Hamas custody were released by the time of his inauguration. Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security advisor, was quick to attribute Israel’s ceasefires with both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza to the advent of a new administration.', 'Palpable apprehension in world capitals about what courses of action Trump might—or might not—pursue has been a powerful driver of events. However, the significance of January 20 as an inflection point cannot be overexaggerated. With Trump now ensconced firmly in the Oval Office, rhetoric alone will prove insufficient to induce tangible cooperation from the United States’ counterparts, who will be monitoring the pulse of his intentions rigorously.', 'Washington watchers in Jerusalem have been, unsurprisingly, surveying the appointments topography for clues to decipher Trumpland, but they have found its landscape equivocal. Israeli officials are encouraged by the nominations of friendlies Mike Huckabee and Elise Stefanik—as ambassadors to Israel and the United Nations, respectively—but diplomats are not policymakers, and the perspective of Trump’s executive cadre is by no means monolithic. The president himself has toggled in recent months between pledging to “stop all wars” and, on the other hand, telling Netanyahu to “do what you have to do” when it comes to Israel’s enemies. (Relations between the two leaders have known highs and lows.)', 'Soon after his victory, Trump unceremoniously disinvited Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two trusted interlocutors of Israel during his previous tenure, from returning to his leadership team. That vacuum has been filled apparently by Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who both advocated on Capitol Hill for a strong US-Israel bond, but few other principals share their level of prior, high-level engagement with the intricate dynamics of that alliance. Meanwhile, senior bureaucratic echelons at the Pentagon—which has been an essential partner in enhancing Israel’s national security—are being populated by staffers who favor greater detachment from the Middle East.', 'It is against this backdrop that Netanyahu arrives in Washington to plead his case. His wish list from Trump will include US acquiescence for Israel to continue its campaign to dislodge Hamas rule from Gaza; normalization with Saudi Arabia; and a kinetic effort—or, at least, US backing for a potential solo Israeli endeavor—to terminate the threat of a nuclear Iran. The paradox of Netanyahu’s predicament is that Trump’s favorable disposition toward that agenda does not mean their approaches will be similarly aligned.', 'Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich—a stalwart critic of the current truce—is touting assurances from the prime minister to intensify the Gaza war and initiate “a gradual takeover” that ensures “humanitarian aid will not reach Hamas as it has been until now.” Smotrich, a proponent of exercising Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, has also vowed repeatedly to scuttle any diplomatic breakthrough with Riyadh that would entail territorial concessions to the Palestinians. On the Iranian front, Israeli military planners are training their sights increasingly on the near term, before Tehran can recover from the blows that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has inflicted on its defenses and on its Hamas and Hezbollah proxies.', 'Those parameters are almost certain to conflict with the president’s thinking. By all accounts, Trump, as evidenced through Witkoff’s interventions, is interested actually in extending the suspension of combat in Gaza, for the sake of securing the release of all captives and stabilizing the area. The track would then be cleared for Israeli-Saudi rapprochement—along lines that would likely be anathema to Smotrich—and a coveted Nobel Peace Prize for Trump. As for Iran, indications suggest that the president might prefer initially to try and settle that standoff through negotiations.', 'The ball is very much in Trump’s court now. Witkoff met on January 30 with Smotrich and Shas chairman Aryeh Deri, two key stakeholders of Netanyahu’s government, in an attempt to enlist their support for his mission, but their consent will hinge ultimately on the specifics involved. (Right-wing Israelis, who are hoping anxiously that Trump will adopt their cause, have latched tightly onto his manifest enthusiasm for transferring Gaza’s residents to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, although the wisdom and feasibility of that program—opposed stridently by those countries and by Palestinians themselves—are dubious.) The time for command decisions is close at hand.', 'Cessations of hostilities in Lebanon and Gaza are both fragile. Netanyahu’s coalition is also in crisis, with saber-rattling between its various members—who are at loggerheads over controversial legislation to exempt Ultra-Orthodox Jews from military service—jeopardizing the passage of a national budget before a March 31 deadline. Separately, Smotrich has committed to bolt unless the IDF resumes its Gaza incursion, in parallel with expanding counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank. Not only the prime minister’s political fate, but also the future of the entire Middle East is hanging in the balance, waiting for Trump to decide how much slack he is prepared to grant Netanyahu.', 'Much will depend on the president’s definition of friendship for Israel: Will it entail space for the IDF to keep fighting Hamas until the achievement of “total victory”—as Netanyahu has promised and many Israelis are still demanding—at the possible cost of derailing progress with Saudi Arabia? Will it, rather, obligate Israel to wind down its offensive and satisfy Saudi requirements for a pathway to Palestinian statehood, thus, in all likelihood, precipitating the collapse of Netanyahu’s majority in the Knesset? Or might it entertain tradeoffs such as greater Israeli flexibility vis-à-vis the Palestinians in exchange for an augmented US role in confronting Iran?', 'There will be inherent risks in any strategy that Trump chooses to embrace. The only certain thing is that now, as commander in chief, he controls an arsenal of formidable carrots and sticks to deploy in the service of his administration’s objectives. On February 4, the world will be watching to see whether he offers Netanyahu a deal that he can’t refuse.', 'Shalom Lipner is a nonresident senior fellow for Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council.

It could also serve as leverage to extend the Gaza deal."", 'On this subject, Anna Barsky, writing in the Israeli newspaper Maariv, notes that: ""The people who have been pushing that idea in meetings with Trump believe that if the process towards normalisation begins now, it would be a powerful incentive for Israel to prolong the ceasefire so as not to derail the historic peace talks that will already be under way.""', ""This week, Netanyahu faces a major challenge to balance pressures from the US - Israel's closest ally - and domestic ones within his own coalition."", 'While the idea favoured by Saudi Arabia of creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel - the so-called ""two-state solution"" - has long been the international formula for Middle East peace, the Israeli PM and members of his government have become even more strongly opposed to the idea since the 7 October attacks. They argue this would result in a ""terror state"".', 'The existing ceasefire deal has also been dismissed as ""reckless"" by Israeli hardliners, such as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich who say it has endangered Israel\'s security by ending fighting before Hamas was fully defeated in line with war goals.', 'With wide Israeli public support for continuing the ceasefire to free more hostages, other politicians have offered a potential lifeline to Netanyahu.', 'Visiting Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza among those worst hit by the Hamas-led attacks, opposition leader Yair Lapid said of the talks with Trump: ""It\'s important to make crystal clear before that meeting: Netanyahu has a political safety net from the opposition for the deal, for every stage.

Trump says US will ‘take over’ Gaza Strip and doesn’t rule out using American troops,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/politics/netanyahu-trump-white-house-meeting/index.html,"['', 'President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States “will take over” the Gaza Strip — possibly with the help of American troops — while the Palestinians who live there should leave, a stunning proposal that would dramatically reorient the Middle East and subject a population of more than a million to further displacement.', '“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,” Trump said during a joint press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, later describing his vision for the area as a new “Riviera.”', '“We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,” he said.', 'Asked whether he was willing to send US troops to fill a security vacuum in Gaza, Trump did not rule it out.', '“As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece that we’re going to develop it,” he said.', 'Trump’s comments are a remarkable assertion from a sitting American president, particularly one who rose to political power in the United States through his criticism of America’s longest wars in the Middle East and pledges to return US investments back to its citizens. They open a host of questions about how Trump’s land-grab would proceed, what its legal authorities would be and who would pay for the effort.', '“I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,” Trump told reporters in the East Room of the White House. He said later: “This was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”', 'There will be many in the region who oppose Trump’s plan, despite his claim that all of his interlocutors love it. Already, Egypt and Jordan have rejected the notion of accepting additional Palestinian refugees, wary of destabilization and fearful they will never be allowed back home.', 'Trump suggested that was exactly what he envisioned: a future in Gaza that largely does not involve Palestinians.', '“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,” Trump said in the Oval Office earlier in the day. “I heard that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They live like hell. They live like they’re living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative.”', 'Later, he added that Palestinians could be among those who return to Gaza, but he was clear he did not envision the strip as a permanent home for them.', '“Palestinians also. Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there,” he said.', 'Trump, a former real estate developer, said during his press conference that he had studied the matter “closely, over a lot of months.”', 'Those comments followed his suggestion earlier in the day that Gazans move to a new location provided by one or more nations in the Middle East.', '“I mean they’re there because they have no alternative. What do they have? It is a big pile of rubble right now,” Trump said moments before hosting Netanyahu for Oval Office talks.', 'Trump’s suggestion that Gazans leave the strip permanently amounts to a provocative stance that will endear him to Israel’s most conservative politicians but is generally a non-starter for Israel’s neighbors, who have said they are unwilling to accept new Palestinian refugees from the enclave.', 'At first on Tuesday, Trump framed the matter as a humanitarian one, saying it was impossible to believe anyone would want to remain in the war-torn territory.', '“Why would they want to return? The place has been hell,” Trump said, ignoring a reporter who cried out: “Because it’s their home.”', 'Instead of Gaza, he suggested the Palestinians be provided a “good, fresh, beautiful piece of land” to live.', 'Netanyahu, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office, smiled as Trump was speaking. The Israeli leader, under conflicting pressures domestically, was in Washington to ascertain exactly where Trump stands on the next phase of a ceasefire in Gaza.', 'But Trump’s dim views of Gaza as a permanent home for Palestinians was certain to provide grist for far-right allies of the Israeli leader, who have called on Netanyahu to abandon the temporary truce that was struck last month.', 'Two Arab officials expressed puzzlement, concern and pessimism in the immediate wake of Trump’s unexpected remarks.', 'It was “rough, raw, hard to grasp and digest,” one official said, adding that they “need clarity and further development to become understood.”', 'A second official said the comments could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza, stressing the “profound implications such proposals have on the lives and dignity of the Palestinian people, as well as the broader Middle East.”', '“The reality remains that 1.8 million people in Gaza would resist such an initiative and refuse to leave,” the diplomat said. “Saudi Arabia is unlikely to pursue peace under these circumstances, and other nations may reconsider their commitments to the Abraham Accords.”', 'Trump’s comments, meanwhile, drew skepticism from congressional lawmakers, including from some within his own party.', '“We’ll see what our Arab friends say about that. I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza,” said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. “I think that might be problematic. But I’ll keep an open mind.”', 'The American president’s proclamation laying claim to Gaza as US territory did not appear likely to convince Hamas to return immediately to the negotiating table.', 'Trump said he was still determined to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. “We’d like to get all of the hostages, and if we don’t, it will just make us somewhat more violent,” he said.', 'Trump has claimed credit for the hostages-for-ceasefire agreement struck in the days before he entered office – and even officials in the outgoing Biden administration acknowledged Trump’s imminent arrival helped apply pressure on Israel and Hamas.', 'Netanyahu, perhaps seeking to ingratiate himself with his host, praised Trump’s efforts.', '“I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,” Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.', 'But for all of his prodding to get the deal inked, Trump will still need to oversee the remaining two phases of the three-phase plan.', '“We’ll see what happens. We’re dealing with very complicated people, but a deal can absolutely get done,” he said.', 'There was plenty for Trump and Netanyahu to discuss beyond the immediate matter of the ceasefire agreement.', 'There is the prospect of a broader normalization of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia, that former President Joe Biden had been pursuing before the October 7, 2023, attacks. Trump, who openly pines for a Nobel Peace Prize, may see his opportunity in such a pursuit, which could transform the entire Middle East and create a new bulwark against Iran, a common foe to Jerusalem and Riyadh.', 'It’s not clear his comments Tuesday will be helpful. In a statement on X following Trump’s remarks, the Saudi Foreign Ministry restated its long-held position that it will not commit to normalization of relations with Israel without guarantees of a Palestinian state.', '“Saudi Arabia will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that,” the statement said.', 'Whether Netanyahu is interested in diplomacy – or whether he instead sees Trump’s arrival in Washington as a moment to take decisive action against Iran, potentially even taking out its nuclear program – remains to be seen.', 'Ahead off his arrival, there was speculation Netanyahu could use the talks to take Trump’s temperature on a direct strike, seizing a moment when Iranian proxies have been decimated, Iran’s nuclear ambitions appear to be accelerating and while he has friendlier ties to Washington.', 'Before Netanyahu arrived, Trump signed a directive authorizing a tough approach to Iran meant to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon while warning of “obliteration” should he be assassinated by Tehran’s operatives.', 'Trump said he’d left directions for his team on how to respond should he fall prey to an Iranian assassination plot.', '“I’ve left instructions,” Trump said. “If they do it, they’ll be obliterated.”', 'Netanyahu’s visit lasted several hours and included the joint press conference, all meant to demonstrate Trump’s solidarity with Israel.', 'But the comity between the men belied a relationship that’s more complicated than it sometimes appears – with nothing less than the future of the Middle East potentially riding on Trump’s words.', 'In the lead-up to last November’s election, there was little question among Biden’s team that Netanyahu favored a Trump victory, believing he would enjoy a far wider remit from the American government to prosecute his war aims with Trump in office instead of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.', 'Those predictions have not been wrong.', 'Already, Trump has lifted a hold on heavy bomb deliveries to Israel, rolling back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel amid its war in Gaza.', 'But while Trump is popular in Israel, and Netanyahu enthusiastically welcomed his return to the White House, things haven’t always been so cheerful.', 'When Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election victory in 2020, Trump was enraged at what he saw as betrayal. In the months that followed, Trump accused Netanyahu of disloyalty and fumed to the esteemed Israeli reporter Barak Ravid, now a CNN analyst: “F**k him.”', 'Even three years later, after Hamas launched the worst terrorist attack in Israel’s history, it was clear Trump’s sore feelings hadn’t entirely faded.', '“(Netanyahu) was not prepared. He was not prepared, and Israel was not prepared,” Trump said in an interview shortly after the attacks, comments that drew condemnation even from Republicans.', 'But Trump’s remarks Tuesday, delivered next to Netanyahu, suggest the animosity has been forgotten.', 'The prime minister is planning to remain in Washington well beyond his Tuesday talks with Trump. He arrived to Blair House, the presidential guest residence, late Sunday and is expected to stay until the end of the week, including for meetings on Capitol Hill.', 'This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.', 'CNN’s Alex Marquardt, Kaitlan Collins, Zeena Saifi, Lucas Lilieholm and Irene Nasser contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

"As Netanyahu and Trump to meet, Ron Dermer has to find ‘the formula of the century’",https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-netanyahu-and-trump-to-meet-ron-dermer-has-to-find-the-formula-of-the-century/,"['ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 488', '', 'Minister Ron Dermer, perhaps the most influential figure in the government these days, is also Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private ambassador to the US. The Americans know this, and so does anyone involved in diplomacy between the US and Israel.', 'Dermer’s most critical role, beyond the grandiose title of minister of strategic affairs, is to ensure that the interests of the two countries align. This is precisely why Dermer is now stepping into the spotlight: He is the one who will oversee and manage the continuation of the negotiations with Hamas over the second phase of the hostage-ceasefire deal, as was first reported on Channel 12 News over the weekend.', 'American interests do not always align with Netanyahu’s political needs. In such cases, Dermer sometimes pushes the prime minister and at other times backs down. He was the driving force behind the continuous flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, meeting the Biden administration’s maximum demands. Key right-wing ministers — most notably Bezalel Smotrich and former minister Itamar Ben Gvir — opposed and continue to oppose this aid.', 'Dermer understood that resisting the Americans on this sensitive issue was not an option. The supply of aid proceeded at the pace and in the quantities the US administration wanted, and an open clash with President Joe Biden was avoided.', 'It is also worth remembering that at the most critical moments when the humanitarian aid issue was on the table, in the early months of 2024, the war cabinet included ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, which made Dermer’s battle easier.', 'Regarding the hostage deal, Dermer has recognized his own limitations. He supported a deal to bring back the hostages from the very start of the war. He was willing to pay almost any price to see the hostages return home — sometimes even beyond what former ministers Gantz and especially Eisenkot had envisioned.', 'Dermer pushed for the deal based on the framework outlined by Biden as early as last May, but then he encountered roadblocks set by Netanyahu. Dermer backed down and did not directly challenge the prime minister.', 'In fact, he would never do that. The prime minister is the one responsible for Dermer’s impressive career trajectory. He sent Dermer as early as 2004 to serve as Israel’s economic attaché at the embassy in Washington, and appointed him Israel’s ambassador to the US between 2013 and 2021.', 'Right now, in Washington, Dermer is doing everything possible to maintain Netanyahu’s room for maneuver in dealing with President Donald Trump. This time, he is operating in his new, highly sensitive role — head of the team managing negotiations on the hostage deal.', 'Netanyahu promoted Dermer to this role, which he is taking over from Mossad chief David Barnea, because the negotiations on the second phase of the deal are expected to be different, with wider implications — incorporating political and diplomatic elements related to Gaza’s future, the normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, and the broader conflict with Iran.', 'This is no longer just the outgoing Biden administration, focused overwhelmingly on the hostage deal. It is about the geostrategic vision of the new administration, continuing alongside or in parallel with the hostage deal. Netanyahu needs Dermer — his closest confidant — on the ground.', 'Incidentally, Netanyahu’s circle dislikes the prevailing narrative that the hostage deal was consummated only thanks to Trump after he pressured the prime minister.', '“Netanyahu initiated the hostage deal and then received 28 new demands from Yahya Sanwar that delayed the entire process,” one of the prime minister’s close associates told The Times of Israel. “Netanyahu, for his part, refused to compromise on inspections in Netzarim and staying in the Philadelphi Corridor. After Sinwar was eliminated and Hezbollah was struck, Hamas accepted the terms — unrelated to Trump.”', 'It is hard to overstate the importance of Netanyahu’s current visit to Washington. Dermer will have to find the “formula of the century” — how to continue the hostage deal (which he supports) until its completion, while also ensuring the elimination of Hamas in Gaza and maintaining the government’s stability against threats of withdrawal from Bezalel Smotrich’s far-right Religious Zionism party.', 'The prevailing assessment heard in Netanyahu’s office before the trip was that Trump would sum up his demand to Netanyahu in seven words: Bring them home, and then we’ll see.', 'Implementing the second phase of the deal requires a full Israeli withdrawal from all of the Gaza Strip. The Religious Zionism party has threatened to dismantle the government if that happens — unless Hamas is first disarmed and stripped of its control over the Strip.', 'Netanyahu and Dermer will demand an American guarantee allowing the option of resuming the war after — or even before — the deal is implemented. Trump’s preference is to see the process completed, for the sake of Saudi normalization.', 'It is always important to remember: Dermer is a far greater admirer of the American administration than Netanyahu is. Dermer is a Republican at heart, and his network of connections within the current administration, Congress, the Senate and the evangelical world is extensive.', 'Dermer, 53, has spent nearly 40 years of his life in the United States as a student, researcher, and diplomat. He is well-acquainted with the influential figures surrounding Trump, and they all know him from the president’s first term, when Dermer was Israel’s ambassador and a key figure in the drafting of Trump’s “Deal of the Century” and the Abraham Accords.', 'Today, Dermer once again finds himself at the center of a historic challenge, alongside some of those same figures. This time, it is the highly complex task of implementing the hostage deal. Starting Monday, as negotiations begin on the second phase of the deal with Netanyahu’s meeting with Steve Witkoff — and especially Tuesday, after Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump — we will learn whether Dermer has succeeded in his landmark mission.', '', 'Supporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

That's a prospect Netanyahu's allies and most of the Israeli parliament oppose even more fervently after the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the Gaza war. They see a Palestinian state as a security threat to Israel and an undeserved reward to Palestinians after the attack."", 'Victoria Coates, an analyst at The Heritage Foundation in Washington D.C., and a deputy national security adviser to Trump during his first term, said the U.S. president will find it difficult to satisfy that Saudi demand.', '""As much as we might want a deal with Saudi Arabia, you know, Israel is going to, particularly after Oct. 7, remain very, very mindful of its internal security. It has to,"" says Coates.

He is slated to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday.', 'In addition to his meeting with Netanyahu, Witkoff will also speak to the prime minister of Qatar and with Egyptian officials this week, after which he and Netanyahu will discuss sending delegations to engage in further talks about moving to the second stage of the ceasefire deal.', 'As per the terms of the ceasefire and hostage deal, negotiations for the second phase of the agreement must begin no later than the 16th day of the first phase, this coming Monday.', 'Despite this, the Walla news site reported Saturday that Netanyahu will not send a team of negotiators to Qatar until after his meeting with Trump.', 'According to the report, Netanyahu canceled a planned meeting at the last minute on Saturday night with Mossad chief David Barnea, Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, hostage point man Nitzan Alon and other senior negotiators.', 'The officials were informed of the cancelation by Netanyahu’s military Roman Gofman, who told them that the premier had decided not to send the team to Qatar until after his upcoming meeting with Trump. However, delaying the negotiations until then would appear to violate the terms of the deal.', 'Netanyahu’s decision is a “very worrying sign” about the implementation of the second phase, an anonymous Israeli source told the news outlet, expressing concern that it could also negatively impact the fulfillment of the ongoing 42-day first phase.', 'The second phase of the deal is expected to include the return of all the remaining living hostages — including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers — held by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian security prisoners and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Strip.', 'Reports have increasingly indicated, however, that Netanyahu is seriously entertaining the possibility of resuming the war after the first phase of the deal, as the far-right members of his governing coalition have demanded, rather than continuing on to the second phase.', 'Earlier on Saturday, Channel 13 reported that the premier held a meeting on Friday on the possibility of resuming the war in Gaza.
