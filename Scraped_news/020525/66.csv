Wobbling stars reveal hidden companions in Gaia data,https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia/Wobbling_stars_reveal_hidden_companions_in_Gaia_data,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Using data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, scientists have found a huge exoplanet and a brown dwarf. This is the first time a planet has been uniquely discovered by Gaia’s ability to sense the gravitational tug or ‘wobble’ the planet induces on a star. Both the planet and brown dwarf are orbiting low-mass stars, a scenario thought to be extremely rare.', 'New research, published today, uses data collected by ESA’s Gaia spacecraft to confirm the existence of two mysterious celestial objects. Gaia-4b is a ‘Super-Jupiter’ exoplanet, and Gaia-5b a brown dwarf. These massive objects are unexpectedly orbiting low-mass stars.', ""Gaia-4b is a planet orbiting the previously unremarkable star Gaia-4 around 244 light-years away. Gaia-5b orbits the Gaia-5 star, around 134 light-years away from Earth. These two newly discovered objects are nearby, in our own galactic neighbourhood. Their existence challenges current theories of planet formation, and Gaia's ongoing mission will provide valuable data to help us understand these intriguing objects."", '“Gaia-4b is about twelve times more massive than Jupiter. With an orbital period of 570 days, it is a relatively cold gas giant planet,” explains first author Guðmundur Stefánsson of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and first author of the new study.', '“With a mass of around 21 Jupiters, Gaia-5b is a brown dwarf, more massive than a planet but too light to sustain nuclear fusion to be a star,” Guðmundur adds.', 'Since its launch in 2013, ESA’s Gaia spacecraft has been building the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of our galaxy. Spinning slowly, it scanned the sky with two optical telescopes, repeatedly pinpointing the positions of two billion objects with unprecedented precision, until its end of science observations on 15 January 2025. Because Gaia precisely tracked the motion of stars – a technique known as astrometry – thousands of new objects are expected to be discovered in its data.', 'A planet in orbit around a star creates a tiny gravitational ‘tug’ that makes the star ‘wobble’ around its centre of mass and travel in a corkscrew-like motion across the sky. The easiest objects to discover using astrometry are massive and in distant orbits around their parent star. Previously, a few massive brown dwarfs were confirmed to exist by other telescopes who observed their faint glow next to bright stars for which Gaia had detected such a wobble.', 'That’s in contrast to the transit method, which detects planets as they pass in front of their star and is most likely to find planets in a close orbit. And although detecting a wobble suggests a star might have a planet, there are other potential causes (such as binary star systems), so astrometric discoveries must be confirmed using other methods.', '“Gaia was repeatedly scanning these stars, building up an increasingly detailed picture over time,” Guðmundur says. “In 2022, Gaia Data Release 3 included a list of stars that appear to be moving as though pulled by an exoplanet. Using ground-based spectroscopic data and the radial velocity technique to investigate these stars, we confirmed our first planet and our first brown dwarf.”', 'Combining astrometric and radial velocity data allows astronomers to find all the orbital details and the mass of the orbiting object, offering a unique opportunity to create three-dimensional visualisations.', ""“About 75% of the stars in the Milky Way are low-mass stars, with masses between about 10% and 60-65% of the mass of the Sun. Because they're so numerous, they're also our nearest neighbour stars,” explains Guðmundur. “Massive planets around low-mass stars are known to be relatively rare, but when they occur, they cause a larger wobble, and therefore a stronger astrometric signature that is easier to detect.”"", 'Whereas a previous exoplanet was found by the Gaia and Hipparcos missions in tandem, the presence of Gaia-4b was revealed by Gaia data alone.', 'When the next batch of Gaia data is released in 2026, it will contain 5.5 years of mission data that could uncover hundreds – if not thousands – of planets and brown dwarfs around nearby stars. That will give us new insights into how these different objects form, and Gaia is paving the way for a new era of astrometric discovery, leading to a deeper understanding of the diverse planetary systems that populate our galaxy.', 'ESA Research Fellow Matthew Standing is an exoplanet expert. “This discovery is an exciting tip-of-the-iceberg for the exoplanet discoveries we can expect from Gaia in the future,” he explains. “The discovery of Gaia-4b is an important breakthrough in the use of Gaia astrometry for exoplanet detection, complimenting the other exoplanet detection methods used by ESA’s Cheops and the upcoming Plato mission.”', '""Gaia has seen the telltale signs of known exoplanets before, but this time Gaia revealed an entirely new extrasolar world,” says Johannes Sahlmann, Gaia Project Scientist at ESA. “The discovery of Gaia-4b shows how Gaia’s detailed measurements complement established exoplanet discovery techniques and offer new opportunities for exoplanet research. The upcoming fourth Gaia data release will be a treasure trove for planet hunters.”', '""Gaia-4b and 5b: Radial Velocity Confirmation of Gaia Astrometric Orbital Solutions Reveal a Massive Planet and a Brown Dwarf Orbiting Low-mass Stars"" by Guðmundur Stefánsson et al is published today in The Astrophysical Journal. https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ada9e1', 'For more information, please contact:\nESA Media relations\nmedia@esa.int', '', '']"

Gaia Was Right. It Did Find a Planet.,https://www.universetoday.com/170755/gaia-was-right-it-did-find-a-planet/,"['UNIVERSE TODAY', 'Space and astronomy news', 'The ESA’s Gaia mission mapped the positions and velocities of stars with extreme precision by measuring about one billion stars multiple times. It created a massive 3D map of the Milky Way that will pay scientific dividends for years to come. Gaia is based on astrometry, the study of the positions and movements of celestial objects.', 'Gaia also tentatively detected some planets, and new radial velocity studies have now confirmed the existence of one of them. The planet is an important outlier in exoplanet science.', 'Gaia wasn’t designed to be a planet finder, but it found some anyway. Since the spacecraft was built to measure stars, the planets it found are massive, and they orbit low-mass stars. These planets tug on their stars, and Gaia can detect the way the stars wobble. However, follow-up observations were required to confirm them.', 'Now, researchers have used the NEID spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at the NSF’s Kitt Peak National Observatory to measure these stellar wobbles and the planet and brown dwarf that cause them via radial velocity. Their results are in a paper published in The Astronomical Journal. Its title is “Gaia-4b and 5b: Radial Velocity Confirmation of Gaia Astrometric Orbital Solutions Reveal a Massive Planet and a Brown Dwarf Orbiting Low-mass Stars.” The lead author is Gudmundur Stefansson from the Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy at the University of Amsterdam.', '“Gaia is more than living up to its promise of detecting planetary companions to stars with highly precise astrometry…”', 'The most recent Gaia data release contains a list of Gaia AStrometric Objects of Interest (Gaia-ASOIs). They’re stars that appear to be moving as if influenced by an exoplanet.', 'In a press release, lead author Stefansson said, “However, the motion of these stars is not necessarily due to a planet. Instead, the ‘star’ might be a pair of stars that are too close together for Gaia to recognize them as separate objects. The tiny shifts in position that appear to be due to a planet might actually result from the nearly perfect cancellation of the larger shifts in position of the two stars.”', 'Follow-up spectroscopy can do what Gaia can’t and determine if the objects are binary stars or stars and their orbiting planets. The researchers used the NEID spectrograph and two others—the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and the FIES Spectrograph to perform follow-up observations. In radial velocity, spectrographs measure the blue-shifted and red-shifted light from stars as nearby planets tug on them and make them wobble. It takes extreme precision to do this, and all three spectrographs are capable of it.', 'The researchers examined 28 separate star systems where Gaia detected candidate exoplanets.', 'According to the results, 21 of the systems have no substellar companions. Instead, these 21 are binary star systems. Five others are inconclusive and require more observations and data before they can be confirmed or refuted.', 'However, two of the 21 are confirmed: one is an exoplanet now named Gaia-4b, and one is a brown dwarf named Gaia-5b.', 'Gaia-4b is a massive exoplanet with about 11.8 Jupiter masses. It follows a 571-day orbit around a star with a mass of 0.644 solar masses. It has the distinction of being the first confirmed exoplanet found by Gaia. It’s also one of the most massive planets that have ever been detected orbiting a low-mass star, reflecting the observational bias inherent in Gaia’s method.', '“It is an exciting time for both NEID and Gaia,” said Jayadev Rajagopal, a scientist at NSF NOIRLab and a co-author of the paper. “Gaia is more than living up to its promise of detecting planetary companions to stars with highly precise astrometry, and NEID is demonstrating that its long-term radial velocity precision is capable of detecting low-mass planets around those stars. With more candidate planets to come as roughly the last year of data is analyzed, this work is a harbinger of the future where Gaia discoveries of planets and brown dwarfs will need to be confirmed, or rejected, by NEID data.”', 'Gaia-5b is a brown dwarf, an object in between planetary mass and stellar mass. Gaia-5b has about 21 Jupiter masses and follows a highly eccentric 358-day orbit around a star with a mass of about 0.34 solar masses.', 'This study highlights how effective Gaia’s astrometric capabilities are for detecting exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It also exemplifies how different observational techniques—astrometry and radial velocity spectrometry—can work together for more robust results. The combined methods can find a wider range of substellar companion masses and orbital characteristics compared to the transit method, for example.', '“If we want to understand how planets are formed, it is necessary to have a vision of how the whole planetary system is composed,” said the ESA’s Ana Heras in a separate press release. “Currently, our vision of most systems is only partial because each detection technique is efficient for a certain range of planet sizes and orbital periods. Being able to combine all techniques and data is critical to understand what planetary systems look like and to put our Solar System in context.”', 'Gaia-4b is an outlier in exoplanet discoveries. Finding such a massive planet around such a low-mass star is a big test for our planet formation theories. “With respect to stellar host-star mass, the occurrence of massive planets is known to decrease with decreasing stellar mass,” the authors write in their paper. “This has been connected to the fact that less massive stars tend to have less massive protoplanetary disks.” If Gaia and the NEID spectrograph and other facilities can find and confirm more of these massive planets, maybe researchers can make progress in understanding how they form.', 'Astronomers expect to find more massive exoplanets and brown dwarfs in Gaia data and confirm some of them with spectrographs like NEID. Due to Gaia’s observational method, there will likely be more “outliers” in the data. These outliers are needed to help us understand planet formation and solar system architecture.', '“These detections represent the tip of the iceberg of the planet and brown dwarf yield expected with Gaia in the immediate future, enabling key insights into the masses and orbital architectures of numerous massive planets at intermediate orbital periods,” the authors conclude.', 'You must be logged in to post a comment.', 'This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

MATSOPOULOS', 'NEID (rhymes with fluid) is a high-precision radial-velocity spectrograph that is designed to measure the extremely minute wobble of nearby stars using the radial velocity effect. This effect results from the mutual gravitational force between a planet and its host star which causes the star’s position to shift very slightly as the planet travels around it. With this powerful capability, one of NEID’s main science goals is to confirm exoplanet candidates found by other exoplanet missions.', 'NEID is funded by the NASA/NSF Exoplanet Exploration Program (NN-EXPLORE) and is mounted on the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at the U.S. National Science Foundation Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), a Program of NSF NOIRLab.', 'One mission that NEID is complementing is the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Gaia spacecraft. Through its precise monitoring of the positions and motions of stars in our galaxy, Gaia is revolutionizing our understanding of many areas of astrophysics. With its exquisite precision, Gaia is expected to be able to detect thousands of exoplanets in orbit around nearby stars.', 'Unlike the radial velocity method used by NEID, Gaia uses a technique known as astrometry to detect a star’s motion. This technique involves measuring the subtle motion of a star as it is tugged by the gravity of an orbiting planet by looking at how the star moves compared to background or nearby stars.', 'Recently, as part of the latest Gaia data release, a list of stars that appear to be moving as though pulled by an exoplanet — the list of Gaia AStrometric Objects of Interest (Gaia-ASOIs) — was published. “However, the motion of these stars is not necessarily due to a planet,” said Guðmundur Stefánsson, assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam and lead author of the paper appearing in The Astrophysical Journal. “Instead, the ‘star’ might be a pair of stars that are too close together for Gaia to recognize them as separate objects. The tiny shifts in position that appear to be due to a planet might actually result from the nearly perfect cancellation of the larger shifts in position of the two stars.” ', 'To weed out these binary stars and harvest the true planets, it is necessary to conduct follow-up observations with spectroscopy. To do so, the team used observations from NEID and two other spectrographs: the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) on the 10-meter Hobby Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory in Texas, and the FIES Spectrograph on the 2.6-meter Nordic Optical Telescope at La Palma in the Canary Islands.', 'With these powerful instruments the team conducted follow-up observations of 28 star systems with planet candidates identified by Gaia. They found that of the 28 candidate systems 21 were false positives and were actually binary star systems — two stars that orbit a common center of mass. They also confirmed that one system is a star hosting a brown dwarf [1] — an object with a mass in between those of planets and stars — but one was a star hosting a giant planet.', 'The newly discovered exoplanet, named Gaia-4b, has an orbital period of 570 days and a mass of 12 Jupiter masses and orbits a star 64% of the mass of the Sun. Not only is Gaia-4b the first planet ever detected by Gaia using the astrometric technique whose orbital solution is fully and independently confirmed, but it is also one of the most massive planets known to orbit a low-mass star.', '“It is an exciting time for both NEID and Gaia,” says Jayadev Rajagopal, scientist at NSF NOIRLab and a co-author of the paper. “Gaia is more than living up to its promise of detecting planetary companions to stars with highly precise astrometry, and NEID is demonstrating that its long-term radial velocity precision is capable of detecting low-mass planets around those stars.
