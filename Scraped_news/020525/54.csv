The Five: Top storylines at WM Phoenix Open,https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/needtoknow/2025/02/04/the-five-wm-phoenix-open-storylines-scottsdale-scheffler-clanton-theegala,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '6 Min Read', 'Need to Know', '', '', '', 'Get to know Florida State’s Luke Clanton', 'A', 'Change Text Size', 'It’s coined “The People’s Open” for a reason. The WM Phoenix Open is perpetually known as one of the most memorable stops on the PGA TOUR calendar, featuring a raucous environment that has broadened the notoriety of the event, and an increasingly competitive field that has elevated its importance.', 'To prep for what will surely be another memorable WM Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale, here’s a look at the top five storylines for the week.', 'The WM Phoenix Open and Scottie Scheffler are a match made in heaven. History tells us that those who play well at TPC Scottsdale are apt to repeat it, and nobody has become a bigger horse for specific courses – including this week’s track – than Scheffler over the last three years.', 'If it feels like there’s a wave of Scheffler dominance every year around this time, well, there is. Ten of Scheffler’s 13 TOUR wins have come between February and April, including two victories at this week’s WM Phoenix Open. His next few starts will include the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard, THE PLAYERS Championship and the Masters, all tournaments Scheffler has won more than once.', '', '', '', 'Scottie Scheffler, caddie conversation on No. 18 at Pebble Beach', 'So, rejoice, it’s the start of another Scheffler season! His season debut at last week’s AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am shouldn’t dissuade any expectations. Scheffler finished in a tie for ninth and led the field in Strokes Gained: Approach, despite not swinging a club for weeks after injuring his hand in the offseason. Scheffler’s one weakness was his performance around the greens, but as the competitive rust continues to wear away, one of the best short-game players in the world will likely return to that level.', 'So, can Scheffler win a third WM Phoenix Open title and spark another run? He’s far-and-away the betting favorite, matching his standing in the sport.', 'Hotshot amateur Luke Clanton could have his TOUR card by Friday afternoon. The standout Florida State junior is in the field on a sponsor exemption and is just one made cut away from reaching the 20-point PGA TOUR University Accelerated threshold, which, if achieved, earns him the ability to take up TOUR membership after the conclusion of the college season.', 'Clanton has made 8-of-10 cuts in his TOUR career, twice finishing runner-up along with two other top 10s. He’s amassed a consistent display of competence that rivals any amateur in recent memory. Others like Nick Dunlap made a bigger splash with a victory, but Clanton has displayed a weekly floor that projects him as one of the most pro-ready amateurs of this generation.', 'A majority of his 19 Accelerated Points have come via his performance on TOUR. He most recently gained his 18th point with a made cut at the Farmers Insurance Open. He earned a 19th point earlier this week by way of his 26th career week as No. 1 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking, making way for ""The People’s Open"" to possibly serve as Clanton’s coming out party.', 'If Clanton reaches the 20-point threshold, he will have the option to take membership after the 2025 spring collegiate season. He can also defer his status until after his senior year, as Vanderbilt’s Gordon Sargent did a year ago.', 'A bad first month on the PGA TOUR is hardly irreversible, nor is it long enough to truly call a slump.', 'A better characterization would be stumble, and two of the top Americans in the world – Sahith Theegala and Max Homa – have a chance to correct course after early-season stumbles.', 'Theegala, like Scheffler, has shown a sticky affinity for TPC Scottsdale. He broke through in front of a national stage in 2022, contending on Sunday and ultimately finishing T3. He finished T5 last year, as well. The course fits him well, where he can show off his strong approach play and short-game prowess while not needing to worry too heavily on any accuracy shortcomings off the tee. But through the first month of the year, Theegala’s typical strengths have disappeared. Theegala ranks 117th in SG: Off the Tee and 118th in both SG: Approach and SG: Around the Green. Simply put, Theegala is playing like a below-average TOUR pro. Can Theegala find his mojo inside the comfy confines of TPC Scottsdale? Nobody would be surprised, if so. If he struggles, the concerns will only grow louder.', '', '', '', 'Sahith Theegala joins Happy Hour with Smylie Kaufman at The Sentry', 'Homa hasn’t had the same high-end results in Phoenix as Theegala, but he’s been remarkably consistent throughout his career. He’s made the cut in five of six appearances with two top 10s.', 'Like Theegala, Homa has struggled with his approach play in 2025. Homa ranks 173rd in Strokes Gained: Approach. The American should be owed some grace, he switched coaches and equipment in the offseason, changes that take time to implement. But at some point, the results need to follow and Homa has dropped outside the top 50 in the world, without a top 10 since last May.', 'The final round of the WM Phoenix Open will have broader implications than who will emerge as the next PGA TOUR winner. The results directly impact who will play The Genesis Invitational, the third Signature Event of the season.', 'Five spots in next week’s field remain up for grabs through the Aon Swing 5, a collection of the top five players not exempt via a higher category, who accumulate the most FedExCup points during the tournaments between Signature Events. For The Genesis Invitational, that includes the points accumulated only from the 2025 Full-Field Events.', 'Here’s a look at the current projections:', '1. Sam Stevens\n2. J.J. Spaun\n3. Andrew Novak\n4. Justin Lower\n5. Lee Hodges', '--', '6. Charley Hoffman\n7. Kris Ventura\n8. Adam Schenk\n9. Alex Smalley\n10. Beau Hossler', 'The Austrian’s resume wasn’t light entering 2025 as a two-time TOUR winner and Ryder Cup participant, but his start to the year is making an argument that there is a ceiling Straka has yet to realize.', 'Straka won The American Express running away, then led the star-studded AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. If he hadn’t been battling a sickness that ultimately caught up with him on the weekend at Pebble, Straka might’ve been entering this week with back-to-back victories. He’s No. 1 in the current FedExCup and rose to a career-high 16th in the Official World Golf Ranking.', 'The WM Phoenix Open is the next box to check, if only because it’s a place Straka has historically struggled. He’s finished CUT-CUT-T66 in three appearances and hasn’t played since 2022. A strong showing at a course that he hasn’t favored would be another arrow in his quiver and push him further toward a breakthrough 2025 campaign.', 'View All News', 'WM Phoenix Open', 'View Tee Times', 'Copyright © 2025 PGA TOUR, Inc.

Scheffler made his first start of the season last week, finishing T-9 at Pebble Beach. He is the +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300) in the 2025 WM Phoenix Open odds, while every other golfer in the 2025 WM Phoenix Open field is outside 10-1. Should you include Scheffler in your 2025 WM Phoenix Open bets? Play gets underway from TPC Scottsdale on Thursday, Feb. 6, and 132 players will be in the WM Phoenix Open field. "", 'Other 2025 WM Phoenix Open contenders include Justin Thomas (11-1), Hideki Matsuyama (16-1) and Sungjae Im (20-1). Matsuyama is a two-time winner at this tournament as well, while Thomas is making his 11th appearance at TPC Scottsdale. Matsuyama is +140 (risk $100 to win $140) to finish inside the top 10, while Thomas is +230 (risk $100 to win $230) to finish inside the top five. Before making any 2025 WM Phoenix Open picks, you need to see the 2025 WM Phoenix Open predictions and best bets from golf insider Patrick McDonald.', 'McDonald joined CBS Sports as a golf writer in 2022 after stops at NBC Sports and RyderCup.com. Covering the sport from a broader perspective, McDonald still likes to dip his toes into the betting pools on a weekly basis between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and more. Featured weekly on the Early Wedge, he gave out numerous winners in 2024, including Jake Knapp (50-1) at the Mexico Open and Xander Schauffele (20-1) at the PGA Championship. He already nailed Sepp Straka as a 66-1 longshot in The American Express three weeks ago. Anyone who followed his betting picks could have been way up on betting apps and sportsbooks.', 'Now, McDonald has focused his attention on the 2025 WM Phoenix Open field and locked in his best bets and top longshot sleepers. You can only see them here.', 'McDonald loves the value of Kurt Kitayama at +5500 (risk $100 to win $5,500) this week. Kitayama made the cut in 19 of 23 events last season, posting four top-10 finishes. One of those top-10s came at TPC Scottsdale, where he finished T8 at 13-under par, and he closed the 2024 season by posting four top-25 finishes in his final five starts. ', 'He made the cut in the Sony Open in Hawaii and The American Express last month, and he should be rested after having the week off last week. Kitayama ranks inside the top 15 on the PGA Tour in strokes gained off the tee, allowing him to contend with even a mediocre short game. He has the tools to make a run at the title this weekend if he can put everything together in Phoenix. ', '""Kitayama may be one of the most underrated players on the PGA Tour by metrics alone. With a phenomenal tee to green, the one-time winner hasn\'t flashed on leaderboards recently due to a poor short game. He has made an improvement to start the season and that should pay dividends this week,"" McDonald told SportsLine. See who else to back here.', 'McDonald has locked in his best bets for the 2025 WM Phoenix Open and has also selected an epic longshot who\'s priced over 300-1.

WM Phoenix Open DFS picks 2025: Our expert's pick to win might surprise you,https://www.golfdigest.com/story/wm-phoenix-open-dfs-picks-2025,"['', 'FANTASY ADVICE', 'After a thrilling week at Pebble Beach, the PGA Tour heads to TPC Scottsdale for the WM Phoenix Open, one of the longer-running events on the schedule with a distinct personality. Consistently one of the highest-attended and rowdiest tournaments of the season, the WM Phoenix Open creates a unique setting for professional golf that is rarer than it should be. Much of that has to do with the venue, and TPC Scottsdale is one of the best realized versions of stadium-style professional golf. The Tom Weiskopf design features a great deal of risk/reward par 5s, an incredibly engaging drivable par-4 17th hole, and in general, a plentiful mix of birdie opportunities while still challenging the modern PGA Tour golfer. The winning score nearly always falls between 17 and 21 under par, and we can expect pristine weather conditions once again in Scottsdale.', 'RELATED: WM Phoenix Open picks 2025: Our two PGA pros are betting on Billy Horschel. Here’s why', 'The field will be headlined by Scottie Scheffler, already a two-time champion at this event, who will be joined by the likes of Justin Thomas, Sam Burns, Sahith Theegala, Sungjae Im, Jordan Spieth and two-time WM Phoenix Open champion Hideki Matsuyama. Scheffler looked impressive in his return from a hand injury that kept him sidelined during the opening month of the season, and he remains the man to beat this week in the desert.', 'RELATED: Why our PGA pro is fading Rory at TGL vs. LAGC', 'Ben Jared', 'There’s truly no need to overthink this one. Scottie Scheffler returned last week to competition and looked in mid-season form, leading the field in approach play. It was encouraging to see the two-time Masters champion shake the rust off, and he now returns to a golf course where he has already recorded two victories and a third-place finish last year.', 'RELATED: Max Homa offers, uh, unconventional WM Phoenix Open pro-am advice to former NFL quarterback', 'While Hideki Matsuyama looked excellent to open the season, I unfortunately believe that he is trending in the wrong direction. Matsuyama lost over a stroke in both ball-striking categories last week at Pebble Beach for the first time in months, and the putter appears to be trending in the wrong direction as well.', ""RELATED: Former major champ's simple slow-play fix? Ban AimPoint"", '', '', '', '', 'Harry How', 'I was certainly encouraged by what I saw last week from Tom Kim at Pebble Beach, as the three-time PGA Tour winner gained strokes in all four major strokes-gained categories. Kim recorded a 17th-place finish at this event last year, and his strong combination of accurate driving and middle iron approach play will continue to pay dividends at TPC Scottsdale.', 'Though Benny An certainly has some encouraging course history at TPC Scottsdale, I have not been impressed with his play to open the 2025 season. An has now lost over a stroke on approach in all three starts to open the season, and it’s hard to pay this price tag for a player in such poor iron form.', 'Kurt Kitayama is my official pick to win this week (non-Scottie division), and his elite combination of power off the tee and elite middle-iron play is a perfect fit for TPC Scottsdale. Unsurprisingly, Kitayama has already recorded an eighth and a 23rd in both of his appearances at the Weiskopf design, gaining strokes in all four major categories in both appearances.', 'Ben Jared', 'I will continue to fade Max Greyserman every week until he is priced correctly, and this event is no different. Greyserman withdrew last week from Pebble Beach with a hand injury, and he now travels to a golf course he has never played before that will certainly expose his poor approach play. There is no need to pay this price tag for a player that should be in the mid-seven thousand range.', 'Ezra Shaw', 'Sam Stevens is one of my absolute favorite plays on the slate this week, and I fully believe he possesses the upside to win this event. Stevens is coming off a 17th-place finish at Pebble Beach where he gained four strokes off the tee, and he nearly won at Torrey Pines the prior week. Stevens’ strong combination of long and accurate driving should yield him a significant advantage at TPC Scottsdale.', 'Similar to Greyserman, I remain a long-term seller on Harry Hall, and he has accumulated much of his early season success via an unsustainable method of elite short game and putting. Hall is an incredibly weak driver of the ball, and his approach play is just as inconsistent. We saw him fall back to earth last week at Pebble Beach when the putter didn’t cooperate, and I would expect more of the same this week in Scottsdale.', 'Ben Jared', 'Gary Woodland is quietly rounding into form, and he has now opened the season with back-to-back top-25 finishes at the Sony Open and AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am where he gained strokes in both ball-striking categories. The former U.S. Open champion now returns to a golf course where he has already recorded won at in 2018, along with four other top-20 finishes.', 'Jennifer Perez', 'At $6,600, K.H. Lee is one of my favorite value plays on the entire slate. Lee has already won twice at the Tom Weiskopf-designed TPC Craig Ranch, and he also has a runner-up finish at TPC Scottsdale. Coming off a ninth-place finish at the Farmers Insurance Open, I expect Lee to continue to surprise in the desert.', 'Andy Lack is a PGA Tour writer and podcaster from New York City who now resides in Los Angeles.

The raucous crowd at the famous 16th hole followed by a memorable finishing stretch of holes has turned into a Super Bowl Sunday staple leading up to the big game.', 'Being sandwiched between two signature events has made the field slightly weaker than the last few years, but there will still be plenty of big names teeing it up. Some players making the trip to Scottsdale this week include Scottie Scheffler, Justin Thomas, Hideki Matsuyama, Max Homa, Sungjae Im and Sahith Theegala. ', 'TPC Scottsdale is a par-71 that measures 7,261 yards and features Poa trivialis greens. ', 'Let’s take a look at several metrics for TPC Scottsdale to determine which golfers boast top marks in each category over their last 24 rounds:', 'Approach will once again be very important this week.', 'Last year, Nick Taylor gained 5.2 strokes on approach. In 2023, Scottie Scheffler gained over 10 strokes on approach. When Brooks Koepka won, he was second in the field in strokes-gained approach trailing only Jordan Spieth, who finished fourth. In 2020, Webb Simpson ranked first in the field in the category en route to a playoff victory over Tony Finau.', 'The greens are relatively flat and pins should be accessible.', 'Total strokes-gained approach over past 24 Rounds:', 'TPC Scottsdale is a course that benefits players who can hit it long and straight with the driver. Being in the fairway and close to the green will give players plenty of scoring opportunities. ', 'Strokes-gained off the tee on driver-heavy courses over past 36 Rounds:', 'Greens tend to get really firm and fast in the Arizona desert. Statistically, the greens at TPC Scottsdale have qualified as “firm” and “fast” in every round but two since 2015.', 'Strokes-gained putting on fast greens over past 36 rounds:', 'This statistic will incorporate players who have fared well while playing desert golf in the past.', 'Strokes-gained total in the desert over past 36 rounds:', 'Statistics from previous years at TPC Scottsdale say greens in regulation at the course are much more indicative of the winner at this tournament than Tour average.', 'With many bunkers and firm, dry areas around the greens, missing the putting surface can be consequential.', 'Total green in regulation percentage over past 24 rounds:', 'Scrambling around TPC Scottsdale is tough. The rough around the green is penal and the bunkers are difficult. Players will need to make some tricky up-and-downs in order to be successful this week.', 'Scrambling percentage on difficult scrambling courses over past 36 rounds:', 'New this year, I am going to generate a “mini model” of the best players at each of the comparable courses. For TPC Scottsdale, I am using TPC Summerlin, Pete Dye Stadium Course, Summit Club, TPC Twin Cities, TPC Sawgrass, Nicklaus Tournament Course, Club de Golf Chapultepec, Concession and Shadow Creek.', 'Below, I have reported overall model rankings using a combination of the five key statistical categories previously discussed.', 'These rankings are strokes-gained approach (22%), strokes-gained off the tee on driver-heavy courses (14%) strokes-gained putting on fast greens (14%), greens-in-regulation percentage (12%), scrambling on difficult scrambling courses (12%), strokes-gained total in the desert (14%) and comparable course rankings (14%).', ""Last week's picks results for the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am:"", 'Justin Thomas (17-1): T48\nPatrick Cantlay (22-1): T32\nJason Day (45-1): T13\nDenny McCarthy (100-1): T58', 'Since this market has been up for quite a while, my card begins with a Justin Thomas 25-1 which is no longer available. He was shaky last week, and while I’m happy with the bet I have, I am unsure if there is any value at his current price, which is all the way down to 11-1 in most spots.', 'Waste Management Phoenix Open future:\n\nJT 25-1 (DK)\n\nImagine this will be great value when the time comes. Love JT to win early and often and the current odds include a handful of players who definitely won’t be playing.', 'Sam Burns is the type of player who can go low and use his driver to pick apart a golf course. Over his past 36 qualifying rounds, he ranks fifth in strokes-gained off the tee on “driver heavy” courses. He also ranks fourth in strokes-gained total in the desert.', 'Burns has been getting better and better at TPC Scottsdale. After missing the cut in two of his first three starts at the course, the 28-year-old has finishes of T6 in 2023 and T3 in 2024. ', 'Last week, Burns had a solid performance at Pebble Beach, finishing T22. However, I feel as though TPC Scottsdale is a much better fit for Burns’s skill set. In addition to the driving prowess, Burns ranks eighth in strokes-gained putting on fast greens. He’s the type of player who will thrive off playing in front of the excitable crowd this week. ', ""Sam Burns has already won five times on the PGA Tour but it's now been since May 2022 since the LSU product has won a stroke-play event on Tour. That can change this week with a strong performance at TPC Scottsdale. "", 'Sahith Theegala is a player who thrives on the West Coast and playing in the desert. He ranks ninth in the field in strokes-gained total in the desert and has already won on the PGA Tour out west. ', 'It’s been a sluggish start to 2025 for the former Nicklaus Award winner, but a trip to what has been one of his favorite courses throughout the early part of his career should get him back on track. In his three trips to TPC Scottsdale, Sahith has finished in the top five in two of them, including a T3 in his debut start in 2022. ', 'Theegala can get somewhat loose off the tee, which won’t be as debilitating this week as it has been in other events this season. He hits it fairly long and is excellent both around and on the greens, and is the type of player who can make the putts if going low is a requirement. ', 'This feels like a very fair price for Theegala this week at TPC Scottsdale.', 'Byeong Hun An played a phenomenal round of golf on Sunday at Pebble Beach. The South Korean shot 66, which was one of the best rounds of the day. ', 'An has played the WM Phoenix Open quite frequently, posting four consecutive top-25 finishes in his first four starts, with his best finish coming in the form of a sixth-place finish in 2017. ', 'An’s driver is a weapon. He is long off the tee and occasionally can hit it straight, which should help immensely at TPC Scottsdale. He is also one of the most underrated around-the-green players on Tour and is a strong bunker player.', 'Over his past 36 rounds, An ranks fifth in the field in strokes-gained off the tee on driver-heavy golf courses. He also ranks 16th in scrambling on tough scrambling courses. If he can get the putter to cooperate, the 33-year-old can contend for his first PGA Tour victory.', 'At first glance, it doesn’t appear Kurt Kitayama is in great form, but a deeper dive gives some reason for optimism. ', 'Despite missing the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open, Kitayama gained 0.77 strokes on approach and 1.11 strokes off the tee in his round at the Torrey Pines South Course. The 32-year-old was great in the fall and perhaps just needed a few starts to knock the rust off for 2025.', 'Kitayama has been great at TPC Scottsdale, finishing T23 and T8 in his two starts in 2023 and 2024. While not the best putter, Kurt has gained strokes putting on the field in a significant way in both of his starts in the event. ', 'Kitayama is an extremely strong driver of the golf ball, and will benefit from being able to use the driver often at the course. In his past 36 rounds, Kurt ranks 8th in the field in strokes-gained off the tee on driver heavy courses. ', 'Born in Chico, Calif., Kitayama is comfortable out west and has already proven he can win on the PGA Tour.', 'Rickie Fowler has been quietly playing some solid golf since the fall. The 36-year-old was fourth at the Zozo Championship back in October after notching back-to-back top 25 finishes at the Sanderson Farms Championship and the Shriners. He kicked off 2025 with a T21 finish at the American Express. Last week, Fowler didn’t finish as well as he’d have liked, but showed flashes of brilliance with his irons throughout the week. ', 'The WM Phoenix Open is the tournament that has arguably been the most consistent for Fowler. He has six top 15 finishes at the event including a win in 2019 as well as runner-ups in 2010 and 2016. ', 'The PGA Tour would love a Fowler win, and I can’t resist backing him at this long of a price at one of his favorite Tour stops. ', 'Beau Hossler finished strong last week at Pebble Beach, shooting a round of 68 on Sunday. He didn’t finish well on the week but I’m willing to give him a pass based on weather factors that will not be in play at TPC Scottsdale. Prior to Pebble, Hossler finished T12 at the American Express and T15 at the Farmers Insurance Open. ', 'Hossler has been hitting the ball extremely well off the tee this season by his standards. He gained 4.84 strokes off the tee at the American Express and 1.80 strokes off the tee at Torrey Pines South. The success with the driver will serve him well at TPC Scottsdale.', 'Hossler has done fairly well at the WM Phoenix Open throughout his career. He finished T14 in 2023 and T17 in 2018 but has otherwise been up and down. He grew up in California and has played well on the West Coast, and is the type of player who can get into contention with a hot putter. ', 'In the fall, Hossler got into a playoff at the Sanderson Farms Championship, hopefully reigniting some confidence. The now 29-year-old was once highly regarded amateur who I still believe has what it takes to be a PGA Tour winner.

Scottie Scheffler headlines the 2025 WM Phoenix Open field, with the world No. 1 looking to win this event for the third time in the last four years. Scheffler is listed as the 3-1 betting favorite in the latest 2025 WM Phoenix Open odds. He is followed by Justin Thomas (11-1), Hideki Matsuyama (16-1), Sungjae Im (20-1) and Sam Burns (28-1). The total 2025 WM Phoenix Open purse is $9.2 million, with the winner taking home $1.656 million and 500 FedEx Cup points. ', 'Before locking in your 2025 WM Phoenix Open One and Done picks, you need to see what SportsLine DFS pro and PGA expert Mike McClure has to say. ', ""The One and Done format is growing in popularity. It has several noticeable similarities to NFL Survivor pools, with the main difference being entries are not eliminated with a bad week. Players pick one golfer per week and earn points based on their selected golfer's prize money for that tournament. Golfers can only be used once per season, and the point format makes nailing majors and big money tournaments critical."", ""McClure is a DFS legend with over $2 million in career winnings, and he's been RED HOT on his PGA picks dating back to the PGA Tour restart in June of 2020. McClure uses his proprietary simulation model to analyze the field and crush his golf picks. In fact, the model is up more than $9,500 on its best bets since June 2020, nailing tournament after tournament."", ""This same model has also nailed a WHOPPING 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters, its third Masters in a row, and last year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open! Anyone who has followed it could have seen MASSIVE returns! "", ""McClure has been nailing his One and Done picks for the last two years, correctly calling Nick Taylor's epic win at the RBC Canadian Open, as well as Scottie Scheffler's and Jon Rahm's victories as the Masters. "", 'Now, McClure has set his sights on the 2025 WM Phoenix Open and just revealed his optimal One and Done picks. They are a must-see for any player looking for an edge in their One and Done pool.', ""We can tell you that one of McClure's top One and Done picks for the WM Phoenix Open is Hideki Matsuyama. The 32-year-old PGA Tour veteran is one of the most talented golfers in the world when healthy, and has 11 career PGA Tour victories on his resume. Matsuyama has already won once in 2025 (at The Sentry), and finished T16 at the Sony Open in Hawaii."", ""McClure is also targeting another golfer in his PGA One and Done picks who is listed as an 60-1 longshot in the latest WM Phoenix Open odds.

FanDuel PGA DFS Picks: WM Phoenix Open Cash and GPP Strategy,https://www.rotowire.com/golf/article/fanduel-pga-dfs-picks-wm-phoenix-open-cash-and-gpp-strategy-89895,"['This article is part of our FanDuel PGA DFS Picks series.', 'Course: TPC Scottsdale Stadium Course (7,261 yards, par 71)\nPurse: $9,200,000\nWinner: $1,656,000 and 500 FedExCup points', ""The WM Phoenix Open is the one event on the schedule that is unlike any other. It is annually the most attended tournament of the year and players have to embrace the chaos to find success. There is no bigger example of stadium golf than the par-3 16th hole at TPC Scottsdale. What is a relatively straightforward par-3 is anything but in a completely enclosed stadium with thousands of rowdy fans waiting to go nuts for a good shot or let you know about it if you hit a bad one. That being said, the tournament organizers said they are taking extra measures to make sure things are reined in after several PGA Tour players admitted the fan behavior had crossed a line in recent years. It all came to a breaking point last year on Saturday, by far the most attended day of the tournament, when the tournament had to close the gates to ticket-holders and cut off alcohol sales because of overcrowding and safety concerns. We'll see how the changes the tournament officials make affect things, but it should still be an incredible atmosphere. "", '', '', 'While yes the WM Phoenix Open is sitting right in the middle of two Signature Events, we still have a pretty strong field with a number of big names. Leading the way of course is the top ranked player in Scottie Scheffler, who is coming off a solid T9 finish in his return from a hand injury that took place on Christmas. Scheffler won the Phoenix Open in 2022 and 2023 before finishing T3 in his bid for the three-peat last year. Another two-time winner of this event is Hideki Matsuyama, who already has a win under his belt in 2025 back at The Sentry. Matsuyama is second in the FedExCup standings to Sepp Straka, who will also play this week following a failed attempt to convert the 54-hole lead at Pebble Beach in his bid to win in back-to-back starts. Justin Thomas, Sungjae Im and Tom Kim are three other top-25 ranked players looking to end long winless droughts at TPC Scottsdale. Nick Taylor won this event in a playoff over Charley Hoffman last year after he finished solo second in 2023. ', 'This will be the last event to qualify for the Genesis Invitational via the Aon Swing 5, which is comprised of the top FedExCup point earners from the Sony Open, The American Express, the Farmers Insurance Open and the WM Phoenix Open. Sam Stevens and J.J. Spaun are in a pretty comfortable spot, but Andrew Novak, Justin Lower and Lee Hodges are hoping to retain those positions. Charley Hoffman, Kris Ventura, Adam Schenk and Alex Smalley are all right in the mix, but anything can happen with a strong showing at TPC Scottsdale. The Aon Next 10 is already locked in for the Genesis Invitational from places 51-60 in the FedExCup Fall. One other player to watch is Luke Clanton, who was given a sponsors invitation this week. The Florida State junior is creeping up on 26 weeks as the No. 1 ranked amateur, which will give him another PGA Tour University Accelerated point and bring his total to 19. Just a made cut at the Phoenix Open very well could give him the 20 points he needs to earn a PGA Tour card that he could take up after the college golf season ends this year. ', ""Last year's WM Phoenix Open featured plenty of weather early in the event, which really softened the golf course up. This year the weather will be beautiful with no expected precipitation and temperatures that will reach into the mid-70s. Apart from some chilly mornings as is typical in the desert, players will not have any excuses this week. The breezes are also expected to be pretty mild. Nick Taylor and Charley Hoffman's 21-under-par 263 total last year was the lowest score at this event since Phil Mickelson posted 28-under 256 back in 2013, which tied Mark Calcavecchia for the lowest ever at the Phoenix Open (2001). Both Mickelson and Calcavecchia had those record scores in their third and final victory at this event. Maybe Scheffler or Matsuyama can join those two along with Arnold Palmer and Gene Littler as three-time winners of this tournament in historic fashion. It's always a nail-biting finish in this event, as a playoff has been required to decide things six of the last nine years. I wouldn't be surprised to see golf shots being played again after the big game kicks off in New Orleans. "", '2024 - Nick Taylor (-21)\n2023 - Scottie Scheffler (-19)\n2022 - Scottie Scheffler (-16)\n2021 - Brooks Koepka (-19)\n2020 - Webb Simpson (-17)\n2019 - Rickie Fowler (-17)\n2018 - Gary Woodland (-18)\n2017 - Hideki Matsuyama (-17)\n2016 - Hideki Matsuyama (-14)\n2015 - Brooks Koepka (-15)', ""TPC Scottsdale has typically awarded the more aggressive players. It's a course where we will see a lot of drivers, and due to the elevation we get a lot of really long drives. There also really isn't much rough out there to speak of, so as long as you are keeping it somewhat in play and avoiding the desert areas, you are going to be just fine. From there it is your typical shootout mindset of hitting it close and sinking putts. The guys that did that best last season ended up in the playoff. Nick Taylor ranked first in SG: Putting and T2 in GIR's, while Charley Hoffman was second in SG: Putting and second in SG: Approach. Not far behind in T3 was Sam Burns who led the field in SG: Off-the-Tee and Scottie Scheffler who led the field by a mile in SG: Approach. These greens are the same surfaces that the players faced at The American Express a few weeks ago, so look for those who putted well there to do the same in Scottsdale. Lastly, we also need to look at overall birdie average as well as par 4 scoring. There's a good chance if a player ranks highly in approach and/or putting they probably also make a lot of birdies. While there are three gettable par-5s, it really seems like the players who are able to consistently make birdies on the average-to-long par-4s are the ones around Sunday afternoon in this event. "", 'The Chalk', 'Scottie Scheffler ($13,400)', ""I was a little worried about Scheffler's long game given the fact that he was barely a week in to being cleared for full swings before the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. While he didn't have his best driving week, Scheffler was clinical with the irons leading the field in SG: Approach once again. He also gained nearly two strokes for the week on the greens. Scheffler has gone T7-1st-1st-T3 the last four years in Scottsdale and is well worth the massive price tag. "", 'Justin Thomas ($12,100)', ""If it's not going to be Scheffler, Thomas should be your pivot. He has gained strokes on approach in his last nine starts and has an awesome record at TPC Scottsdale. While Thomas has never won here, he has not finished worse than T17 in his last seven starts, including a trio of top-five finishes. Thomas also had one of his best putting performances in the last few years at The AmEx on his way to a second place finish on what are very similar surfaces to this course. "", 'Sepp Straka ($10,900)', ""Straka has been an approach demon of late. He has gained at least 1.05 strokes on approach per round over his last seven starts. Straka has also gained strokes off the tee in all of those same events. The Austrian putted extremely well on these same type of greens in Palm Springs en route to a victory which was his fourth top-15 in his last five starts. Straka doesn't have a great history in Scottsdale, but he is playing the best golf of his career. "", 'The Middle Tier', 'Nick Taylor ($9,600)', 'Taylor has historically been a pretty inconsistent ball striker throughout his career, but he is in the mix of the best approach play stretch in his life. The Canadian has gained over 15 strokes on approach over his last 10 measured rounds. Taylor also loves putting on these style greens ranking first in SG: Putting at TPC Scottsdale last year and fourth in 2023. He was also second in SG: Putting at PGA West a few weeks ago. ', 'Min Woo Lee ($9,500)', 'Lee is a guy who should absolutely feed off these crowds and his aggressive style of play could lead to a lot of birdies. The Aussie is one of the best drivers on Tour, as he ranked fifth in SG: Off-the-Tee last season. Lee has also really improved his iron play and has now gained strokes on approach in six of his last seven tournaments that had strokes gained data. He played a lot around the world in the fall and has finished T32 or better in all nine starts since the TOUR Championship.', 'Sam Stevens ($9,100)', 'Stevens backed up his runner-up at Torrey Pines with a solid T17 finish at Pebble Beach. It was the third straight event in which he has gained strokes on the greens and the sixth straight time he gained strokes on approach. Stevens has not missed a cut over his last 11 starts and is one of the longest hitters in the field. He went T28 in his TPC Scottsdale debut a year ago. ', 'The Long Shots', 'Lee Hodges ($8,700)', 'The end result was a T33 at Pebble Beach for Hodges, but he was hovering right around the top-10 most of the week before he dumped two in the water and made a 9 on the par-5 18th on Sunday. Hodges has been playing really good golf with five finishes of T16 or better over his previous seven starts. The 29-year-old has gained strokes on approach in eight of his last nine starts, and currently ranks 10th in SG: Putting this season. ', 'Nicolai Hojgaard ($8,600)', ""At this time last year everyone thought the same thing about Nicolai Hojgaard that they now do about Rasmus, who checks in at $10,500. Nicolai's rookie year on the PGA Tour was not easy, but he's got that same kind of talent his brother is showing now. This is a great opportunity to buy low as he makes his season debut. Hojgaard is a really strong ball striker who has gained strokes on the greens in four of his last six starts. He has five top-25 finishes over that stretch."", 'Mac Meissner ($8,400)', ""Meissner is one of the best iron players in this price range. This season he already ranks 15th in SG: Approach after he was top-35 in SG: Approach, GIR percentage and proximity last season. While Meissner hasn't had a high-end finish in awhile, he's still been pretty reliable making the cut in 11-of-12 starts. The 25-year-old has an underrated short game and when he putts well he finishes top-20. "", 'Based on a Standard $60K Salary Cap', ""I'm a big fan of the $9K and $8K ranges, as both of them are very deep with a lot of potential options to fit this course well. I do not think the $7K range is good at all, so I will likely lean towards a more balanced build with just one $11K+ player. TPC Scottsdale is typically one of the stickiest in terms of course history, so that's a good spot to lean on. That being said, most of the players who put up consistent results here are quality ball strikers. After not having to sweat the cut last week, it's going to take two good scores to make the weekend in Scottsdale given the expected good conditions.

This year's WM Phoenix Open doesn't enjoy signature status on the 2025 PGA Tour schedule, but the field is still expected to be of high quality. Fifteen of the top 30 players in the Official World Golf Ranking have committed to tee it up this week, including world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Scheffler is already a 13-time PGA Tour winner and two-time major champion and he's the +300 favorite in the 2025 WM Phoenix Open odds, followed by Justin Thomas (+1100) and Hideki Matsuyama (+1600). "", 'However, there are also dozens of props available on finishing position for just about every player in the 2025 WM Phoenix Open field and that will give you ample opportunity to put together a massive PGA Tour parlay. Before making your 2025 WM Phoenix Open picks and parlays, you need to see this PGA Tour parlay from SportsLine golf expert Eric Cohen that pays out a staggering $1.8 million on a $10 bet. ', 'Cohen is an avid golf bettor who correctly predicted the pre-tournament outright winner in seven tournaments over the last two seasons. He correctly identified Aaron Rai at +3300 odds in the 2024 Wyndham Championship, as well as Davis Thompson (2024 John Deere Classic, +2200), Bryson DeChambeau (2024 U.S. Open, +2000), Scottie Scheffler (2024 Players Championship, +550), Rickie Fowler (2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic, +1400), Brooks Koepka (2023 PGA Championship, +2000), and Chris Kirk (2023 Honda Classic, +3500). Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.', 'Now that the Cohen has had a chance to break down the latest PGA Tour odds for the WM Phoenix Open 2025, he has locked in his betting picks to form a 7-leg golf parlay that pays out nearly $1.8 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.', ""For the WM Phoenix Open 2025, one of the picks featured in Cohen's 7-leg PGA Tour parlay is Tom Kim to finish top 10 for a +300 payout. The 22-year-old is already a three-time PGA Tour winner with 12 wins worldwide. He's currently ranked 23rd in the OWGR and he's coming off a T-7 finish at Pebble Beach. It was his third top-10 finish in his last six worldwide starts."", '""Maybe his TGL heroics from last Monday will carry over for another week. The South Korean phenom tied for 7th at Pebble Beach last weekend, gaining strokes in all major categories. He gained more than five shots with his irons last year en route to a T-17, but I think a jump to the top-10 seems more than reasonable in 2025,"" Cohen told SportsLine. See the rest of the picks in Cohen\'s PGA Tour parlay here.', 'Cohen has also picked his outright winner and has made six other PGA Tour prop picks for his WM Phoenix Open parlay that pays nearly $1.8 million on just a $10 bet. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.', ""So who wins the 2025 WM Phoenix Open, and what combination of PGA Tour props could unlock a $1.8M payday on just a $10 bet? Visit SportsLine now to get Eric Cohen's weekly $1 million PGA Tour parlay and picks for the WM Phoenix Open 2025, all from the golf expert who has called seven outright winners since 2023, and find out."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The din extends through the par-4 17th and 18th holes, but those two present more like white noise against the brilliant green of the Bermudagrass and often cloudless, azure sky. The bottom line is, it’s a three-hole stretch unlike any other all season. No, it’s not for everybody, but the field of 132 is robust year after year, so those who are here have chosen to be. If you’re concerned about any of it as a distraction, remember that they are not when they commit.', 'This tournament is the first of the second half of Segment 1 of PGA TOUR Fantasy Golf presented by PGA TOUR Superstore. Although two Signature Events remain – The Genesis Invitational and the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard – this is still a smart time to rely on your favorites. Explanations follow below.', 'Adding to the calculus of your roster management for the remainder of Segment 1 is the temporary relocation of The Genesis Invitational to Torrey Pines Golf Course.

This means that you burned your first at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and you’re planning on exhausting the other two at the Signature Events. (He’s the defending champion at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.) Or, gasp, you’re not planning to use all three. If either is your strategy, it’s as bold (and unwise) as it gets. If you have only two remaining, burn them now and at Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge.', '', '', '', ""Scottie Scheffler's top shots from WM Phoenix Open wins"", 'With two more Signature Events in Segment 1, there’s reason to consider holstering the elite for them and the beefier FedExCup bonus points they will yield.

There aren’t many stages on which he can’t shine, but we’ve yet to be wowed by the Canadian at TPC Scottsdale. Since debuting in 2020, he’s perfect in five trips but has only one top 25 (T17, 2021).

So you should, too.', 'The WM Phoenix Open is the true clash of current form and course form, perhaps more than any other PGA TOUR venue, and you need to be aware of the colliding trends before you place any bets for TPC Scottsdale.', 'The last 14 winners of the WM Phoenix Open all entered the event having at least one top 10 in their previous five TOUR starts. Showing some current form is imperative when entering the coliseum amongst the throngs of thousands of fans.', 'But that’s not all. The last nine straight winners not only had the current form but also a previous top 10 result (top seven, actually) at the WM Phoenix Open before taking home the trophy.', 'So if the double trend is to continue there are only 18 players in the field at TPC Scottsdale that can win this week – and don’t think oddsmakers are unaware. The top five on the FanDuel Sportsbook odds board are part of this trending crew. Honestly, I’m also thinking your winner comes from this quintet:', 'Scottie Scheffler +280 – The odds are eye-popping, but also justified.

Has never missed the cut at TPC Scottsdale (he withdrew in 2018 after the first round), and of course recently won at The Sentry.', 'Sungjae Im +2200 – Third at The Sentry and T4 at the Farmers Insurance Open shows the two-time TOUR winner has his form in a decent spot. When you add two previous WM Phoenix Open top 10s you get a guy primed to pounce.', 'Sam Burns +2500 – While there is plenty of hype around Scheffler, his good friend Burns is quietly trending to something big.

He showed such ruthless tenacity down the stretch to win that I was ready to anoint him a contender at THE PLAYERS Championship off the back of the victory.

His climb back is in full swing now and he has three previous top 10s in Phoenix. Was a runner-up on TOUR five starts ago.', ""Andrew Novak +9000 Last week's T13 at Pebble Beach was preceded by a third-place finish at Torrey Pines, and many may have forgotten that this man opened the WM Phoenix Open 65-65 to be T2 at the halfway point before ultimately finishing T8."", 'If you must know, the others who qualify on the double trend of course form and recent performance – you can also consider Rickie Fowler, Billy Horschel, Kurt Kitayama, K.H.
