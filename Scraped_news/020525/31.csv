Lo and behold, it did — Apple told me they generally let anyone take out AppleCare+ for their device within a year of purchase, even if it fell outside the normal two-month window. In fact, the employee I spoke to said they wouldn’t be surprised if Apple one day expanded AppleCare+ availability to every Apple device owner, regardless of how long they’d had their product, as long as it was in good condition. The idea was that AppleCare+ makes the company a lot of money, so expanding it is a logical next step.', 'Once the employee had inspected my device, the AppleCare+ option reappeared in my Settings app, and I hastily purchased the pre-paid two-year coverage option. That was just this week — fortuitous timing given Gurman’s latest news.', 'How does that relate to Gurman’s claim about the changing AppleCare+ landscape? Well, I was only able to get AppleCare+ coverage this late because I had my Watch physically inspected by Apple. But if things change and you can only buy longer AppleCare+ plans online and not in Apple Stores or on your device, how will you be able to get the discounted plan and convince Apple that your device is still roadworthy if it falls outside the two-month window?', 'In other words, you’ll probably be fine as long as you purchase a multi-year AppleCare+ plan within the initial two-month window, as the online option (which doesn’t require device inspection by Apple) will remain.

In the US, most of us are used to paying a monthly premium for health insurance, so paying monthly (or annually) for the health of our hardware sort of makes sense, too. In return, we're covered when disaster strikes—usually."", ""On the other hand, it seems like an easy way for Apple to quietly siphon money while we look the other way. I can't be the only one who loses track of mounting subscriptions. I would venture to guess that most customers who buy two years of AppleCare+ up front don't re-up at the end of their term. Conversely, an AppleCare+ subscriber may hold on to that monthly plan for a long time, either out of comfort or forgetfulness."", ""At the end of the day, AppleCare coverage is a decent product that will suit some people better than others. Whether it's a one-time purchase (OTP) or a subscription, it's best to do some light risk analysis to decide whether you even need AppleCare+ at all.
