Participants completed questionnaires assessing fatigue, dyspnea, and physical activity and underwent pulmonary function tests.', 'Children with postacute COVID-19 syndrome reported significantly greater fatigue (parent-rated scores: mean 67.9 vs. 82.4, p\u2009<\u20090.001; child-rated scores: 73.7 vs. 83.0, p\u2009<\u20090.001), increased dyspnea (mMRC grades 3–4: 10.9% vs. 4.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.001), and lower physical activity (median 787.8 vs. 1658.5 MET*min/week, p\u2009<\u20090.001) than controls. They also had a higher prevalence of mixed (8.1% vs. 1.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.029) and restrictive lung disease (29.7% vs. 10.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Older age and COVID-19 were identified as risk factors for fatigue and reduced activity. Fatigue correlated with reduced physical activity but not with pulmonary function.', 'Children and adolescents with postacute COVID-19 syndrome, particularly older individuals, experience greater fatigue and reduced physical activity than controls. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying postacute COVID-19 symptoms and their associations with physiological assessments.', 'This prospective, age- and sex-matched cohort study revealed that children and adolescents with postacute COVID-19 syndrome perceived higher fatigue levels, had higher dyspnea scores, had a greater prevalence of mixed lung and restrictive lung disease, and exhibited less physical activity than their control counterparts.', 'Fatigue correlated with reduced physical activity but was not consistently correlated with pulmonary function test results.', 'This study highlights the importance of quantifying postacute COVID-19 symptoms and exploring the associations between individual symptoms and the impact of coronavirus infection on various systems, including the neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and immune systems.', 'This is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution', '', 'Subscribe to this journal', 'Receive 14 print issues and online access', '$259.00 per year', 'only $18.50 per issue', 'Buy this article', 'Prices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout', 'The data supporting this study’s findings are available in the supplementary file (PostAcuteCOVID data.cvs).', 'Wilde, H. et al.

Typically, when scientists undertake comparative testing, they compare a disease group with a ‘control’ group (i.e. people who aren’t sick). But inflammation is seen in many different situations, including in COVID-19 infection.', 'To be sure the molecular signature they found is specific to Long COVID, they compared the inflammatory markers in children with Long COVID against those with acute COVID-19, a group with other inflammatory complications, and a healthy control group.', 'They studied 112 children—34 children with Long COVID, 32 with active infections, 27 with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and 19 healthy controls.', 'All children in the Long COVID group had symptoms persisting for at least eight weeks after initial infection, with impacts significant enough to disrupt daily activities.', 'The team found that eight specific inflammatory proteins were consistently elevated in children with Long COVID, including CXCL11, CXCL1, and CXCL8, which play crucial roles in inflammation and blood vessel formation.', 'This protein signature mirrors patterns previously seen in adult Long COVID patients, suggesting similar underlying disease mechanisms across ages.', 'The team created an AI model that was able to identify Long COVID with 93% accuracy. This could lead to the development of routine blood tests for diagnosing the condition in children.', 'The discovery of specific biological markers also gives researchers clues that could help develop targeted therapies for the condition.', 'They also found that kids with Long COVID had high levels of a protein called FGF21, which is involved in energy metabolism and muscle function. This aligns with studies in adults with Long COVID demonstrating that fatigue is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'The research team has already begun collecting follow-up samples to track how these blood markers might change as children recover, which could offer insights into the condition’s duration.', 'Subscribe to Global Health Notes, our weekly LinkedIn newsletter, to get the latest VaccinesWork news and features.', 'Subscribe', '', '', '', 'By clicking ""Accept All"", you consent to the use of these additional cookies.
