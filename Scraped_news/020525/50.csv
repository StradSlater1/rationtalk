No matter how many scenarios Nico planned in his head, AI could not have accurately predicted the outrage that dealing Luka to the Lakers would generate.', 'The Mavericks could win the NBA title this season, and the parade will be muted because it will not include Luka.

It’s easy to see why the Lakers seemingly shattered their present for a brighter future with Dončić at the heart.', 'With their best player both on offense and defense now in Dallas, the Lakers, who currently sit in fifth place in the Western Conference, will have to completely rethink their philosophy on the fly with Dončić and James now on the court together. But there’s just one problem–Dončić hasn’t played a game since Christmas Day and has missed the last six weeks with a lingering calf strain–unfortunately, not even Dončić himself knows when he will be able to return to the court wearing his new Lakers uniform. ', 'Prior to the announcement of the trade, reports indicated that Dončić was close to returning. On Tuesday morning, during Dončić’s introductory press conference,  Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka addressed the elephant in the room.', '“We’re going to take it one day at a time just to make sure that the calf injury is in a good and safe place,” Pelinka said. “I would truly say at this point that he’s day to day. We’re going to take it one step at a time, but if (everything) goes well and Luca feels good and confident, he’ll be in a game soon.”', ""Get today's sports news out of Los Angeles. Here's the latest on the Dodgers, Lakers, Angels, Kings, Galaxy, LAFC, USC, UCLA and more LA teams."", 'That “soon” carries a tantalizing weight. Dončić is set to participate in 5-on-5 drills with the Lakers on Wednesday at practice. If that goes well, the team will work alongside his personal training staff to chart a return-to-play plan. ', 'Given the Lakers upcoming schedule, here are a few possible options on when Dončić could make his debut with the purple and gold:', 'Thursday, February 6 vs. Golden State Warriors', 'If all goes well during the 5-on-5 drills on Wednesday, it’s possible Dončić could make his debut the following night against Steph Curry and the Warriors on TNT. However, this return would likely be well ahead of most people’s expected timeline and falls on the heels of the NBA trade deadline. ', 'Saturday, February 8 vs. Indiana Pacers', 'This game carries a lot of weight. There were reports that Dončić was targeting a return date of the 8th when he was still with the Dallas Mavericks, and could make that same-day return with his new team, the Lakers against Tyrese Haliburton and the Pacers. This one could definitely happen, especially on a Saturday afternoon matchup at Crypto.com arena. ', 'Monday, February 10 or Wednesday, February 12 against the Utah Jazz', 'If the Lakers opt for a softer runway for their newest superstar’s takeoff in Tinseltown, their home-and-away back-to-back games against the Utah Jazz might be the perfect spot. The Jazz are one of the worst teams in the NBA and would provide Luka with an opportunity to slowly acclimate with his new teammates without sacrificing a spot in the standings. Either one of these games makes the most sense. ', 'Wednesday, February 19 vs. Charlotte Hornets', 'Dončić was expected to return before the NBA All-Star break, but if he’s still not ready by the back-to-back games with the Jazz, then it might make the most sense for the Lakers to give him an extra few days of rest during the February 14-18 All-Star break and allow Dončić to make his debut with the purple and gold in the team’s first game back from the break at Crypto.com arena against the Hornets. ', 'For Dončić, his calf has been nagging at him for quite some time, and this time around, patience has been the key. ', '“For the first time, I took my time (to) get it to heal 100%,” Doncic said of his return. “Other times, I think I just wanted to go back to the court playing basketball, and I really (wouldn’t) be healthy 100%. This time I just took my time, which was the normal amount of time to get back to 100%.”', 'What Will the Lakers Look Like With Dončič on the court?', 'A pairing of Dončić and LeBron James is the kind of basketball dream that belongs in video games, not real life. The pick-and-roll possibilities alone are endless. ', 'Lakers’ head coach, J.J. Redick, Dončić’s former teammate, is likely already diagramming ways to weaponize two of the most cerebral offensive minds in the game.', 'The backcourt will almost certainly feature Dončić alongside Austin Reaves, with the two sharing ball-handling duties. Since trading D’Angelo Russell in December, the Lakers have largely operated without a traditional point guard, relying on James and Reaves to initiate offense. That will change now, as Dončić thrives with the ball in his hands.', 'Contrary to some speculation, this is not a problem for James. In fact, it’s a relief. The 40-year-old legend has long expressed a desire to play off-ball more, allowing him to conserve energy and pick his spots. Dončić’s arrival provides that opportunity, and if the two can develop chemistry quickly, the Lakers’ offense could become a nightmare for opposing defenses.', 'On the defensive side of the ball, however, things get tricky. The Lakers’ defense took a significant hit when they traded Davis to acquire Dončić. Without their anchor in the paint, they’ll need to get creative to avoid becoming a team that simply tries to outscore opponents every night.', 'With less than 48 hours before the NBA trade deadline, Pelinka is still trying to acquire a defensive-minded center that is also a lob-threat to solidify his new roster. ', '“We know we have a need for a big,” said Pelinka in the press conference. “Right now, leading into the last two or three days of the trade deadline it’s very dry. There’s just not a lot available. I would say, in terms of a big move for that position, it’s probably more realistic that would be something that comes in the offseason. But we’ll accomplish that task that’s before us. We’ll find a way.”', 'The Lakers don’t have much time to figure it out. The NBA trade deadline closes at noon pacific time on Thursday, February 6th, and by that time the Lakers will have just 34 games remaining in the season. ', 'If they are able to acquire a center by then, and Dončić returns to the court soon, then the fully integrated Lakers could be a real threat–albeit a flawed one–in the playoffs. ', 'For now, Lakers fans will have to wait just a little longer to see how this roster shapes out and to see L.A.’s newest superstar don the purple and gold, thereby signalling the beginning of a new era in Lakers history.

Not knowing the whys and wherefores of the deal leaves me blissfully ignorant as to the actual reasons for the deal, so instead of trying to understand why the Mavericks and Lakers did what they did, instead I’ll shift my focus to what would happen if the Phillies did this.', 'The line that is gaining the most traction in trying to come up with an explanation for the deal was uttered by the Dallas general manager:', '“I believe that defense wins championships,” Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN’s Tim MacMahon, explaining his motivation to deal Doncic for Davis...”We’re built to win now and in the future.”', 'Alright then, now we have a framework. What if the Phillies were to move a franchise altering player that would improve their defense? Framing it in a more baseball-centric manner, we’d have to assume that the trade would see the team acquiring a pitcher to satisfy those that believe pitching is what wins baseball championships.', 'The Phillies don’t possess someone like Doncic - young(ish), superstar, MVP vote getter - but there are ways to make this idea work.', 'Harper has been the cornerstone of this entire era of Phillies baseball. He’s the most important player to the franchise right now, easily clearing several others. One could make the argument that you could substitute Zack Wheeler in this deal and still have equal value and that might be true. However, one thing that Harper does better than Wheeler is maintain a higher Q rating than the Phillies’ Ace. How many Wheeler shirseys do you see what you walk on the Citizens Bank Park concourse? Maybe that’s an indictment on the fans, that Wheeler should be more popular than he already is, but you cannot argue that Harper is a more popular player than Wheeler.', 'Framber Valdez is one of those guys that should be mentioned among the top pitchers in the game more often than he actually is. Over the past three seasons, Valdez is sixth in the game in pitching fWAR (12.4), placing him among the game’s best pitchers on the mound. This offseason, he was the subject of trade rumors once the Astros decided on trying to avoid paying more money in luxury taxes, but ultimately, as of this writing, he remains atop Houston’s rotation.', 'Swapping Harper for Valdez would give the Phillies easily - EASILY - the best rotation in the game. Not only is Valdez very, very good at what he does, he’s durable as well, making 90 starts in those aforementioned three seasons. If pitching and defense really were what won championships, the quartet of Wheeler-Valdez-Aaron Nola-Cristopher Sanchez would be borderline unfair. Teams would fear that rotation.', 'And still the Phillies would feel vulnerable.', 'Try to imagine the team’s offense without Harper. While there are still several big names that could hoist the offense on their shoulders, there would be left the feeling that something more is needed. Another All-Star being a fit for the middle of the lineup.', 'Someone like Bryce Harper.', 'This deal would never be done, of course, but that’s why the NBA is different from MLB. Teams apparently have no qualms trading stars in the middle of the season and altering not just the season at hand, but the future of the franchise at large.', 'Owners these days are being criticized for a lot of things, most of them justifiable. The top thing that many of them are being accused of is penny pinching, holding tight the purse strings of the franchise. Aside from the Dodgers and Mets these days, it feels like the one thing that most owners are more interested in is winning the title of “best team that stayed under the luxury tax” as opposed to winning the Commissioner’s Trophy.', 'John Middleton, for all his faults, has not been shy about spending money.

We’ve heard about the changes made to the Clearwater complex, the building and completion of the complex in the Dominican Republic and how they have changed their approach to bringing up a farm system (even if the results have left much to be desired). You can reasonably say that Middleton is one of the top owners in the game when it comes to letting his front office do what they’re paid to do, using his financial muscle when it is wise to do so and generally staying out of the way.', 'Finding a trade for Middleton is tough since owners seem to fall into two categories - those that will spend and leap over the luxury tax thresholds and those that won’t. The Mariners feel like the best of both worlds. They have had farm systems that have borne fruit in recent seasons, giving the rotation the depth and star power that is the envy of the game, producing superstars in the likes of Julio Rodriguez and ancillary pieces that keep them on the fringes of playoff contention. Yet when it is most necessary, the reins are tightened a bit and spending is curbed. Seattle, according to Roster Resource, has the plan of going into the season with Dylan Moore, JP Crawford and Jorge Polanco as their second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, a trio that projects to have a wRC+ that nearly just about average. On paper, their lineup is pleading for names like Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso, yet nowhere is a rumor to be found that they are willing to pony up for either player.', 'Were the Mariners to have Middleton as their owner, it would be impossible to say if he’d hand over the cash necessary to get players of that caliber, but he has demonstrated the willingness to get players that would help the Phillies build a roster to consistently get to and succeed in the playoffs.', 'That’s what fans should want in an owner.', 'That makes him one of the top owners in the game now.', 'There have been precious few times the Phillies can honestly say they have the best at something.', 'The best ever third baseman.', 'The best pitcher in the game, several times.', 'The best catcher in baseball.', 'What is inarguable is that they have the best mascot in the game in the Phanatic.

If Phoenix trades Durant, the only logical move is to pivot to a rebuild around Devin Booker — and land enough picks and young players in that trade to jumpstart the rebuild process.', 'But this has been a wild trade deadline, so we’re not ruling anything out completely.', 'Just 72 hours ago, it seemed a lock that Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic would be out of Chicago before the deadline. That is true for LaVine, who is now in Sacramento with his old Bulls’ teammate DeMar DeRozan trying to lift the Kings into the playoffs.', 'Vucevic, however, may be a Bull past the Feb. 6 deadline after two deals for the big man fell through on Tuesday, reports Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times. He adds that the Bulls are now preparing to have him around past the deadline.', 'Things change fast in the 36 hours before the deadline, but it may not be fast enough for Vucevic.', 'Khris Middleton is out, and Kyle Kuzma is in for Milwaukee? Jusuf Nurkic is out, and Jonas Valanciunas is in for Phoenix?', 'Those deals are getting close, reports long-time NBA scribe Steve Bulpett at Heavy.com. The rebuilding Wizards will pull the trigger if the draft compensation coming back makes it worth their while.', 'Milwaukee wanted to be aggressive heading into the trade deadline, looking for an upgrade and moving on from Middleton — who had surgery on both ankles this offseason and has looked a step slower to the naked eye — but is Kuzma that guy? The Bucks would be banking on the guy who picked up a ring in the bubble with the Lakers to return closer to that form than the guy shooting 28% from 3 this season, scoring seven fewer points a game than he did a season ago.', 'Phoenix wants to get Nurkic out the door — he was moved to the bench last month because Nick Richards is the starting five now — and this trade brings Valanciunas in as a solid reserve big. The Wizards have had a lot of interest in Valanciunas in recent weeks.', 'This isn’t a surprise, but we should make it all-but official:', 'Bradly Beal is going to be with the Phoenix Suns after the trade deadline. That was obvious for a few reasons, starting with Beal has a no-trade clause, so he completely controls the process (also, there is no market for him). But if you wanted confirmation, there is this from The Athletic.', 'A league source close to Beal reiterated on Tuesday that there are currently no talks about him waiving the clause, and that he expects to remain in Phoenix through the deadline.', 'KJ Martin, who has been out since Dec. 23 due to a foot injury, is being held out Tuesday night 76ers game because he is on the verge of being traded, something reported by several people around the Sixers including Kyle Neubeck of PHLY Sports.', 'The Sixers are updating KJ Martin to OUT, with a trade pending, source tells me. More to come', 'The 76ers are reportedly looking at multiple trade options for Martin, but all of them largely a salary dump move that does not bring a player back to the Sixers, a league source told NBC Sports. Martin is a 6\'6"" wing who has averaged 6.4 points a game coming off the bench in the 24 games before his injury. He can help multiple teams and is making just under $8 million this season and is under contract for basically the same amount next season.', 'KJ will be the second Martin Philly has traded, they also moved Cody Martin to Dallas for Quentin Grimes.', 'And the Kevin Durant chatter just gets louder and louder... and now Jimmy Butler is even getting dragged into it.', 'Golden State’s interest in re-uniting with Durant is well known — the Warriors are desperately looking for a star shot creator to pair with Stephen Curry, and dancing again with Durant is on the table — but Dallas and Houston also are showing levels of interest, reports The Athletic’s Sam Amick, David Aldridge and Anthony Slater.', 'Dallas getting in the mix after trading away Luka Doncic — for 50 cents on the dollar — is an unexpected twist, and would be difficult for them to pull off because they don’t have a lot of tradable players and picks left. Durant makes $51.2 million, and since Dallas can’t or won’t trade Kyrie Irving, just-acquired Anthony Davis, or P.J. Washington, it becomes a difficult-to-construct five-for-one or worse trade that likely has to drag a third team into the mix.', 'Houston’s GM Rafael Stone has said in the run-up to the deadline that he wants to see what this roster — with its young players — can do in the playoffs before making a move, but Durant could change that dynamic. The Rockets have the players to make the trade with a package based around the expiring Fred VanVleet and a bunch of picks, but that only works if Phoenix wants to totally rebuild. Which it seems like they do not.', 'That same Athletic reports suggest a possible three-team arrangement where Jimmy Butler gets his wish to go to Phoenix, Durant heads to Golden State, and an Andrew Wiggins-based trade package heads to Miami. The question for Phoenix is, why? Swapping out Durant for Butler to play with Bradley Beal and Devin Booker does not make the Suns better, why would they do that? Better to blow the whole thing up and rebuild.', 'It’s all still a long shot, but momentum toward a Durant trade continues to build.', 'Lonzo Ball is more than just one of the best stories of the season, he has returned to being the kind of player every team needs — a solid backup point guard. He’s averaging 7.2 points and 3.5 assists a night, playing 20-25 minutes a night off the bench (although he isn’t playing back-to-backs).', 'That has led to a number of teams calling about him, reports Marc Stein. Ball is on an expiring $21.4 million contract, but the Bulls are likely to keep him on the roster past the deadline and try to re-sign him this summer, according to the report. Of course, if you’re trying to get teams to offer more for a player, that’s exactly what you would leak.', 'Just know that after more than 1,000 days away from the game and three knee surgeries, Lonzo is back and will get another contract this summer.', 'Phoenix went into this trade season looking to land Jimmy Butler and put him alongside Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, but that appears less likely with each passing minute (more on the Heat below; keep reading), so the Suns may pivot.', 'Talk about the Suns trading Kevin Durant, likely to the Golden State Warriors, is getting a lot louder, with league sources confirming to NBC Sports that there are ongoing talks. I’m not the only person reporting this chatter is getting louder.', 'That’s not to say it will happen — would Durant be okay with this? — but the Warriors have called everyone and anyone looking to find a star to put next to Curry, and the Suns didn’t hang up on the call.', 'It’s still highly unlikely the Suns will trade Durant. Phoenix’s preference would remain to find a new home for Bradley Beal, which would allow them to complete a Butler trade. However, that seems less and less realistic. If so, would Phoenix consider a serious pivot? Just keep an eye on the situation.', 'The Lakers were looking for depth at center before they traded their best defender and only quality rim protector to Dallas for Luka Doncic. That has only upped the pressure on Lakers GM Rob Pelinka to find a new center, but he said riding the long-term fit next to Doncic (and LeBron James) could come this summer.', '“We know we have a need for a big,” Pelinka said Tuesday at Doncic’s press conference. “The market for bigs right now, leading into the last two or three days of the trade deadline, is very dry. There’s just not a lot available. So maybe we’ll be able to do some stuff around the margins. I would say, in terms of a big move for that position, it’s probably more realistic that that would be something that comes in the off-season.”', 'Interesting note from David Aldridge and Josh Robbins at The Athletic: The Wizards and Bucks have at least talked about a Kyle Kuzma trade sending Khris Middleton to Washington.', 'Two league sources said the Wizards and Milwaukee Bucks have explored a potential deal in which Milwaukee would send Khris Middleton and draft capital to Washington for Kuzma. This matches what was reported elsewhere on Monday. Exchanging Middleton’s salary for Kuzma’s would help the Bucks move under the second apron, a significant goal for the Bucks.', 'Take that with a grain of salt, but Washington wants out of the Kuzma business and the Bucks might bet he can be an upgrade over the current version of Middleton.', 'Rumors of the Nuggets trying to upgrade by moving on from Michael Porter Jr. have been going around, but Nuggets coach Michael Malone shot that down Monday night. Here’s his response, via ESPN, when asked if he talked to MPJ about his name being trade rumors.', '“No because we’re not trading Michael Porter,” Malone said. “So I’m not touching base with anybody on that. ... And if there’s something coming, obviously [Nuggets GM Calvin Booth] will talk with me and I’m sure we’ll communicate with whatever players. But Michael is a really important piece, he helped us win a championship.”', 'Jimmy Butler isn’t Kevin Durant. On a lot of levels. But particularly in regards to this trade deadline, where if the Suns choose to pivot away from trying to land Butler they can quickly have teams lined up to talk about Durant. Along those same lines, Jimmy Butler isn’t like Luka Doncic, where there would have been an overwhelming level of interest in a trade for the 25-year-old if Mavericks GM Nico Harrison had opened up bidding.', 'Outside of Phoenix, there is not much interest in trading for Butler, Tim Bontemps notes at ESPN. That’s not for a lack of effort by Miami to find trade partner — and both the Suns and Heat have looked at four- and five-team trades — but there is not a pent-up Butler market waiting to break out. A big part of that is Butler can opt out of the $52.4 million he is owed next season and become a free agent next summer, and he has made it clear he wants to get to Phoenix (where he believes owner Mat Ishbia will pay him). Plus, Butler is 35, has seen his game take a step back this season, has a long injury history, and wants to get paid with at least two new years at a high number on this contract.', 'The question the Suns may need to ask themselves: What do we do with Butler if we can’t trade him before the deadline?', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

""I had to check if it was April 1.

I would say I always take the high road. I had my amazing moments in Dallas with all my teammates, coaches and most importantly the fans. They always supported me, and it was an amazing journey.""', 'The Lakers formally welcomed Doncic on Tuesday, less than three days after they traded Anthony Davis and Max Christie in a three-team deal for the Slovenian scorer who won his first scoring title last season before leading the Mavs to the NBA Finals. Doncic is a five-time All-NBA selection and a five-time All-Star.', ""Stars of Doncic's age and accomplishments are almost never traded in any sport, and particularly not in such an abrupt manner. But when Dallas decided to move on from its 25-year-old centerpiece, the Lakers eagerly gave up Davis -- one of basketball's best big men -- to make it happen."", 'Doncic is still processing the upheaval, but he already is seeing the limitless upside of a career in Los Angeles that will begin alongside James, 40, the top scorer in NBA history.', '""Honestly, it was hard at first,"" Doncic said.

In his typically florid style of discourse, Pelinka said Doncic\'s arrival would bring ""basketball joy to the world.""', '""I think Luka Doncic joining forces with the Los Angeles Lakers is a seismic event in NBA history.""

"Luka Doncic trade grades: Lakers get 'A+' as they solve future, why Mavs fail despite landing Anthony Davis",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/luka-doncic-trade-grades-lakers-get-a-as-they-solve-future-why-mavs-fail-despite-landing-anthony-davis/,"['', ""The modern NBA is built on drama and there's no more fertile ground for wild stuff to happen than the days leading up to the trade deadline. But absolutely nobody could've seen this coming: The Lakers and Mavericks have agreed to a three-way trade with Utah that sends Anthony Davis to Dallas and ... brace yourself ... Luka Doncic to Los Angeles. Yes, Luka Doncic will now play for the Lakers alongside LeBron James."", ""While you're digesting that, here are the full details of the deal:"", ""Apologies to Jazz fans, but nobody has any time to assess their part of this deal. This is all about Luka joining up with LeBron and the Lakers, as crazy as this sounds, possibly better positioning themselves in the short term to win a title. Now, let's get to the trade grades. "", ""There's no other way to look at this. Factoring in both age and production, the Lakers just scored what is probably the most coveted basketball player in the world not named Victor Wembanyama. Doncic is only 25 years old. To land a player this good and this young in a trade is absolutely bonkers. You honestly might never see a score again like this in your lifetime. "", ""It almost doesn't even matter how Luka and LeBron will pair together or whether they'll have any chance of holding up defensively (probably not), because for the Lakers, the short-term implications of this deal aren't nearly as important as what this does for them long-term, assuming they lock up Doncic on a max deal as soon as humanly possible. "", ""The Lakers have been trying to figure out their post-LeBron plan for some time now. They have held firm to their future first-round draft picks knowing they couldn't empty their cupboard as LeBron ages out, which is bound to happen, right? Well, Luka Doncic pretty much takes care of that concern, and to think, they didn't even have to give up both their trade-eligible picks to get him. They could still go out and make even more moves before Thursday's deadline. "", ""This is truly unbelievable. I don't know whether Rob Pelinka is the luckiest or smartest man alive, but the Lakers are celebrating tonight."", 'So here\'s the weird thing: I truly believe the Mavericks are better positioned to win a championship with Anthony Davis, assuming full postseason health, than they are with Luka Doncic... today. Right now. And yet they still get an ""F"" because you just can\'t trade Luka Doncic, not unless your hand is forced. ', ""Upon first hearing the news, that was my only rational explanation for the deal. The Mavericks had to have been forced by Doncic behind closed doors. He must've told them he wanted out, and they didn't want to wait until next season when word would get out and they would lose leverage. "", ""Through that lens, I went on CBS Sports HQ and initially gave the Mavericks a C-, because I'm all for being proactive with these things rather than winding up like the Heat with Jimmy Butler or the 76ers with James Harden or the Pelicans with Davis and having to do everything on the players' terms."", 'This is where reporting started to diverge. According to Marc Stein, Doncic ""did not request a trade"" and the Mavericks did this entirely on their own accord. CBS Sports\' Bill Reiter, however, reports something slightly different, that the Mavericks were essentially sensing that Doncic was going to be tough to keep considering his free agency in the summer of 2026 and all the teams that are currently organizing their books to make a run at him. So they got ahead of a mess even though it hadn\'t officially started. ', ""This thing is fluid. We're going to be hearing little, or perhaps big, pieces of context trickle out for a long time. I have to believe Doncic possibly leaving the Mavs, whether he had actually hinted at that behind closed doors or not, played a role in Nico Harrison's thinking, and for that I give him credit. These stars holding teams hostage is a nightmare. Teams have to get ahead of these things if they sense it coming. "", ""That said, Harrison made it pretty clear that at least a decent chunk of his reasoning for making this trade was basketball related. It wasn't because Luka asked or demanded out; it was because he doesn't play defense and doesn't stay in shape. "", '""I believe that defense wins championships,"" Mavs GM Nico Harrison told ESPN regarding his motivation to trade Luka Doncic for Anthony Davis. ""I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We\'re built to win now and in the future.""', 'MacMahon further reported that the Mavericks had ""major concerns"" about partnering with Doncic on another max contract ""due to his constant conditioning issues."" ', ""So this is the context we need, or at least as much as we can hope for in the immediacy of a trade of this magnitude. The Mavericks don't trust Luka to stay in shape and they don't trust him to play defense and they believe defense is a must to win a championship, and I don't think you would find very many people who would disagree with any of those things. "", 'I also don\'t think you would find very many people, all those things notwithstanding, who would\'ve made this trade without a loud-and-clear demand from Doncic. Not a hint that a demand might come. Not after looking around at the landscape and trying to predict the future. A full-on ""trade me or else"" situation. Short of that, there\'s a chance Nico Harrison is the only GM in history who would\'ve made this deal. ', ""It's Luka, man. He's a once-in-a-generation player, even when he's out of shape and not playing defense. I'm sorry. He's just too great and too young to trade, even if the concerns are reasonable and even if you're possibly in a better spot to win a title in the short term, which I do believe is the case for the Mavericks. "", ""Luka was a defensive mess in last year's Finals. The Celtics feasted on him. Dallas had no chance to win that series, even with Luka being Luka offensively. Davis can play alongside Daniel Gafford or Derek Lively and give the Mavericks a massive defensive front line, and he's an absolutely perfect two-man pairing with Kyrie Irving, whom the Mavericks are clearly comfortable turning their offense over to, with shooting around them."", ""If Davis is healthy in the playoffs, Dallas is going to be nasty. Just watch. But I'll tell you what, even if they actually do win the title, it will still be hard to justify this deal. It will be a lot easier than if they don't, but it still is going to sting for a long time, letting Luka Doncic go on your own accord. "", 'In two years, when Davis is 34 and Kyrie is 35 and Doncic is off winning MVPs, they are going to wake up some morning in a cold sweat wondering what the hell they did, the same way the Hawks, for as good as Trae Young has been and for as justifiable as that draft-day trade looked on paper at the time, will never get over giving up Luka. ', ""See, that's the thing. Davis is going to be out of his prime in the blink of an eye. The Mavericks, if they really wanted to do this, could've gone out and gotten so many future draft picks they wouldn't have known what to do with them. But they chose the best team they could put together right now. It's short-sighted, but it is what they chose to do. I can't see any way they won't end up regretting it once enough time passes -- however, these next few seasons shake out. "", ""Well, OK. If they win back-to-back titles, I'll give it to Nico. "", ""But until then, I mean, I don't know what else to say. This is ludicrous. I may have entirely different thoughts on all this in a week, or a month, or a year, or in five years, but right now, this is how it shakes out in my head. The Mavericks are better positioned to win a title with Davis this season than they would've been with Doncic, and yet they still made a massive mistake. "", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Luka Doncic–Anthony Davis Trade Is an All-Time NBA Shocker,https://www.theringer.com/2025/02/02/nba/luka-doncic-anthony-davis-trade-los-angeles-lakers-dallas-mavericks,"['Most NBA trades are predictable in their buildup and ultimate framework. A pricey team seeks to duck under the luxury tax, or an available role player from a noncontender fills a hole on a playoff team, or a star publicly requests a trade, leading to all manner of rumors and Trade Machine screenshots and podcast debates. There’s a pattern, a flow, an understanding to these things.', 'But ESPN’s Shams Charania dropped an all-time stunner late on Saturday night, tweeting, completely out of the blue, that the Dallas Mavericks were trading Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis and a first-round pick. It was so surprising that Charania had to start his follow-up tweet with the line, “Yes, this is real,” because the immediate question was whether his account had been hacked.', 'The trade is indeed real. And given the players and franchises involved and the complete lack of lead-in speculation, it may well be the most stunning deal this century, if not in all of NBA history. ', 'I have never seen so many team executives not involved in this trade stunned.', 'The full deal, according to Charania, will send Doncic, Maxi Kleber, and Markieff Morris to Los Angeles; Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick to Dallas; and Jalen Hood-Schifino and two second-rounders to Utah. But the headline is clear: Doncic for Davis and a pick. Plus, perhaps, a meltdown among Dallas fans who just lost the 25-year-old face of their franchise in the middle of the night.', 'That would be rough enough on its own. But Luka isn’t just any face of a franchise; he is, by one measure, the most accomplished young player in NBA history. Luka had five first-team All-NBA nods through age 24, the most ever. The list of players right behind him—which includes his new teammate LeBron James—is a who’s who of some of the best in league history.', 'Doncic is also an outstanding playoff performer, fresh off a Finals appearance last spring. Only Michael Jordan has a higher career postseason scoring average than Doncic’s 30.9 points per game, and Luka has already been the best player on one Finals team and another that reached the conference finals. In perhaps his defining moment as a Maverick, he crossed up Rudy Gobert, then sank a game-winning 3-pointer in Game 2 of the 2024 conference finals, and screamed, “You can’t fucking guard me!” at the four-time Defensive Player of the Year.', 'But now, less than a year after that display of immense talent and unvarnished emotion, Dallas decided to say goodbye to the Luka experience. Marc Stein—a reporter well connected in Dallas—revealed Saturday night that Doncic had not requested a trade, and that “the Mavericks did this on their own accord.” ', 'That decision is so surprising that it inspires questions about the internal qualms Dallas must have felt about its leading star. That seems to be the only logical explanation for why Doncic—a 25-year-old megastar who just ranked fourth on Bill Simmons’s Trade Value list—would be available. The team “had major concerns about moving forward with Luka Doncic due to his constant conditioning issues and the looming commitment of another supermax contract extension this summer,” ESPN’s Tim MacMahon tweeted.', 'Bill Simmons’s NBA Trade Value Rankings', 'The publicly stated rationale was less convincing. “I believe that defense wins championships,” Dallas GM Nico Harrison told MacMahon. “I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We’re built to win now and in the future.”', '', 'But the Mavericks already had a solid chance with Luka on the roster. They didn’t merely make the Finals in 2024; they were also 19-10 this season before he suffered an injury on Christmas, and the backcourt pairing of Doncic and Kyrie Irving looked as unguardable as ever. ', '😳', 'In terms of the possible basketball reasons to make this swap, perhaps Harrison was worried about Dereck Lively II’s foot fracture and wanted another center—and Davis was the best one he could’ve traded for, assuming Nikola Jokic and Victor Wembanyama weren’t available. Perhaps Harrison had seen his team beat the West-leading Thunder three times without Doncic this season and been encouraged by that Luka-less look. Perhaps he wanted to avoid the luxury tax and its roster-building implications. Perhaps he salivated at the prospect of Davis playing next to Kyrie Irving—an ideal thunder-and-lightning duo—years after their first chance at a potential union was scuttled.', 'Or perhaps Harrison actually had such deep, private fears about Luka’s conditioning and injury history—he hasn’t played more than 70 games in a season since he was a rookie—that he felt the need to make a move right now, before re-extending Luka for nearly $350 million this summer. That’s the only conceivable justification that makes any sort of sense—and even then, the Mavericks reportedly didn’t make Luka’s availability widely known to incite a bidding war.', 'Meanwhile, Doncic becomes the latest in a long line of Lakers stars welcomed to the glitz and glamor via trade. The metaphorical opportunity for LeBron to pass his torch to Luka seems almost too perfect to be real. And while the Lakers will lose a top-10 player to facilitate that chance, half a decade after a blockbuster trade for Davis propelled them to their most recent title, this is about as easy a no-brainer as is possible with a trade of this magnitude. Luka’s proved he’s that special, time and time again.', 'And heck, the Lakers surrendered only a single first-round pick in this deal, meaning they still have their 2031 first to deal before the trade deadline if they want to upgrade their roster around Luka and LeBron.', 'The context behind that phrase—“Luka and LeBron”—would have sounded meaningless to any NBA fan, even the most ardent Trade Machine obsessive, before Saturday night. Luka and LeBron seemed far more likely to play against each other in the postseason than to play together. Luka’s one of the best players in the NBA, right in his prime age range; LeBron’s, well, LeBron, with a no-trade clause to boot. In what conceivable world would they have ever become teammates?', 'In a world in which Shams wasn’t hacked, apparently, and in which NBA teams can execute middle-of-the-night blockbusters with the stealth and speed of a fantastical assassin. The entire league changed on Saturday, and nobody—not even Luka, not even LeBron—saw it coming.\nEnd of article', 'Yep, we have one too', 'Most Read', 'You’ve Never Seen an Offense Like the Memphis Grizzlies’', 'The Bears Are Getting Ben Johnson.

Why the stunning Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade may end up a win-win,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mavs-trade-luka-doncic-lakers-anthony-davis-rcna190535,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The NBA was rocked on Sunday by news of the shocking, once-in-a-generation deal that sent Luka Dončić to Los Angeles and Anthony Davis to Dallas. While there are some draft picks and other players involved, along with the Utah Jazz, theories about Dončić are taking center stage. And for good reason.', 'On the surface, it seems crazy that the Mavericks would want to get rid of their offensive superstar. Last year, Dončić’s 73-point game against the Atlanta Hawks was the fourth most points in league history. Dončić is a perennial MVP contender, and he has made the All-NBA first team for the last five seasons. And while the Mavs lost in the NBA Finals to Boston, Dončić played well, if unevenly. This felt like the beginning of a beautiful relationship for the 25-year-old Dončić and Dallas, not the end of the line.', 'This felt like the beginning of a beautiful relationship for the 25-year-old Dončić and Dallas, not the end of the line.', 'But while it may sound like riding the fence, I don’t think that both teams could very well wind up winning when we look at this deal five or six years from now. (Although, of course, future trades could certainly change the way we view this deal.)', ""Dallas fans upset by this presumed loss would be wise to read between the lines of the post-trade comments made by Mavs general manager Nico Harrison. It's telling that Harrison made it clear he and head coach Jason Kidd were on the same page when it came to this once-unimaginable deal."", 'While his offensive talent is undeniable, Dončić doesn’t play a lick of defense. His large frame lumbers up and down the floor, and he has been criticized for a lack of effort. As ESPN noted, he is almost never operating in high gear. While not as hefty as Pelicans star Zion Williamson, Dončić just doesn’t seem to have taken his conditioning seriously over the past few years.', 'Dončić has bristled in the past at comments about his weight and stamina. But when combined with his long list of injuries, this is a topic his coaches may not have been able to ignore. Indeed, the Slovenian star hasn’t played since late December because of a calf strain.', 'Could a move to Los Angeles that connects him with a legend like LeBron James provide Dončić with new motivation? James’ attention to fitness is well-regarded. Perhaps he can provide a blueprint to Dončić to help better his off-the-court habits.', 'The Lakers’ decision to part ways with Anthony Davis is far less controversial but no less consequential. The opportunity to bring in a 25-year-old offensive dynamo in exchange for a 31-year-old Davis appears to have been too good to pass up. Now, the Lakers are left without a defensive presence at the rim. And there will be short-term pain for Lakers fans as a result. Still, the long term is bright for the Lakers with the ability to build around Dončić. The move also likely means that James will play another year or two in Los Angeles. And he has long praised Dončić’s play publicly.  ', 'On the other side of the trade, the short-term consequences for the Mavericks will be swift. Davis can provide solid offensive output and a defensive presence the team has lacked for years. Once he and Kyrie Irving get on the same page, Dallas could be a force in the Western Conference playoff picture. The long-term picture is a bit murkier given the age and mileage on Davis and Irving. It seems there is an urgency to win now with this group.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'Lastly, there were the financial considerations. Miriam Adelson bought a majority stake in the Mavericks from billionaire owner Mark Cuban in 2024 for over $3 billion. Dončić was set to sign a “SuperMax” contract this offseason that would pay him $345 million for five years. That could have played a role, in part, for the Mavericks.', 'In a world where we long for instant results, this stunning trade may yet disappoint. Or not.

Luka-AD blockbuster a reminder of what might have been for Celtics,https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nba/boston-celtics/luka-doncic-anthony-davis-trade-kyrie-irving-danny-ainge/685388/,"['Chris Forsberg, Eddie House, and Kayla Burton share their immediate reactions to the stunning Luka Doncic trade.', 'While we all try to wrap our heads around the most out-of-left field trade in NBA history -- the Los Angeles Lakers acquiring Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster swap that sent out Anthony Davis -- this is what we can’t stop rolling around in our Celtics-centric mind:', ""Six years ago, Danny Ainge seemed hell-bent on pairing Kyrie Irving and Davis together in Boston. Ainge, now at the helm of the Jazz, finally made that combo a reality, as Utah was the third team that facilitated Saturday's jaw-dropping deal"", 'And that got us thinking about how different things could have been in Boston.', 'For as much as Ainge loved big trades, even he often admitted the best swaps were sometimes the ones he didn’t make. The high value Ainge placed on Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, even when they were just future draft picks, might have prevented overspends that could have altered the course of a franchise that eventually secured the elusive Banner 18 last season.', 'There’s always the chance that acquiring Davis could have infused some missing happiness into Irving’s life and that the Celtics, with Brad Stevens still at head coach, might have finished that title quest even sooner than the 2023-24 season.', 'But it’s hard to even imagine not getting this Jays Era. Not watching Brown and Tatum climb the ladder to NBA superstars. Not seeing them overcome several setbacks, like the 2022 Finals loss, before ascending to NBA champs.', 'With Davis and Irving paired now together in Dallas, maybe we’ll get a glimpse at what life could have been like in Boston if that combo had been put together here. They’re both north of 30 now, however, and the window won’t be open nearly as long as it could have been in Boston.', 'Regardless, it’s also a reminder that things worked out just fine here.', 'When the AD quest fizzled and Irving stomped off to join Kevin Durant in Brooklyn, the Celtics leaned harder into a Jays-led future and have been rewarded handsomely. Stevens eventually took the front-office reins from Ainge and shaped the roster around Tatum and Brown, and Boston is now on the hunt for Banner 19.', 'In a sense, it might have been the way the Celtics exposed the defensive weaknesses of the Mavericks on the title stage last season that forced Dallas to come to grips with a potentially Luka-less future. There’s certainly more to this story -- you don’t quietly trade for injury-prone Davis if you’re simply worried about Doncic’s long-term conditioning.', 'The Celtics are insanely fortunate to have two young stars who embrace both ends of the court and utilize much of their downtime in a quest to be the best version of themselves on the court.', 'Before the season, Tatum predicted the Celtics and Mavericks would meet in a rematch of the 2025 Finals. Despite trading out a superstar scorer, it’s fair to wonder if the Mavericks now have a better overall balance that should keep them in the mix in the West. We’ll see if there are any more shoes to drop with the Lakers after the Doncic acquisition.', 'We’ll likely have to wait until next season for the first up-close glimpse of Doncic in Lakers purple and gold. The new-look Mavericks visit TD Garden this Thursday. Davis and Irving will finally share the floor in Boston, just like we all wondered might happen.', 'But things might have worked out even better for the Celtics without that combo.', '', 'Never miss a moment.

Lakers trade Anthony Davis for Luka Doncic in shocking NBA blockbuster with Mavericks and Jazz,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-trade-anthony-davis-for-luka-doncic-in-shocking-nba-blockbuster-with-mavericks-and-jazz-per-reports/,"['', 'The Dallas Mavericks have agreed to trade Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis in a shocking blockbuster trade that also involves the Utah Jazz. The Mavericks confirmed the trade Sunday morning after the stunning news broke shortly after midnight ET.', ""Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris will also go to the Lakers, while Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round pick will head to the Mavericks. The Jazz will receive Jalen Hood-Schifino, a 2025 second-round pick via the Los Angeles Clippers and the Mavericks' 2025 second-round pick in the trade first reported by ESPN that comes days before the Feb. 6 trade deadline."", 'This is one of the most substantial and surprising trades in NBA history and will alter the course of two franchises.', ""From the Mavericks' perspective, this is particularly shocking. Doncic, 25, has been one of the league's best players since entering the league in 2018. He has made five consecutive all-NBA first teams and led the Mavericks to the NBA Finals last year, where they fell to the Boston Celtics. "", 'For his career, he has averaged 28.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game while shooting 47% from the field and is widely regarded as one of the five best players in the world. Players of his caliber rarely get traded unless they force their way out of town. Per Marc Stein, Doncic did not make such a request. Though CBS Sports NBA insider Bill Reiter reports that Doncic was not planning to stay with Dallas as his contract ended in 2026.', '""We really feel like we got ahead of what was going to be a tumultuous summer, him being eligible for the supermax and also a year away from him being able to opt out of any contract,"" Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told the Dallas Morning News. ""And so we really felt like we got out in front of that. We know teams, they\'ve had it out there, teams have been loading up to try to sign him once that comes available.""', ""Doncic's poor defense, which stuck out in the Finals, and regular conditioning issues were reportedly factored in Dallas' decision, too. Doncic has been sidelined since Christmas due to a calf injury and has never played more than 72 games in a season. "", '""I believe that defense wins championships,"" Harrison told ESPN about the decision to trade Doncic. ""I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We\'re built to win now and in the future.""', ""The Mavericks will now look to move forward with a Davis-Kyrie Irving pairing. Those two have a chance to be a dynamite combination, and they have a balanced roster around them. It seems that Dallas could have gotten more for Doncic, however, and if health and conditioning was a concern with him, they certainly didn't solve it by adding Davis, who currently is nursing a foot injury, though he is coming off the healthiest season of his career in 2023-24 (76 games played). "", 'At 26-23, the Mavericks sit in ninth place in the crowded Western Conference. They are 2.5 games back of a top-six seed and guaranteed playoff spot and 1.5 games ahead of 11th place and missing out on the Play-In Tournament entirely. ', ""For the Lakers, the Mavericks' concerns were their gain. In Doncic they now have a young superstar who can possibly be the face of their franchise for the next decade. Any concerns about what may happen to the organization once LeBron James retires have just evaporated. "", 'As for the present, the Lakers now have two of the most gifted offensive players in the league. James, even at age 40, can still dial it up from time to time, as he showed hours before the trade when he dropped a triple-double in a win over the red-hot New York Knicks. He cannot do so every night, however, and with Doncic by his side, James will have more of a chance to pick and choose his spots, which should keep him fresh until and during the playoffs. ', ""The Lakers have won eight of their last 10 to climb to fifth place in the West at 28-19, but were generally not considered true title threats due to James' age and their lack of offensive creation and poor defense. Losing Davis certainly hurts the latter, but the former will no longer be an issue. Are James and Doncic enough to truly contend? We'll soon find out. "", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

', 'According to the ESPN article, the trade discussion started on Jan. 7 at Ascension Coffee in the lobby of the Hotel Crescent Court in Uptown. There, Rob Pelinka and Nico Harrison started early talks on the trade that would rattle the NBA.', ""For those who don't know, Pelinka and Harrison are very familiar with one another. Pelinka, now the GM of the Lakers, was formerly Kobe Bryant's agent. Harrison, now the GM of the Mavericks, was formerly a Nike executive tasked with recruiting Bryant to a deal with Nike. "", 'From that relationship, which eventually resulted in a multi-million dollar signing, Pelinka and Harrison formed a bond that lasted decades. That tight bond created even tighter lips with the Luka Doncic trade — Harrison himself admitted as much in the post-trade press conference.', ""However, according to ESPN reporting, even Utah Jazz president Danny Ainge, who was the third team that made the deal possible, didn't know the magnitude of the trade. Per ESPN, Ainge didn't know Doncic was part of the deal until 30 minutes before the trigger was pulled."", 'For many Mavs fans, one question has been swirling in their heads: Why would a team that just made the Finals trade their franchise player who led them there?', ""ESPN's reporting revealed that Doncic's weight was a primary concern."", 'According to ESPN, the Mavs determined Doncic\'s ""ideal weight"" was 245 pounds. Despite the Mavs wanting Luka to hit that 245 benchmark, Luka hovered around the 250-255 mark, ESPN reported.', 'In November, the Mavs gave Doncic an 11-day absence to shed weight after he reached a weight in the high 260s, sources told ESPN. By January, when he underwent an MRI, Doncic weighed 255, the article stated.', 'According to ESPN, the Mavericks made multiple personnel moves in an attempt to prod Doncic into their desired strength and conditioning regimen, including firing former director of player health and performance Casey Smith, strength coach Jeremy Holsopple and manual therapist Casey Spangler. ', 'Per ESPN reports, all three men the franchise fired had been on the payroll since before Luka was drafted in 2018 and had strong relationships with him.', '""They get rid of everybody I like,"" Doncic reportedly said.', 'As a result, Doncic brought in his own team, according to ESPN, hiring Slovenian strength coach Anže Maček, physiotherapist Javier Barrio Calvo and nutritionist Lucia Almendros from Real Madrid. Luka reportedly paid for this full-time ""body team"" out of his pocket.', 'Per ESPN, this team did not result in a healthier Luka, and, in fact, resulted in the weight gain he experienced in November 2024. ', ""The weight concerns for Doncic were perhaps the Mavs' worst-kept secret. It was talked about on broadcasts, podcasts and all over social media. However, it never really mattered to fans."", 'When you have a star who can lead your team in points, rebounds, assists and steals in a playoff run that took them to the NBA Finals while injured, it tends not to matter if they put on a couple of pounds.', 'However, the stakes change when there are millions of dollars on the line. This summer, Doncic was eligible to sign the largest extension in league history — a $345 million five-year deal.', 'Nico Harrison made his feelings known about signing Luka to that extension during the post-trade press conference on Sunday. But in a stunning glimpse into how the team viewed Doncic, sources told ESPN that they were ""as afraid of Doncic signing the deal as they were of him not.""', 'Blame for the trade has largely fallen onto Nico Harrison, but Mavs governor Patrick Dumont still gave final approval on the deal.', ""Dumont has remained largely out of the limelight compared to the Mavs' previous owner Mark Cuban, and has not involved himself as deeply with the basketball operations of the franchise."", 'According to ESPN, Dumont trusted Harrison about the trade decision. ESPN said Dumont believed in Harrison\'s vision of a more defensive-minded team under Anthony Davis and saw it as a ""business decision that would preserve the Mavericks\' financial flexibility for the long term.""']"

John Kuntz, cleveland.com"", 'CLEVELAND, Ohio — Tristan Thompson thought it was fake.', 'That was a recurrent reaction to the Dallas Mavericks trading 25-year-old superstar Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in a package that included Anthony Davis during the late hours of an otherwise sleepy Saturday night — arguably the most shocking deal in NBA history that left many baffled and speechless, wondering if ace insider Shams Charania had gotten hacked. Even Charania had to send out a follow-up, essentially confirming his own reporting.', 'Who are The 40 Most Influential People in Cleveland Sports when it comes to fan happiness? See our list and how we ranked them.', 'Thompson was watching Seinfeld reruns in bed at the time, winding down and getting ready for some shut eye with a home game against the Mavericks about 15 hours away. Then his group chat went crazy, as teammate Darius Garland sent the first message.', '“What is this, a hack,” Thompson wondered aloud.', 'Tough to know these days, especially with so many social media parody accounts.', 'Nearly two million basketball lovers follow a handle known as “NBA Central” — an aggregation account that often gathers information from various reporters and posts it on X, formerly Twitter. Sourcing. Rumors. Quotes. Photos. Videos. Notable stats.', 'But there’s also a fake account — NBA Centel — that takes great pride in duping fans with a comedic flare. NBA players have become fully aware of it too.', '“We have a group chat with all our boys and stuff,” Thompson said. “I put in the chat, ‘Yo, D.G. you got Centel’d.’ And he’s like, ‘Yeah. All right.’ And then D.G. sent the next one when Shams was like, ‘I’m not hacked. This is real.’ I was like, ‘Oh, (expletive).’', '“You think it was fake just because the reality of like, not even about A.D., that’s bro, A.D. is amazing, Hall of Famer, you could run off the accolades, but it’s more so the Luka Doncic point. He had it made, tailored exactly to his liking, so it would’ve seemed from the outside, right? They said it’s the first time in NBA history two first-team All-NBA guys get traded midseason. That’s pretty big for it to happen. K.D. (Kevin Durant) said it best, at end of day, business is transactional. If a transaction works and the card don’t decline, then that (expletive) gets approved.”', 'And, yet the Mavericks aren’t looking for a refund — despite Doncic being a perennial MVP candidate, five-time All-Star and generational talent who led Dallas to the Finals last year. In his seventh career season, Doncic averages 28.6 points, the third-highest scoring average in NBA history to this point.', 'When asked about the momentous deal, Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison said it was in the best interest of the franchise.', 'What? How? Why?', 'As Harrison spoke from an overcrowded room near the visitor’s locker room inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, he emphasized the importance of culture and spoke about a specific identity.', '“The players that we’re bringing in, we believe, exemplify that,” Harrison said. “We think defense wins championships, and we’re bringing in one of the best two-way players in the league.”', 'The trade was partially about Doncic. The Mavericks were reportedly concerned about his weight, conditioning, lackadaisical defense and off-court habits. There was organizational hesitancy to offer him the cap-restrictive supermax deal worth five years and $345 million. Harrison addressed that looming decision, calling it a “unique” situation and saying the team got in front of what could have been a “tumultuous summer.”', 'It was also about Davis — and a specific vision.', 'One that ties directly to Cleveland.', '“I think if you look at the Cavaliers, that’s what you’re going to see,” Harrison told the Dallas Morning News early Sunday morning, singling out Cleveland’s imposing frontcourt of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. “Anthony’s probably going to finish games at the five, but you’re going to see those guys play together. When the Lakers won, he played the four.”', 'The Mavericks already have promising youngster Dereck Lively II and last year’s trade deadline acquisition Daniel Gafford to play inside. The idea is to pair Davis with either one of them, creating an interior fortress that can improve the league’s 13th-ranked D.', 'It wasn’t long ago that some around the league scoffed at Cleveland’s two-big plan, wondering if the front office needed to split the supposedly ill-fitting Mobley and Allen, reconfiguring the roster to match the space-ball era. President of basketball operations Koby Altman answered multiple questions about that subject during last May’s end-of-season wrap-up. He even had some of his data-driven cohorts pull numbers supporting the keep-them-together stance.', '“They said it wouldn’t work,” Mobley explained when informed of Harrison’s comments following Cleveland’s record-setting 144-101 win over short-handed Dallas. “I feel like we figured out a way each year and got better playing with each other. Now it’s clearly working. I feel like, a lot of teams are just — the copycat league and trying to figure out the new wave of how to play basketball.', '“That might be the new wave.”', 'The Cavs have been riding it to the league’s best record at 40-9.', '“We’ve built something special here,” Allen told cleveland.com. “We’ve built something that works, that not a lot of people thought would work. We proved them wrong. You don’t prove anything until you’re winning. I think this year is starting to prove that we are becoming what we always thought it would be. Now people are seeing it and starting to copy that success.”', 'The Cavs have played 633 minutes with Allen and Mobley together this season. In those minutes, the team has an offensive rating of 124.1, a defensive rating of 109.7 and a net rating of 14.4. It’s become one of Cleveland’s most reliable and effective combinations.', '“Willingness is first,” Allen said. “You can look at another big man and think, ‘Oh, he’s taking up my space.’ But we don’t do that. We have been willing to adapt every single thing and have found a system that works for both of us.”', 'That was Atkinson’s vision. During his lengthy interview process with Cleveland decision-makers this offseason, he arrived with a detailed PowerPoint presentation and numerous film clips — some from his days in Golden State with Draymond Green and Kevon Looney. It was all intended to show why Allen and Mobley could flourish. Together.', '“That was part of the thing I really pushed in my interview with Koby — yes, we need this, I’d love to keep them together,” Atkinson said. “I think in the playoffs you need various ways to play and I’m glad that combination has been excellent together this year. Let’s see how it works out for us in the end.”', 'The Mavericks aren’t the first opponent to mention mimicking the Cavs’ two-big approach.', 'Miami’s Erik Spoelstra introduced a new pairing of Bam Adebayo and Ke’lel Ware — the 7-foot rookie who moved into the starting lineup about two weeks ago. The Minnesota Timberwolves tried it with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert before sending Towns to New York this past summer. The top-seeded Western Conference juggernaut Oklahoma City Thunder will eventually have that same look with Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren. More could come, especially if Cleveland’s style translates to playoff success.', '“The NBA is such a copycat league,” Thompson said. “When Golden State was 73-9 and running up all those 3s, every team wanted to play Moneyball and shoot 40 3s a game. Then you came with the wave where you had the Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and Brook Lopez where you had the five that could space and shoot 3s. Now you’re in the era right now where you’ve got to have bigs that guard one through five.', '“I think for what we’re trying to do, it works because Ev is making 3s, and we interchange them. You kind of do hockey shifts where you have six minutes on, the next guy comes in, you come with different waves.', '“We’re doing something right if others are trying to follow suit.”', 'Powered by Advance Insights', '1 of 5', 'To understand how we may use the results of this poll, please read our\nPrivacy Policy and User Agreement.

Luka Doncic trade: What factors led to Lakers and Mavericks making the most shocking deal in NBA history?,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/luka-doncic-trade-what-factors-led-to-lakers-and-mavericks-making-the-most-shocking-deal-in-nba-history/,"['', 'The most shocking trade in NBA history, conversations with sources across the NBA suggest, was the product of a complicated set of circumstances that largely came down to this: Luka Doncic did not plan on staying with the Dallas Mavericks after his current deal came to an end in 2026, and his team should get what they could for him.', 'On Saturday, the news broke that a three-team trade between the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz had done what felt utterly unthinkable. Luka Doncic will be a Laker. Anthony Davis will be a Maverick.', 'The initial reaction when ESPN broke the story was, in effect, what the actual hell, Dallas?', 'But those across the NBA painted a picture that included several important factors that led to this moment.', ""First, there's the notion that Doncic had provided the Dallas Mavericks the runway to move on from him in part because it was a way to, as much as one can, graciously exit Dallas by allowing them to get something in return for him. Sources say that was the case, and that Doncic was following a similar, if much, much higher-profile (albeit much, much quieter), path as De'Aaron Fox earlier this week. Doncic reportedly never asked for a trade, but his long-term plans in Dallas were uncertain."", 'In that context, as frustrated as Mavs fans were as they processed losing their 25-year-old generational talent, getting Anthony Davis in return for Doncic is an infuriating-but-solid consolation prize. ', ""For the Lakers, who clearly come out ahead in this deal, the benefits are obvious. They acquire that young generational talent, a star they can try to pair with LeBron James for however long he's in the NBA -- a year, two, three, maybe more. But L.A. now also has its face of the franchise and superstar for the next decade, a cornerstone long after LeBron retires."", 'For the Lakers it had become obvious they were unlikely to truly compete for a championship with the roster it had. LeBron himself admitted this recently, saying, ""\'That\'s the way our team is constructed.""', 'Not anymore.', ""For Doncic, L.A. offers the chance to play with his childhood idol. It's also a landing spot that could allow his talent to get the accolades he must crave. While the Mavs made the Finals last year, Luka has never actually, truly contended for a Most Valuable Player Award. "", ""Though he's been a First-Team All NBA player every year since 2020, his MVP voting finishes have not been on the level of someone of his ability. Since that year, he's finished fourth, sixth, fifth, eighth and third in the MVP race."", 'There\'s also many moving parts here, and Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison released a statement Saturday night, painting this as a Dallas decision, not a Luka decision. ""Defense wins championships,"" Harrison Harrison told ESPN. ', 'In quotes published by the Dallas Morning News on Sunday morning, however, Harrison said the deal helped the Mavs get in front of ""what was going to be a tumultuous summer.""', '""We really feel like we got ahead of what was going to be a tumultuous summer, him being eligible for the supermax and also a year away from him being able to opt out of any contract,"" Harrison said. ""And so we really felt like we got out in front of that. We know teams, they\'ve had it out there, teams have been loading up to try to sign him once that comes available.""', ""It's also true -- and this led to LeBron James lashing out at CBS Sports on Saturday night -- that there had been talk in the past about LeBron growing frustrated with AD. The clip that angered LeBron in no way suggested he had anything to do with AD's departure this weekend. The full context referenced previous reporting from last year about rumors within the Lakers organization that LeBron at the time was frustrated with Davis."", 'That said, it would be surprising that the Los Angeles Lakers would trade Anthony Davis without running it by LeBron James -- their star, the GOAT, the guy who got his son drafted and his podcast partner hired as the head coach.', 'Questions remain. How did Rich Paul, the founder and CEO of Klutch sports who represents LeBron and AD, navigate this situation? Could the Mavs have had issues with Doncic that fueled his desire to leave, or made them more willing trade partners than one might think?', 'And, of course, what happens now for these Lakers and Mavs teams, having totally reshuffled halfway through this season?', 'This much is certain: The most stunning trade in NBA history will likely also be one of its most impactful, even if it takes months, or years, to see how exactly that plays out.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Utah Jazz are also involved in the three-team deal, acquiring Jalen Hood-Schifino and second-round draft picks from the Lakers (their 2025 pick from the Clippers) and the Mavericks.', ""James was apparently in the dark about this deal. In fact, according to ESPN, he was at dinner with his family following the Lakers' 128-112 win over the New York Knicks on Saturday when he first heard the news. "", 'That in and of itself is stunning.', 'Since joining the Lakers in 2018, James has had his hand on seemingly everything within the organization. He recruited Davis, whom he has played with for six seasons and won a championship alongside in 2020. He played a big role in the Lakers breaking up their title-winning squad to acquire Russell Westbrook in 2021.', 'When that experiment failed, he made his discontentment crystal clear, publicly pushing Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka to make a move. Pelinka went on to deal Westbrook and acquire six new players ahead of the 2023 trade deadline en route to the team reaching the Western Conference Finals that season.', 'Even heading into this season, with James on the cusp of turning 40, he was still clearly in control. After Lakers coach Darvin Ham was fired following the Lakers being eliminated in the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the team hired JJ Redick, James\' podcast partner on ""Mind the Game."" James even orchestrated the first father-son duo in NBA history, encouraging the Lakers to acquire Bronny James with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft. ', 'So, to make a move this big without James speaks volumes.', ""The Mavericks reportedly reached out to the Lakers about the deal, fed up with Dončić's deficits on the defensive end and his issues around being out of shape ahead of him being up for a supermax contract extension this summer."", 'It was too good for the Lakers to pass up.', 'How could the Lakers turn down Dončić, who sets up the 17-time champions for the post-LeBron James era with a young superstar who could be the next face of the team? The 25-year-old Dončić led the Mavericks to the Finals last season and has been a perennial contender for the MVP award. ', 'As for the Mavericks, their thinking was clear. While parting ways with one of the top young players in the league is a head-scratching endeavor on the surface, Davis gives the Mavericks a defensive-minded superstar who knows what it takes to be a champion.', 'For the Lakers, this was an investment in their future. For the Mavericks, this was a win-now move. ', 'But for James, it was something different. ', ""He's the face of the league. He's the leading scorer in NBA history.

DAVIS: THESE MAVERICKS HAVE ‘GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP’,https://www.mavs.com/davis-arrives/,"['PHILADELPHIA – Anthony Davis knows how to make a good first impression.', 'The new Mavericks superstar was first off the team bus as it pulled into Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday morning. He walked at the head of the line of Mavericks as they filed to the court for their morning shootaround before playing the Philadelphia 76ers a few hours later.', 'And then, as he was wrapping up a chat with reporters after the morning workout, he said the words Maverick fans have wanted to hear since general manager Nico Harrison made the stunning trade of Luka Dončić for Davis and Max Christie.', '“Excitement,” Davis said. “Nico believes in what I can add to this team. We’re both extremely excited about what we can do and I think we have a great opportunity to win a championship.”', 'Not a lot of teams can say that with a straight face. The Mavericks can.', 'Davis spent a good chunk of his first interview as a Maverick talking about his connection to Harrison and coach Jason Kidd, as well as his enthusiasm about joining Kyrie Irving in a bid to go title hunting.', 'He also acknowledged that all of this was just as stunning to him as everybody else.', '“I was shocked. I didn’t know,” Davis said of the trade. “I was home, about to watch a movie with my wife. And got the phone call. I had no idea. I’d just sent the team a text (of) congratulations on the big win (versus New York). And looking forward to Tuesday’s big game against the Clippers.', '“An hour later, I was no longer with the team. So I was in shock, obviously. I had no idea it was happening. Now, I’m kind of over it and ready to play for Dallas.”', 'That could come on Thursday in Boston, or when the Mavericks return home from this longest trip of the season to play Houston at 2 p.m. Saturday at American Airlines Center.', 'Before then, Davis said he will go through workouts Tuesday and Wednesday to test out his foot, which was listed as the reason he was out for Tuesday’s game against Philly.', '“I’m going to work out today, see how I feel,” he said. “Depending on that, get another one in Wednesday. And then depending on that, see how I feel. If not Thursday, then more than likely Saturday.”', 'And when he does make his Mavericks’ debut, it almost certainly will be as their starting power forward alongside Daniel Gafford at center and P.J. Washington at small forward to fill out a formidable front line.', 'When asked about returning to his more natural position after playing center for the Lakers for years, Davis said: “Obviously, Dereck (Lively II) is dealing with an injury, but Gaff is playing phenomenal. So I think that’s the plan, but we’ll see how it goes.', '“Right now, I’m just excited to get back to playing basketball. Given the whole trade thing but also the injury, each time I’m on the floor, I feel better. But I haven’t played power forward in a long time, since I was first in LA. To be back at the four, I’m excited to see how it goes.”', 'Davis and Irving have a history together, along with Klay Thompson. All three were on the 2014 World Cup team that won the gold medal. And Davis said he and Irving have discussed previously about pairing up their talents in the NBA.', '“Me and Kai talked about this I think in 2018 when I asked for a trade from New Orleans,” Davis said. “He was in Boston at the time and he ended up leaving for Brooklyn. We’ve been wanting to play alongside each other for a very long time. Now we got that opportunity to do so.”', 'But as long as Irving and Davis have been friends, the relationship with Harrison goes back even further for Davis.', 'When Harrison was a Nike executive, it was his job to help recruit elite athletes to the Nike brand. Davis certainly was a qualifier.', '“Nico’s known me since I was in high school,” Davis said. “Obviously, one of the guys I got close to when I signed with Nike. And then to stay close throughout the years, we remained good friends. And now to come back kind of full circle and be together here in Dallas, it’s going to be fun.', '“J-Kidd, I had him in LA (with the Lakers as an assistant coach on the 2020 championship team), so I’m pretty familiar with the offensive and defensive schemes they run. Obviously, little tweaks that he brought here. But for the most part, I’m very excited. I’m not trying to come here and disrupt anything. I’m just trying to add value to what they already have. But having him as the captain of the ship definitely makes my life a little easier.”', 'And if there was any doubt about Davis’ commitment to the Mavericks, it surely was erased when he waived the trade kicker that could have cost the franchise a hefty price.', 'Instead, that’s money that could be used to facilitate other moves, should they arise.', '“Just trying to help the team,” Davis said. “You always want to get better and losing a monument-to-be like Luka, obviously, it’s a lot. So I’m just trying to do my part and help Nico and the organization on how to continuously get better.”', 'So did he have any inside information that another move is coming before Thursday’s trade deadline?', '“You got to talk to Nico,” Davis said with a laugh.', 'X: @ESefko', 'Copyright © 2025 NBA Media Ventures, LLC.
