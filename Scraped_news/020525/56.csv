Head coach Andy Reid has avoided answering any questions along those lines. But Patrick Mahomes , Travis Kelce and their teammates are not so lucky.', 'Mahomes was asked by a reporter named Rich Shertenlieb, if he had a favorite referee. That question was actually laced around the idea that the star QB has had many great teammates in the past. It seems the reporter was trying to hoodwink the father of three into either giving a wild take or losing control.', 'However, he stayed calm and managed to give a diplomatically correct answer with a smile on his face. The usually ‘clutch’ quarterback did not seem fazed, leaving the reporter to head up to his teammates. Rich Shertenlieb saw Travis Kelce was fielding questions.', 'Travis, what do you love more? Taylor Swift or phantom 15-yard roughing the passer penalties in the playoffs?', 'To this Travis Kelce replied;', 'That’s a good question. Anybody else?', 'It was evident that the question ticked the 10-time Pro Bowler off.

But later down the line, he managed to keep his cool as he went through questions that brought his lighter side out. Then he decided to ask the gathered reporters a question.', 'If I could ask the media one question, why are you guys leaning into this whole ref thing?', 'His question was specifically as to why reporters are asking about the entire Kansas City Chiefs officiating favors theme.

Emailed daily. Always free!', 'The Washington Commanders finished so far ahead of schedule that the questions for this offseason are relatively minimal and more so about filling in some spots around their core. Washington successfully identified a rising star at quarterback in Jayden Daniels last offseason. They also added two key pieces to their coaching staff in head coach Dan Quinn and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. Terry McLaurin remains a dangerous threat on the outside and Quinn\'s defense has a few budding prospects across the formation. So while the Commanders look to add to a group that went to the NFC Championship Game this past season, there is not much concern surrounding the actual team heading into the offseason. Instead, the name of the franchise has stirred some discussion, continuing from years of debate and fuss from multiple sides. Washington changed its long time name of the ""Redskins"" to the ""Football Team in 2020. In 2022, the team got a more lasting name in the ""Commanders"" which has lasted through the present day. Amid speculations for change, Commanders owner Josh Harris has made a perfectly clear statement on where the franchise stands. Monday morning, Harris announced the team will not be changing its name and will stick with ""Commanders"" moving forward. “I think it’s now being embraced by our team, by our culture, by our coaching staff. We’re going with that,” Harris said. Very apparent in Harris\' statement is the desire to charter a path forward not only from the team\'s controversial past name, but previous ownership that soured among the fanbase when the team was known as the ""Redskins."" While many Washington fans and fans around the league still embrace the previous name, it is relatively obvious to see where Harris is coming from on this issue. He and the franchise will need to work to blend the present with the rich history of the team. But with a new stadium potentially on the way and their foundational player in the locker room already, the vision for the ""Commanders"" seems the right change at the right time.', 'Since his acquisition by Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens at the end of summer 2024, Patrik Laine\'s name has been the subject of much discussion. Whether it\'s because of the excitement that came with the acquisition, the serious injury he suffered in the fall, or for other reasons, he has been widely talked about. This week is no exception, but unfortunately, this time, it\'s for less favorable reasons. It started Monday morning with a strong outburst from Gilbert Delorme. And it continued during Tony Marinaro\'s show, still on the BPM Sports airwaves. Tony Marinaro believes it will likely be the end of Patrik Laine with the Montreal Canadiens by the summer of 2026 He also called the Finnish forward ""lazy."" It\'s hard to argue with that. That said, here\'s what Tony had to say on the subject. ""Patrik Laine is a lazy player. ""He always has been and always will be, whether he plays in Canada, the United States, or in Beirut! ""We shouldn\'t be surprised by what we\'re seeing. ""It\'s always been him, he\'s a player with crazy talent who shows up when he feels like it. ""And it often happens that he doesn\'t feel like it. That\'s why this second overall pick in the draft is now on his third team in the League. ""It ended badly with the first two and their coaches.. ""If I had to predict today, Patrik Laine would not be returning to the Canadiens at the end of his contract."" - Tony Marinato See the clip in question: You can guess that it continues to spark many reactions.', 'NHL insider Frank Seravalli released his new updated trade board, and with the Maple Leafs needing some defensive help, one name could be a massive help on the blue line. GM Brad Treliving has to make some type of deal to help the Maple Leafs get to that next level, and whether it\'s a trade for a premium center or a shutdown defenseman, there are definite holes that need improving. Speculation abounds about who can be brought in, and Seravalli has been keeping an eye on things. His latest trade board has a litany of targets, but one who could help Toronto lands himself at No. 14: Connor Murphy. Connor Murphy could be Jake McCabe 2.0 for Maple Leafs Seems familiar, eh? Toronto trades for a veteran defenseman from Chicago who ends up being a stud. It happened with Jake McCabe and it should happen with Murphy. The 6-foot-4, 212-pound blueliner is exactly the remedy for a struggling Morgan Rielly. He blocks tons of shots, throws his huge frame around, can contribute a bit offensively, has a high hockey IQ and can give Rielly a break if he pinches up, knowing Murphy has his back in transition. Seravalli gave a bit more insight into why Murphy makes sense: ""Remember when the Blackhawks retained half on defenseman Jake McCabe\'s deal and knocked him down to just $2 million to send him to Toronto? That deal worked out great for the Leafs. Chicago could do it again with Murphy. There is a reason the Blackhawks preserved their final salary retention slot in the Taylor Hall/Mikko Rantanen trade. It could be to potentially retain Seth Jones, though that isn\'t preferred, or it could be to get creative on a deal like one for Murphy - who is a perfectly serviceable if not flashy No. 4 defenseman. The youth movement is on the way in Chicago."" Maybe Toronto can look to Chicago again and snag Murphy this year. He costs $4.4M, but if it can get retention, a shutdown defenseman for Morgan Rielly at $2.2M is an absolute steal. With the Blackhawks rebuilding and Murphy already 31, it doesn\'t seem like the best fit. He shouldn\'t cost too much, either, and certainly won\'t be a Fraser Minten or Easton Cowan level of player. It\'s possible Toronto can trade away Nick Robertson and Topi Niemala with its 2026 third-round draft pick to get things done. Murphy would be the perfect addition to a Maple Leafs blue line that, while older, is meant to be a brick wall between the opponents and the net. Toronto needs one more piece to build the strongest protection possible not only in the regular season but the playoffs.', 'Perhaps Cleveland Browns edge-rusher Myles Garrett is the missing piece of the Detroit Lions\' Super Bowl puzzle. In an interview with the ""Dan Patrick Show,"" Sports Illustrated\'s Albert Breer listed the Lions as his favorite landing spot for Garrett, who requested a trade on Monday. ""I mean, God, the idea of Myles Garrett lining up opposite Aidan Hutchinson. That, to me, is really intriguing,"" Breer said Tuesday. Garrett and Hutchinson would form one of the most fearsome pass-rushing tandems in the NFL. Hutchinson has 28.5 sacks and has made one Pro Bowl in three seasons with the Lions. Garrett, meanwhile, has 102.5 sacks in eight seasons with the Browns and won the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. The Lions would have to unload high draft picks to land Garrett. The Athletic\'s Jeff Howe recently polled 10 NFL personnel executives to gauge the pass-rusher\'s value. All said the Browns would regain a first-rounder in a trade, and three said Cleveland could land multiple first-rounders. However, the Lions don\'t need to keep stockpiling draft picks. ""[The Lions] are in a spot now where they don\'t need their first-round pick,"" Breer said. ""If you\'re them, you could almost say, \'We may only have five or six rookies make our team.\'"" During the 2024 season, Hutchinson had 7.5 sacks in five games before fracturing his tibia/fibula in Week 6. The Lions acquired edge-rusher Za\'Darius Smith from the Browns before the trade deadline passed, but he didn\'t deliver in the playoffs. In a 45-31 divisional-round home loss to the Washington Commanders, the Lions had no sacks, and Commanders rookie QB Jayden Daniels finished 22-of-31 passing for 299 yards and two TDs. If the Lions had a player of Garrett\'s caliber, they could have applied much more pressure on Daniels and avoided an early postseason exit.', 'Join hundreds of thousands of readers who start their day with The Morning Bark, the best newsletter in sports.']"

Washington successfully identified a rising star at quarterback in Jayden Daniels last offseason. They also added two key pieces to their coaching staff in head coach Dan Quinn and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. Terry McLaurin remains a dangerous threat on the outside and Quinn\'s defense has a few budding prospects across the formation. So while the Commanders look to add to a group that went to the NFC Championship Game this past season, there is not much concern surrounding the actual team heading into the offseason. Instead, the name of the franchise has stirred some discussion, continuing from years of debate and fuss from multiple sides. Washington changed its long time name of the ""Redskins"" to the ""Football Team in 2020. In 2022, the team got a more lasting name in the ""Commanders"" which has lasted through the present day. Amid speculations for change, Commanders owner Josh Harris has made a perfectly clear statement on where the franchise stands. Monday morning, Harris announced the team will not be changing its name and will stick with ""Commanders"" moving forward. “I think it’s now being embraced by our team, by our culture, by our coaching staff. We’re going with that,” Harris said. Very apparent in Harris\' statement is the desire to charter a path forward not only from the team\'s controversial past name, but previous ownership that soured among the fanbase when the team was known as the ""Redskins."" While many Washington fans and fans around the league still embrace the previous name, it is relatively obvious to see where Harris is coming from on this issue. He and the franchise will need to work to blend the present with the rich history of the team. But with a new stadium potentially on the way and their foundational player in the locker room already, the vision for the ""Commanders"" seems the right change at the right time.', 'Since his acquisition by Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens at the end of summer 2024, Patrik Laine\'s name has been the subject of much discussion. Whether it\'s because of the excitement that came with the acquisition, the serious injury he suffered in the fall, or for other reasons, he has been widely talked about. This week is no exception, but unfortunately, this time, it\'s for less favorable reasons. It started Monday morning with a strong outburst from Gilbert Delorme. And it continued during Tony Marinaro\'s show, still on the BPM Sports airwaves. Tony Marinaro believes it will likely be the end of Patrik Laine with the Montreal Canadiens by the summer of 2026 He also called the Finnish forward ""lazy."" It\'s hard to argue with that. That said, here\'s what Tony had to say on the subject. ""Patrik Laine is a lazy player. ""He always has been and always will be, whether he plays in Canada, the United States, or in Beirut! ""We shouldn\'t be surprised by what we\'re seeing. ""It\'s always been him, he\'s a player with crazy talent who shows up when he feels like it. ""And it often happens that he doesn\'t feel like it. That\'s why this second overall pick in the draft is now on his third team in the League. ""It ended badly with the first two and their coaches.. ""If I had to predict today, Patrik Laine would not be returning to the Canadiens at the end of his contract."" - Tony Marinato See the clip in question: You can guess that it continues to spark many reactions.', 'NHL insider Frank Seravalli released his new updated trade board, and with the Maple Leafs needing some defensive help, one name could be a massive help on the blue line. GM Brad Treliving has to make some type of deal to help the Maple Leafs get to that next level, and whether it\'s a trade for a premium center or a shutdown defenseman, there are definite holes that need improving. Speculation abounds about who can be brought in, and Seravalli has been keeping an eye on things. His latest trade board has a litany of targets, but one who could help Toronto lands himself at No. 14: Connor Murphy. Connor Murphy could be Jake McCabe 2.0 for Maple Leafs Seems familiar, eh? Toronto trades for a veteran defenseman from Chicago who ends up being a stud. It happened with Jake McCabe and it should happen with Murphy. The 6-foot-4, 212-pound blueliner is exactly the remedy for a struggling Morgan Rielly. He blocks tons of shots, throws his huge frame around, can contribute a bit offensively, has a high hockey IQ and can give Rielly a break if he pinches up, knowing Murphy has his back in transition. Seravalli gave a bit more insight into why Murphy makes sense: ""Remember when the Blackhawks retained half on defenseman Jake McCabe\'s deal and knocked him down to just $2 million to send him to Toronto? That deal worked out great for the Leafs. Chicago could do it again with Murphy. There is a reason the Blackhawks preserved their final salary retention slot in the Taylor Hall/Mikko Rantanen trade. It could be to potentially retain Seth Jones, though that isn\'t preferred, or it could be to get creative on a deal like one for Murphy - who is a perfectly serviceable if not flashy No. 4 defenseman. The youth movement is on the way in Chicago."" Maybe Toronto can look to Chicago again and snag Murphy this year. He costs $4.4M, but if it can get retention, a shutdown defenseman for Morgan Rielly at $2.2M is an absolute steal. With the Blackhawks rebuilding and Murphy already 31, it doesn\'t seem like the best fit. He shouldn\'t cost too much, either, and certainly won\'t be a Fraser Minten or Easton Cowan level of player. It\'s possible Toronto can trade away Nick Robertson and Topi Niemala with its 2026 third-round draft pick to get things done. Murphy would be the perfect addition to a Maple Leafs blue line that, while older, is meant to be a brick wall between the opponents and the net. Toronto needs one more piece to build the strongest protection possible not only in the regular season but the playoffs.', 'Perhaps Cleveland Browns edge-rusher Myles Garrett is the missing piece of the Detroit Lions\' Super Bowl puzzle. In an interview with the ""Dan Patrick Show,"" Sports Illustrated\'s Albert Breer listed the Lions as his favorite landing spot for Garrett, who requested a trade on Monday. ""I mean, God, the idea of Myles Garrett lining up opposite Aidan Hutchinson. That, to me, is really intriguing,"" Breer said Tuesday. Garrett and Hutchinson would form one of the most fearsome pass-rushing tandems in the NFL. Hutchinson has 28.5 sacks and has made one Pro Bowl in three seasons with the Lions. Garrett, meanwhile, has 102.5 sacks in eight seasons with the Browns and won the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. The Lions would have to unload high draft picks to land Garrett. The Athletic\'s Jeff Howe recently polled 10 NFL personnel executives to gauge the pass-rusher\'s value. All said the Browns would regain a first-rounder in a trade, and three said Cleveland could land multiple first-rounders. However, the Lions don\'t need to keep stockpiling draft picks. ""[The Lions] are in a spot now where they don\'t need their first-round pick,"" Breer said. ""If you\'re them, you could almost say, \'We may only have five or six rookies make our team.\'"" During the 2024 season, Hutchinson had 7.5 sacks in five games before fracturing his tibia/fibula in Week 6. The Lions acquired edge-rusher Za\'Darius Smith from the Browns before the trade deadline passed, but he didn\'t deliver in the playoffs. In a 45-31 divisional-round home loss to the Washington Commanders, the Lions had no sacks, and Commanders rookie QB Jayden Daniels finished 22-of-31 passing for 299 yards and two TDs. If the Lions had a player of Garrett\'s caliber, they could have applied much more pressure on Daniels and avoided an early postseason exit.', 'Join the thousands of fans who prove their sports knowledge every afternoon with our exclusive Quiz of the Day Newsletter.
