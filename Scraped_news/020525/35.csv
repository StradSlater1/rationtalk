Nintendo was forced to cut its forecasts for the second quarter in a row; it now predicts that it will sell 11 million Switches in its current fiscal year (which ends on March 31), down from an original estimate of 13.5 million. It also lowered its profit forecast for the year.', 'There’s no mystery to these tumbling numbers. Although Nintendo held back the announcement of the Switch 2 as late as it could, it has been apparent for a long time that the Switch was nearing the end of its life. Eight years is a long lifespan for any video game console, leaks and rumours about the Switch 2 have been rife, and Nintendo’s software support for the Switch has been getting notably thin.', 'Addressing the fall in game sales, Nintendo noted the unfavourable comparison to its previous fiscal year, which encompassed the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros.

Nintendo has now sold 150.86 million Switches — only just shy of the 154 million tally of the Nintendo DS, the second-best-selling gaming device of all time. Even bearing the release of the Switch 2 in mind, the Switch is all but certain to beat that number at some point this year and become Nintendo’s most successful console ever.', 'To become the best-selling console of all time, however, the Switch would have to beat the PlayStation 2’s lifetime sales of over 160 million units.

That’s an impressive number, and yet…that’s still not enough to make it the company’s best selling piece of hardware – a distinction that belongs to the humble Nintendo DS – but it’s getting close.', 'The company released its earnings report earlier this week and the numbers don’t look great. Though hardware sales are down a whopping 30 percentage points compared to 2023, Nintendo has, predictably, taken an optimistic stance. After all, this console is eight years old with the Switch 2 tantalizingly close to launch. And in light of all that, it still sold almost 10 million units. But that impressive 150 million unit total is still a bit short of the massive 154 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its 12-year lifetime. Bolstered by recent games like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and with new games like Metroid Prime 4 and Pokémon Legends: Z-A on the horizon, it’s likely that the Switch will finally overtake the DS this year, making it Nintendo’s best selling console ever.', 'After that, there’s one more boss for the console to beat before it can be called the best-selling console of all time – the 160 million units of the PlayStation 2.', 'A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

However, it doesn't seem like a price drop for the existing Switch models is likely."", ""Sales of the Nintendo Switch console and its games have not been as much as planned, according to the company's latest earnings report, and Nintendo cut its forecast for the original Switch by 1.5 million units, now expecting to sell 11 million Switch consoles. This drop in sales is not surprising since the Switch 2 is set to release this year, but what is surprising is that Nintendo didn't expect a much bigger reduction in sales."", ""The Switch has already sold over 150 million units, making it one of the best-selling consoles ever, nearing the PlayStation 2's total of 160 million. According to a financial call, Nintendo believes that the upcoming release of the Switch 2, set for 2025, is affecting current sales, but the company doesn't think it’s having a huge impact on customers holding off on buying a Switch."", ""Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said the company thinks the Switch is doing well in its eighth year. He also mentioned that the company will keep supporting the original Switch as long as people want it. That means Nintendo likely doesn’t plan to change the price of the original Switch much, even after the Switch 2 comes out. Nintendo rarely cuts prices on any of its hardware or games—Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still priced at $59.99 on the Nintendo website, even though it's a seven year-old port of a nearly 11 year-old Wii U game. Nintendo isn't going to stop making the original Switch if there is still demand, and Nintendo will likely try to get every dollar it can from it. So don't expect a big discount on the console, even if it's part of the previous generation."", ""There's been no word of a Switch 2 Lite, which would be the budget alternative. This might mean the original Switch will likely be pushed as the cheaper option for buyers for now. However, don't expect it to be that much cheaper. Either the Switch will keep its current price tag and the Switch 2 will be more expensive, or the Switch will see a small price reduction."", 'Sources: Insider Gaming, Sankei']"

Here’s how it works.', 'The PS2 might still be the best selling console of all time, but almost eight years after its launch, the Nintendo Switch continues to close the gap, with Nintendo now confirming that it shipped over 150 million units as of the end of last year.', ""To be exact, as of December 31, 2024, a whopping 150.86 million Switch family units had been sold, which is an enormous figure. That accounts for regular ol' Switches, as well as the Switch Lite and OLED models – the latter of which has, unsurprisingly, become the most popular of the three options since financial year 2023. "", ""Sony may be quaking in its boots, as if another 10 million of Nintendo's current-gen consoles are sold, the PS2 may finally be dethroned, even after the company updated its sales figures last year. For many years, it was believed 155 million PS2s had made it out into the world, but last November, Sony said it'd actually sold over 160 million of the things. At the time, Nintendo's most recent figures stated that its hybrid console had hit 146.04 million sales, so it's managed to close the gap a fair bit since then. "", 'Will the Switch ever be able to overtake its 25-year-old competitor, though? Well, that remains to be seen. In its latest financial results, Nintendo says that despite sales being ""stable given the fact that the platform is in its eighth year,"" software and hardware sales are ultimately down year-on-year, with hardware specifically being down ""30.6% year-on-year at 9.54 million units."" Furthermore, it\'s also amended its financial forecast, reducing the number of expected Switch hardware sales from 12.5 million units to 11 million units for the financial year ending at the end of March. ', 'On top of that, while it might not have an exact release date just yet, the Switch 2 is also around the corner. When that launches, it seems less likely that people would be buying its predecessor, but who knows, maybe the 2017 hybrid console will eventually be able to pass that coveted 160 million mark. After all, the chance of Sony updating its PS2 sales yet again seems slim.', 'Indie developer behind the last Wii U and 3DS games says Switch 2 Mario Kart textures are ""extremely telling that this system is significantly more powerful"" than the Switch.', 'Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more', ""I'm one of GamesRadar+'s news writers, who works alongside the rest of the news team to deliver cool gaming stories that we love.
