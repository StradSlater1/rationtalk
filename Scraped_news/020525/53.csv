Nic Dowd sticks around and Alex Ovechkin beats the buzzer as Caps defeat the champs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/02/04/capitals-panthers-alex-ovechkin-nic-dowd/,"['Dowd had the winner before Ovechkin put his 878th goal into an empty net with 0.1 seconds left in a 6-3 win over the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers.', 'Nic Dowd asked Dylan Strome if he should get off the ice.', 'Early in the third period of Tuesday night’s game against the Florida Panthers at Capital One Arena, Dowd — the Washington Capitals’ fourth-line center, not a player typically in the mix during man-advantage situations — was on the ice when the Capitals drew a penalty. Goaltender Logan Thompson skated to the bench for an extra attacker on the delayed penalty call, and as the usual power-play members came over the boards, Dowd thought he should exit.', 'But Strome told him to stay on — and seconds later Dowd capped off a sequence started by Strome and winger Andrew Mangiapane with a backdoor finish at the edge of the crease. The goal, Washington’s fourth, ended up the game-winner as the Capitals beat the defending Stanley Cup champions, 6-3.', '“Typically I try and get off in those situations, six-on-five, and let our power-play guys typically come on for that,” said Dowd, who also had two assists. “[They are] much more apt at probably being in that situation than me. ... I watched Mange make a couple nice plays through the neutral zone and get up the ice. I just drove the net with my stick on the ice, and he found me.”', 'Follow Sports', 'Aliaksei Protas and captain Alex Ovechkin added empty-net tallies in the final two minutes. Ovechkin’s goal, his 25th of the season and the 878th of his career, hit the net with just 0.1 seconds left. It left him 17 goals from breaking Wayne Gretzky’s NHL record of 894.', 'Thompson, starting for the second game in a row, made 30 saves for Washington (35-11-7), which prevailed after back-to-back overtime losses. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 20 shots for the Panthers (32-20-3), whose three-game winning streak was snapped.', '“Really good hockey game against a really good team that I feel like is playing really well,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “[It was] tight the whole way through. We get a lead, which was important, to try to play from in front. Sort of gave it back a couple times on a couple miscues but continued to stay with it. And then the third period, a couple big plays.”', 'Mangiapane gave Washington a 1-0 lead late in the first period, picking a corner over Bobrovsky’s shoulder from a sharp angle for his 11th goal. The Capitals nearly escaped the period with the lead despite a push from the Panthers over the last five-plus minutes, but Sam Bennett scored his 17th goal to tie it at 1 with 30 seconds remaining.', 'Florida went on its first power play just 20 seconds into the second period when defenseman Rasmus Sandin was boxed for tripping. But Washington’s aggressive penalty kill held the Panthers at bay — and Protas and Tom Wilson combined for a shorthanded goal to put the Capitals back in front. As the heavyweights raced up the ice on a two-on-one, Protas delivered a slick feed to Wilson for his 22nd goal.', 'Less than three minutes later, though, the Panthers had another answer. After Thompson stopped Jesper Boqvist on a breakaway earlier, Aleksander Barkov skated in alone and outmuscled defenseman Jakob Chychrun’s last-ditch defending to challenge Thompson one-on-one — and beat the netminder with a backhander.', 'The Capitals came up empty on a power-play opportunity split between the end of the second period and the beginning of the third, but they didn’t need long after that to move back into the lead. Center Lars Eller ended a 10-game goal drought with a solo effort at 2:19. Eller poked the puck away from Panthers defenseman Dmitry Kulikov in the neutral zone and followed it as it slid into the offensive zone. It wasn’t a full breakaway, but Eller didn’t need it to be: He corralled the puck in front of Bobrovsky, made a move to his left and shot it over the goaltender’s outstretched right pad.', '“Had a few breakaways and a lot of good, big chances [lately], so it was good one finally found the back of the net,” Eller said. “A wobbly puck in the neutral zone, I just tried to jump on it and keep it alive. All of a sudden, I was alone with the goalie.”', 'On a delayed penalty a few minutes later, Dowd scored for the first time in 2025 to give Washington its first multi-goal lead. Dowd was knocked into Bobrovsky as he scored, which sparked a scuffle and led to matching roughing penalties on Chychrun and Florida’s Evan Rodrigues.', 'With the teams at four-on-four, forward Matthew Tkachuk brought Florida within a goal again by beating Thompson with a snipe from a sharp angle off the rush. The Capitals defended well from there, and Thompson made a handful of saves to preserve the lead.', '“We’re trying to get better in a way that we’re more consistent and give ourselves an opportunity to be in or leading games at the end of the year, which is when you want to be playing your best hockey,” Dowd said. “To play a really good hockey team tonight [with a] really good goaltender, good special teams and try to tie it all together is how we’re going to continue our success down the stretch.”', 'The Panthers pulled Bobrovsky for an extra attacker with just over two minutes left. Florida put the pressure on, but when Carter Verhaeghe’s stick broke on a one-timer from the top of the zone, Protas was in position to pick up the puck and fire it down the ice into the empty net.', 'When the Panthers pulled Bobrovsky again, Ovechkin had just enough time to get his shot across the line.', '“Automatic,” Eller said with a grin.', 'Longtime Capitals broadcaster Craig Laughlin had open-heart surgery Tuesday morning. Laughlin had announced in January that he would be stepping away from the broadcast booth.', 'The surgery, Laughlin’s broadcast partner, Joe Beninati, said before the game, was successful.', '“It sounds good,” Beninati said on the Monumental Sports Network broadcast. “I just saw a text from his daughter Courtney that said Craig is stable. He’s still under, in terms of anesthesia. I would imagine they won’t bring him out too soon. It’ll take some time there, but they have questioned him, I understand, and he’s responded in his usual feisty manner. All in all, it sounds like things went very well today.”', 'The Laughlin Family Foundation made “Locker Strong” T-shirts that Beninati and the rest of Washington’s broadcast team, on TV and radio, wore ahead of the game.', ""Here's a @Laughlin18 update from @JoeBpXp & @AlanMay_16! 🎙️\n\nWishing him & his family the best in his recovery! #LockerStrong | #ALLCAPS pic.twitter.com/Nd8r2QLPIK"", '']"
