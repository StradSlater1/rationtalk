The Botched App Rollout Cost Sonos Dearly—Now It’s Working On A Video Streamer,https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/02/04/sonos-video-streaming-box/,"['Photo Credit: Ashley Byrd', 'Sonos launched an AirPods Max competitor last year, but you’re forgiven if you missed the news. Even Patrick Spence told shareholders that the app fiasco hampered excitement for the Sonos Ace headphones launch. “[The Ace headphones launch was] overshadowed by the problems that our customers and partners experienced as the result of the rollout of our new app,” Spence said at the time. “We have a clear action plan to address the issues caused by our app as quickly as possible.”', 'The result is the Sonos Arc soundbar and the rumored Sonos video streaming box were delayed so engineers could focus on fixing the app. (The new app still does not have feature parity with the old one, ticking off many long-time Sonos customers on the subreddit.) Bloomberg first reported the existence of a Sonos TV set-top box in November 2023. At the time, the device was rumored to cost between $150 and $200 and offer a way to stream most services.', 'Fast forward a few months and now The Verge is reporting on what that set-top box could look like. An interesting note is that the price from the Bloomberg rumor has nearly doubled—it could cost between $200 and $400 now. That would make it one of the most expensive video streaming setups available from its major competitors (even Apple).', 'What makes it so expensive is that the box will also serve as an HDMI switch with several HDMI ports with passthrough technology. External devices like game consoles, and Blu-ray players can be unified under a single interface, giving Sonos more control over the I/O stack of a person’s entertainment setup. Pinewood is also rumored to support configuring a genuine surround sound system using Sonos’ other speakers—though Sonos has not finalized which speaker arrangements the system will support.', 'Sonos’ new interim CEO Tom Conrad will hold his first call with investors later this week. Prior to his appointment in January, he served as the Chief Technology Officer and EVP of Product at Pandora between 2004 and 2014. Since then, he’s bounced from Snapchat to Quibi before landing at a health-related app company.', 'Share on:', 'You must be logged in to post a comment.', '', '']"
"New info about Sonos' streaming box sounds like a dream product, apart from the 2 horrendous flaws",https://www.techradar.com/televisions/streaming-devices/new-info-about-sonos-streaming-box-sounds-like-a-dream-product-apart-from-the-2-horrendous-flaws,"['HDMI switching and separate surround speakers, but HOW much?', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""Major new information about Sonos' much-rumored set-top streaming box has leaked via The Verge, and as a long-time Sonos user, I was borderline salivating at the promised features here – it sounds like the device I'd be dreaming of when thinking what I'd want a Sonos streaming box to be. In fact, it started sounding too good to be true, and then you get to the pricing and a reminder about the software behind it, and it starts falling apart."", ""Let's start with the great stuff. The box is said to be a small black square when seen from above, slightly thicker than a deck of cards – so quite similar to the Apple TV 4K. It will apparently connect to your TV, and will act as a wireless streaming hub for the best Sonos speakers, meaning that your lovely Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar wouldn't have to be connected to your TV via a cable."", ""We're moving towards the era of wireless soundbars, and I've said before that if Sonos can't find a way to make its soundbars go wireless with big-brand TVs, it's doomed. But, wireless soundbar connectivity is the least interesting part of it."", ""Apparently, Sonos will enable users to do what they've dreamed of for ages and have multiple wireless Sonos speakers in a separate surround configuration, with no soundbar required. The report says that Sonos is finalizing which speakers will be compatible, but basically the idea is that you could have a Sonos Era 300 to the left and right of your TV providing left and right channels as well as Dolby Atmos upfiring channels and you could have the same behind you for a 4.0.4 configuration, as an example."", ""Add a Sonos Sub, and you've got meaty bass; hopefully, you could add something like a Sonos Ray as a center channel, too, because I'm not especially into these 'virtual' center configurations, such as the Sony Bravia Home Theater Quad offers when used with a non-Sony TV."", ""The ability to use Sonos speakers as left and right channels is something that the hardcore users on the r/sonos subreddit ask for basically daily and Sonos has always gently resisted in response. But it sounds like we're moving in that direction, and I would love for this to be as flexible as possible."", '', 'The streaming box, apparently codenamed Pinewood, is also said to offer multiple HDMI ports, which will pass video through to the TV so it acts as an HDMI switch. I love this idea as someone whose TV has only two HDMI 2.1 ports, and one of them is the HDMI eARC port, meaning that a soundbar is eating up my precious 4K 120Hz space.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', ""It's such a clever way for this to stand out over the Apple TV 4K (2022) or Google TV Streamer and it is a genuinely useful and unique feature. You'll get more HDMI ports by using this product, not losing one; it's a great value proposition and solves real problems."", ""The final dream offering is one that I'm far more skeptical about as a claim. Supposedly, the streaming interface will offer a truly unified search, recommendations, and control interface drawn from all the best streaming services, including Netflix."", ""Netflix is a real prickly customer to work with in this regard. It doesn't allow something like Apple's TV app to pull in shows you've been watching and let you pick them back up because it doesn't want you to use another app as your 'home base.' It doesn't like its shows to appear in universal search tools. What it wants is for you to go to Netflix for everything, where it can recommend 100% Netflix shows and movies."", ""Could Sonos be the company that finally persuades Netflix to play nice and not be the sole center of your streaming universe? It doesn't feel likely, but it's possible… for reasons that bring us to the first of the big flaws of this whole affair."", ""According to The Verge's article, the streaming box has a “beautiful” interface design, but the whole thing has been developed with an ad-tech firm. So maybe Sonos has gotten Netflix on board for its fancy interface because it's prepared to give the streamer better data about your habits, and Netflix will compromise in exchange for making more money by showing people better ads."", ""That's just speculation on my part, but something would have to change things for Netflix, and the whole ad element really weighs heavily over the whole project."", ""If the Sonos interface is full of ads, or people feel like it's hoovering up all their data, we've said before that the whole streaming box endeavor feels doomed – and while that was before we knew about the promised authentic wireless surround sound and the HDMI switching, it was also when we thought the price would be $150-$200."", ""Now, let's get to the real problem: the rumored price of $200-$400. This is a category where Apple – Apple! – keeps its offering under $150. And if the software is indeed designed around ads, a super-premium price just isn't going to be accepted."", ""The likes of Google TV and Amazon Fire TV are also designed around ads. Still, the devices they're on are generally very inexpensive, so you actually feel like the ads are subsidizing you getting something for a great value."", 'If the Sonos streaming box comes anywhere near the $400 mark, it will be for a niche audience only when it could be something far more popular.', 'To be fair, adding a load of HDMI ports obviously adds expense and complexity, and apparently, Sonos will include cutting-edge Wi-Fi 7 for the best performance.', ""And I also have to note that the price of four $449 Sonos Era 300 speakers with a $400 streaming box would be $2,200, which is the exact same price as the Sony Bravia Theater Quad, which would be a direct equivalent. So it's not out of line compared to a like-for-like product at all."", 'But it means that only the wealthier hardcore are going to be interested when otherwise, this could be so good for so many people.', ""Here's hoping that Sonos will bring the dream side of things that I want and will find a way to keep the price realistic – because if it can make things work, the best soundbars might be on notice from a Sonos streamer and surround combo."", ""Matt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

Even as work continues to rehabilitate the company’s beleaguered mobile app, Sonos is planning to take a big swing in a new product category: it’s getting into video for the first time.

According to people familiar with its development, Pinewood serves as an HDMI switch and has several HDMI ports with passthrough functionality. You’ll be able to plug external devices like gaming consoles or 4K Blu-ray players into it. Sonos engineers have been frustrated over the years by unpredictable issues between its soundbars and certain TVs. These can include audio sync delays, brief signal dropouts, and other bugs that can prove challenging to reproduce, let alone fix. With Pinewood, Sonos aims to take greater control of the I/O stack.
