Should You Buy Disney Stock While It's Below $120?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/04/should-you-buy-disney-stock-while-its-below-120/,"['', '', '', 'KEY POINTS', 'Shares of Walt Disney (DIS -0.61%) have been trending higher in the past several months. Thanks to improving financial performance and positive market sentiment, the stock has climbed 26% in the last six months. This gain meaningfully outpaces the broader S&P 500.', ""As of this writing, shares still trade 44% off their all-time high, which was achieved in March 2021. Investors might believe the business still deserves a closer look. Should you buy Disney stock while it's below $120?"", ""Between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2021, Disney's segment operating income was cut in half (Disney's fiscal year ends in September). That's certainly a troubling data point that helps explain why shares are still trading at a sizable discount to their record."", ""The company was dealing with a whirlwind of issues. Its historically lucrative cable TV networks are in secular decline due to the rise of streaming video entertainment. Disney did launch direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services, but they were posting massive operating losses in an attempt to scale up. And the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shut down Disney's theme parks and cruise lines."", 'However, the business appears to now be heading in the right direction. Its DTC segment, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, is now generating positive operating income thanks mainly to cost controls. Management expects the division to post a 10% operating margin (excluding ESPN+) in fiscal 2026, which would be substantially better than fiscal 2024.', 'The theme parks and cruise lines, although dealing with softer consumer demand in recent quarters, have bounced back nicely since the pandemic. In fiscal 2024, the segment that also includes consumer products reported 5% year-over-year revenue growth, leading to a 4% gain in operating income. In fact, those two figures were both all-time records.', 'Long-term investors should want to own businesses that possess an economic moat. Having durable competitive advantages helps protect against the threat of competition and new entrants. In essence, the presence of a moat not only indicates a high-quality company, but it also reduces the risk that a business falls by the wayside.', ""In Disney's case, its intellectual property (IP) is undoubtedly what makes up its economic moat. Decades of building stories and franchises and characters have created immense value. Even better, because Disney has so many consumer touch points, it's able to monetize this IP in various ways, whether at the box office, on your home TV, at a theme park, on a cruise, or with consumer products at retail stores."", ""No business on Earth has the breadth and depth of IP that Disney possesses. Even if someone had unlimited capital, it would be impossible to copy what Disney has created. That's definitely a fantastic position to be in and one that will benefit the company for a long time."", 'Even though Disney shares have been volatile in the past 12 months, they have been trending higher since the summer of last year. However, the valuation is still compelling.', 'As of this writing, shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.9. This represents a 6% discount to the overall S&P 500, despite Disney being an above-average company.', ""According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Disney's earnings per share are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.9% between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027. That outlook seems reasonable, but consider that analysts have been revising expectations higher, which could make the current forecast look conservative. Improving bottom-line performance should result in the market becoming more optimistic toward the company, leading to a higher forward P/E ratio."", ""Based on the combination of a positive earnings trajectory and a low starting valuation, Disney almost looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity while it's below $120 per share."", 'Neil Patel and his clients have positions in Walt Disney.

Analysts are expecting earnings per share to come in at $1.46 on revenue of $24.68 billion. This equates to 19.7% and 5.4% year-over-year increases, respectively, according to TipRanks’ data.', '', '', 'This is ideal because earnings per share should grow faster than revenue as this demonstrates a high degree of operating and financial leverage in the business. It’s also worth noting that Disney has beaten earnings estimates for six consecutive quarters.', 'Interestingly, though, Citi, which is led by five-star analyst Jason Bazinet, said in a recent research note that the consensus earnings estimates “look a touch high.” This suggests that the analysts are not very confident in Disney’s ability to beat earnings this time around. Nevertheless, the firm sees an attractive risk-to-reward ratio of $13 worth of downside and $25 in upside potential. As a result, Citi issued a Buy rating with a $125 per share price target.', 'Using TipRanks’ Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report.

Making sure it stays above $100 -- and building on its market-matching 24% gain in 2024 -- will depend on its ability to continue delivering across its media empire."", ""February may be the shortest month of the year, but it doesn't mean that this will be 28 days that investors can spend tapping the snooze bar. Disney has a big earnings report on the way in the week ahead. It also has another huge movie coming out and a promising new piece of animated content coming to Disney+."", ""There's never a dull month when it comes to Disney. Let's take a closer look at February's potentially needle-moving events."", ""Disney's fiscal year ends in September. Most stocks have been posting their fourth-quarter numbers this earnings season, but for Disney, it will report its fiscal first-quarter results on Wednesday."", ""The market isn't expecting much in terms of revenue growth at Disney. Analysts are bracing for a modest 4% step-up on the top line. The year-over-year comparisons for its media networks and theme parks should prove challenging. Wall Street pros have also been paring back their expectations from the 5% increase that they were modeling a month ago.

If it's any consolation, Disney has surpassed Wall Street profit targets consistently over the past year."", ""It's not just the numbers that will move the shares. Disney may update investors on new content releases, including moving movies and TV shows, earlier or later on its calendar. Investors will want to see if Disney is making progress at its theme parks, where growth has stalled in recent reports."", ""There isn't likely any news on the eventual success to CEO Bob Iger. Disney's board expects to announce its next leader in early 2026 before Iger steps down near the end of that year. Even if there is no major news announced in Disney's report and subsequent earnings call, it's going to be the biggest February event for investors to monitor."", ""It's fitting that Disney chose Valentine's Day as the release date of its next Marvel theatrical release. Captain America: Brave New World will hit a multiplex near you on Feb. 14. Moviegoers fell in love with Disney last year. The media giant scored the world's three highest-grossing films that came out during the 2024 calendar year: Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, and Moana 2."", ""It's been nine years since the last stand-alone Captain American movie came out.

It's the first of several potential blockbusters that Disney will be putting out this year."", ""Now that Disney+ is profitable, the power of scalability starts to take the wheel. It can't afford to skimp on new content to retain subscribers, even with its top rival recently hiking its subscription prices."", ""Pixar fans are looking forward to Win or Lose later this month. It will be the first original long-form animation series put out by the computer animation studio that's been turning heads and drawing audiences since 1995's Toy Story redefined the genre."", ""This won't be Pixar's first foray into a long-form animation show. In December, it introduced Dream Productions, based on the Inside Out franchise. The new show doesn't have the same benefit of an established audience, but it's Pixar. It rarely misses when it takes a swing."", ""Win or Lose is about a co-ed middle school softball team looking to win the league's championship.

Its historically lucrative cable TV networks are in secular decline due to the rise of streaming video entertainment.

And the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shut down Disney's theme parks and cruise lines."", 'However, the business appears to now be heading in the right direction.

Decades of building stories and franchises and characters have created immense value. Even better, because Disney has so many consumer touch points, it's able to monetize this IP in various ways, whether at the box office, on your home TV, at a theme park, on a cruise, or with consumer products at retail stores."", ""No business on Earth has the breadth and depth of IP that Disney possesses.

However, the valuation is still compelling.', 'As of this writing, shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.9.

That outlook seems reasonable, but consider that analysts have been revising expectations higher, which could make the current forecast look conservative. Improving bottom-line performance should result in the market becoming more optimistic toward the company, leading to a higher forward P/E ratio."", ""Based on the combination of a positive earnings trajectory and a low starting valuation, Disney almost looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity while it's below $120 per share."", 'Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
