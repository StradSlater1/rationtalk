Morning Boosts Mental Health and Wellbeing,https://www.miragenews.com/morning-boosts-mental-health-and-wellbeing-1403052/,"['Generally, things really do seem better in the morning, with clear patterns across time of day in how we report our mental health and wellbeing, suggest the findings of a large study led by researchers at UCL.', '', 'The findings, published in the open access journal BMJ Mental Health, suggest that people generally wake up feeling in the best frame of mind in the morning but in the worst around midnight, with day of the week and season also playing their part. But the researchers caution that the findings need to be replicated in other studies to be sure they are a true picture.', 'Relatively few studies have looked at how mental health and wellbeing might change over the course of the day, and those that have tended to use small and selective samples, the researchers said.', 'The team therefore wanted to explore whether time of day was associated with variations in mental health (depressive and/or anxiety symptoms), happiness (hedonic wellbeing), life satisfaction, sense of life being worthwhile (eudemonic wellbeing) and loneliness (social wellbeing). They also wanted to find out if these associations varied by day, season, and year.', 'Lead author Dr Feifei Bu, from UCL\'s Department of Behavioural Science & Health, said: ""Our findings suggest that on average, people\'s mental health and wellbeing are better in the morning and worst at midnight. We drew on a large sample of repeated data - nearly a million survey responses from 49,000 participants over two years.', '""However, this pattern could reflect when people choose to respond to the survey, rather than a direct effect of time of day. For example, those already feeling better in the morning might be more likely to engage with the survey at that time.', '""While these findings are intriguing, they need to be replicated in other studies that fully account for this potential bias. If validated, this could have important practical implications. Researchers investigating people\'s mental health and wellbeing should take into account the time of day people respond. Mental health support services might consider adjusting resources to match fluctuating needs across the day-for instance, prioritising late-night availability.""', 'The team analysed longitudinal data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, which began in March 2020, and involved regular monitoring until November 2021, and then additional monitoring up to March 2022.', 'All aspects of mental health and wellbeing were measured via online questionnaires using validated assessment tools or through single direct questions: ""In the past week, how happy did you feel; how satisfied have you been with your life; to what extent have you felt the things you are doing in your life are worthwhile?""', 'Time stamps on completion of each survey provided information on time of day (continuous from 6 am to midnight); day of the week; season; and year (2020, 2021, 2022).', 'Information on other potentially influential factors included age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, employment status, residential area (rural, urban) and diagnosed physical and mental health conditions.', 'Complete information was available for 49,218 people, three quarters of whom (76.5%) were women. People educated to degree level or above were over-represented (68%) while those from ethnic minority backgrounds were under-represented (6%). The sample was therefore weighted to reflect population proportions.', 'Analysis of the data revealed a clear pattern across time of day in self-reported mental health and wellbeing, with people generally waking up in the morning feeling best-lowest depressive/anxiety symptoms and loneliness and highest happiness, life satisfaction, and worthwhile ratings-and feeling worst around midnight.', 'The influence of day of the week was less clear-cut, with more variation in mental health and wellbeing during weekends than on week days.', 'Happiness, life satisfaction, and worthwhile ratings were all slightly higher on Mondays and Fridays than on Sundays, and happiness was also higher on Tuesdays. But there was no evidence that loneliness differed across days of the week.', ""There was clear evidence of a seasonal influence on mood. Compared with winter, people tended to have lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness, and higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction, and feeling that life was worthwhile in other seasons. And mental health was best in the summer across all outcomes. The season didn't affect their associations with time of day, however."", 'Mental health and wellbeing also steadily improved from 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, to 2022.', 'This is an observational study, and as such, cannot establish causality. No information was available for sleep cycles, latitude, or weather, all of which may also have been influential, the researchers said.', 'But the changes in mental health and wellbeing across the day might be explained by the physiological changes associated with the body clock.', 'The researchers wrote: ""For example, cortisol peaks shortly after waking and reaches its lowest levels around bedtime. However, it is important to acknowledge the differences between weekends and weekdays.', '""Given there is little evidence that physiological processes differ across different days of the week, differences might be related to other factors that drive [mental health and wellbeing] changes over the course of the day. This could include contextual factors and sequence of daily activities, which are likely to be different between weekends and weekdays.""']"
New study reveals time of day we’re most happy,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/health/new-study-reveals-time-day-30937817,"['', 'Humans can experience a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the day. Most people would probably agree that our feelings can run high at night.', 'We often tell ourselves, “everything will feel better in the morning,” but is this really true? Now, a new study has shed light on the time of day that we feel our happiest. Early risers may already agree, but mornings are often the time of day people feel their best.', 'The research found that people report the greatest feelings of happiness after they wake up, but typically feel their worst at midnight. The study’s authors wrote: “Generally, things do seem better in the morning.”', 'The research also reinforced the idea of the “winter blues,” with people feeling happier in the summer months than during the winter.', 'In the study, a team of UCL researchers looked at data from nearly 50,000 people which was collected as part of a Covid-19 social study between March 2020 and March 2022.', 'Using questionnaires, the team looked at changes in mental health, such as symptoms of depression and anxiety, happiness, life satisfaction, the sense of life being worthwhile, and loneliness. Factors such as age, health conditions and whether people worked were taken into account.', 'The findings showed that people woke up “feeling best” but, by midnight, they were “feeling worst”. The researchers suspect that these changes could be related to our internal body clock, which releases hormones throughout the day that influence our mood.', '“For example, cortisol (a hormone that regulates mood, motivation and fear) peaks shortly after waking and reaches its lowest levels around bedtime,” the authors said.', 'People also had more varied mental health during weekends while things were steadier during the week. Happiness, life satisfaction, and worthwhile ratings were all higher on Mondays and Fridays than on Sundays, and happiness was also higher on Tuesdays.', 'Dr Feifei Bu, from UCL’s department of behavioural science and health, said: “Our findings suggest that on average, people’s mental health and wellbeing are better in the morning and worse at midnight.', '“However, this pattern could reflect when people choose to respond to the survey, rather than a direct effect of time of day. For example, those already feeling better in the morning might be more likely to engage with the survey at that time.”', 'Dr Bu emphasises that further research is needed to validate the findings of the study, but the results could have “important implications” for mental health treatment.', '“Mental health support services might consider adjusting resources to match fluctuating needs across the day – for instance, prioritising late-night availability,” Dr Bu added.', 'The observational study was published in the journal BMJ Mental Health.', '', '', 'At Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

They were based on questions answered between March 2020 and March 2022, which included, “In the past week, how happy did you feel? How satisfied have you been with your life? To what extent have you felt the things you are doing in your life are worthwhile?”', '“Across a large, diverse sample, we repeatedly saw mornings align with better mental health and well-being and midnight with the lowest—a pattern that held even when accounting for differences in individual characteristics,” says lead author Feifei Bu at the Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London.', 'Happiness, life satisfaction, and sense of life being worthwhile ratings also varied based on day of the week and season, according to the study.', 'Researchers found that people were happiest Sunday mornings, with Saturday coming in at a close second. Life satisfaction and sense of life being worthwhile ratings were also at their highest on weekend mornings. The authors point out that this could be due to socialization and employment patterns. Their findings are supported by previous research, which has linked dips in mental health and well-being during the week to work stress. Another study found that even unemployed people had improved well-being on weekends likely due to increased social time.', 'Researchers also found that anxiety symptoms were lowest on Sundays, which researchers attribute to the “sequence of daily activities,” that vary on weekends versus weekdays.', 'Feelings of satisfaction, that life was worthwhile, and happiness, however, plummeted to their lowest at midnight across all days of the week. Similarly, loneliness, was consistently lower in the morning and higher at night, regardless of the day of the week.', 'Researchers’ suspect that circadian rhythms, which cause cortisol to peak shortly after waking and decrease to its lowest levels around bedtime, play a role. “Cortisol is just an example of how physiological processes may explain why time of day may affect mental health and wellbeing,” Bu tells Fortune. “Many other factors such as environmental factors, patterns of daily activities may also play a role.”', ""It wasn’t just time of day or day of the week that influenced mood—the time of year also impacted respondents' well-being, researchers found."", 'Winter is associated with the highest levels of loneliness and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents had lower levels of loneliness, depression and anxiety symptoms in other seasons, and had higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction, and feeling that life was worthwhile.', 'The researchers hypothesize cold, dry weather in the winter, low levels of sunlight, and even “sociocultural cycles, including cultural holidays, norms, and employment patterns” affect mood in the winter versus non-winter seasons.', 'This likely won’t come as a surprise to people with seasonal affective disorder (also known as SAD), which is a type of depression that can be caused by a drop in serotonin—the hormone that regulates mood—due to less overall daylight in winter. Additionally, the hormone melatonin, released before sleep, is triggered by darkness and can make people feel sleepy earlier, in turn affecting mood and mental health.', 'With this study, the authors are hoping that medical professionals will be better understand when and why mood can fluctuate.', '“Mental health researchers or clinicians should take into account that people’s mental health and wellbeing could be affected by when they are assessed,” Bu says. “Mental health support services may consider adjusting resources to match fluctuating needs across the day—for instance, prioritizing late-night availability.”', 'More on mental health:', 'Workplace well-being is at an all-time low.

We're happiest in the morning and most depressed at midnight,https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/were-at-our-happiest-in-the-morning-and-our-most-depressed-at-midnight,"['Search for stories, experts & multimedia', ""People are likely to be happiest and have lower depression and anxiety symptoms in the morning, according to international research. The team used data from a survey that repeatedly asked nearly 50,000 people how they were feeling over a two year period - looking at the time of day the participants filled their survey out. The researchers say the time of day clearly impacted depression, anxiety and happiness levels, with people likely at their lowest around midnight. People were likely to be in a better mood in summer and a worse one in winter, they add. The researchers say it's possible the time of day the participants were choosing to fill out their surveys could have impacted the results, but it's also possible that there are physiological reasons that our mood shifts with our body clock."", 'Journal/conference: BMJ Mental Health', 'Research: Paper', 'Organisation/s: University College London, UK', 'Generally, things really do seem better in the morning, large study suggests\n\nClear time of day patterns in frame of mind: best early on; worst late at night\n\nGenerally, things really do seem better in the morning, with clear differences in self-reported mental health and wellbeing across the day, suggest the findings of a large study published in the open access journal BMJ Mental Health.\n\nPeople generally wake up feeling in the best frame of mind in the morning but in the worst around midnight, the findings indicate, with day of the week and season of the year also playing their part.\n\nMental health and wellbeing are dynamic in nature, and subject to change over both short and extended periods, note the researchers. But relatively few studies have looked at how these might change over the course of the day, and those studies that have, have included particular, or only small, groups, they add.\n\nThe researchers therefore wanted to explore whether time of day was associated with  variations in mental health (depressive and/or anxiety symptoms), happiness (hedonic wellbeing), life satisfaction, sense of life being worthwhile (eudemonic wellbeing) and loneliness (social wellbeing). They also wanted to find out if these associations varied by day, season, and year.\n\nThey analysed data from the University College London COVID-19 Social Study, which began in March 2020, and involved regular monitoring until November 2021, and then additional monitoring up to March 2022.\n\nAll studied aspects were measured via questionnaires using validated assessment tools or through single direct questions: “In the past week, how happy did you feel; how satisfied have you been with your life; to what extent have you felt the things you are doing in your life are worthwhile?”\n\nTime stamps on completion of each survey provided information on time of day (continuous from 6 am to midnight); day of the week; season; and year (2020, 2021, 2022).\n\nInformation on other potentially influential factors included age groups (18–29, 30–45, 46–59, 60+), gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, employment status, residential area (rural, urban) and diagnosed physical and mental health conditions (yes, no).\n\nComplete information was available for 49, 218 people, three quarters of whom (76.5%) were women. People educated to degree level or above were over represented (68%) while those from ethnic minority backgrounds were under represented (6%). The sample was therefore weighted to reflect population proportions.\n\nAnalysis of the data revealed a clear pattern in self-reported mental health and wellbeing across the day, with people generally waking up in the morning feeling best—lowest depressive/anxiety symptoms and loneliness and highest happiness, life satisfaction, and worthwhile ratings—and feeling worst around midnight.\n\nThe influence of day of the week was less clear-cut, with more variation in mental health and wellbeing during weekends than on week days.\nHappiness, life satisfaction, and worthwhile ratings were all higher on Mondays and Fridays than on Sundays, and happiness was also higher on Tuesdays. But there was no evidence that loneliness differed across days of the week.\n\nThere was clear evidence of a seasonal influence on mood, however. Compared with winter, people tended to have lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness, and higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction, and feeling that life was worthwhile in other seasons.\nAnd mental health was best in the summer across all outcomes. But the season didn’t affect the associations observed across the day, however.\nMental health and wellbeing also steadily improved from 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause. And when people chose to fill in their questionnaires might have influenced the findings, say the researchers. No information was available for sleep cycles, latitude, or weather, all of which may also have been influential, they add.\n\nBut the changes in mental health and wellbeing across the day might be explained by the physiological changes associated with the body clock, they suggest.\n\n“For example, cortisol peaks shortly after waking and reaches its lowest levels around bedtime. However, it is important to acknowledge the differences between weekends and weekdays,” they write.\n\n“Given there is little evidence that physiological processes differ across different days of the week, differences might be related to other factors that drive [mental health and wellbeing] changes over the course of the day. This could include contextual factors and sequence of daily activities, which are likely to be different between weekends and weekdays.”\n\nThe similar time of day patterns in mental health and wellbeing, irrespective of the seasons, is surprising, as one of the main reasons for seasonal changes in frame of mind is the number of daylight hours, say the researchers.\n\n“Other drivers of the seasonal variation in [mental health and wellbeing] could include weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity) as well as various sociocultural cycles, including cultural holidays, norms, and employment patterns,” they suggest.\n\nThe findings have implications for service delivery and clinical assessments, say the researchers. “Finally, in relation to public health, our findings indicate that people’s [mental health  and wellbeing] tends to be lowest around midnight, mid-week, and in winter. This should be considered when planning service and resource provision.”', 'Note: Not all attachments are visible to the general public', 'International', 'Media contact details for this story are only visible to registered journalists.']"

What’s more, stress, autonomy, social support and environmental conditions all have an impact on mood as well, she added.', 'And if you aren’t a morning person, this research doesn’t have to mean you should rearrange your life, Bu said.', '“Your personal experience may vary,” she said. “If you are a night owl who feels (in) top form at midnight, don’t panic.”', 'The-CNN-Wire', '™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Here are 8 simple habits to incorporate into your morning routine to boost your wellbeing, whatever the weather…', '1. Don’t hit snooze', '“When you hit snooze, you disrupt your sleep cycle, which can lead to grogginess,” says E.M. Austen, author of Smarter, 10 Lessons For A More Productive And Less Stressed Life. “Instead, place your alarm out of reach to encourage yourself to get out of bed immediately.', '“You could also set your alarm for the latest possible time you need to rise, allowing yourself to wake up feeling more refreshed. This minor adjustment can transform your mornings and set a more energised tone for the day ahead.”', '2. Do a crossword', '“Crosswords are enjoyable and a relaxing activity, bringing a sense of achievement and goal attainment – boosting our mood and the much-needed neurochemical release for wellbeing,” says Natalie Mackenzie, cognitive rehabilitation therapist.', '3. Try mindfulness', '“Find a quiet space, close your eyes, and spend 5-10 minutes in meditation or mindfulness,” recommends Nicci Roscoe, holistic health and wellbeing practitioner, and author of Micro Meditation: Moments Of Calm For A Happier, Healthier Life. “Focus on your breath or follow a short guided meditation. This is the time to just be present and calm your mind before you dive into the day’s tasks.”', '4. Take a laughter break', '“If you are feeling low, laughter is a brilliant tonic,” says Sarah Campus, personal trainer and founder of holistic wellness platform LDN MUMS FITNESS. “Try listening to a funny podcast as you’re getting ready, sometimes all we need is a good old chuckle to help us feel happier.”', '5. Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast', 'Fuel your body and your mind.', '“I recommend eggs, avocado, seeds, tomato and spinach on rye toast first thing,” advises Chloe Thomas, personal trainer, and nutrition and mindset coach. “If you reach for sugary and starchy cereals you will get a sugar slump and crash later that morning.', '“The cleaner you eat, the better you feel, so take the time to enjoy your food.”', '6. Integrate arts, culture and heritage into morning rituals', '“Starting the day with a cultural ritual, such as listening to music, engaging in mindful sketching or reading poetry, fosters a sense of identity, continuity and joy,” suggests Jody Findlay, founder of Mindseta. “Research has highlighted that engaging with the arts – whether through music, storytelling or creative expression – improves mental and physical health, reducing stress and increasing emotional resilience.”', '7. Have a little morning dance', '“Dance is amazing as a form of cardio, but it’s also brilliant to raise the endorphins and serotonin that make us happy,” says Dominika Blonska, personal trainer and founder of Define By Dom. “Pop on tunes that make you feel happy and dance like no one is watching.', '“The more you can shake the stagnancy out of your body, the more the happy hormones will flow. You do not have to be any good, don’t overthink it… just move!”', '8. Smile in the mirror', 'So simple, yet so effective.', '“Did you know that smiling can trick your brain into happiness? The act of smiling activates pathways in your brain that influence your emotional state,” says Alison Goolnik, an integrative psychotherapist at Therapy Here. “So, try smiling at yourself in the mirror, smile at your colleagues and family and see how it makes you feel.”', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '@2025 The Irish News Ltd', 'Actively scan device characteristics for identification.

Using data from 49,218 adults, researchers looked at whether time of day, season or year was associated with variations in mental health (i.e., depressive and/or anxiety symptoms), life satisfaction, a sense of life being worthwhile and loneliness. They found that:', '', '', 'People generally feel in the best frame of mind in the morning, and feel the worst around midnight.', 'There’s “some inconsistent evidence” that the day of the week is associated with mental health and well-being.', 'Mental health is overall best in the summer. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and feelings of loneliness are highest, and happiness levels and life satisfaction levels are lowest in the winter.', 'The study authors write that the changes in mental health and well-being throughout the day could be explained by the physiological changes associated with the body’s biological clock — for example, cortisol peaking shortly after waking and reaching its lowest levels at night.', '“We repeatedly saw mornings align with better mental health and well-being, and midnight with the lowest — a pattern that held even when accounting for variations in individual characteristics,” Feifei Bu, lead author of the study and a research fellow at University College London, tells Yahoo Life.', 'While Bu says the COVID-19 pandemic “undoubtedly shaped many aspects of daily life, and its toll on mental health is well-documented,” those conditions were carefully factored into the analysis of the data.', '“It is reassuring that our findings match pre-pandemic studies on mood cycles,” she says. “This suggests that the time-of-day association may be more than just a special case of the COVID-19 pandemic.”', 'Still, Bu acknowledges that further research in non-crisis settings and in other countries is needed.', 'Bu says the knowledge that people’s mental health and well-being can fluctuate throughout the day may have important implications for future research, as well as for mental health support and services.', 'But she also warns that the study’s results should not be expected to explain specific individual circumstances.', '“On average, people do seem to feel best in the morning and worst late at night,” Bu says. “But our analyses also revealed how much individuals can vary around the overall trend. What’s true for the group is not always true for every individual.”', 'Chloe Carmichael, a clinical psychologist and author of Nervous Energy: Harness the Power of Your Anxiety, tells Yahoo Life that the study’s findings align with what she often sees in her professional work. That said, there’s certainly some variety.', ""“For many people, mornings are generally best — we're fresh and at least somewhat rested,” Carmichael says. “However, of course, there are people who absolutely ‘don't do mornings,’ but they get very creative, social or focused in the evenings.”"", 'Experts say it helps to get to know your own mental health peaks and valleys — and to prepare accordingly. Here’s what they suggest.', 'Get to know your daily and seasonal mood rhythms. Carmichael says that many people are intuitively aware of their own daily and seasonal mood patterns. But if you need help determining them, you can make a point to observe yourself with that issue in mind. “For many people, just being intentional about noticing your patterns is very helpful,” she says. “If you need more help, make a list of recent ups and downs. Do you notice any patterns?”', 'Anticipate when you’re likely to feel down — and plan accordingly. We can experience “anticipatory anxiety” when we know something stressful is on the horizon, Carmichael says. “Autumn blues,” for example, can precede the winter blues for many people. Kirk Schneider, a psychologist and author of Life-Enhancing Anxiety: Key to a Sane World, tells Yahoo Life that in his own work, he has noticed that ""anniversary reactions"" — like dates of significant losses, deaths or trauma — are particularly difficult for people to deal with, and knowing that can help you cope. “Anticipating anniversary reactions, holidays and periods like dark winter days can help people to prepare themselves and others for potential stress and thereby assist them to make more informed choices about what they take on or whom they engage,” Schneider says.', 'Prepare and make adjustments as needed. According to Carmichael, identifying your mood rhythms can be helpful on the practical level of self-care, and also give you a sense of control. “If an obligation arises that forces you out of your comfort zone, prepare as best you can,” Carmichael says. “For example, consider a short afternoon nap if you are an ‘Early to bed, early to rise’ type but you must attend an evening meeting.”', 'Take some time to check in with yourself. Schneider says that “Pause, reflect and respond” can be a helpful mantra when you feel a challenging mental state coming on. “Such a process may also lead one to contact a friend, engage in mindful meditation, take a walk or, if necessary, contact a therapist,” he explains. “Any of these activities can help us to gain a new perspective on our anguish, so that we begin to see more options than just our sadness, anger or fear.”', 'Share your mood rhythms with others. Try what psychologists call ""narrating your experience,"" which Carmichael says just means letting others know if you recognize that factors such as time or season are affecting your mood or mental state. This, she adds, is a much better alternative than bailing on someone because you’re feeling out of sorts. Carmichael explains: “Most people can be sympathetic if you say, ‘I\'m sorry, this is a lot for me to digest right now. I\'ll be much fresher in the morning, and I\'d like to give this the attention it deserves. Could we plan to talk at 9 a.m.?\'""']"

So far, however, there has been insufficient research into how these values change throughout the day.', ""Feifei Bu, Jessica Bone and Daisy Fancourt have now analyzed data from University College's Covid-19 Social Study, which began in March 2020 and ran for up to two years. As part of this study, participants regularly completed questionnaires and also indicated the time of day, day of the week and season."", 'They were asked questions such as ""How happy did you feel in the past week?"", ""How satisfied were you with your life?"" and ""To what extent did you find the things you do in your life meaningful?""', ""The researchers also recorded the participants' age and gender, ethnicity, level of education, employment status, place of residence and physical or mental illness. In total, they had data from 49,218 people, of which women (76.5 percent) and people with a higher level of education (68 percent) were overrepresented. The sample was therefore weighted to reflect the population proportions."", 'When analyzing the data, the researchers were able to identify a time-of-day pattern. In general, the answers showed greater well-being in the morning and at the same time the fewest symptoms of anxiety, depression or loneliness. The indications of happiness, life satisfaction and fulfillment also tended to be clearest at this time of day. Conversely, these indicators tended to be most negative around midnight.', 'However, not only the time of day, but also the day of the week seems to play a role, albeit a rather small one. The researchers observed that happiness, life satisfaction and self-esteem were slightly more pronounced on Mondays and Fridays than on Sundays. However, the indications of perceived loneliness appeared to be independent of the respective day of the week. And: mental health and well-being varied more at weekends than during the week.', 'The influence of the season was unsurprising: compared to winter, people in the other seasons tended to have lower levels of loneliness and fewer symptoms of anxiety or depression. At the same time, the values for happiness, life satisfaction and the feeling of a life worth living were higher in these seasons. The diurnal patterns, on the other hand, were similar across all seasons.', 'As Bu, Bone and Fancourt themselves admit, this is a purely observational study that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the causes of the patterns described. In addition, the choice of time at which the participants completed the questionnaires could have influenced the results. Sleep cycles, latitude or the weather could also have had an effect - but the researchers had no information on these factors.', 'The authors speculate that the diurnal patterns could be explained by physiological changes related to the body clock. For example, the level of the stress hormone cortisol peaks shortly after waking up and lows around bedtime, they write.
