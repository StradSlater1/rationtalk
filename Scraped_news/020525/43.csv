Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer sued over sexual abuse allegations,https://www.avclub.com/neil-gaiman-amanda-palmer-lawsuit,"['Scarlett Pavlovich, who last month accused Neil Gaiman of a litany of disturbing sexual crimes, has filed suit against Gaiman and his estranged wife, Amanda Palmer. Made public earlier today, the suit accuses Gaiman of sexual abuse and Palmer of being aware of his “decades-long history of sexual misconduct” and failing to protect Pavlovich from him. Per the briefing, Palmer facilitated Pavlovich’s relationship with Gaiman and, therefore, she is suing both under the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, which gives victims international protection against human trafficking.', 'Pavlovich’s allegations were reported in a bombshell New York Magazine report detailing how the then-22-year-old Pavlovich met Palmer in 2020. Pavlovich was homeless at the time and estranged from her family. After meeting Palmer, whom she was a fan of, Pavlovich was hired as a nanny for Gaiman and Palmer’s children. After being hired, she was allegedly raped by Gaiman, and when Pavlovich alerted Palmer to his behavior, she replied, “I bet he did.”', '', 'The suit claims that both she and Gaiman “knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, and/or obtained Scarlett for labor or services while knowing she would be forced to engage in sexual acts as a condition of receiving the pay and housing they promised her.” The suit also states that Gaiman “intended to coerce sexual services and free childcare” from Pavolvich under threat that “if she did not perform such labor and services, she would suffer serious harm or physical restraint.” Pavlovich claims Palmer was aware of the hardships in her life, including that she was raped by a 45-year-old man when she was 15. Therefore, Palmer “recklessly disregarded” that she could become one of Gaiman’s victims.', 'Gaiman is being sued in Wisconsin, where he owns a home. Pavlovich sued Palmer in New York and Massachusetts, where she claims residency and will “proceed against Palmer only in the district of her choosing.” The suit argues that Pavlovch is entitled to damages for past and future physical, mental, and economic harm. The amount will be determined at trial, but the complaint says it is “reasonably believed to be in excess of $1,000,000.”', '', 'Correction: The headline of this article has been updated.', '', 'GET A.V.CLUB RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Pop culture obsessives writing for the pop culture obsessed.', '', 'Sign Up', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 Paste Media Group.

The author has a “decades-long history of sexual misconduct” as alleged by several women, many of whom have signed non-disclosure agreements, the complaint says.', 'More from The Hollywood Reporter', ""How Emilia Pérez Is Being Removed from the 'Emilia Pérez' Oscar Campaign"", ""Bain's Advice for Hollywood This Year: Own IP or Own Nothing"", 'Juliette Binoche to Head 2025 Cannes Jury', 'The filing of the lawsuit comes in the wake of Dark Horse Comics announcing last month that it would no longer publish adaptations of Gaiman’s works after New York magazine published a cover story detailing his alleged history of sex crimes based on interviews with eight women.', 'Gaiman has maintained that the sexual encounters were consensual. “Some of the horrible stories now being told simply never happened, while others have been so distorted from what actually took place that they bear no relationship to reality,” he wrote last month on his blog.', 'The lawsuit details violent assaults by Gaiman, starting in 2022 when his wife Amanda Palmer asked Pavlovich to babysit their child at their New Zealand home, according to the complaint. When Pavlovich arrived, Gaiman insisted that she take a bath while he made a call for work. Shortly after, the lawsuit says, Gaiman undressed himself and started to bathe with her.', '“Gaiman then penetrated Scarlett’s rectum with his fingers,” the complaint states.

Pavlovich, who was hospitalized after a mental health crisis caused by the alleged assaults, was later denied re-entry into the couple’s home.', 'Throughout her employment as a live-in nanny, Pavlovich alleges she wasn’t paid and was left with no choice to stay because she had no other residence or job opportunity. “Gaiman and Palmer intended to have Scarlett trapped, vulnerable, and penniless,” the lawsuit says, “because that would leave her without a real chance to defend herself or escape.”', 'Pavlovich says she filed a police report accusing Gaiman of sexual assault, which was dropped after Palmer refused to cooperate with law enforcement, according to the complaint.', 'The complaint alleges that Palmer, who’s named in the complaint, has been aware of her husband’s sexual misconduct since at least 2015. They separated in 2020 and have been locked in a divorce and custody battle.', 'Upcoming Gaiman book-to-screen adaptations include The Sandman season two at Netflix, the Amazon miniseries Anansi Boys, and the concluding 90-minute episode of Good Omens, also at Amazon.

IS NEIL GAIMAN'S LEGACY IN JEOPARDY AFTER RECENT ALLEGATIONS?,https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2025/01/is-neil-gaimans-legacy-in-jeopardy-after-recent-allegations/,"['Neil Gaiman, one of the most influential authors of the modern era, has captivated millions with his imaginative storytelling across multiple mediums, from novels to comics, to film and television. His knack for blending the surreal and the fantastical with deeply human themes has earned him a devoted following worldwide. But recently, Gaiman has found himself at the centre of controversy after allegations of sexual misconduct emerged, leading to the cancellation of his highly anticipated musical adaptation of Coraline. So, who is Neil Gaiman, and how have these allegations affected his career?', 'Neil Gaiman is best known for his rich, genre-defying works, most notably American Gods, Coraline, and The Sandman. His novels and stories are often rooted in myth, folklore, and fantasy, drawing from his deep love of classic literature and the works of writers like J.R.R. Tolkien and Edgar Allan Poe.', 'His breakout work, The Sandman comic series, has become a cornerstone of modern graphic novels, blending elements of horror, fantasy, and Shakespearean drama. American Gods, a novel that explores the clash between old and new gods in contemporary America, has become a cult classic, earning multiple awards and inspiring a hit TV series.', ""However, it's his 2002 dark fantasy novel Coraline that has arguably cemented his place as a master of children's literature. Although Coraline was originally considered too frightening for children, the book went on to become a beloved classic, winning numerous literary awards including the Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker Awards. The success of Coraline led to a 2009 animated film adaptation, which earned a BAFTA and an Academy Award nomination."", 'Gaiman’s rise to fame is largely attributed to his ability to blend genres and appeal to both young readers and adults. His early career as a journalist helped him hone his writing style, but it was his work in comics that truly set him apart. His series The Sandman revolutionised the comic book world, pushing the boundaries of what comics could achieve as a literary form. With his mix of mythological references, gothic horror, and philosophical undertones, Gaiman’s writing quickly transcended the comic book world, reaching a wider audience of literature enthusiasts.', ""Gaiman’s ability to adapt his work into various formats also played a major role in his popularity. From Coraline to Stardust, Gaiman’s stories have been successfully adapted into movies, TV shows, and even stage productions. His foray into television writing, including his critically acclaimed episode of Doctor Who titled The Doctor's Wife, further solidified his status as a multi-talented creator."", 'Gaiman’s use of social media has also played a role in his rise to fame. By connecting directly with his audience through his blog and Twitter account (@neilhimself), Gaiman has been able to build a dedicated fanbase. His blog, which has attracted millions of readers, and his large Twitter following demonstrate the close relationship he maintains with his fans, allowing them to engage with him on a personal level.', ""As of 2025, Neil Gaiman's net worth is estimated to be around $50 million, although some sources place this figure higher. His wealth comes not only from his prolific output as a writer but also from the royalties he receives from the adaptation of his works into film, television, and stage productions. American Gods alone has been adapted into a successful TV series, while Coraline remains one of the most beloved animated films of the 2000s."", 'Beyond his writing, Gaiman has been a savvy investor, capitalising on his intellectual property and continuing to build his financial portfolio. His work as an executive producer and his continued involvement in Hollywood adaptations has also contributed significantly to his wealth.', 'Related: The Most Influential Film Directors of All Time: Icons Who Changed Cinema Forever', 'Gaiman’s career recently faced a significant setback due to allegations of sexual misconduct that surfaced in January 2024. These allegations, made by eight women, have caused a stir in the literary and entertainment worlds. Gaiman has vehemently denied the claims, stating that he has “never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone” and expressing his shock at the allegations.', ""The controversy surrounding these accusations has led to the cancellation of his highly anticipated Coraline musical, a major production set to take place in multiple UK theatres. The theatres involved, including Leeds Playhouse and Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre, announced that they could no longer proceed with the show in light of the allegations. They cited the difficulties of moving forward in the context of the allegations and the negative impact they could have on the production’s reception. The Coraline musical was expected to be a major draw for these venues, so the cancellation has left a gap in their programming."", ""Gaiman's recent brush with scandal has raised questions about how allegations can impact even the most successful creators. While Gaiman continues to deny any wrongdoing, the repercussions of the accusations may haunt his reputation for some time. It remains to be seen how this controversy will affect his future projects and relationships within the industry."", 'Despite the current controversy, Neil Gaiman’s legacy remains firmly intact. He has transformed the worlds of literature, comics, and film, becoming a household name in the process. His works continue to inspire and captivate readers, with The Sandman and American Gods still regarded as pillars of modern fantasy. His deep, compelling storytelling has earned him a place among the most influential authors of the 21st century.', 'However, the recent allegations may lead to a shift in how Gaiman is perceived by both his fans and the industry. While he remains one of the most celebrated writers of his generation, the coming months may prove to be a pivotal moment in his career, as he attempts to navigate the fallout from the accusations and continue his creative pursuits.', '']"

According to the lawsuits, Pavlovich was homeless when she met Palmer in Auckland in 2020, the Associated Press reports. She was invited to their home, where she began assisting with errands and childcare, eventually becoming their full-time nanny. The alleged assaults began in February 2022 and continued until Pavlovich threatened suicide, prompting her departure.
