Just over half of cases (52.4 percent) occurred among men aged 55 to 69 years, while 39.7 percent occurred among men aged 70 years and older. The distribution of cases by race and ethnicity included 0.3 percent in men identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native, 8.1 percent among Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander men, 17.2 percent among Hispanic or Latino men, 9.5 percent among non-Hispanic Black men, and 61.5 percent among non-Hispanic White men. From 2011 to 2021, the incidence of distant prostate cancer increased 6.7 percent annually. Increases in the incidence of distant prostate cancer by approximately 6 percent or more per year were seen in nine of the 10 California regions. From 2004 to 2012, prostate cancer mortality rates declined 2.6 percent per year but then plateaued between 2012 and 2021 across ages, races and ethnicities, and regions.', '“Efforts to develop and implement evidence-based risk-stratified prostate-specific antigen screening are urgently needed to stop the rapid rise in distant-stage prostate cancer and prevent the anticipated subsequent rise in prostate cancer mortality,” the authors write.', 'One author disclosed ties to the pharmaceutical industry.', 'Abstract/Full Text', 'Copyright © 2025 HealthDay.
