But the revelation of Gascón’s incendiary past positions has thrown her campaign into disarray, and sent Netflix, the film’s distributor, scrambling to contain the fallout.', 'Screenshots of since-deleted tweets continued to circulate on Friday after the deactivation of Gascón’s account, including a post in which the actress invoked Hitler — never a great idea on social media — to make a point about about racial and gender inequality.', '“I have defended each and every one of the minorities in this world and supported any event against racism, freedom of religion or homophobia, in the same way that I have criticized the hypocrisy that underlies them, because the first thing I am self-critical of is myself,” Gascón writes.', '', 'In her statement, Gascón apologizes for “erroneous” past opinions, chalking them up in part to the toxicity of social media.

The disturbing tweets — and messy apology tour — blowing up Emilia Pérez’s Oscars campaign,https://www.vox.com/culture/397810/emilia-perez-karla-sofia-gascon-oscars-netflix,"['When news breaks, you need to understand what matters — and what to do about it. At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can’t do it on our own.', 'We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Karla Sofía Gascón made history as an openly trans Oscar nominee. Now she’s apologizing for hateful posts.', 'by Kyndall Cunningham', 'Since its arrival on Netflix in December, the Spanish-language French film Emilia Pérez has been a nesting doll of controversies. The musical, directed by Jacques Audiard, has been slammed by critics and on social media for its regressive portrayal of trans identity. The film has also been critiqued for its “Eurocentric” depiction of Mexico — even inspiring a viral spoof film made by Mexican filmmakers, called Johanne Sacreblu — and Audiard himself has made dismissive if not offensive comments about Mexico and the Spanish language. Meanwhile, earlier this week, the movie’s Oscar lead actress, Karla Sofía Gascón, was most notable for being at war with “Brazilian Twitter” for comments she made about her Best Actress rival Fernanda Torres’s social media team.', 'Despite all this, Emilia Pérez is up for 13 Oscar nominations and is predicted to pick up at least one for Zoe Saldaña in the Best Supporting Actress category. Gascón’s Oscar hopes are likely done, however, following a series of offensive, resurfaced tweets in what might be one of the most surprising scandals in Oscars history.', 'On Wednesday, after Gascón was already in the news for her comments about Torres, X users began circulating years-old tweets from the Spanish actress using derogatory language aimed at marginalized communities. The tweets, from as recent as 2021, include disturbing remarks about George Floyd, Islam, and even the nonwhite winners of the 2021 Oscars ceremony. Other tweets find her casually using anti-gay and other hateful language.', 'The Oscars aren’t unfamiliar with controversy. However, the mounting issues corroding the Emilia Pérez Oscar campaign are pretty extraordinary — and even make the controversy surrounding 2019 Best Picture Green Book look quaint in comparison. In the days since her old tweets were exposed, Gascón has arguably dug herself (and the film) into a deeper hole, giving insufficient apologies and even implying that her calling-out is some sort of conspiracy. Likewise, it’s an ironic but extremely familiar trajectory for a movie that has been bolstered by the Hollywood establishment for its diversity and “progressive” themes.', 'On Thursday, journalist Sarah Hagi posted a thread with screenshots of more than a dozen tweets from Gascón (in her native Spanish) disparaging Islam and immigrants from the Arabic countries. In one tweet posted on July 2, 2016, and translated by Vox editor Izzie Ramirez, she says, “Islam is becoming an infection for humanity that needs to be cured urgently.” In another tweet from September 2, 2020, Gascón, who is from Spain, posted a photo of a Muslim family, including a woman wearing a burka, in a restaurant, mocking the role of women in Islam. In the tweet, she sarcastically decried the wearing of burkhas and what she perceives as the lack of respect for women in Islam, capping it off with a phrase that translates to “the deepest revulsion of humanity.”', 'In other posts, she points out the rising number of Muslims in Spain, lamenting that schools will start to teach Arabic instead of English. She blames Islam for several terrorist attacks. There are also multiple tweets where she a European slur referring to Muslims or people with dark skin.', 'Users then began circulating a startling now-deleted thread she apparently posted on June 8, 2020, about Floyd, whose death by a police officer ignited worldwide Black Lives Matter protests. In the first post, a user with Gascón’s name says, “Let me see if I understand, a guy tried to pass off a counterfeit bill after taking meth, an idiot cop arrives, and goes too far in arresting him and kills him, ruining the lives of his family and friends, and then then guy with the bill turns into a heroic marytr.” In another statement in the thread, the user refers to Floyd as a “drug addict and a hustler.”', 'The X account also exposed other unsavory comments, like a joke about China and Covid-19, and casual use of hateful language. A post about the 2021 Oscars ceremonies, read, “More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films. I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M [feminist strike],” referring to an International Women’s Day march, which takes place on March 8. Users also found a bizarre post where she refers to paparazzi photos of Miley Cyrus cozying up with a woman as “lesbian perversion.” This post might be seen as particularly baffling, as Gascón is herself a trans woman who is married to another woman.', 'Gascón’s X account has since been deleted, although screenshots of her comments still abound online. On Friday, she also gave a terse apology to Variety: “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt. As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well, and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life, I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.”', 'She had previously sent a more defiant exclusive statement to the Hollywood Reporter, explaining why she deleted her account. In that statement, she called the backlash a “campaign of hate and misinformation,” while implying that the opinions she stated have changed:', '“As part of this society, I have expressed my disagreement or agreement with all the related issues that have touched me and of which I have had an opinion, often erroneous, which has changed throughout my own experience. I have always used my social media as a diary, reflections or notes, to later create stories or characters, not as something that would be scrutinized down to the last of its 140 characters, since sometimes I, myself, am not even aware of having written something negative.”', 'On February 3, she addressed the controversy on Instagram in a statement that partly reads: “They have already won. They have achieved their objective, to stain my existence with lies or things taken out of context.” Later that evening, she appeared on CNN en Español where she sat down for a tear-filled, hour-long interview to clarify the context of her tweets and claimed that they aren’t representative of her character. She also alluded to a possible smear campaign, pointing out the timing of the resurfaced tweets during the Oscars voting period, which ends on February 18.', '“They put them all together so it seems that she is a very bad person, and we remove her just when we can do the most damage right in the voting period,” she told anchor Juan Carlos Arciniegas. She also said a post credited to her where she calls her Emilia Pérez co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat” was fabricated. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Gascón set up the interview independently “without the involvement of anyone working on the film,” including its distributor, Netflix.', 'So far, Saldaña is Gascón’s only co-star to address her resurfaced posts. At an Emilia Pérez Q&A in London on January 31, where Gascon was expected to appear but pulled out, Saldaña said she was “still processing” Gascón’s remarks. “It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it],” she said. “And I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric toward people of any group. I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural, and gender equity. And it just saddens me.”', 'For decades, the sabotaged Oscars campaign has been a fascinating — and typically amusing — phenomenon of awards season. Outside of Gascón’s antics, this year alone has seen several other controversies threaten the chances of certain Oscar hopefuls. Last week, the editor of 10-time Oscar nominee The Brutalist, Dávid Jancsó, revealed that he utilized AI to perfect Adrien Brody’s Hungarian speech in a brief part of the film. This led to questions about whether Brody’s performance, which has already earned him a Golden Globe, should be re-evaluated.', 'Meanwhile, in the midst of Gascón’s controversy, social media users found an article that her rival Torres had written slamming Amber Heard during her 2023 defamation trial against her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as well as a resurfaced video of Torres appearing in blackface in comedy sketch on a Brazilian TV show, for which she apologized earlier this week.', 'Other times, these flubbed campaigns have often emerged from aggressive PR measures, from the Bette Davis infamous write-in campaign to the supposed “overkill” of Diana Ross’s Best Actress campaign ads for Lady Sings the Blues to Melissa Leo’s self-funded “Consider…” plea — although she ultimately went on to receive her Oscar. This sort of zealous campaign was famously codified by former film producer Harvey Weinstein. Before Gascón’s scandal, the mantle for the most controversial recent Best Actress nominee belonged to Andrea Riseborough, who caused a huge kerfuffle when she received a surprising nod in 2023 for the small Sundance film To Leslie, due to sudden endorsements by celebrities and a dubious email sent to voters. The last-minute but shockingly efficient campaign ultimately didn’t go against the Academy’s lobbying rules, but it did put a mark on the actress leading up to the awards show.', 'In general, though, it’s much more rare that a contender’s Oscars chances have been tainted if not completely shattered due to hate speech — the most recent example being Lars von Trier’s antisemitic comments during a press conference for his 2011 film Melancholia. Still, Gascón’s controversy presents a more complex and head-scratching case, given that Gascón is the first openly trans acting nominee. Despite how groundbreaking her nomination is on paper, her hateful comments on social media blot out any perception that her nomination is a win for progress. Awards forecaster Scott Feinberg also claimed that Gascón’s tweets have “severely damaged the Oscar prospects of her film,” outside of the Best Actress category. “Based on my conversations in recent days with Academy members, many are going to have a hard time voting for Emilia Pérez in any category, given that Emilia Pérez herself has become toxic,” said the Hollywood Reporter journalist.', 'Her controversial comments also present a legitimate conundrum for the ceremony. Folks are already wondering how she’ll be included in the Best Actress presentation. The Academy recently announced that it would be bringing back the “Fab 5” format, where previous acting winners give a heartfelt introduction to each of the nominees. There’s also always the possibility for more vocal backlash and even boycotts from the groups she targeted.', 'Overall, Gascón’s remarks have only continued to illuminate the shallowness of Emilia Pérez as a project and a “progressive” pick for the Academy. Following her scandal, folks have openly questioned why a European woman was cast in the role of a Mexican character, and recirculated comments about Audiard professing his own ignorance about Mexico. They’ve also affected any remaining amount of goodwill that the movie had going for it, including a powerful statement Gascón made at the Golden Globes earlier in January, when the film won Best Picture — Musical or Comedy.', '“The light always wins over darkness,” she said. “You can put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you can never take away our soul or our resistance or our identity. I want to say to you, raise your voice and say that I won, I am who I am, not who you want [me to be].” Who knew that, a few weeks later, it’d be recycled for an apology?', 'Update, February 3, 10:50 am ET: This story was originally published on January 31, 2025, and has been updated several times, most recently to include Karla Sofía Gascón’s CNN en Español interview, her Instagram post, and Zoe Saldaña’s response.', 'Correction, February 3, 1:30 pm ET: An earlier version of this story misstated when Karla Sofía Gascón posted on Instagram and appeared on CNN en Español.

Ryan also liked “Rebuilding,” starring Josh O’Connor, which also features a destructive fire, and “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” starring Rose Byrne as a stressed-out mom. “A horror movie of motherhood,” he said.', 'The highest profile sales title was Bill Condon’s expensive Kander and Ebb musical adaptation of Manuel Puig’s novel “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” The film stars Diego Luna and breakout star Tonatiuh as prisoners sharing a cell in 1983 Argentina, with Jennifer Lopez leading the musical fantasy sequences as a fictional screen siren. Héctor Babenco’s 1985 Oscar-winning original cost $1.5 million. (The new movie’s reps say this one’s budget is far below $50 million.) Condon’s song-and-dance take could be a tough sell. We wonder if it’s too old-fashioned to land with today’s audiences.', 'One reason for late-breaking buys could be due to fewer screening venues, requiring Sundance to spread the program out over more days. Some buzzy titles like “Sorry, Baby” debuted after the first weekend.', '', 'To that end, we both adored “Train Dreams” and U.S. Dramatic Competition Screenwriting winner “Sorry, Baby,” marking an auspicious debut for writer/director/actor Eva Victor, who has made a comedy splash on TikTok.  Naomi Ackie costars in this well-observed academic drama about the repercussions of a “bad thing.”', 'Anne also focused on the documentaries, because Sundance always delivers three or four Oscar contenders at year’s end. Sundance 2024 premieres now up for Oscars include “Black Box Diaries,” “Sugarcane,” “Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat,” and “Porcelain War.” We both admired “The Jinx” director Andrew Jarecki’s shocking prison expose “The Alabama Solution,” which incorporates inmates’ own phone videos to detail terrible conditions within the state’s correctional facilities; “Perfect Neighbor,” which edited police tapes into a powerful narrative about a Florida manslaughter; and “Folktales,” Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s heartwarming story of a program that teaches young people dogsledding in the Arctic. Anne liked “Prime Minister,” about New Zealand’s COVID-fighter Jacinda Ardern. “Perfect Neighbor” and “Prime Minister” both won Sundance prizes Friday.', 'In other Sundance-related news, Quentin Tarantino gave a festival talk where he explained setting aside his supposed final film, “The Movie Critic,” and how he likely won’t tackle a new film anytime soon, partly because the movie business, he said, died in 2019. He’s going to try theater, where the audience is in the palm of the writer’s hand. Then, if it’s a hit, he might make that into a movie. “He is under so much pressure about that tenth film,” Anne said. “He sees that the old universe that used to guarantee that a certain kind of movie would do well no longer exists. He doesn’t want to go out on his last film a failure.”', '', 'Is the movie business dead? “It was a muted Sundance,” Ryan said. “We can’t take the temperature of that broader question by Sundance alone… but so many movies are going to languish and die here.”', 'Listen to the episode below or watch in the video above.', '', '', 'Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.

However, her likelihood of winning the coveted award now appears to be in doubt. ', 'So, what happened and where did things go wrong?', 'Subscribe to our newsletter for a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy.', 'Here’s a brief summary… ', 'Emilia Perez, a Spanish-language musical crime drama from French director Jacques Audiard, won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year and was subsequently snapped up by Netflix.', 'The film centers on a Mexican cartel leader (Gascón) who enlists a lawyer (Zoe Saldaña) to help her disappear so that she may transition into a woman. Selena Gomez also co-stars.', 'Netflix released the movie in mid-November. It earned generally favorable reviews from critics. Though not everyone who saw the film was a fan.', 'Amongst the plaudits, there were more than a few naysayers. Some queer advocates expressed frustration with a movie in which a trans person’s surgery played a central role. GLAAD called it “a step backward for trans representation.” ', 'In Mexico (where Gascón was a regular on telenovelas before her transition in 2018), many have expressed anger that the violence of drug cartels acts as the backdrop for a musical fantasy. ', 'Despite this, the movie has continued to win praise. It won “Best Musical or Comedy” at the Golden Globes last month, and followed this up with a whopping 13 Oscar nominations, which is the most ever for a foreign-language movie. ', 'Further controversy erupted last Thursday when old tweets Gascón wrote resurfaced online. ', 'In 2020, around a week after the murder of George Floyd, she posted a thread of her thoughts.', '“I truly believe that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict and a hustler, but his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider Black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong,” she tweeted.', 'Then in November 2020, she took aim at Muslims living in her native Spain.', '“Sorry, is it just my impression or are there more and more Muslims in Spain? Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Maybe next year instead of English we’ll have to teach Arabic.”', 'In another tweet, she called for a ban on “religions that go against European values.” And in another, she expressed ignorance over what made Hitler such a bad guy, writing: “I do not understand so much world war against Hitler, he simply had his opinion of the Jews. The end, that’s how the world goes.”', 'every 45 minutes we find out there’s another group of people Karla Sofía Gascón has written hateful things about', 'On Friday, Gascón deactivated her X account and issued a lengthy response to the Hollywood Reporter.', '“I’m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X,” she said. “I have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion. I have a wonderful daughter to protect, whom I love madly and who supports me in everything.”', 'She continued, “You will never hear me support a war, an injustice, extremism or applaud anyone who oppresses other human beings. Perhaps my words are not correct, many times due to ignorance or pure mistake. I apologize again if anyone has ever felt offended or in the future.”', 'She went on to apologize for “erroneous” past opinions. She suggested some were the result of the toxicity of social media, while others were her attempts to prompt debate by adopting a provocative third-person persona.', 'Gascón concluded by saying she believed there was a nefarious campaign behind the rediscovery of the tweets and that someone was trying to derail her award hopes. ', '“I am a human being who also made, makes and will make mistakes from which I will learn. I am not perfect. Taking my words out of context or manipulating them to hurt me is something I am not responsible for.”', 'On Sunday, Gascón followed up her statement with a tearful, one-hour interview to CNN en Español. It was reportedly done without the knowledge of Netflix. ', 'On camera, she again said she was “not racist” and offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended for the way I express myself in my past, in my present and in my future.”', 'She continued: “I believe I have been judged, I have been convicted and sacrificed and crucified and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself.”', 'Asked about her George Floyd tweet, she said she formerly used her social media “unfortunately more like a diary” filled with “reflections as opposed to something that can influence someone, because before being here my post was viewed by three people.”', 'Asked about the Hitler tweet, she said she was again using the “third person, as if I were a Nazi.”', 'She went on to claim another reported old tweet, in which she called her Emilia Perez co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat” was pure fabrication. ', 'Gascón said she had “nothing to hide” and had a “clean conscience.”', '“If the whole world thinks that I am that bad of a person that I have to return to my home and such, then I will go home with my family, my cats and with the people who love me and I will continue my life like I have done so before, [where] I have never lacked a plate of soup because I have made it honestly without hurting anybody in this world.”', 'Gascón also said had no intention of rescinding her Academy Awards nomination, despite calls for her to do so.', '“I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime, nor have I harmed anyone,” she told CNN.', 'Just before we went to press, Variety reported that Gascón was no longer expected to attend several high-profile industry events in the run-up to the Oscars. This includes the Critics Choice Awards on Friday. Unnamed sources also told the outlet that Netflix was no longer paying Gascón’s travel expenses to attend awards ceremonies or associated events.', 'Voting for the Academy Awards ends on February 18. The 97th Oscars ceremony takes place on Sunday, March 2. Even after her apologies, it’s hard to imagine the controversy will not impact Gascón’s chances of winning. It may also dent Emilia Pérez’s success in other categories – something Netflix is obviously keen to avoid.', '“I don’t give a damn about awards,” Gascón claimed. “What I do care about is the people that I represent, because of what I represent in this world. We can all change and be better people in this world.”', 'This February brings new projects from Antoni Porowski & Laverne Cox, plus new seasons of ‘The White Lotus’ & ‘Yellowjackets.’', 'It’s was another very queer year for Sundance, and these are the 10 films the gays will be buzzing about all year long.', 'Sign up for the Queerty newsletter to stay on top of the hottest stories in LGBTQ+ entertainment, politics, and culture.', ""Don't forget to share:"", ""We can't rely on mainstream media to tell our stories.

"Feinberg on Karla Sofía Gascón, ‘Emilia Pérez’ and a Very Modern Oscars Scandal",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/karla-sofia-gascon-emilia-perez-oscars-scandal-1236122527/,"['', '', 'THR\'s executive editor of awards coverage dissects the origins and implications of a situation that has ""completely upended the Oscar race.""', 'BY SCOTT FEINBERG', '', 'The annual Oscar race, which spans about 10 months, from the Cannes Film Festival in May through the Academy Awards ceremony in March, is like a political contest. It starts with the candidates throwing their hats into the ring (at film festivals and premieres). Then, the backers of candidates that show potential (based on reactions and reviews) begin finessing their pitches (emphasizing narratives that present them in the best possible light) and courting voters (at screenings and receptions, and through Q&As and interviews). Some advance to the primaries and caucuses (the many other awards shows that precede the Oscars). And then comes Election Day (Oscar night itself).', '', 'But the similarities don’t end there. While it’s certainly true that the implications of winning a political election are more important and far-reaching than the implications of winning an Oscar, the potential rewards of winning an Oscar — reputational, monetary and otherwise — are significant enough that they, too, can cause people to behave in distasteful ways and/or result in others searching for and exposing past bad behavior.', 'Case-in-point: Karla Sofía Gascón, the Spanish actress who played the title character in Emilia Pérez, and who was rewarded with a best actress Oscar nomination on Jan. 23, which made her the first trans person ever to be named an acting finalist by the Academy.', 'Less than a week later, Gascón’s Oscar prospects, and entire life, completely imploded. In a Jan. 28 interview, she made comments that implied, without evidence, that people associated with fellow best actress Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres (I’m Still Here) were behind attacks on her, which prompted a swift backlash from many, including the army of Brazilians who have been passionately championing Torres and her film online all season long.', 'Shortly thereafter, coincidentally or not, tweets posted over the past few years by Gascón, containing bigoted commentary about a wide array of marginalized communities and even the Oscars itself, were unearthed and circulated on X (formerly Twitter). The whole thing has since gone viral and turned Gascón, who quickly deactivated her X account, into Hollywood’s version of Gary Condit, John Edwards or George Santos — in other words, completely toxic. At this point, Mel Gibson is probably more popular in town.', '', 'One can speculate that the exposure of Gascón’s tweets, and the timing of it, was not entirely organic. And one can also argue that Emilia Pérez distributor Netflix, with its deep pockets and dozens of people working specifically on awards efforts, should have caught them before investing millions into an Oscar campaign for a film with her at its center; after all, a similar situation, albeit involving just a single tweet, almost derailed the Oscar prospects of another divisive film, Green Book, six years ago.', 'But the bottom line, of course, is that Gascón did this to herself.', 'I find the whole situation to be shocking and sad.', 'I have interacted quite a bit with Gascón over the past few months at various festivals, events, interviews and Q&As, and saw no indication of this dark side. She had an unmistakably special bond with her co-stars, Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, and her director, Jacques Audiard. Often, she was accompanied by her young daughter, who struck me as a really impressive and terrific kid, and who must be feeling a lot of pain right now.', 'Beyond that, there is this: One doesn’t have to like Emilia Pérez to recognize that Gascón gave a courageous and daring performance in the film, and that her awards season success represented hope and progress for a lot of other people. Under different circumstances, she would have gone on to be celebrated at the Oscars, win or lose, and would have eventually wound up on a wall at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, described as a trailblazer alongside the likes of Sidney Poitier and Kathryn Bigelow.', '', 'But now, as a result of her behavior, her chances of winning the best actress Oscar, which were mixed to begin with, have been extinguished, and it’s possible that the same can be said for her future in the business altogether. And she has also severely damaged the Oscar prospects of her film — which was arguably the frontrunner for the best picture Oscar, having received a field-leading 13 nominations, just one shy of the all-time record — and, most unfairly of all, the prospects of her colleagues who were also nominated for the film, including Saldaña, who has been the best supporting actress frontrunner for months. Based on my conversations in recent days with Academy members, many are going to have a hard time voting for Emilia Pérez in any category, given that Emilia Pérez herself has become toxic.', 'Emilia Pérez is far from the first Oscar frontrunner to find itself caught up in “scandal” at a particularly inopportune moment in the awards season. Particularly over the last quarter-century or so, since the bare-knuckle Shakespeare in Love versus Saving Private Ryan brawl, accusations of varying degrees of legitimacy, and in some cases hazy origin, have threatened the prospects of A Beautiful Mind (the man played by Russell Crowe was said to be an antisemite); Slumdog Millionaire (accused of exploiting its Indian child actors); The Hurt Locker (a veteran claimed it ripped off his story); The King’s Speech (for allegedly falsifying history); and Green Book (for so many different things).', '', 'Interestingly enough, every one of those films still won the best picture Oscar. Academy members either deemed the claims false, misleading or immaterial to their assignment of evaluating the quality of a film. But the Gascón situation feels different than anything that has come before it, because her bad behavior is undeniable (although she has claimed that some of the tweets that have been circulated are doctored), indefensible (is there an ethnic group that she didn’t offend?) and completely contrary to what she and her movie are supposed to be about (namely, tolerance). Moreover, she has undermined the efforts of a lot of people who worked tirelessly on her behalf.', 'This is a very modern Oscars scandal, one that wouldn’t have been possible just a few years ago, before the advent of the internet and the rise of social media. As in politics, there have always been forms of opposition research mobilized in the Oscar race, but usually by strategists working on behalf of another campaign; I don’t condone that, but it’s the truth. In this case, though, all indications are that civilians — who may or may not be among a large number of people who vocally oppose “wokeness,” on one end of the spectrum, or who find Emilia Pérez’s depiction of trans people and Mexico to be offensively simplistic, on the other — took matters into their own hands, searching for, locating and circulating damaging information about someone who left them plenty of it to find.', 'Could these civilians have been aided and abetted by a rival campaign that would benefit from the downfall of Gascón and Emilia Pérez? Anything is possible and, in the age of the internet and social media, very hard to prove. But the bottom line is still the same: They have completely upended the Oscar race.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"

The 52-year-old actress, nominated for Best Actress for her role as a transgender crime boss in the Netflix musical, has faced intense backlash following offensive tweets she made over the past five years. The posts, which included remarks about George Floyd, Islam, and diversity at the Oscars, have quickly overshadowed her awards campaign, leading to a wave of criticism.', ""Also Read: Beyonce's ‘spectacular’ tour to celebrate ‘female empowerment’ after Grammy win"", 'Gascon insisted that she is not “a racist” in her hour-long interview with CNN es Espanol as she cried and addressed her controversial social media history. Talking to interviewer Juan Carlos Arciniegas, the actor was asked if she would renounce her Oscar nomination, first-ever awarded to an openly transgender actor. She said, “I cannot renounce a nomination because what I have done is a job and what is being valued is my acting work,” as translated by The Hollywood Reporter.', 'Gascon continued, “I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone. I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am."" She addressed her tweet about George Floyd who was murdered by a white police officer in 2020 and led to Black Lives Matter. She called Floyd a “drug addict and a hustler,” and wrote, “his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider Black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong.”', 'She said that her now-deleted tweet was misinterpreted as she told the media outlet, “He was a person who had been in a very difficult situation in his life and no one had helped him, and suddenly he becomes a symbol of a cause and everyone loved him.” She added, “But for someone to think that … I have ever insulted a person because of their skin colour, I do not allow that to anyone, to anyone.”', 'Also Read: Trevor Noah faces heat over ‘tasteless’ jokes on illegal immigrants, Colombians and Shakira; netizens seek ‘apology’', 'In response to the backlash over tweets condemned as Islamophobic, Gascon explained that she was expressing criticism of radical Islam and never intended to harm anyone. She shared about her relationship with a Muslim woman “whom I adore, whom I love and who has taught me so much about respect for people.”', 'She continued, “What have I done in my life? What have I done? I haven’t killed a single fly. When I have a spider in my house I put a little glass on it so as not to kill it and take it out to the street,” as per the translation by Deadline.', 'Gascon offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended for the way I express myself in my past, in my present and in my future,” adding, “I believe I have been judged, I have been convicted and sacrificed and crucified and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself.”', 'While many of the tweets circulating on social media are real, some are fake such as teh one post where she described her co-star Selena Gomes as a “rich rat.” About the tweet, Gascon said, “It’s not mine, of course. I have never said anything about my colleague I would never refer to her that way.""', 'She claimed that people “have dedicated themselves to searching, to put together all the things that I had said at a time that I had written, most of which are false … most of them I don’t even recognise that I wrote them. And they put them all together and so it seems that she is a very bad person and we remove her [from the Oscar race] just when we can do the most damage, right in the voting period.""', 'The actor added that she “doesn’t give a damn about awards.” She continued, “What I do care about is the people that I represent, because of what I represent in this world. We can all change and be better people in this world."" The interview took place without any involvement of Netflic who distributed the film, Emilia Perez.', '', '', '']"

I apologize again if anyone has ever felt offended or in the future,” she writes. “I am a human being who also made, makes, and will make mistakes from which I will learn. I am not perfect. Taking my words out of context or manipulating them to hurt me is something I am not responsible for.”', 'The original post continues below.', 'Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, the star of Emilia Pérez, has apologized after coming under fire for a bevy of Islamophobic and racist remarks found on her personal X account.', '“I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt,” Gascón said in a statement obtained by Vanity Fair. “As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.”', 'The posts on the website formerly known as Twitter were first publicized in a viral X thread from writer and podcaster Sarah Hagi. On Thursday, January 30, Hagi resurfaced screenshots of old posts from Gascón’s personal X account which contained a multitude of insensitive remarks about Muslim people, the Arab community, and Islam.', '“Islam is marvelous, without any machismo. Women are respected, and when they are so respected they are left with a little squared hole on their faces for their eyes to be visible and their mouths, but only if she behaves. Although they dress this way for their own enjoyment. How DEEPLY DISGUSTING OF HUMANITY,” read one post on Gascón’s X account on September 3, 2020, translated from Spanish to English by Variety. The post also included a photo of a Muslim family in a restaurant, including a woman in a burqa.', 'Another post shared on Gascón’s page (but later deleted) and translated from Spanish to English by Variety reads, “I’m sorry, is it just my impression or is there more Muslims in Spain? Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Next year instead of English we’ll have to teach Arabic.”', 'Hagi’s thread contained screenshots of 12 posts she allegedly found on Gascón’s page. Many of the posts were apparently published between 2020 and 2021, with the earliest post in Hagi’s thread bearing a 2016 time stamp. In a separate thread, which is now deleted, Gascón’s account reportedly commented on the 2020 murder of George Floyd. “I truly believed that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict and a hustler, but his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong,” read the post, as translated from Spanish via Google Translate.', 'Gascón’s verified X account is still live, but some of the posts highlighted by Variety and Hagi also appear to have been deleted.', 'Gascón is the first openly trans actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. She leads Emilia Pérez, also starring Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, which received 13 total Oscar nominations—the most for any film this season, as well as the most ever for a movie not in the English language. The film has been both widely celebrated on the awards circuit and dogged by controversy ever since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won two prizes and was acquired by Netflix in a splashy deal. It’s since won a best-film prize at the European Film Awards and the award for best musical or comedy at this month’s Golden Globes.', 'Once the movie premiered on Netflix, several trans critics, as well as GLAAD, spoke out against the film, criticizing it as a regressive and simplistic portrait of the trans experience. (On social media, one musical number in particular has inspired outright mockery.) Speaking with Vanity Fair earlier this month, Gascón pushed back: “Being LGBTQ, having those labels, does not remove your stupidity, just like heterosexuality does not remove your stupidity. What bothers me is that the people that say things like that [are] just sitting down at home doing nothing. If you don’t like it, go and make your own movie. Go create the representation you want to see for your community.”', 'The film has also been criticized by Mexican audiences, including Oscar-nominated filmmaker Rodrigo Prieto, who called out its “inauthentic” depiction of the country and its casting of predominantly non-Mexican actors (Gascón is Spanish). Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez also critiqued Selena Gomez’s use of Spanish. (Derbez later apologized to Gomez for his remarks.) Director Jacques Audiard, who does not speak Spanish, ignited backlash when he said in French in a recent interview, “Spanish is a language of modest countries, of developing countries, of the poor and migrants.”', 'Gascón has often addressed the backlash to Emilia Pérez on social media, to increasing scrutiny. On Wednesday, her comments to Folha de S.Paulo, a Brazilian daily newspaper, went viral as she seemed to suggest that supporters of the Brazilian film I’m Still Here and its star Fernanda Torres were orchestrating a campaign against her: “What I don’t like are social media teams—people who work with these people—trying to diminish our work, like me and my movie, because that doesn’t lead anywhere. You don’t need to tear down someone’s work to highlight another’s. I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie. However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”', 'After these comments were widely picked up, Gascón issued a clarification: “I am an enormous fan of Fernanda Torres and it has been wonderful getting to know her the past few months,” she said in a statement obtained by Variety. “In my recent comments, I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience. Fernanda has been a wonderful ally, and no one directly associated with her has been anything but supportive and hugely generous.”', 'This story has been updated.', 'Inside America’s Most Unconventional Counterterror Squad', 'Beyoncé Wins Big at the 2025 Grammy Awards', 'See the Full List of 2025 Grammy Winners', 'All the Looks From the 2025 Grammys Red Carpet', 'Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit', 'See the 2025 Oscar Nominations', 'The 10 Biggest Snubs and Surprises From the 2025 Oscar Nominations', 'How the MAGA World Ignited the Obama Divorce Rumors', 'The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires', 'Beware the Serial Squatter of Point Dume', 'The Best Rom-Coms of All Time', 'From the Archive: MAGA Non Grata', 'MORE FROM VANITY FAIR', 'CONTACT', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

"The Repulsive Mess of 'Emilia Pérez,' Karla Sofía Gascón, and Those Tweets",https://www.pajiba.com/film_reviews/the-repulsive-mess-of-emilia-perez-karla-sofia-gascon-and-those-tweets.php,"['By Kayleigh Donaldson | Film | January 31, 2025 |', 'Over the past couple of days, various tweets of actress Karla Sofía Gascón came to light that revealed the extent of her astonishing bigotry. The star of the film Emilia Pérez, a musical drama about a trans cartel leader, made history earlier this month by becoming the first out trans woman to receive a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars. The film itself, directed by Frenchman Jacques Audiard, is the most nominated movie of the year. In what should be a moment of celebration, Gascón has instead found herself exposed as someone rather repugnant.', 'The tweets, which date back several years but were as recent as last year, involve astonishingly numerous screeds of racist, Islamophobic, and queerphobic rhetoric. She was anti-Asian racist towards the COVID-19 vaccination, called George Floyd a ‘drug addict swindler’, and derided the 93rd Academy Awards, where Daniel Kaluuya and Youn Yuh-jung were among the winners, as an ‘Afro-Korean festival.’ In one post, she said, ‘Sorry, is it just me or are there more Muslims in Spain? Every time I pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Next year instead of English, we’ll have to teach Arabic.’ That’s actually one of the tamer tweets in terms of her Islamophobia. The tweets just kept on coming, and it began to feel like Gascón had never tweeted a non-bigoted thing in her life.', 'The day after, Gascón issued a hilariously cheap and self-aggrandizing apology. She wrote, ‘All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.’ To which I say, you, Ms. Gascón, are the darkness.', 'Awards season campaigning is full of messy and often dirty tactics. The 2024 roster has frequently felt like a return to the days of Miramax-style aggression and subterfuge, with studios spending huge amounts of money to get their movie to the Academy stage. Netflix has not been shy in their agenda for Emilia Pérez, which they hope will land them their first-ever Best Picture winner. They beat out multiple studios to acquire the distribution rights for $8 million out of Cannes. They have sent out lavish FYC kits to critics and industry figures. Their campaign has largely hinged upon its historic precedence, and with Gascón as the face of that. She was pushed to Best Actress despite having less screen time than Zoe Saldana, who is nominated in the supporting category. She was the one who accepted the film’s Golden Globe award and talked eloquently about supporting trans people in the midst of a terrifying time for the community. A triumph for Emilia Pérez was a triumph for the trans community, so Netflix has wanted this season to declare. How very Weinstein-esque of them.', 'One has to wonder if Netflix set aside any money in their expensive awards campaign to media train their lead actress and sift through her social media history. That seems like a basic requirement for a 2025 Oscar run. Personally, I’m glad they didn’t do a clean-up. Let sunlight be the best disinfectant, right?', 'It barely mattered to them that the film has been, to put it mildly, controversial among both the trans and Mexican communities. It’s a film about a murderous cartel leader who transitions in secret and then returns to the limelight to be a faux-saint. Jacques Audiard has repeatedly admitted he did no research on either Mexico or the reality of cartel violence. GLAAD called it ‘a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman’ and ‘a step backward for trans representation.’ Spanish philosopher and filmmaker Paul B. Preciado, who made the excellent Orlando, My Political Biography, described the film as ‘a polysemic amalgam loaded with racism and transphobia, anti-Latino exoticism and melodramatic binarism’ that ‘reinforces the colonial and pathologizing narrative’ of both Mexican culture and gender transition. Trans-Mexican artists responded by making their own parody film called Johanne Sacreblu, about a trans heir to a baguette company.', 'Conflating a piece of art, however bad it may be, with the awful person headlining it is typically ill-advised. We’ve all watched films we love that star gross bigots and had to do the old separating of art and artist just to find the energy to get on with our lives. With Emilia Pérez, Netflix can help to take the blame for making this divide much harder. After all, they’re the company so desperate for Oscar glory that they steamrolled over months’ of concerns and criticism to push this one woman as being the ground-breaking face of a community they cared so little about. It should be a moment of celebration that an out trans actor has been Oscar-nominated after decades of watching cis men in dresses exemplify every nasty stereotype against trans women and perpetuate a cultural cruelty. Instead, it’s been a reminder that even marginalized people can be as bigoted as anyone else.', 'Frankly, it makes too much sense for the star of Emilia Pérez to be as close-minded and cruel as the film she headlines, all of which has been furiously sold as a sign of progress and the Academy’s new open-mindedness. One is almost worried that they’ll sympathize with Gascón more after those tweets since getting mad about industry diversity and hating Muslims isn’t something white elites are exactly punished for. The Academy notoriously doesn’t like being told what to do. Some voters admitted to doubling down in their support for Green Book after it faced criticism from Black critics and audiences over its Driving Miss Daisy-esque portrayal of race relations in the 1950s. I wouldn’t put it past them to throw their weight behind Emilia Pérez and reassert it as An Important Film.', 'But personally, I think this is the end of the road for Gascón’s campaign. I doubt there’s a PR-mandated apology good enough to mitigate her years of hatred but the one she gave certainly wasn’t close to appropriate. Her own self-importance has crumbled in the face of pure arrogance and repulsive bigotry that is a greater representation of Emilia Pérez than any FYC campaign could ever embody.']"

The post was allegedly shared via Gascón’s account, which has been deactivated.', 'Us Weekly has reached out to reps for both Gascón and Gomez for comment.', '', 'Gascón received widespread backlash in January 2025 when past social media posts started circulate online, some of which date back to 2016. In some of the posts, Gascón made derogatory comments about the Muslim population in her native Spain and criticized George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in the United States in 2020. Gascón has since deleted her X account and apologized for the resurfaced posts.', '“As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain,” she shared in a statement via Netflix, per the Associated Press. “All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.”', 'Gascón’s Emilia Pérez costar Zoe Saldaña addressed the controversy during a Q&A in London on Friday, January 31, saying she was “still processing.” She explained, “It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it], and I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.”', 'Saldaña, 46, continued, “I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural, and gender equity. And it just saddens me. It saddens me that we are having to face this setback right now.”', 'Emilia Pérez is a musical drama starring Gascón as the leader of a Mexican cartel who fakes her death and transitions into a woman.', 'Gascón’s posts aside, the film is already shrouded in controversy. While Gascón is the first transgender woman nominated for Best Actress at both the Golden Globes and Academy Awards, Emilia Pérez was notably left out of the nominations for the GLAAD Media Awards in January.

The transitioning of a fugitive cartel boss has been criticised as regressive, rather than the trailblazing triumph for trans visibility the marketing would have us believe.', 'A good deal of the other flak was undiluted transphobia. Gascón received death threats. She also lashed back on social media at what she has called “a campaign of hate and misinformation”, and has blamed the publicists behind some of this year’s rival films (especially the Brazilian drama I’m Still Here) for stoking the flames.', 'Until last week, it was possible to sympathise with Gascón up to a point. But there’s no defending her now-infamous tweets. A Canada-based culture writer called Sarah Hagi was the one who found them – motivated, as a Muslim woman, by a dog-whistle use of the word “Islamist” in one of Gascón’s recent posts.', 'What Hagi found, doing a basic search on Gascón’s Twitter feed for words such as “Muslims” or “hijab” in Spanish, was a torrent of vileness, posted between 2016 and 2023 with almost no one paying attention. An example from 2020, translated into English: “I’m sorry, is it just my impression or are there more Muslims in Spain? Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Next year instead of English we’ll have to teach Arabic.”', 'Her screeds were by no means limited to such eye-watering instances of Islamophobia. In another tweet, a few weeks after George Floyd’s death, she weighed in by saying “I truly believe that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict and a hustler…”', 'These outpourings had stood unchallenged, with “no pushback, no visibility”, in Hagi’s words, since the moment Gascón casually tweeted them. The journalist firmly believes that Gascón’s “blatant racism” ought to result in the rescinding of her Oscar nomination. There’s certainly no way she will win, which might have been an outside possibility until this happened.', 'How Gascón – and by extension, Emilia Pérez generally – even got this far in this awards race is the question that has everyone confounded. Before being cast by Jacques Audiard in this role, the Madrid-born actress was really only known to Mexican audiences, for a string of telenovelas in which she appeared, pre-transitioning, as a man, credited as “Juan Carlos Gascón” or sometimes “Carlos Gascón”.', 'Gascón’s most prolific part, a supporting role for 80 episodes, was in a period drama called Wild Heart (2009-2010). These weren’t star turns – Gascón was featured among ensembles of dozens. (Consider that Gascón’s second most prominent role, in the cartel drama The Lord of the Skies, totted up to 47 episodes. Lead actor Rafael Amaya has now done 700.) Post-transitioning in 2018, Gascón made a small handful of other appearances as “Karla Sofia”.', 'Had she achieved international fame sooner, it’s surely probable that some kind of broader fan base would have existed, and more people would have looked askance at some of the incriminating tweets. Perhaps, with management guidance, she would have been more circumspect about casually venting. Indeed, the only way this current situation arises is because Gascón wasn’t a celebrity, in any real sense, before Emilia Pérez. She was a TV actor, thoroughly unknown outside the Spanish-speaking world.', 'As a PR disaster, this is up there with one of the most brutal to afflict an Oscar race in many years – much worse than Charlotte Rampling saying that the 2016 diversity row was “racist to white people”. It’s practically the Will Smith slap, if he had delivered it in tweet form to a range of minorities, and managed to time it before, and not after, the voting was done.', 'While Gascón’s tweets themselves are unconscionable, the disaster was entirely preventable, and this is what’s most bizarre. Netflix, who bought the film for $12 million following its success at Cannes, are entirely responsible for elevating Emilia Pérez to Oscar heavyweight status – indeed, with 13 nominations, it holds the record for the biggest tally a foreign-language film has ever received. To get that far – and with such an odd duck of a film to work with – requires the orchestration of an immensely intricate, concerted and expensive awards campaign. There’s a rumour floating around that 200 people are deployed by Netflix to concentrate on awards-season publicity alone.', 'With all of those resources, it beggars belief that no one on their team thought Gascón’s social media history might come under scrutiny, or had a cursory scroll backwards to make sure nothing was beyond the pale. If the most basic due diligence had been performed, she could have taken the precaution of deactivating her account – which she has now done, of course – and we’d be none the wiser about her written record of Islamophobia (and everything else).', 'Even before the tweets resurfaced, Gascón’s presence on socials was vehement, to say the least. She was mightily defensive about her Mexican accent, and went on the attack against the campaign for I’m Still Here star Fernanda Torres, her Best Actress rival, accusing that team of trying to discredit her.', 'It’s perhaps not surprising, then, that her response to the crisis has been chaotic and packed with denials, to the point where it has only made things worse. She arranged an hour-long interview with CNN en Español, supposedly without even telling Netflix, and continued to beat the drum tearfully, and unapologetically, about her remarks being taken out of context, and in some cases fabricated.', 'Did she really call her Emilia co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat”, in a since-deleted tweet from October 2022? She says that tweet was “not mine”. Equally, she says that an apparent defence of Hitler, for “simply having opinions about Jews”, was misunderstood.', 'Gascón’s very obscurity up to this point has been her calamitous undoing. She has leapt to notoriety in one bound, and the scandal has depressingly tarnished any coup for trans representation that her nomination, or her film, can ever claim in the future.', 'Hagi believes she should be disqualified, not just because of the tweets themselves, but because “she hasn’t explicitly apologised to the group she offended”. For her part, Gascón has said she will not withdraw from contention, which leaves the Academy mulling over this stain on the Best Actress category, with a month left to go. Netflix has now removed Gascón’s name from its Oscar ads, and seems to have stopped campaigning for her altogether.', 'It won’t be enough for host Conan O’Brien to make pointed jokes about old tweets on Oscar night. And it makes Emilia Pérez a very unlikely winner now in any major category, save for Best Supporting Actress, where Zoe Saldaña, so long as she does a very sober job of withholding solidarity, remains the favourite. Gascón will never live it down, unfortunately, and Netflix must shoulder a huge chunk of the blame.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Variety and the Hollywood Reporter have since reported the news and translated older posts.', 'Gascón, originally in Spanish, called Floyd “a martyr hero” weeks after his death and wrote: “I truly believe that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict and a hustler, but his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider Black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong.”', 'She followed up by writing that it “is no longer a question of racism but social classes that feel threatened by each other”.', 'In November 2020, she also wrote about “more and more Muslims in Spain” before adding: “Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Maybe next year instead of English we’ll have to teach Arabic.”', 'In another post, she wrote: “Until we ban religions that go against European values and violate human rights, such as Islam, under the protection of freedom of worship, we will not end part of the huge problem we face.

I believe light will always triumph over darkness.” She has since deactivated her account.', '“I’m sorry, but I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect me and my family, so at their request I am closing my account on X,” she wrote. “I have been threatened with death, insulted, abused and harassed to the point of exhaustion. I have a wonderful daughter to protect, whom I love madly and who supports me in everything.”', 'Netflix purchased the film at Cannes and has yet to comment.', 'Gascón recently made headlines for criticising the social media team involved with her fellow best actress Oscar nominee, I’m Still Here star Fernanda Torres. “I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie,” she said in an interview. “However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”', 'She later clarified that it wasn’t meant to be an attack on Torres but on “toxicity and violent hate speech on social media”.', 'Emilia Pérez has been nominated for 13 Oscars, a record for a film not in the English language, yet has faced criticism from both the LGBTQ+ community and in Mexico, where it is set. It tells the story of a cartel boss transitioning into a woman.', 'Advocacy group Glaad called it “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and that it represented “a step backward” for representation while the film has been accused of perpetuating Mexican stereotypes.', 'French director Jacques Audiard has since apologised: “If there are things that seem shocking in Emilia Pérez then I am sorry … Cinema doesn’t provide answers, it only asks questions. But maybe the questions in Emilia Pérez are incorrect.”']"

So have the Oscars prospects of Saldaña’s “Emilia Perez” colleagues and of the film itself, ever since Karla Sofía Gascón, the trans actor who plays the titular transgender cartel boss Emilia Perez, has become embroiled in an ugly and shocking scandal over her history of posting offensive, bigoted views about a wide array of marginalized communities.', 'In the past week, the Spanish actor’s Oscar prospects, and entire life, have “completely imploded,” Feinberg said.

Saldaña’s front-runner status was helped by her winning the Golden Globe award for best supporting actress.', 'But in speaking to Academy members in recent days, Feinberg said, “Many are going to have a hard time voting for ‘Emilia Pérez’ in any category, given that Emilia Pérez herself has become toxic.”', 'On Friday, Saldaña was forced into doing damage control for “Emilia Perez,” while distancing herself and the film from Gascón, according to another report in The Hollywood Reporter.
