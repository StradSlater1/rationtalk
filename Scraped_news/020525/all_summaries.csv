6,### Title: Trump's Aggressive Stance on Iran,"['', 'In a series of aggressive actions against Iran, President Trump dismantled the six-nation nuclear agreement established by President Obama, imposing stringent ""maximum pressure"" sanctions that severely restricted Iran\'s oil exports. His administration escalated tensions by assassinating General Qassem Soleimani, Iran\'s top military leader, and issuing stark warnings of retaliation against Iranian sites, including culturally significant locations. Following his withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, Trump sought a ""better deal"" but instead intensified pressure on Iran with unrealistic demands that were unlikely to be accepted by any Iranian government.
