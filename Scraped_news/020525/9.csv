These nine charts show what’s at stake, what comes next, and why it matters.', ""Article by Shannon K. O'Neil and Julia Huesa"", 'Last updated February 1, 2025 6:38 pm (EST)', 'On February 1, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico—the United States’ largest trading partners. U.S. importers will pay a 25 percent tax on all goods from Canada and Mexico, as Trump tries to force both countries to curb migration and drug trafficking into the United States. Imports from China, meanwhile, will face 10 percent tariffs—punishment for Beijing’s failure to rein in the smuggling of fentanyl precursor chemicals to Canada and Mexico, where they are made into U.S.-bound fentanyl.', 'Here are nine graphics that show the potential economic effects of such tariffs on all four countries.', 'More on:', 'United States', 'Tariffs', 'Canada', 'China', 'Mexico', 'Nearly half of all U.S. imports—more than $1.3 trillion—come from Canada, China, and Mexico. However, analysis by Bloomberg Economics shows that the new tariffs could reduce overall U.S. imports by 15 percent. While the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion per year in extra federal tax revenue, they could also impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and ultimately driving up consumer prices.', 'Certain sectors of the U.S. economy will be hit particularly hard, including the automotive, energy, and food sectors. Gas prices could surge as much as 50 cents per gallon in the Midwest, as Canada and Mexico supply more than 70 percent [PDF] of crude oil imports to U.S. refineries. Also at risk are cars and other vehicles, as the United States imports nearly half its auto parts from its northern and southern neighbors. ', 'A 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico will raise production costs for U.S. automakers, adding up to $3,000 to the price of some of the roughly sixteen million cars sold in the United States each year. Grocery costs could rise, too, as Mexico is the United States’ biggest source of fresh produce, supplying more than 60 percent of U.S. vegetable imports and nearly half of all fruit and nut imports.', 'Still, the United States is less reliant on trade than many other industrialized economies, including Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Imports and exports make up just a quarter of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), and the United States sources what it does import from a fairly broad set of nations.', 'Tariffs will hit Canada and Mexico much harder, as trade makes up about 70 percent of both economies’ GDP. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The two countries are particularly dependent on trade with the United States. More than 80 percent of Mexico’s exports—including cars, machinery, fruits, vegetables, and medical equipment—head north, accounting for 15 percent of total U.S. imports. This dependence is especially pronounced on Mexico’s northern border. There, industrial states Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Baja California account for nearly half of Mexico’s exports to the United States, sending more than $200 billion worth of computers, electronics, transportation equipment, and other products each year.', 'A unilateral 25 percent tariff on these goods could slash Mexico’s GDP by some 16 percent according to Bloomberg Economics, with Mexico’s auto industry bearing the brunt. Mexico sends nearly 80 percent of the cars it produces to the United States alone, amounting to some 2.5 million vehicles each year. Duties will also threaten Mexico’s energy sector; the United States is the recipient of roughly 60 percent of Mexico’s petroleum exports, most of which is crude oil bound for U.S. refineries. At the same time, Mexico is the top destination for U.S. refined oil exports, which meet over 70 percent of domestic demand. U.S. tariffs will likely make fuel more expensive, raising prices at the pump and straining Mexico’s broader economy.', 'Canada faces a similar challenge. The United States buys more than 70 percent [PDF; in Spanish] of Canada’s exports, with these goods making up 14 percent of total U.S. imports. Under the new tariffs, Canada’s energy sector will take the biggest hit, as exporters send 80 percent of their oil south. ', 'These asymmetries in the cost of tariffs at home give the U.S. significant leverage over its North American partners in negotiations.', 'China is comparatively less dependent on the United States and less reliant on trade overall. Over the past two decades, the country has steadily reduced the importance of trade to its economy as Beijing has ramped up domestic production. Today, imports and exports account for only about 37 percent of China’s GDP, compared to more than 60 percent in the early 2000s. ', 'In recent years, U.S.-China trade has declined, particularly in sectors hit by previous tariffs and export controls, such as auto parts, data servers, furniture, and semiconductors. China has instead ramped up trade with other partners including the European Union, Mexico, and Vietnam. The country’s share of global trade has climbed roughly 4 percent since 2016, when President Trump first took office, even as the United States’ share has dipped. Combined, these factors will lessen the shock of an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.', 'Each country’s currency could weaken further, lessening the bite of tariffs on imports and raising the effective price of U.S. exports to other nations. A weakened yuan has already softened the blow for Chinese producers, helping their exports remain competitive around the world. The roughly 30 percent depreciation of Mexico’s peso since April and the Canadian dollar’s 8 percent drop since September also lessens the potential impact. Markets could potentially drive the peso, as well as the Canadian dollar, further down not that tariffs are in place.', 'Additionally, Canada, China, or Mexico could respond in kind, imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on the United States. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has already suggested that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which underpins North American free trade, would likely allow it.', 'This wouldn’t be the first time countries have reciprocated. In 2018, Mexico and Canada placed retaliatory tariffs on a combined more than $15 billion worth of U.S. goods—including steel, pork, yogurt, and tablecloths—after Trump imposed tariffs on their steel and aluminum. Likewise, the United States lost $20 billion in annual farm exports when China hit back against a slew of U.S. tariffs from 2018 to 2019.', 'If either Canada or Mexico retaliates, U.S. fuel exporters would likely take the biggest hit alongside automakers and other advanced manufacturers, including pharmaceutical producers.', 'Retaliatory tariffs on the United States would predominantly affect manufacturing-heavy states. Mexico buys 70 percent [PDF] of New Mexico’s exports, including billions of dollars in U.S. semiconductor chips and electrical components that later return to the United States in Mexican-made cars and appliances. Texas sends more than $20 billion in chips, auto parts, and electrical equipment to Mexico; overall, the state’s southbound exports account for 5 percent of its GDP. Tariffs would also dent Ohio’s $5 billion worth of auto and metal exports to Canada as well as Maine’s $320 million in northbound lumber and paper exports.', 'Will Merrow created the graphics for this article.', '', 'What Are Tariffs?', 'by Anshu Siripurapu and Noah Berman\nFebruary 3, 2025', '', 'What Is the FDA’s Role in Public Health?', 'by Mariel Ferragamo and Claire Klobucista\nJanuary 27, 2025', '', 'What Does the G20 Do?', 'by Anshu Siripurapu, Noah Berman and James McBride\nNovember 15, 2024', '', 'DeepSeek: Making Sense of the Reaction—and Overreaction', 'by Michael Froman\nJanuary 31, 2025', '', 'Who Controls the Panama Canal?', 'by Diana Roy\nJanuary 29, 2025', '', 'Securing Ukraine’s Future: What Should the United States Do?', 'by Heidi Crebo-Rediker, Liana Fix, Thomas Graham, Michael O’Hanlon and Paul B.

Chinese goods have already been subjected to previous tariffs starting in Trump’s first term between 2017 and 2021.', 'The tariff war by the US, the second-largest goods trader in the world after China, has rattled markets worldwide. From January to November 2024, the value of goods traded between the US and the world reached $4.88 trillion, with $2.98 trillion in exports and $1.90 trillion in imports.', 'The United States’s top trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China – account for more than 40 percent of total goods traded, valued at more than $2 trillion.', '', 'A tariff is a government-imposed tax on imported goods and services, paid by businesses bringing them into the country. Designed to protect domestic industries, tariffs often drive up costs for consumers by making foreign products more expensive, potentially reducing demand.', 'For example:', 'Following talks with Trump, Mexican President Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau both made commitments to bolster security at their shared borders with the US.', '“I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.', 'Following his call with Trump, Trudeau announced that Canada would move forward with its previously outlined $1.3bn border plan, while also committing to appointing a “fentanyl czar” and officially designating cartels as “terrorist” organisations.', '“Fundamentally it’s very good news that tariffs have been paused and Canada needs to do everything possible to engage with Trump – work on border security issues etc,” Vina Nadjibulla, vice president, research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera.', '“But beyond the immediate crisis, we need to work on structural issues that led to this over-dependence on the US. We need to build capacity to export [to places other than the] US and invest in our own competitiveness,” Nadjibulla added.', 'No, tariffs have been used by several countries before. Historically, in the US from 1790 to 1860, tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue.', 'Tariffs can also be used to “punish” a foreign producer of goods for not abiding by international trade practices. In 2018, the US began placing tariffs on Chinese goods worth hundreds of billions citing unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. This marked the start of the US-China trade war, where items such as semiconductors, batteries and electronics such as washing machines were taxed.', 'In the same year, Trump also introduced a 25 percent levy on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminium, affecting a number of countries including Canada, Mexico, India, Brazil and Argentina.', '', '', '', 'Tariffs are often used to protect certain domestic industries from foreign competitors. This happens by increasing the price of those imported goods. The notion behind tariffs is that buyers will choose domestic products over expensive foreign imports, which in turn will help the domestic industry grow. However, this isn’t always the case.', 'For example, for the US to produce avocados – 90 percent of which are imported from Mexico – would be a long and arduous feat given that avocados are produced in just three states: California, Florida and Hawaii.', 'During Trump’s presidential campaign, he promised to impose tariffs on the US’s biggest trading partners in retaliation over undocumented migrants and the flow of drugs, especially fentanyl.', 'Trump also emphasised using tariffs as a means to bolster domestic manufacturing and encourage foreign businesses to establish factories within the US territory.', 'Tariffs are also used to generate revenue for a country with the extra income from the taxes levied on imported goods being used for public spending. For example, in 2019, $79bn of revenue was generated in tariffs, double the value from 2017, according to the Brookings Institution. However, the majority of this burden was passed on to consumers who paid higher prices.', '“During 2018-2020, President Trump mainly used tariffs as a bargaining chip,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “This time, the motivations seem broader, including a desire to bring more manufacturing back to the US, shift the tax burden away from income taxes and onto tariffs, and use tariffs both as leverage and as punishment. We’re looking at a much larger scale than we saw under Trump’s first term.”', 'A range of goods will be heavily affected by Trump’s imposed tariffs. Based on what the US imports the most from Canada, Mexico and China, this will include items such as cars, fuel, computers and electrical equipment. Food items like avocados are also likely to see a price increase.', 'Trump signed three executive orders placing 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10 percent tariff on Canadian oil and an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods.', 'Canada is a large exporter of crude oil with 97 percent of its crude oil exports going to the US in 2023, while Mexico exports a large amount of produce such as fruit and vegetable as well as automobile parts.', 'China is a major exporter of electrical equipment and electronics including chips, laptops and smartphones.', 'Canada, Mexico and China have all stated that they would react with retaliatory tariffs. Trudeau had said on Saturday that a 25 percent levy would be slapped on a slew of US imports, which have subsequently been paused.', 'Beijing criticised the latest tariff, saying it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO), an intergovernmental body responsible for regulating international trade. China has placed counter-tariffs on US imports that will come into effect on February 10.', 'Under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, US trade representatives wield power to counteract unfair trade practices by foreign countries. This has been at the heart of Washington’s trade war with China since 2018 when tariffs were placed on the world’s largest exporter.', 'In a significant move, the Biden administration expanded these tariffs in September 2024 to target items such as electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors and solar panels, with levies ranging between 25-100 percent.', '', '“It appears there’s a temporary pause on tariffs against Mexico and Canada. However, tariffs on China are likely to take effect on February 4, and President Trump has signalled additional tariffs against the EU and others. So yes, we could be heading into a trade war,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera.', '“In response, countries will likely adopt a range of strategies – from direct retaliation to hedging their trade relationships among the US, China, and other partners. Globally, we can expect inflationary effects and significant disruptions to supply chains.”', '“Yes. Both the tariffs themselves and any mitigation measures – such as subsidies or support programmes for affected sectors – will contribute to inflation,” Nadjibulla said. “Higher prices associated with tariffs, combined with the cost of remedy efforts, will lead to inflationary pressures overall.”', '“Where possible, buying local products and avoiding certain imports may help consumers manage rising costs,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera.', 'But they cannot completely escape the inflationary pressure triggered by the tariff war.', 'Yes, in most cases the cost of items will go up. This is not just final product goods, but capital goods too, which would increase production costs and result in higher costs for final products. Additionally, higher costs for raw materials and parts would raise prices through the supply chain.', 'According to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), a US-based nonprofit organisation researching the global economy, machinery and electronics will face the largest import tax – given they are mostly sourced from China and because they currently face low tariff rates.', 'Other US imports from China likely to be hit the hardest would also include toys and sporting equipment.', 'Ultimately the consumer. US-based businesses will face paying higher taxes. In most cases, the cost of tariffs is indirectly picked up by consumers as importing businesses are likely to increase the price of said goods to manage the taxes levied.', '“Consumers will shoulder much of the burden through higher prices, but businesses will also feel the impact. Industries such as the Canadian and US auto sectors may be especially hard-hit,” Nadjibulla from the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada said.', 'In theory, the imposition of tariffs would encourage more domestic production, which, in turn, would require more employment. Similarly, if foreign companies are being encouraged to bring their factories to the United States, it would increase employment.', 'For example, after Trump imposed 20-50 percent tariffs on washing machines, more jobs were brought to two regions where appliances were not previously manufactured: Clarksville, Tennessee and Newberry, South Carolina.', 'In 2018, LG completed an investment in a new smart factory in Clarksville, to be staffed with 700 employees. Similarly, in 2018, Samsung built an appliance manufacturing facility in Newberry, South Carolina, hiring 1,000 employees.', 'The US administration would hope the latest tariff war will incentivise corporations to set up more factories and businesses in the US.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

Trump increases his power by demonstrating he has the power and is willing to use it.', 'The same with deporting, say, Colombians in military planes, handcuffed and shackled. Trump says, without any basis in fact, that they’re criminals.', 'If Colombia complains about their treatment, so much the better. Trump threatens tariffs. Colombia backs down, and Trump has once again demonstrated his power.', 'Why did Trump stop foreign aid? Not because it’s wasteful. In fact, it helps stabilize the world and reduces the spread of communicable diseases. The real reason Trump stopped foreign aid is he wants to show he can.', 'Why is he disregarding or threatening to tear up treaties and agreements (the Paris agreement, Nato, whatever)? Not because such treaties and agreements are bad for America. To the contrary, they’re in the US’s best interest.', 'The reason Trump is tearing them up is they tie Trump’s hands and thereby limit his discretion to dish out punishments and rewards.', 'Don’t think of these as individual “policies”. Think of them together as demonstrations of Trump’s strength.', 'If he doesn’t reach a deal with Canada or Mexico over the next 30 days and one or both retaliate against US-imposed tariffs with their own tariffs on US exports, he’ll retaliate against them with even bigger tariffs.', 'If some senior Republican members of Congress object that he’s stepping on congressional prerogatives, so what? It’s an opportunity to show them who’s boss.', 'If a federal court temporarily stops him, so what? He’ll go right on doing it and demonstrate that the courts are powerless to stop him.', 'Look behind what’s happening, and you’ll see Trump employing two techniques to gain more power than any US president has ever wielded.', 'The first is to demonstrate that he can mete out huge punishments and rewards.', 'It doesn’t matter if the punishment or reward is justified. A 25% tariff on Canada? Hello?', 'It’s a demonstration of strength.', 'If prices jump in the US for oil and lumber from Canada or for fruits and vegetables from Mexico, no problem for Trump. Most Americans don’t understand how tariffs work, anyway. Trump will blame Canada and Mexico. And then threaten them with, say, 50% tariffs. Kaboom!', 'Which brings us to the second technique Trump is using to expand his power: unpredictability.', 'What makes an abusive parent or spouse, or an abusive dictator, or Trump, especially terrifying? They’re unpredictable. They lash out in ways that are hard to anticipate.', 'So, anyone potentially affected by their actions gives them extra-wide berth – vast amounts of obedience in advance.', 'Trump keeps everyone guessing.', 'He demands Denmark sell Greenland to the United States. He chews out the CEO of the Bank of America at Davos for allegedly discriminating against conservatives. He attacks birthright citizenship.', 'What’s next? Who knows? That’s the whole point.', 'How else to explain the bizarre deference – cowardice – we’re seeing among CEOs, the media, almost all Republican and even some Democratic lawmakers? Presumably, they’re all saying to themselves: “He could do anything, so let’s be especially careful.”', 'In 1517, Niccolò Machiavelli argued that sometimes it is “a very wise thing to simulate madness”.', 'The “rule of law” is all about predictability. We need predictability to be free.', 'But much of what Trump is doing is probably either illegal yet would require months or years before the US supreme court decides so, or is in the gray area of “probably illegal but untested by the courts”. Which suits his strategy just fine.', 'The media calls it “chaos”, which is how various people and institutions experience it.', 'The practical consequence is that an increasing number of so-called “leaders” – in the private, public and non-profit sectors, and around the world – are telling their boards, overseers, trustees or legislatures: “We have to give Trump whatever he wants and even try to anticipate his wants, because who knows how he’ll react if we don’t?”', 'Together, these two techniques – big demonstrations of discretionary power to reward or punish, and wild uncertainty about when or how he’ll do so – expand Trump’s power beyond the point any president has ever pushed it.', 'Which brings us to the obvious question: why is Trump so obsessed with enlarging his power?', 'Hint: it’s not about improving the wellbeing of average Americans and certainly not about making America great again (whatever that means).', 'True, he’s a malignant narcissist and sadist with an insatiable lust for power who gets pleasure out of making others squirm.', 'But there’s something else.', 'The bigger his demonstrable power and the more unpredictably he wields it, the greater his ability to trade some of that power with people with huge amounts of wealth, both in the United States and elsewhere.', 'I’m referring to America’s billionaires, such as Elon Musk and the 13 other billionaires Trump has installed in his regime, as well as the 744 other billionaires in the US, and the 9,850 Americans with at least $100m in net worth.', 'Together, these individuals have a huge storehouse of wealth. Many are willing to trade some of it to gain even more, and to tie down what they have more securely.', 'They give Trump (and his family) business deals, information, campaign money and positive PR (propaganda). In return, he gives them tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and suspensions of antitrust.', 'I’m also referring to oligarchs in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. He gives them special trade deals, energy deals, intelligence deals, access to global deposits of riches; or he threatens to hold them back. In return, they give him (and his family) business deals, information, support in political campaigns and more covert propaganda.', 'This is Trump’s game: huge demonstrations of power, wielded unpredictably.

Trump’s executive orders would have placed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and a lower 10% tariff on Canada’s energy resources.  ', 'However, Trump’s executive orders also tacked an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, which began Feb. 4. In response to U.S. demands, China retaliated with a 15% tariff imposed on coal and liquefied natural gas. China also imposed a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, set to begin Feb. 10. ', 'Trump spoke multiple times during his campaign about how he aims to expand U.S. manufacturing, which included tariff hikes on the three countries. The administration has explained that one purpose of the tariffs is to curb fentanyl entering the U.S. The administration has also criticized America’s neighbors for not doing enough to stymie illegal administration. ', 'Now that the president is following through with his promises, some manufacturing trade groups are urging Trump to reverse course. Some cited the success of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump worked on near the end of his first term, stating the deal shifted manufacturing imports away from China.', '“A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico would add an estimated $144 billion a year to the cost of manufacturing in the U.S.,” the National Association of Manufacturers said in a handout.', 'Manufacturing trade groups also said they are willing to work with the Trump administration to pursue and meet their shared goals for the industry, while some are requesting exemptions.', 'Here is what industry leaders have said about Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.', 'Feb. 1: “Thanks to [the USMCA] agreement, one-third of critical U.S. manufacturing inputs now come from Canada or Mexico, rather than from competitors like China that often engage in unfair trade practices.', 'However, with essential tax reforms left on the cutting room floor by the last Congress and the Biden administration, manufacturers are already facing mounting cost pressures. A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico threatens to upend the very supply chains that have made U.S. manufacturing more competitive globally. The ripple effects will be severe, particularly for small and medium-sized manufacturers that lack the flexibility and capital to rapidly find alternative suppliers or absorb skyrocketing energy costs. These businesses—employing millions of American workers—will face significant disruptions. Ultimately, manufacturers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, undermining our ability to sell our products at a competitive price and putting American jobs at risk.”', 'Feb. 2: “While SOCMA supports policies that promote fair trade and protect North American producers, broad tariffs risk unintended consequences that weaken U.S. manufacturing. A targeted, strategic approach is essential to addressing trade challenges without undermining the supply chains that specialty chemical manufacturers depend on. We urge the Administration to implement trade policies that protect domestic interests while preserving access to critical raw materials and maintaining the benefits of USMCA.”', 'Jan. 31: “The electroindustry has taken major steps to reduce reliance on Chinese imports since 2018, decreasing China’s share of U.S. imports of electroindustry goods from 28.2% to 17.9%, while significantly growing electroindustry trade across North America by 36% spurred by USMCA.', 'We look forward to working with the Trump Administration to further strengthen USMCA, including its enforcement and ensuring it incentivizes new investments and jobs in the United States.”', 'Feb. 3: “Canada and Mexico are our industry’s largest trading partners. The American chemical industry imports materials, many of which are unavailable in the United States, adding value and supporting other manufacturing supply chains domestically and abroad, through our exports. The U.S. chemical industry is a net exporter, both in the aggregate and individually with Canada and Mexico, contributing positively to the nation’s trade balance. ', 'In particular, the U.S. chemical industry continues to support the USMCA Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. The USMCA’s Annex on Chemical Substances, created under President Trump’s first administration, is a model for agreements with other countries, advantaging U.S. based production and promoting science-based regulatory approaches.”', 'Feb. 2: “President Trump is right to focus on securing our border and protecting American communities. But levying tariffs on goods that U.S. equipment manufacturers depend on not only jeopardizes the President’s agenda, including the Trump Administration’s plan for a stronger, more competitive America, but drives up costs for U.S. equipment manufacturers, disrupts our supply chains, and exposes our customers to retaliatory tariffs. The fact remains: tariffs are a tax paid by Americans, and their broad-based application will stifle economic growth and undermine the competitiveness of the United States.', 'Equipment manufacturers stand ready to work with the Trump Administration on a trade strategy that holds bad actors accountable, safeguards the benefits of the successful United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and bolsters equipment manufacturing in North America.”', 'Feb. 1: “Tariffs on all imported goods from Mexico and Canada – especially on ingredients and inputs that aren’t available in the U.S. – could lead to higher consumer prices and retaliation against U.S. exporters. Despite sourcing the vast majority of ingredients and inputs from U.S. farms and domestic suppliers, CPG companies depend on global supply chains for certain imports due to unique growing conditions and other limiting factors around the world. We urge leaders in Mexico and Canada to work with President Trump to protect consumers’ access to affordable products and remove tariffs that could contribute to grocery inflation.”', 'Feb. 1: “The U.S. is by far the world’s largest oil producer, but U.S. refineries—primarily in the Midwest—rely on Canadian crude to produce the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel that’s critical for transportation, agriculture and American consumers. The U.S. is the largest market for Canadian crude oil exports and Mexico is the No. 1 destination for U.S. refined product exports. U.S. oil and natural gas exports to China totaled more than $14.4 billion in 2023 and are critical to reducing our trade deficit.”', 'Feb. 2: “We are assessing the potential impact of these tariffs on our industry and our supply chain, which is unique to our sector and shared between commercial and defense companies.', 'Decades-long trade agreements enabled robust civil aviation and defense trade that resulted in a sky-rocketing positive trade balance over the last 40 years, making aerospace and defense the largest American exporting industry. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico could change that positive trajectory. We hope to work with the Trump Administration to find a path forward to protect this critical industry, which is a strategic asset to both our economy and our national security.”', 'Feb. 3: “This period of negotiation provides an opportunity to explore solutions that achieve shared objectives while maintaining the strength and stability of North American trade. The vehicle supplier industry remains the largest sector of manufacturing jobs in the U.S., and the relationships between the three nations are a key facet of the industry’s daily operations and competitiveness.  ', 'We recognize and respect President Trump’s commitment to addressing critical challenges concerning border security and fentanyl trafficking and appreciate this opportunity for the three partner nations in North America to engage in productive negotiations. A collaborative, strategic approach will be key to ensuring that these efforts meet their intended goals without disrupting the highly integrated North American supply chain that supports U.S. jobs.”', 'Feb. 1: “PLASTICS is concerned about the new tariffs and their impact on U.S. plastics manufacturing and jobs. While we understand President Trump’s rationale, a blanket tariff policy could have significant economic consequences, disrupting the movement of essential machines, products, and materials that keep American manufacturers running. A competitive industry requires policies that protect high-quality jobs and ensure stable supply chains across sectors like healthcare, consumer products, and automotive. A strategic, measured approach to trade is critical to strengthening—not inadvertently harming—U.S. industry.”', 'Feb. 1: “During this time of high inflation, this is not the time to impose new costs on U.S. supply chains. Instead, our industry needs tariff relief and commitment to smart trade policy and strong trade partnerships. We need to renew expiring and expired trade preference programs with our allies and strengthen the competitiveness of our free trade agreement with Central America to stem the tide of migration.” ', 'Feb. 1: “During his first term, President Trump was early to recognize the genuine threat that non-market actors pose to U.S. manufacturing industries like ours. This led to more than $10 billion in industry investment since 2016. This investment requires an enormous amount of metal, much of which the U.S. industry must import from within North America. To ensure that American aluminum wins the future, President Trump should exempt the aluminum metal supply needed for American manufacturers, while continuing to take every possible action at the U.S. border against unfairly traded Chinese aluminum. This is consistent with action his administration wisely took during his first term. Then, we should work to keep unfairly traded aluminum out of the region by harmonizing tariffs with our North American trading partners.”', '', '', '', '', 'Keep up with the story.

The historic significance of Trump's tariff actions,https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/historic-significance-trumps-tariff-actions,"['', '', '', '', 'On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico (except energy products from Canada, which will be taxed at 10 percent), along with a 10 percent tariff on imports from China. On February 3, 2025, the Trump administration decided to postpone for 30 days the implementation of the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but the threat to impose them remains. Although these plans could change at any time, the imposition of these tariffs would constitute a historic event in the annals of US trade policy and would amount to one of the largest increases in trade taxes in US history.', ""One has to go back almost a century to find tariff increases comparable to what the president is planning. Before the United States pivoted in the 1930s toward trade agreements to reduce tariffs, Congress regularly voted to change the import duties in the tariff code. Perhaps the most infamous was the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, enacted as the world economy was sinking into the Great Depression. There was also the McKinley tariff of 1890, one that Trump has often touted as being responsible for America's economic success in the late 19th century, although it too was followed by a severe depression of 1893–96. And there is the Fordney-McCumber tariff of 1922, designed to reverse a Democratic tariff reduction in 1913. All of these tariff rate increases were enacted by Republican congresses and signed by Republican presidents. Now, of course, presidents have discretion in setting tariff rates, and that is what Trump has done."", 'How do the new Trump tariffs, as announced on February 1, compare to these past tariff increases? Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way of comparing tariffs over time. These actions differ in the base from which they start, the degree to which they increase rates, the share of trade they cover, and the importance of trade in the economy, among many other dimensions. For example, which is more significant: a tariff that raises duties from 5 percent to 10 percent on 100 percent of imports, or a tariff that raises duties from 20 percent to 40 percent on 40 percent of all imports?', 'Still, it is possible to make some very basic comparisons, at a broad level, to see which tariff changes might be more significant.', ""Let's start with the proposed new tariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico. In 2023, these imports accounted for 29 percent of total US imports of goods, amounting to 3.2 percent of US GDP (source: Exhibit 13, FT-900 2023 Annual). These imports entered the United States duty free, just as US exports to Canada and Mexico were given duty-free treatment under the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA), the Trump-negotiated successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Trump administration would raise tariffs from 0 percent to 25 percent on imports that amount to more than 3 percent of GDP, with the exception of imports of oil from Canada, for which the tariff will be 10 percent. (Oil accounts for about $93 billion of the $419 billion worth of imports from Canada, or 0.3 percent of GDP.)"", 'In addition, a new tariff of 10 percent will be levied on imports from China. In 2023, those imports comprised 14 percent of total US imports, or 1.5 percent of GDP.', 'If implemented, what will these new tariffs do to the average tariff level of the United States? In 2023, the last year with full annual data available, the average US tariff on all imports was 2.4 percent, and the average US tariff on dutiable imports was 7.4 percent, according to the US International Trade Commission. Now all imports from Canada and Mexico move off the duty-free list and become dutiable, and imports from China face an additional tariff. Assuming no change in the amount of imports, which would give us an upper bound of the impact of the new tariffs on the average tariff, the Trump tariff hike would increase the average tariff on total imports from 2.4 percent to 10.5 percent, an increase of 8.1 percentage points. It would also increase the average tariff on dutiable imports from 7.4 percent to 17.3 percent, an increase of 9.9 percentage points.', 'This static calculation is an upper bound because it does not incorporate any reduction in imports because of the tariffs. The reduction of imports subject to the tariffs would dampen the measured increase in average tariffs as importers substitute away from those goods. However, what makes the static approach useful is that, in the past, the Tariff Commission and congressional committees used exactly that method when they were evaluating the change in the average tariff due to new legislation. Hence, the crude approach here is roughly comparable to that used to examine past tariff legislation.', ""The table below reports on the share of imports affected by the four major tariff changes over the past century (as a percentage of GDP), the baseline tariff in place before the tariff change, the increase in the average tariff (static estimate), and the percentage point change in the average tariff. Because trade is a larger part of the economy today than in the past, Trump's current tariffs directly impact a larger fraction of the US economy. Notably, the Smoot-Hawley tariff hit dutiable imports when they amounted to just 1.4 percent of GDP (1929). Trump's new tariffs increase the average tariff on dutiable imports by 9.9 percentage points, significantly more than Smoot-Hawley but starting from a much lower base. Even after the Trump tariffs, however, the average tariff on dutiable and total imports still will be considerably lower than during the previous tariff regime."", 'The McKinley and Fordney-McCumber tariffs were substantial additions to the already high existing tariffs. But their economic impact was much smaller because imports were a relatively small share of GDP. One of the biggest differences between a century ago and today is the growth of global supply chains and international production networks. These factors make trade, and particularly trade in intermediate goods and components, a much more significant part of the US economy today than in the distant past and tariffs a much greater disruption to the economy.', 'The figure below shows another way to put the proposed Trump tariffs in historical perspective. This figure presents the average US tariff from 1790 to 2023 and includes the prospective tariff changes with the new duties on Canada, Mexico, and China. The average tariff rises much more sharply than during the first Trump administration, when tariffs were imposed on about half of imports from China and on imported steel and aluminum. The most recent tariff increase is easily the largest since World War II and marks a clear break from the more or less continuous reduction in tariffs since 1932. The new Trump tariffs are likely to put the average tariff back to where it had been in the 1940s. The United States has not seen an average tariff on total imports of around 10 percent since 1943 and has not seen an average tariff on dutiable imports of about 17 percent since 1947.', '', 'Even with the new Trump tariffs, the average tariff would remain much lower than in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We are not close to the days of the Tariff of Abomination (1828) or Smoot-Hawley (1930). But then again, the president has promised that more tariffs are to come. New tariffs on imports from the European Union, which amounted to 2.1 percent of US GDP in 2023, would change these calculations considerably.', 'The data underlying this analysis can be downloaded here [xlsx].', 'Senior Research Staff', 'OP-EDS', 'November 29, 2024', 'via LinkedIn', 'OP-EDS', 'November 10, 2024', 'via East Asia Forum', 'POLICY BRIEFS', 'October 2024', 'Subscribe to the PIIE Insider Weekly Newsletter', 'PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS', 'The Peterson Institute for International Economics is an independent nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization dedicated to strengthening prosperity and human welfare in the global economy through expert analysis and practical policy solutions.', 'LEARN MORE ABOUT PIIE', 'ADDRESS', '1750 Massachusetts Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20036']"

"Canada Poised to Retaliate Against Trump Tariffs, Rethink US Reliance",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-01/canada-poised-to-retaliate-against-trump-tariffs-while-rethinking-us-reliance,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
Trump’s Trade War Is Only Getting Going,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/trumps-trade-war-is-only-getting-going,"['On Wall Street, it’s called Trump-induced volatility, and the message of the past few days is that investors—and everybody else—had better get used to it. At the weekend, the President made good on a signature campaign promise, imposing twenty-five per cent levies on Mexican and Canadian goods and ten per cent on Chinese imports. On Monday, after Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican President, said that she would send ten thousand troops to fight drug smuggling at the southern border, the White House said it was suspending the tariffs for a month. Later in the day, Trump spoke with Justin Trudeau, the outgoing Prime Minister of Canada, who made a similar pledge, and came away with a similar pause.', 'Both Mexico and Canada are acutely vulnerable to such pressure: the U.S. accounts for about eighty per cent of their trade. Trump, for his part, was under a lot of pressure from the business world to back down, and when the President paused the tariffs, the pro-free trade editorial page of the Wall Street Journal ran with the headline “Trump Blinks.” In the markets, news of tariffs led to an early sell-off; the market rebounded on the news of the pause. At the close of trading, the S. & P. 500 index was down less than one per cent. On Tuesday, the markets didn’t move much.', 'Some investors are still hoping that Trump’s threat of sanctions is merely a negotiating tactic to force concessions from trading partners. Or, as Scott Bessent, the former hedge-fund manager who is now Treasury Secretary, told the Financial Times in October, “it’s escalate to de-escalate.” Perhaps. But since his Inauguration, Trump has made clear that he plans to upend the international trade system and assert U.S. economic power in ways that are fundamentally antithetical to how the world economy has been organized since after the Second World War—a period in which American inflation-adjusted G.D.P. per capita rose from roughly fifteen thousand dollars to nearly seventy thousand dollars, while, in recent decades, workers’ wages stagnated and inequality increased sharply.', 'Trump campaigned on using trade policy to protect American workers, but his willingness to push around America’s neighbors, Mexico and Canada, as well as Greenland, Colombia, and Panama, is part of a broader agenda that is more accurately described as economic imperialism than as mere protectionism. One definition of economic imperialism is a strong country using its power to exert control over the economic resources and policies of weaker ones. The pretext Trump cited for the tariffs on Mexico and Canada was the inflow of fentanyl. This is certainly a serious problem, posed particularly by Mexican drug cartels: last year, authorities seized ninety-six hundred kilograms of the drug at the southern border. However, the total amount of fentanyl seized at the northern border in 2024 was a mere nineteen kilograms, according to the New York Times. Canada is not a major source of the fentanyl killing Americans, and the real reason for Trump’s animus toward the country appears to be that it runs a trade surplus with the United States and that its leader hasn’t been sufficiently deferential to him.', 'Over the weekend, Trump claimed on his Truth Social account, “We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason.” And on Monday, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he repeated his assertion that Canada should become the fifty-first state. Of course, the United States doesn’t spend a dollar to subsidize Canada. Just as is the case between many advanced economies, a lot of commerce goes on across the U.S.-Canada border. In 2023, Canada imported $440.9 billion worth of U.S. goods and services. To be sure, we also imported a lot of goods and services from Canada: $481.6 billion. This created a bilateral trade deficit of $40.7 billion, equivalent to less than 0.15 per cent of the U.S. G.D.P.—hardly an alarming figure.', 'Moreover, trade in goods and services is only part of the U.S.-Canada economic relationship. Financial capital also moves across the northern border in search of profitable investment opportunities, such as purchases of businesses or real estate. In 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the total stock of Canadian direct investment in the United States was $589.3 billion, compared with U.S. direct investment in Canada of $438.8 billion. In other words, the United States was running a surplus on investment capital. Quite possibly, Trump himself has benefitted from this inflow by selling condos to wealthy Canadians. If he has, he hasn’t mentioned it.', 'As for the trade deficit, much of it is accounted for by energy products, particularly crude oil and natural gas, which Canada exports to the United States in large quantities. If the tariffs go into effect, the price of these products will go up for Americans. Over the weekend, Irving Energy, a Canadian company that supplies propane to Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, warned that it would pass the levies on to its customers. That’s what happens in trade wars.', 'The auto industry plays a key role in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1993, U.S. and foreign-owned automakers have reconstituted their manufacturing operations. General Motors, for example, now assembles about forty per cent of the vehicles it sells in the United States in Mexico and Canada. And the level of cross-border integration goes well beyond final assembly. Much of the industry’s supply chain is organized on a continental basis, some parts crossing a border several times before they are shipped out as part of a finished car or truck. As Paul Krugman pointed out in a Substack post, the Trump tariffs threaten to blow up this entire model.', 'And for what? Trump’s rhetoric sometimes suggests that his goal is to make the United States self-sufficient in virtually everything; the last major capitalist economy to achieve such a goal was Nazi Germany. At other times, including over the weekend, he has celebrated tariffs as a revenue source for the federal government, and suggested that they are better than income taxes. But, if tariffs were to become a major source of revenue, they would have to be substantial and permanent. What, then, of “escalate to de-escalate”?', 'It’s surely sufficient to know that Trump regards tariffs as an effective tool to bully other countries, and that his recent experience with Colombia appears to have strengthened this conviction. (After Colombia’s government refused to accept military flights of migrants deported from the United States, Trump slapped heavy tariffs on the country, prompting a quick reversal on Colombia’s part.)', 'On Sunday, Trump signalled that the next step would be the announcement of punitive tariffs on goods from the European Union, which has long been one of his bêtes noires. The way things are going, it wouldn’t be surprising if he singled out Denmark, which exports a lot of medical products, including Ozempic, to the United States, for specially punitive treatment, as a means of pressuring it to make concessions on mineral-rich Greenland, which figures prominently in his imperialist ambitions. (He’s already had one phone call with the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen. The Financial Times reported that it “had gone very badly.”)', 'So far, China, the prime target of Trump’s first-term trade war, has got off relatively lightly, with a ten per cent across-the-board tariff. (During the 2024 campaign, he had threatened a levy of up to sixty per cent.) On Tuesday, China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports of crude oil and natural gas, farm equipment, and certain other vehicles. As many big U.S. firms, including Apple, Intel, and Tesla, remain heavily dependent on Chinese supply chains, the government in Beijing has the capacity to inflict a great deal more hurt on the U.S. economy, but its measured response signalled it is open to negotiations, and some of Trump’s business allies may well be advising him to exercise caution. In the meantime, he is busy bullying the vulnerable and figuring out how far he can take things without creating a financial crash. ♦', 'Searching for the cause of a catastrophic plane crash.', 'The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.', 'Gloria Steinem’s life on the feminist frontier.', 'Where the Amish go on vacation.', 'How Colonel Sanders built his Kentucky-fried fortune.', 'What does procrastination tell us about ourselves?', 'Fiction by Patricia Highsmith: “The Trouble with Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble with the World”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

Those ties remained strong throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. When the automotive industry plummeted into catastrophe during the Great Recession, it wasn’t just the U.S. government that pitched in to preserve it. Canada offered its own tax dollars as part of President Barack Obama's task force that led General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy. "", 'K. Venkatesh Prasad, senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research, said modern vehicle production in Mexico began with components before full-vehicle production was gradually introduced. ', '“As you draw a line over the last 20 years or so, there’s been steady investments made in Canada and in Mexico by the Detroit Three, as you might expect, primarily for cost reasons, and in a gradually increasing manner of complexity,” Prasad said. ', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'In Canada, manufacturers started with systems and jumped directly to producing cars, largely due to the proximity of Windsor to Detroit.', '“Over the last four years, what you see is the same pattern, a little bit of inversion with how the dollars are being spent, with potentially more growth in money going to Canada than Mexico because of the investments in electrification,” Prasad said.', 'Harley Shaiken, a labor expert and professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, said that with the most recent trade agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, President Donald Trump aimed to address flaws in the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 that led to American manufacturing job losses, a deal the UAW and other unions opposed.', 'The 2018 agreement has stronger language than NAFTA on worker rights and environmental protections, Shaiken said, but it hasn’t lessened the U.S. trade deficit with its neighbors the way the president intended. ', '“We were running over $100 billion trade deficit in 2023, most of it in the auto sector,” Shaiken told the Free Press. “U.S. shareholders are enjoying the gains, but the benefits are largely bypassing U.S. workers.”', 'More:Detroit chamber, Fain criticize Trump tariffs; list of affected automakers', '[ STAY UP TO DATE:Sign up forour Daily Briefing newsletter today to get the Free Press in your inbox. ]', 'Though much has changed since the earliest days of automotive manufacturing, the ties that link the Detroit Three to Mexico go back 100 years.', 'In 1925, Ford Motor Co. opened a new company in Mexico City and built its first assembly plant there five years later. The plant had 260 employees and produced five Model Ts a day. Over time, production expanded to include the Model A, Mercury Cougar and Ford Mustang.', 'One advantage offered by the Mexican government was a 50% discount on import duties on inputs, rail freight tariff concessions and the promise of no union workers.', 'General Motors and Chrysler followed suit, with both having started Mexican vehicle production by 1938. ', 'Automotive parts production in Mexico flourished in the 1960s with the creation of maquiladoras, foreign manufacturing facilities through which companies can import vehicle parts or assembly products without paying tax. The goal of the duty-free facilities was to encourage international investment in production, while foreign countries like the U.S. and Canada would benefit from cheaper labor.', 'In the 1970s and 1980s, the influx of Japanese automakers prompted further investment in Mexico, as U.S. automakers sought to offshore labor and cost-intensive production. ', 'The establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 also made it easier for companies to move goods across the continent without paying duties. The revised agreement signed during Trump’s first term still supports this process. ', 'Mexican wages are far lower than those in the U.S., with Mexican autoworkers making roughly about 10% of their northern neighbors today. Nonetheless, Shaiken said, “What I’ve found on the ground in many plants in Mexico is, in fact, Mexican productivity is comparable or even higher than U.S. productivity, and the quality is very high,” he said. ', 'Shaiken calls it “high productivity poverty” — Mexican workers produce great products but aren’t earning a living wage.', '“That affects U.S. workers because the combination of high productivity and low wages attracts investment, plants are closed here that are in many cases opened there,” he said. “But Mexican workers are also short-changed. They have small parking lots in Mexican auto factories because workers can’t afford the products they produce.”', 'Trade relationships with Canada go back just as far as Mexico but workplaces are different thanks to the country’s strong unions. They also began with Henry Ford, who built his first Canadian automotive plant in 1904, largely to escape tariffs levied on Canadian imports.', 'A vestige of carriage production, the 35% tariff on vehicles coming into Canada prompted the Detroit automaker to set up branch operations across the river, according to Dimitry Anastakis, the L.R. Wilson and R.J. Currie Chair in Canadian Business History at the University of Toronto. ', '“It makes no sense to have a Ford Motor Plant in Detroit and a Ford Motor Plant in Windsor, but that’s exactly what happened because of the tariff wall,” he said. ', ""This lasted until the 1960s, when Canada launched a trade war of its own against the United States after the invention of the automatic transmission, which flooded the Canadian market with vehicles made in Canada, and thus not subject to the tariff. By then, only U.S. companies' branch plants remained in operation due to the scale and investment the auto industry requires."", 'In 1965, the Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement was enacted, a precursor to NAFTA that removed tariffs between the two countries. This led to increased auto manufacturing in Canada and more jobs. The agreement was abolished in 2001, but by then NAFTA had more or less superseded it. ', 'Without tariffs getting in the way, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler were able to “rationalize” their production in North America, including their Canadian facilities, to streamline and focus on the continent rather than one market at a time.', 'The effects were immediate and profound. In 1963, before the auto pact, out of the 632,000 vehicles built in Canada, a grand total of 921 were exported to the United States. In 1973, with the auto pact in full bloom, Canada built 1,589,000 vehicles and exported 1,092,000 of them to the United States.', ""“In the '60s and '70s, the Canadian industry was integrated right into the American industry,” Anastakis said. "", ""As for labor, in its earliest incarnation, Canada’s union presence was an extension of the UAW, formed in 1937 following a strike at General Motors's Oshawa, Ontario, plant. "", 'Under Bob White, the legendary president of the Canadian Auto Workers, the branch split off and formed an independent union in 1984. Since then, it has merged with others to form Unifor in 2013. ', '“Canada has good labor laws. In a number of ways, they’re better than the U.S.,” Shaiken said. ', 'Many of the jobs these agreements created favored blue-collar workers, but most of the decision-making behind vehicle and parts production stayed in the U.S.', '“For more than 60 years, the Canadian and American auto industries have depended on each other. Together, we build best-in-class cars and trucks that remain the envy of the world,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in an emailed statement. “Unionized autoworkers fought for and won gold standard collective agreements that created good jobs, raised living standards and built strong, vibrant communities.”', 'She added: “Two-way trade in automotive goods is about $160 billion per year and split virtually down the middle in near perfect balance. Threatening damage to this relationship, as Trump is doing, threatens good, union jobs on both sides of the border. It is both reckless and dangerous.”  ', 'General Motors currently employs about 120,000 people in North America. Of those, 90,000 work in the U.S., 23,000 work in Mexico, and 6,000 work in Canada. ', ""Ford Motor Co. has approximately 71,974 employees in North America, as of estimates provided on the company's website for the third quarter of 2024. Of those, 5,480 are employed in Canada, and 7,000 in Mexico. "", 'Stellantis has about 75,500 total North American employees, with 52,000 in the U.S., 8,600 in Canada and 14,900 in Mexico.', 'Jackie Charniga covers General Motors for the Free Press.

Is Trump’s trade war with Mexico and Canada over?,https://www.vox.com/politics/398024/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-trudeau-sheinbaum-trade-war,"['When news breaks, you need to understand what matters — and what to do about it. At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can’t do it on our own.', 'We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Why the tariffs might — and might not — still happen.', 'by Eric Levitz', 'Donald Trump has incoherent and unhinged beliefs about trade policy.', 'He also has a penchant for pretending to be a “crazy guy” for the sake of increasing his leverage in negotiations.', 'This made it difficult to tell whether his proposal for an across-the-board 25 percent tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports was sincere. That policy was supposed to take effect Tuesday. But a flurry of last-minute diplomacy on Monday yielded agreements that postponed the onset of the tariffs for 30 days, while the US and its neighbors worked on shoring up security along America’s northern and southern borders.', 'In exchange for the delay of these tariffs, the Mexican government agreed to send 10,000 national guard troops to its northern border while Trump vowed to stem the flow of American firearms into Mexico. Canada, meanwhile, pledged to implement its 1.3 billion border security plan (which it had already enacted in December). Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he was “very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured.”', 'For now, it looks like Trump’s avowed desire to upend North American trade — if not to coerce Canada into becoming a US state — was more negotiating ploy than agenda. Or at least, it appears that Trump was not sufficiently committed to that agenda to stick by it, even in the face of overwhelming industry opposition.', 'This said, Trump did not withdraw his proposed tariffs — he only shelved them for one month. There is a strong case for thinking that those tariffs will never take effect. But there is also some reason to fear that he might revive his plans for a North American trade war, if perhaps in more modest form.', 'There are at least three reasons to think that Trump will delay his 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico indefinitely:', 'The economic consequences of Trump’s tariffs would be punishing. Altogether, his newly proposed duties would cost the typical US household more than $1,200 a year, according to an analysis from the Peterson Institute of International Economics. And this de facto tax increase would be regressive, burdening lower-income households more than wealthy ones, as the former spend a greater share of their incomes on foreign consumer goods.', 'Economic nationalists might frame this as the necessary price of revitalizing American manufacturing. Yet high tariffs on Canada and Mexico would also have devastating consequences for US producers. The North American economy has been structured around the presumption of near-zero tariffs for three decades now. American automakers have constructed supply chains that stretch across our nation’s northern and southern borders: Different stages in the production of a car component often take place in different countries, with inputs being sent from back and forth across borders as many as eight times before the finished product is complete.', 'If US carmakers need to pay a 25 percent tax each time they purchase a car part from a Canadian or Mexican supplier, their costs of production will soar. By one estimate, Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico would add $60 billion in costs to the industry. And firms would seek to pass on those costs to consumers. The consultancy Wolfe Research has estimated that the price of a new car would jump by about $3,000, according to Bloomberg.', 'Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders warned over the weekend that imposing steep tariffs on housing materials and lumber from Canada and Mexico would lead to a slowdown in residential construction, at a time when America is suffering an acute housing shortage (and the rebuilding of Los Angeles is already taxing our nation’s supply of construction labor and materials).', 'More broadly, Trump’s tariffs would increase the value of the dollar, which means that US-made goods would become more expensive for foreign consumers (and that’s before considering the retaliatory tariffs that Trump’s moves would provoke). Thus, his policy would render American exporters’ goods less competitive in global markets, while also forcing up their costs of production by imposing a tax on foreign-made inputs.', 'Given that Trump’s tariffs would hurt almost all voters and business interests aligned with his party, it’s reasonable to suspect that they will eventually be withdrawn.', 'The second reason to think that Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada will never take effect is that they were officially intended to fight “a drug war,” not a trade war. Trump claims that our neighbors to the north and south have been abetting the transfer of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants into the United States — and that this constitutes a “national emergency.” This was the legal basis for Trump to enact the tariffs immediately, under the auspices of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).', 'If the point of Trump’s tariffs was not to restructure the North American economy — but merely to persuade Canada and Mexico to increase their border control efforts — then the three countries should have little difficulty negotiating a lasting economic peace.', 'The third reason to think that Trump will eventually withdraw his tariffs on Canada and Mexico is that we’ve seen this movie before.', 'In 2019, Trump promised to slap a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports — and increase it steadily to 25 percent — if Mexico failed to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants entering the United States. After Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” migration policies, the tariff threat was dropped.', 'What’s more, in 2017, Trump reportedly told his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, to tell South Korean officials that America’s president was “so crazy,” he could pull out of the US-Korean trade deal “any minute” if he didn’t get concessions.', 'Thus, at times in the past, Trump has tried to make his intentions on trade policy appear more extreme than they were in actuality, for the sake of gaining leverage in negotiations.', 'All this said, there are still three reasons to think that Trump may yet revive his North American trade war:', 'Although White House officials — such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett — have taken pains to portray Trump’s tariff as a response to the fentanyl crisis, this appears to be a legal nicety.', 'Over the weekend, Trump posted on Truth Social:', 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!', 'He further lamented that “The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the “Stupid Country” any longer. MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!”', 'These are not complaints about Canadian or Mexican drug policy. Rather, they are arguments for blowing up the North American trade system because it leads America to run trade deficits with Canada and Mexico — which means that the US is “subsidizing” those countries.', 'This is awful economic analysis. The fact that America purchases more goods from Canada than vice versa does not mean that we are subsidizing that country. You purchase more goods from your grocery store than it purchases from you. In that sense, you run a “trade deficit” with your grocer. But it does not follow that when you hand over your currency in exchange for a shopping cart full of food, you have just made a charitable donation to Kroger.', 'Nevertheless, Trump complains far more often about the fundamental undesirability of trade with Canada than about that nation’s supposed laxity about stopping fentanyl exports.', 'Separately, he reiterated on Monday that he would like to use tariffs to coerce Canada into accepting its annexation by the United States.', 'Suffice to say, “Canada still isn’t the 51st state” probably does not qualify as a national emergency that would legally justify extraordinary economic measures from the president. For this reason, the Trump administration likely faces a legal imperative to minimize the ambitions behind the president’s tariff policy.', 'The second reason to think that Trump will stick to his guns on tariffs is that he’s been making the same arguments about trade for nearly 40 years.', '“A lot of people are tired of watching other countries ripping off the United States,” Trump said of America’s trade deficit in 1987. “They laugh at us behind our backs. They laugh at us because of our own stupidity.”', 'Trump had no motivation at that time to pretend to believe that trade is a zero-sum exchange — in which the country running a surplus is the winner, and one running a deficit is the loser. The man was still a real estate mogul at that time, not a federal official, so his remarks could not have been intended as a mere diplomatic ploy.', 'Finally, Trump’s decision to keep his tariffs relatively modest during his first term may say more about the team that was around him at that time than it does about his own pragmatism.', 'In 2017, Trump reportedly came extremely close to suddenly withdrawing the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It took the concerted lobbying of his cabinet to stay his hand (a feat that was only achieved by presenting him with maps that suggested Trump voters would be disproportionately harmed by a collapse of trade with Canada and Mexico). Trump ultimately renegotiated and retitled NAFTA, dubbing his new version, The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).', 'Indeed, Trump tried to pursue a wide variety of radical and impulsive policies — from withdrawing the US from NATO or bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities — only to have his inner circle deter him or slow-walk his orders.', 'But his advisers do not seem inclined to check his impulses this time around. To the contrary, they have expedited the execution of Trump’s most harebrained ideas, such as releasing dammed waters into California’s Central Valley — a policy ostensibly aimed at fighting wildfires in Los Angeles, but which in practice accomplished little beyond endangering homeless people, overwhelming local water managers, and depleting a water supply that Golden State farmers will need to draw on come spring and summer.', 'In the end, it seems much more likely than not that Trump will beat a full retreat on his 25 percent tariffs. Although a new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports is still slated to take effect Tuesday, the president plans to renegotiate the USMCA in 2026. To this point, whenever Trump’s idiosyncratic impulses have come into blatant conflict with his corporate backers’ core interests, the latter have taken precedence.', 'Yet the threat that Trump will eventually pursue profoundly costly protectionist policies cannot be fully dismissed. He has many genuinely mistaken conceptions about economic reality, and less political incentive to put pragmatism above ideological conviction than ever before.', 'Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

Canadians grapple with a sense of betrayal after Trump’s trade war and 51st state threats,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/canadians-grapple-with-a-sense-of-betrayal-after-trumps-trade-war-and-51st-state-threats,"['', 'Rob Gillies, Associated Press', 'Leave your feedback', 'TORONTO (AP) — As Canadians absorb U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state, one thing has become abundantly clear: One of the world’s most durable and amicable alliances — born of geography, heritage and centuries of common interests — is broken.', 'Canadians are feeling an undeniable sense of betrayal after Trump declared a trade war against America’s northern neighbor and longtime ally. Trump keeps threatening Canada’s sovereignty and and vowing to put sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products, though Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday afternoon the tariffs will be postponed by at least 30 days after he promised more cooperation on the border.', 'WATCH: A look at how tariffs work and the impact they have on the economy', 'In Canada, discussion and disapproval are everywhere. Canadian hockey fans have even been booing the American national anthem at recent National Hockey League games. Addressing the nation this past weekend, Trudeau channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. “We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,” he said.', 'The Canadian jitters, some worry, could go beyond the moment. “The damage is going to be long-lasting,” said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. “The Americans won’t be trusted anymore. The 51st state stuff is just contemptuous. It treats Canada like we don’t even exist.”', 'The ties between the two countries are without parallel. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.5 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the United States. Each day, about 400,000 people cross the world’s longest international border. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.', '“He wants to come after us?” said Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province of Ontario. He has said that it feels like being stabbed in the heart by a family member. “I’ve yet to hear one American citizen say Canada is the problem,” he said.', 'Some Canadians are circulating lists of Canadian products they can buy instead of American items and others are canceling vacation plans to the United States. The U.S. Travel Association said the tariffs on Canada could impact Canadian visitation to and spending in the United States, noting that Canada is the top source of international visitors to the United States, with 20.4 million visits last year.', '“What he is doing now is unprecedented and highly damaging for the relationship. … He is eroding Canadians’ trust towards the U.S. in ways that will make it hard to repair the relationship,” said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. He says many Canadians feel betrayed by Trump’s threats and attitude, especially because the two countries have long enjoyed strong economic, cultural and geographic ties.', '“It’s certainly one of the worst moments in Canada-U.S. relations since the creation of Canada in 1867,” Beland said. “His talk about making Canada the 51st state is a direct attack against the country’s sovereignty. Even if we exclude that threat, he shows no respect for Canada’s sovereignty and institutions.”', 'Canadian officials said they are applying 25% retaliatory tariffs to American imports including beverages, cosmetics and paper products. A second phase will be even more punishing.', 'Trudeau did hold out hope that Trump wouldn’t “punish” Canada. Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum put their planned tariffs on hold Monday for a month to give time for further negotiations, and Mexico said it planned to deploy 10,000 members of its national guard to address drug trafficking.', 'Trudeau noted that the United States and Canada have built the most successful economic, military and security partnership the world has ever seen — a relationship that, he says, has been the envy of the world.', '“As President John F. Kennedy said many years ago, geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends, economics has made us partners and necessity has made us allies,” he said.', 'Trump also plans to put a 10% tariff on Canadian energy. Underscoring the potential effects, Canada provides more than 4.3 million barrels of oil a day to the United States. The U.S. tends to consume about 20 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It has been producing domestically about 13.2 million barrels.', 'Yet Trump keeps saying the United States doesn’t need Canada for anything and said again Monday that he’d like to see Canada become the 51st state.

"From lip balm to sneakers, here's how Trump's China tariffs could raise prices",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/lip-balm-sneakers-trumps-china-tariffs-raise-prices-rcna190632,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'U.S. consumers could start seeing price hikes on a wide variety of goods made in China after the United States began collecting a 10% tariff Tuesday on all Chinese imports, reigniting a trade war between the two countries that’s at risk of accelerating.  ', 'President Donald Trump said he was instituting the tariffs until China took action to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the United States. China responded by announcing plans to put its own tariffs next week on certain U.S. products, including coal, oil, agricultural machinery and pickup trucks.', 'While the 10% tariff is smaller than the 60% tariff Trump had threatened during his campaign, investors and industry analysts expect the added cost to have a ripple effect across certain industries that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing. It has also raised fears among retailers that it could be just the opening salvo in a prolonged tit-for-tat with China. ', '“There’s just a lot of uncertainty about how to price goods, because it’s a 10% tariff now on top of whatever duties we’re already paying, but what will it be a month from now or two months from now?” said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. Priest said he was hearing a lot of confusion from companies at a trade show he was attending Tuesday in New York.', '“It’s almost impossible to confidently cost your goods without knowing where this duty plane will land,” he said.', 'With more than half of footwear sold in the United States coming from China, Priest said, consumers are likely to see an increase in shoe prices, though some of the cost will be absorbed by retailers and other businesses throughout the supply chain. The typical sneaker already has around a 20% tariff on it, including a 7.5% tariff added during Trump’s last term. With the additional 10% tariff, a midrange sneaker could ultimately have $18 to $20 added to the total cost, he said. ', '“This is a movie we’ve seen before, and it doesn’t bring jobs back to the U.S., and it does raise costs, so it’s a challenge for us to see the end game or the point,” Priest said. “We do want to work with the administration to tamp down inflation — that was the president’s mandate, and we agree with it — but this is not the way to go about doing that.”', 'Tariffs are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods from China, such as retailers or wholesalers, when those goods arrive at U.S. ports. Those companies will then have to decide whether to pass the higher costs on to consumers by raising prices or absorb the cost by taking lower profits or trying to cut costs elsewhere.', 'China’s retaliatory tariffs on around $24 billion worth of U.S. products could also have an impact on U.S. workers if companies see significant declines in sales from Chinese customers.', 'China also said it was launching an antitrust investigation into Google and took aim at two other U.S. companies: gene sequencing maker Illumina Inc. and PVH Group, the owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, placing them on a blacklist limiting their ability to sell their products there.', 'But China’s moves were more limited in scope than some companies had feared: They apply to around 14% of U.S. exports to China, while Trump’s tariffs apply to all goods sold in the United States from China.', 'That could be an effort by China to send a signal that it is willing to target specific U.S. companies without escalating a trade war too quickly. ', '“The measures are fairly modest, at least relative to U.S. moves, and have clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, wrote in an analysis note. “But there is a risk that retaliation backfires by encouraging Trump to escalate tariffs further.”', 'On the campaign trail, Trump made tariffs central to his plan to revive the U.S. economy, arguing that putting significant duties on imports would encourage companies to move their manufacturing plants to the United States and protect industries from cheaper overseas competition. Trump has also proposed using revenue from tariffs to pay for other policy priorities. ', 'But economists and businesses have warned that tariffs would be likely to have little effect on driving manufacturing back to the United States because of the costs, logistics, regulatory barriers and lack of labor many industries would face in moving production stateside. A study of Trump’s tariffs during his first term found they reduced overall manufacturing employment by driving up costs for companies importing parts and materials from China. ', 'Ahead of Trump’s election, companies had been warning that they would be likely to raise prices in response to the tariffs if Trump carried through on his threats, including AutoZone, Columbia Sportswear and Black and Decker. None of the companies responded to requests for comment Tuesday on whether they planned to go through with those plans. ', '“If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer, and we’ll pass them through,” AutoZone CEO Philip Daniele told investors in September.', 'Consumers are also likely to see higher prices on clothing, with about 30% of U.S. apparel coming from China. The tariffs could cause clothing prices to rise as much as 2% for some brands, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. ', 'Personal health and beauty products could feel the impact of the tariffs, as well. Cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes the vast majority of its products in China, may have to increase prices by around 3% unless it is able to offset those costs by negotiating concessions from suppliers or shifting more production out of China, Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian said in a note to clients.', 'Apple is among the technology companies most at risk from the tariffs with the vast majority of iPhones made in China.', ""During Trump’s first term, Apple was able to mostly avoid having to pay Trump’s tariffs by receiving government waivers. While Apple hasn't commented on how it will respond to the latest round of tariffs, analysts expect it to have to raise prices to compensate for the higher costs."", 'The tariffs could also drive up drug prices. About half of generic drugs taken in the United States are made entirely overseas, and China is increasingly playing a role in making those ingredients, according to data from United States Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit group that focuses on the safety of the drug supply chain.', 'Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '']"

US President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Saturday to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and a 10 percent tariff on China, declaring a national emergency due to illegal migration and drugs. The tariffs, which include a carve-out of a lower 10 percent levy on Canadian energy, carry major implications for the economy, diplomacy, and geopolitics. Our experts explain it all below.', 'Click to jump to an expert analysis:', 'Josh Lipsky: Beijing is breathing a sigh of relief', 'Jason Marczak: Can there be a short-term end game for Mexico?', 'María Fernanda Bozmoski: The tariffs on Mexico are counterproductive to Trump’s goal of curbing immigration', 'Joseph Webster: These tariffs could upend energy sector business models', 'Barbara C. Matthews: This historic move means US trade treaties now come with a caveat', 'Maite Gonzalez Latorre: Canada’s next prime minister must articulate how the country will navigate the Trump presidency', 'L. Daniel Mullaney: The tariffs genie is out of the bottle', 'Two things are true at the same time. These tariffs are more sweeping than any trade action we saw in the first Trump term and will impact over one trillion dollars in goods. The president has invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in an unprecedented way, levying major trade barriers all at once against the United States’ three largest trading partners. But it’s also true that China is likely breathing a sigh of relief.', 'Policymakers in Beijing have to be wondering how it happened that the United States tariffed its allies at 25 percent and its greatest economic challenger at 10 percent. Of course, the 10 percent comes on top of the already existing tariffs in several sectors, but it still means that most goods from Mexico and Canada will face a steeper fine than those from China. It’s much tamer than Trump’s campaign threat of 60 percent. (In fact, despite that threat, we predicted a China scale-down right after the election.) ', 'Why the softening toward China? Inflation is one reason. Trump knows his moves on Canada and Mexico will have an impact, and there’s only so much price pressure US consumers are going to put up with. But leverage is another. Mexico and Canada depend far more on the United States than the United States depends on them. (Though there’s no doubt every economy in North America is going to bear some cost in these new trade wars.) China is a different story. China’s economy is less dependent on trade than Canada and Mexico—and only 15 percent of its exports go to the United States, compared to nearly 80 percent for Washington’s neighbors.', 'Now faced with 10 percent tariffs, Beijing has a trick up its sleeve: currency devaluation. Watch to see how the yuan moves this week. It’s likely that most of this increase can be absorbed through exchange rates—and that’s one reason why Beijing’s rhetoric will be sharp but its economic retaliation will potentially be more muted.', '—Josh Lipsky is the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center and a former adviser to the International Monetary Fund.', 'Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum quickly responded to Trump’s announcement of 25 percent tariffs with an instruction for Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard to implement what she termed “Plan B” to include retaliatory tariff and non-tariff measures. If Mexico uses a similar playbook as to when Trump threatened tariffs in 2019, retaliatory tariffs will follow a red-state strategy. This could include pork from Iowa, dairy from Wisconsin, and industrial goods, including vehicles and electronics, particularly from Michigan and Ohio—all states that voted for Trump in 2024. ', 'Sheinbaum has until Tuesday to see how to de-escalate and what carve-outs may be possible. Back in 2019, Trump threatened escalating tariffs that didn’t end up going into effect since Mexico committed to specific measures to curb immigration. What can Mexico agree to do this time around that would satisfy Trump? The fact sheet announcing the tariffs stated that the purpose is to “hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.” The Mexican authorities will be seeking to find some type of common understanding on new measures—like in 2019—that could be undertaken so the US president can claim a quick win.', 'Trump may be looking at the success of last Sunday’s tariff threats against Colombia—25 percent immediately with an escalation to 50 percent after one week—as proof that tariffs can deliver quick wins. Last week, Colombia acquiesced by the end of the day to Trump’s demands around acceptance of deportees. The Colombia tariff threats were the first test of this new administration as to whether governments would quickly capitulate. But Colombia is not Mexico or Canada.  ', '—Jason Marczak is vice president and senior director at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.', 'This evening’s announcement of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican imports—it is still unclear when they will take effect—is counterproductive to Trump’s goals of curbing immigration to the United States. The Trump administration has, oddly, made it cheaper for US manufacturers to source supplies from China than from Mexico. The tariffs will quickly erode the economic growth and improvements in supply-chain security that were direct results of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). China is stronger, and Mexico and the United States are weaker, because of this move. ', 'The implementation of these tariffs will weaken the Mexican peso and the country’s economy. Depending on how long the tariffs remain in place, Mexican exports could fall by over 10 percent, and its gross domestic product (GDP) contraction could reach up to 4 percent. However, it is clear from the White House statement that the logic behind these tariffs on Mexico is not economic; they are being used as a tool to force flashy results on the security front. The Trump administration has gone as far as accusing Mexico of colluding with drug trafficking organizations. This marks the first time in decades that US-Mexico economic collaboration has been so explicitly dependent on security concerns. Most importantly, the signals it sends to the United States’ top trading partner ahead of the revision of Trump’s signature trade agreement—the USMCA—are far from positive. Finally, the timing of this announcement could not be worse, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio embarks on a trip to Central America to build goodwill among allies in the same neighborhood. ', '—María Fernanda Bozmoski is the director of impact and operations and lead for Central America at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.', 'Trump has issued an order imposing 25 percent additional tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent additional tariff on imports from China. According to the White House, “energy resources from Canada” will face a lower 10 percent tariff. If these tariffs are indeed implemented, the impact on energy markets will depend on the tariffs’ duration and the definition of “energy resource.”', 'Many US energy producers will never have imagined that supply chains in Mexico and especially Canada would ever face 25 percent tariffs. Consequently, some energy sector business models will break down if these tariffs are sustained.', 'It’s unclear which Canadian energy resources will qualify for the 10 percent tariff, though crude oil likely will. If the lower rate excludes imports of electricity, batteries, and minerals, this could significantly impact US electricity, battery, and defense technology markets. US capabilities in artificial intelligence and drones will be impacted, as well.', 'As David Goldwyn and I noted in our examination of USMCA energy trade, US refineries will now pay higher prices for Mexican and Canadian crude in the wake of tariffs. Texas refineries have historically taken in Mexican crude oil but will now be forced to pay higher input costs, harming their export competitiveness to other markets, especially Latin America. Midwestern refineries will also face higher prices, as they have few if any alternatives to Canadian crude oil and will pass along many costs to consumers. Finally, the US automotive sector could be severely impacted by these tariffs, due to deep supply chain interconnectedness with its North American neighbors. US development of autonomous vehicles will likely slow, perhaps considerably. The Midwest—especially Michigan—may be particularly squeezed by auto-related tariffs, as the mobility industry accounts for an estimated 27 percent of the Wolverine State’s gross state product.', '—Joseph Webster is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center and Indo-Pacific Security Initiative; he also edits the independent China-Russia Report.', 'Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on US trade treaty partners accelerates centrifugal forces that have been pulling at the global economy for over a decade.', 'The White House announced that the tariffs are being imposed under the president’s authority from IEEPA rather than through established trade treaties. This move is historic.', 'IEEPA provides the president with broad powers to address any “unusual or extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States.” Centering the tariff action on national security should make the move World Trade Organization-legal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade’s Article XXI national security exception. If the Trump administration invokes the Article XXI national security exception, the United States and Ukraine will be the only nations ever to do so.', 'Trump has now asserted that the United States faces a dire national emergency as China exploits the free trade area created by the USMCA. The tariff policy implies that the United States’ closest trading partners are turning a blind eye to the fentanyl trade.', 'This is not, however, the first time that the United States has imposed tariffs to address non-trade vulnerabilities. President Richard Nixon invoked the Trading with the Enemy Act to impose across-the-board 10 percent tariffs after the United States left the gold standard in the early 1970s. His goal at the time was to avoid a balance of payments crisis. Nor would the United States be the only nation to use tariff policy to promote domestic policy priorities. The European Union is creating import levies based on their estimated embedded carbon emissions under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.', 'The harsh truth is that international economic interdependencies also create real vulnerabilities. The world has been adjusting to those vulnerabilities since the COVID-19 pandemic. Today’s tariff decision being premised on a national emergency shifts US trade policy past the trade paradigm. It signals that Washington no longer considers international trade to be either benign or always beneficial.', 'The United States’ trading partners have had time to prepare for this action. Geoeconomic alliances are already shifting. Canada’s prime minister has turned inward, encouraging domestic provinces and territories to decrease their own internal trading barriers to offset the disruption in trade flows with the United States. The European Union this month concluded a new trade agreement with Mexico. ', 'Today’s tariff decision tells the world that the United States’ trade treaty commitments come with a caveat: trading partners must support US policy priorities. The United States already exerts considerable economic influence through economic statecraft associated with US dollar sanctions policy. Tariff policy has now been enlisted into action as well.', '—Barbara C. Matthews is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council. She is also CEO and founder of BCMstrategy, Inc.', 'As Canada navigates a race to determine who will lead the Liberal Party and become the next prime minister, the 25 percent Trump tariffs could potentially devastate Canada’s economy, shrinking its GDP by 2.6 percent (approximately 78 billion Canadian dollars), according to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. While these tariffs would also harm the US economy, reducing its GDP by 1.6 percent (roughly $467 billion), Canada is more vulnerable due to its greater reliance on trade with the United States.', 'As the Liberal Party chooses its next leader, it is crucial for the party to present a strong, unified front to the public, despite internal challenges. More importantly, the candidates must articulate how Canada will navigate a Trump presidency, and fighting against these tariffs could provide an opportunity to achieve unity on this issue. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country is readying a “forceful and immediate response,” which signals a strong, unified Canadian front.', 'Canada and the United States have long maintained a strong and vital economic and diplomatic relationship. The next Canadian government has the opportunity to assert itself and push back against unfavorable policies like the 25 percent tariff. This week, Rubio met with Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly in Washington to discuss collaboration on shared global challenges, including securing borders and ensuring energy security. With the United States emphasizing energy policy, Canada’s role as a key ally in this sector will become increasingly significant and could be a way to fight back against the tariffs.', '—Maite Gonzalez Latorre is a program assistant at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.', 'With this action, the United States has crossed a Rubicon. Previous tariffs have generally been in response to the injurious impact of some set of unfair trade practices, import surges, or balance of payments issues. Using the emergency power to impose tariffs in response to unrelated issues like drugs and immigration sets the stage for further tariffs in response to any number of other non-trade priorities. The genie is out of the bottle.  ', '—L. Daniel Mullaney is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center and GeoEconomics Center.

The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war - what comes next?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vdjpj7pe3o,"['Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.', ""Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days."", 'But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?', ""China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant."", ""Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power."", 'This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.', 'Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.', 'He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.', 'The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.', ""Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to."", 'That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.', ""The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process."", ""The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come."", ""That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America."", ""These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?"", ""Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?"", ""The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage."", 'What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?', 'President Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy.', ""Netanyahu's far-right allies will cheer the proposal, but Arab nations will see it as ethnic cleansing of Palestinians."", 'The full Senate voted in the evening, approving Bondi as the next attorney general, tasked with running the Department of Justice.', ""The BBC's Analysis Editor takes a look at the latest round of tariffs announced by President Trump - and what the US has got in return."", 'Benjamin Netanyahu praised the idea and called the US president the ""greatest friend Israel has ever had"" in the White House.', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.
