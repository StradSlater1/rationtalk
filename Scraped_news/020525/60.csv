Asteroid impact on Moon carved massive canyons within minutes,https://www.science.org/content/article/asteroid-impact-moon-carved-massive-canyons-within-minutes,"['When a massive asteroid slammed into the Moon’s southern region 3.8 billion years ago, it shot out debris that—with energy 130 times greater than Earth’s entire nuclear arsenal—carved lunar fissures comparable in size to the Grand Canyon within minutes. The finding, reported today in Nature Communications, doesn’t just illuminate a cataclysmic bit of lunar history—it may have cleared up a concern for future NASA missions.', 'The results indicate the spray of debris kicked up by the asteroid likely spared the exploration zone where astronauts plan to collect and date debris fragments from an even older impact. Such missions could answer questions about the Moon’s earliest history and perhaps even the story of how life took root on Earth.', 'The finding is “very important,” says Georgiana Kramer, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute who was not involved with the work. It provides some reassurance to the astronauts of NASA’s Artemis mission that their sample collection won’t be contaminated with the younger asteroid impact debris, she says.', 'Artemis astronauts are scheduled to take off for the Moon’s surface in 2027. NASA plans to send them to the south pole, where they will collect rocks from the South Pole–Aitken Basin, the largest and oldest visible basin on the Moon. The 2500-kilometer-wide basin is shallow but immense, and the Artemis team’s exploration zone will be littered with rocks dredged up during its formation from a massive asteroid strike.', 'The Moon’s surface is scarred by many basins and craters. The younger they are, the smaller they tend to be, notes Jacob Bleacher, chief exploration scientist for a NASA directorate helping plan the future Artemis lunar missions. This trend reflects the disappearance of the massive asteroids that once whizzed through our early Solar System, slamming into young planets and perhaps periodically snuffing out nascent life on Earth. As the number of these enormous rocks in our Solar System decreased, life on Earth finally had a chance to gain “a foothold,” Bleacher says.', 'The South Pole–Aitken Basin in theory represents the oldest record of the most massive impacts in the Earth-Moon system. Determining the basin’s age would tell scientists how long ago the Solar System’s planets were still experiencing life-snuffing asteroid strikes. In short, its age would likely reflect an upper bound on when life on Earth started to become sustainable.', '“The lunar surface is basically like a time stamp of the very early history of our solar system,” says study co-author Danielle Kallenborn, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London.', 'The problem is that scientists have yet to definitively nail down the South Pole–Aitken Basin’s age. By collecting rocks from the basin’s inception, they hope to update the current estimates, about 4.3 billion years.', 'But sitting inside of the South Pole–Aitken Basin, just north of the Artemis mission’s planned landing site, is the much smaller Schrödinger Basin, the second youngest of the Moon’s great basins at an estimated 3.8 billion years old. The later asteroid that excavated the Schrödinger Basin could have easily sprayed debris over the Artemis exploration zone, complicating efforts to date the underlying South Pole–Aitken Basin rock.', 'So, Kallenborn and colleagues mathematically re-enacted the minutes after a 25-kilometer-wide asteroid carved out the Schrödinger Basin. The scientists analyzed photographs and surface height measurements collected by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2009. They determined where exactly the asteroid must have landed and its angle of descent for the ejected debris to carve two canyons that run in straight lines away from the Schrödinger Basin’s rim, making the depression look like a hand forming the peace sign.', 'These canyons—“as wide, and deeper than, the Grand Canyon on Earth”—were formed when the debris excavated rows of smaller craters that overlapped or collapsed into each other, says study co-author David Kring, a planetary scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute. The team was even able to calculate the size and velocity of the debris fragments that gouged the canyons’ individual craters.', '“Just a bit of maths basically,” Kallenborn says.', 'The team’s calculations suggest the asteroid flew over the south pole at a shallow angle before hitting the ground, plowing northward and spraying debris in front of it, away from the planned Artemis exploration zone. That’s good, Kramer notes. “We want to be sampling South Pole–Aitken ejecta or even pristine crust,” she says.', 'The Moon rocks astronauts intend to collect from the dead lunar surface are the best substitute for fragments of Earth’s own catastrophic collisions with asteroids. Weather, water, and geological activity on Earth have ground any remnants of those catastrophes into “mineral relics,” Kring says.', 'The lunar surface holds the evidence for when life on Earth became a long-term prospect, Bleacher says. “The Moon has been sitting there with us pretty much for the whole history of the Earth, just recording what’s happened.”', 'Collin Blinder is an intern at Science and a graduate student in the science communication program at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Close to the moon's south pole are two canyons each comparable in size to the Grand Canyon that were born in a much different process."", 'New research indicates that these canyons, in an area called the Schrödinger impact basin on the side of the moon perpetually facing away from Earth, were dug out in a matter of less than 10 minutes by rocky debris sent violently aloft when an asteroid or comet struck the lunar surface roughly 3.8 billion years ago.', 'This impact unleashed about 130 times the energy of the current global inventory of nuclear weapons, according to geologist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute of the Universities Space Research Association in Houston, lead author of the study published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.', ""The scientists mapped the canyons using data obtained by NASA's robotic Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft and then employed computer modeling to determine the flow directions and speed of the flying debris. The rubble would have traveled at up to about 2,200 miles (3,600 km) per hour, they found."", 'One of the canyons, called Vallis Planck, measures about 174 miles (280 km) long and 2.2 miles (3.5 km) deep. The other, called Vallis Schrödinger, is about 168 miles (270 km) long and 1.7 miles (2.7 km) deep.', ""The impact occurred during a period of heavy bombardment in the inner solar system by space rocks thought to have been dislodged following a change in the orbits of the solar system's giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - that is thought to have happened at the time."", 'The object that struck the moon is estimated to have been about 15 miles (25 km) in diameter, larger than the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago and doomed the dinosaurs.', '""When the impacting asteroid or comet hit the lunar surface, it excavated a tremendous volume of rock that was launched into space above the lunar surface before it came crashing back down. Knots of rock within that curtain of debris hit the surface in a series of smaller impact events, effectively carving the canyons. Adjacent to the canyons, the debris would have covered the landscape,"" Kring said.', 'The canyons are straight-line scars on the lunar surface, extending outward from a large and round impact crater, with smaller craters from unrelated impacts also in the vicinity.', 'This marked one of the last of the large impacts on the surfaces of the moon and Earth during this bombardment period in the early solar system. The moon still bears these scars on its surface while Earth does not.', 'That is because Earth recycles its surface as part of a geological process called plate tectonics. The outer part of our planet is comprised of continent-sized plates of rock that move very slowly. At points where they meet, one plate dives beneath the other, sending rock that had been at the surface deep below. The moon, a less dynamic body, lacks plate tectonics.', ""The new findings have relevance for lunar exploration in the coming years. The Schrödinger impact basin is located near the exploration zone for NASA's planned Artemis mission, intended to place astronauts on the moon for the first time since the Apollo landings of the 1970s."", '""Because debris from the Schrödinger impact was jettisoned away from the lunar south pole, ancient rocks in the polar region will be at or close to the surface, where Artemis astronauts will be able to collect them. Thus, it will be easier for astronauts to collect samples from the earliest epoch of lunar history,"" Kring said.', 'Those rocks would allow scientists to test the hypothesis that the moon was created when a large impactor collided with Earth and sent molten material into space, as well as the hypothesis that the lunar surface early on was an ocean of magma, Kring added.', '(This story has been corrected to say 10 minutes, and not 10 seconds, in the headline)', ""(Reporting by Will Dunham, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)"", '', 'Advertisement']"

The Moon’s epic ‘grand canyons’ were gouged out in 10 minutes by an asteroid strike,https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-moons-epic-grand-canyons-were-gouged-out-in-minutes/,"['Introducing the all-new Astronomy.com Forum! Become a part of our Community!  >> Visit Now', 'Each year, millions of visitors marvel at the geological intricacy and beauty of the vast chasm of the Grand Canyon carved through the Arizona desert by 5 million years of water erosion. It is interesting to contemplate the force of water as over the eons the Colorado River meticulously sliced through layers of Arizona bedrock. The erosion of rock is a slow process, but Nature is patient, and the flow of water is relentless. Today, the Grand Canyon reaches up to 18 miles (29 kilometers) wide and sinks more than a mile (1,857 meters) below the arid Arizona landscape — a majestic sight with staggering proportions.', 'But even more mind-boggling is to contemplate the forces that created the Grand Canyon-sized gouges of Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck on the Moon — in roughly 10 minutes. These immense valleys extend outward from the northern rim of Schrödinger Basin, created when an asteroid the size of Manhattan slammed into the Moon’s farside nearly 4 billion years ago. ', 'In an article published Feb. 3 in Nature Communications, planetary scientists David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston and Danielle Kallenborn and Gareth Collins of Imperial College London present a scientific analysis of the creation of these features — which they describe as lunar grand canyons — and a fascinating tourist’s guide.', 'Schrödinger’s location on the southern farside of the Moon hides the basin and its lunar grand canyons from terrestrial eyes, but interest in the region is ramping up. At 75° south latitude, it lies just 190 miles (300 km) from the Moon’s south pole, and just inside the southern rim of the 1,500-mile-wide (2,400 kilometers) South Pole-Aitkin Basin — the Moon’s largest and oldest impact crater. It’s also only 78 miles (125 km) from the series of crewed landing zone candidates known as the Artemis Exploration Zone — where NASA intends to land astronauts starting with the Artemis 3 mission. And next year, Schrödinger is set to be visited by for the first time by a robotic lander, a NASA-funded commercial mission built by Draper Laboratory.', 'Kring and his colleagues present a fascinating study of the monumental forces that created Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck. Considering it took 5 million years to create the Grand Canyon in Arizona, it’s hard to comprehend that its lunar counterparts were created in a mere 10 minutes. But the team gained an understanding of this incredibly brief period by analyzing the 15 secondary craters lying within Vallis Schrödinger, using images and elevation data taken by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.', 'Although the lengthy gouge of Vallis Schrödinger is called a “valley”, it is also technically a catena, or linear string of craters — each 6 to 10 miles (10 to 16 km) wide — created by a series of impacts of projectiles from the same source. In this case, a linear stream of projectiles were ejected by the titanic blast that created the Schrödinger Basin.', 'Typically, secondary craters formed by ejecta from a primary crater less than 160 miles (260 km) wide are 4 percent the width of the primary. Extrapolating this to the 320-kilometer size of the Schrödinger Basin reveals the string of 15 secondary craters within Vallis Schrödinger are slightly oversized. This might be because the impact territory where the secondaries formed was already seismically weakened and softened by the previous South Pole-Aitkin basin impact, which occurred around half a billion years earlier. Nonetheless, the location and orientation of both Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck inescapably show their origin was the Schrödinger Basin impact.', 'By analyzing the ballistics of projectiles thrown by the Schrödinger Basin impact, the team determined how long it took to create the radial lunar grand canyons. The velocities needed to throw the 0.3- to 0.8-mile-wide (0.5- to 1.25 km) blocks of ejecta that created the length of Vallis Schrödinger, assuming trajectory angles of between 20° and 45°, were around 0.6 mile per second (1 km per second). The projectiles that created the farthest reach of the longer Vallis Planck had a slightly higher velocity of around 1.23 to 1.28 km per second. (This is about half of the lunar escape velocity, the authors note.) These velocities, trajectory elevations, and impact distances point to flight times for the flying mountains of 4.5 to 15 minutes for the creation of Vallis Schrödinger and 5.2 to 15.4 minutes for the longer Vallis Planck. The heaviest canyon forming impacts thus occurred within a 10-minute interval.', 'Equally staggering is the calculated force of the impacts creating the chain of craters within Vallis Schrödinger. The valley was created by forces 700 times greater than the yield of all U.S., Russian, and Chinese nuclear tests combined, or 130 times the power of the global inventory of nuclear weapons.', 'The proximity of the Schrödinger Basin to the southern polar location — the target of the upcoming Artemis crewed landings — also has implications for the science performed at these sites. The Artemis landing zones zones under consideration are within the 300-mile (500 km) splash range of ejecta thrown from the Schrödinger basin, meaning many tons of Schrödinger ejecta may be covering up important samples from the South Pole-Aitkin Basin. One of the Artemis goals is to recover samples of South Pole-Aitkin ejecta that could have originated as deep as 62 miles (100 km) below the surface. But the good news is that analysis of Vallis Schrödinger, Vallis Planck, and other ejecta rays from the Schrödinger Basin reveal the ejecta pattern is asymmetrical, with less of it directed toward the Artemis Exploration Zone.', 'The creation of the lunar grand canyons are fascinating to contemplate and just one facet of unravelling a complete understanding of our natural satellite. The coming months and years will bring more insights as the lunar puzzle is solved.

When that curtain fell, its rocks plunged up to 3.5 kilometers into the lunar surface with energies 130 times greater than the global inventory of nuclear weapons, new calculations show.', 'And that’s how a hailstorm of boulders carved out two gargantuan canyons on the moon in less than 10 minutes.', '“They landed in a staccato fashion, bang-bang-bang-bang-bang,” says planetary geologist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, who reports the finding February 4 in Nature Communications.', 'The two channels, Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck, extend in straight lines from the 320-kilometer-wide Schrödinger basin marking the initial impact. Until now, the circumstances of the canyons’ formation have been a mystery. The canyons are 270 and 280 kilometers long and up to 2.7 and 3.5 kilometers deep, respectively.', '“The landscape of the south polar region of the moon is so dramatic,” Kring says. “If it occurred on Earth, it would be a national or international park.” The Grand Canyon, for example winds for a sinuous 446 kilometers and is only 1.9 kilometers deep at its deepest point.', 'A comparison of the width and depth of the Grand Canyon along the Bright Angel hiking trail (top) and Vallis Planck on the moon’s south pole (bottom). The colors each represent 500 meters of elevation.', 'The south pole also contains some of the oldest rocks on the moon, perhaps dating back to its formation about 4 billion years ago. Collecting samples from there would allow scientists to test some of the biggest mysteries about the moon’s history.', 'But there’s a potential problem. The rim of the Schrödinger basin is about 125 kilometers from the anticipated landing site of NASA’s Artemis astronauts. If the impact that formed the basin splashed rock in all directions, those tantalizing older rocks could have been buried.', 'So Kring, together with geologists Danielle Kallenborn and Gareth Collins of Imperial College London, analyzed spacecraft images of the Schrödinger basin and its canyons to deduce the physics of their formations. In addition to finding that the canyons’ origin was swift and explosive, the team found that the straight lines converge toward the southern edge of Schrödinger basin, not the middle. That convergence suggests the impacting object came in toward the moon at an angle, and splashed material preferentially northward, away from the Artemis exploration zone.', '“That means that very little of the Schrödinger material is going to be burying this very old terrain,” Kring says. “We have an opportunity to peer deeper into lunar history and better understand the earliest epoch of the Earth-moon system.”', 'Questions or comments on this article?

Here we use photogeologic mapping of those canyons and related impact ejecta deposits to show the trajectory of the impacting asteroid or comet, which produced an asymmetrical pattern of crater excavation and transport of ejected debris. The flow directions of that ejected debris and the speed of its subsequent impact with the lunar surface are calculated, as is the energy that carved the canyons in less than ten minutes. The study implies that most of the excavated debris was ejected away from the lunar south pole, minimizing the amount of debris that covers the >\u20094 billion year old units that will be explored by Artemis astronauts.', 'A global lunar landing site analysis1 found that the Schrödinger impact basin2 is the best location for addressing National Research Council science objectives for lunar exploration3, prompting geologic studies of the basin and analyzes of potential landing sites for human and robotic missions4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. The first robotic mission is scheduled to land in 2026. Schrödinger basin is also the best analog surface expression for Earth’s buried Chicxulub impact crater19, which is linked to the extinction of dinosaurs and most life at the end of the Cretaceous20,21,22,23. The Schrödinger impact basin is remarkable for streams of rocky debris that it ejected, carving two canyons that are comparable to Earth’s Grand Canyon in width and depth. Here we describe those canyons, how they formed, and the implications they have for the trajectory of the impactor.', 'The Schrödinger impact basin (Fig. 1) is a peak-ring basin, ~320\u2009km in diameter, ~4.5\u2009km deep, centered at 75°S, 132.5°E (ref. 8, Supplementary Fig. 1), with an estimated age of 3.81 +0.013-0.014 Ga (ref. 24), although some models suggest ~0.15 Ga uncertainty on basins with late Imbrian ages25. Schrödinger’s ~150\u2009km diameter peak ring, a circular mountain range that rises 1 to 2.5\u2009km above the basin floor, was produced by the collapse of a central uplift14. Basalt lava flows and a large pyroclastic vent later erupted on the basin floor and ceased erupting 3.70 +0.02-0.03 Ga (ref. 18). Schrödinger formed in the outer margin of the ~2400 km-diameter South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin26, which is the largest and oldest impact basin on the Moon. The rim of the Schrödinger basin is within 300\u2009km of the south pole and within 125\u2009km of the Artemis exploration zone, which is the first destination of Artemis astronauts.', 'a Orbital view of the Schrödinger peak-ring impact basin and two radiating canyons carved by impact ejecta.

Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck (see Fig. 3 for close-up views) intersect near the southern rim of the basin (white point). The size of the point indicates the uncertainty. The projected bearing of the primary impactor (yellow) runs through the point of intersection and the basin center. A third unnamed feature extends in an uprange direction.', 'The Schrödinger basin is surrounded by an asymmetrical ejecta blanket (Fig. 1) that has been mapped27 up to distances of 500\u2009km from the basin rim, although ejecta components not visible from orbit would have been deposited at far greater distances. The basin is also surrounded by several impact ejecta rays (ref. 28; Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), including Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck (Fig. 1), which are the foci of this work. Such rays are the result of closely-spaced and radially-aligned secondary impact craters that excavated deep canyons in the lunar crust.', 'Vallis Schrödinger is ~270\u2009km long, ~20\u2009km wide, ~2.7\u2009km deep, and occurs within the limits of the continuous ejecta blanket. The deepest portion of Vallis Planck is ~280\u2009km long, ~27\u2009km wide, and ~3.5\u2009km deep, but a ray of secondary craters extends beyond the continuous ejecta blanket to a length of 860\u2009km. For comparison, the length of the sinuous Grand Canyon is 446\u2009km (277 river miles) between Lees Ferry and Grand Wash Cliffs, which includes the length of Marble Canyon. The deepest point of the Grand Canyon is 1.949\u2009km (6393\u2009ft) below the north rim near Nankoweap Rapids and 1.452\u2009km (4765\u2009ft) below the south rim near Cremation Creek. For illustration purposes (Fig. 2), a transect of Vallis Planck is compared with the Grand Canyon along the Bright Angel Trail, which is a location familiar to most Grand Canyon National Park visitors.', 'a Width and depth of the Grand Canyon along the Bright Angel hiking trail from the south to the north rim (annotated in Supplementary Fig. 4). b Width and depth of Vallis Planck. The cross-section of Vallis Schrödinger is in Supplementary Fig. 6. Colors show 500\u2009m elevation steps.', 'Fifteen secondary craters are discernable along the length of Vallis Schrödinger, with diameters between 10 and 16\u2009km, clearly defined by their eroded but still visible crater rims (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). The maximum diameter of secondary craters produced by primary craters ≤\u2009260\u2009km in diameter is 4% of the primary crater’s diameter29, which, if extrapolated to the 320\u2009km diameter Schrödinger basin, implies 13\u2009km. Observed 10–16\u2009km dimensions of secondary craters in Vallis Schrödinger approach and slightly exceed that value.', 'Deepest sections of Vallis Schrödinger (a and b) and Vallis Planck (c and d) without and with identified craters. Green circled craters are clearly defined by their eroded crater rims, while yellow circled craters are inferred from the terrain and are not used in the crater scaling calculations. A wall of Valles Planck (lower left of c and d) appears to have collapsed into the canyon. Location of Supplementary Fig. 6 and Fig. 2 transects are shown (b and d), respectively.', 'On the Moon, the depth/diameter (d/D) of fresh primary craters <\u200915\u2009km in diameter is 0.196 +0.038-0.027 (ref. 30) with those 400\u2009m to 10\u2009km in the polar region is 0.21 (ref. 31). The d/D value of lower-velocity secondary craters is less, ∼0.1 for small craters32. While no fresh secondary craters produced by basin-size primary craters exist, we infer that the craters along Vallis Schrödinger likely had a d/D value\u2009<\u20090.2 when formed. Measurements after ~3.8 billion years of erosion indicate an average d/D of 0.14 for Vallis Schrödinger and 0.11 for Vallis Planck.', 'Craters are partly overlapping and superposed by younger craters. Secondary craters are not everywhere preserved along the length of Vallis Planck, which was modified by the collapse of canyon walls as seen in images (Fig. 3) and a topographical transect (Fig. 2). Both canyons suffered erosion, mostly driven by impact gardening of the regolith, seismic slumping, and downslope creep. The upper canyon walls are the steepest portions of the crater rays and have slopes of 27 to 34°, which is the angle of repose for lunar highland material (30°; ref. 33).', 'Velocities of secondary ejecta are 0.95, 0.97, and 1.05\u2009km/s for Vallis Schrödinger assuming ballistic angles of 45, 30, and 20°, respectively (Fig. 4) (see “Methods”). Maximum velocities of ejecta to produce Vallis Planck are larger (1.23 to 1.28\u2009km/s), reflecting longer travel distances. Those velocities are about 50% of the escape velocity from the Moon (2.38\u2009km/s). Flight times of debris producing the 270 km-long main canyon are 4.9 to 15.0\u2009min for Vallis Schrödinger over the entire range of potential ejection angles, with canyon-forming secondary impacts occurring within a\u20095\u2009min interval. Flight times of debris producing the 280 km-long main canyon are 5.2 to 15.4\u2009min for Vallis Planck over the entire range of potential ejection angles, with canyon-forming secondary impacts occurring within a\u20095\u2009min interval.', 'Secondary impact velocities (red) and calculated secondary projectile diameters (blue) for Vallis Schrödinger (round symbols) and Vallis Planck (triangular symbols), assuming a 30° flight trajectory, with vertical bars on the symbols representing a range produced by flights from 20 to 45°. Black dashed line is a fit to the secondary impact velocity symbols. The Gray dashed line is the approximate extent of the continuous ejecta blanket.', 'At these ejection speeds, theoretical estimates of mean ejecta fragment sizes range from one-fiftieth to one-twentieth of the primary impactor diameter34, which was ~25\u2009km for the Schrödinger impact14. This implies mean ejecta fragment sizes of 0.5 to 1.25\u2009km diameter at the range of the Schrödinger canyons. This is consistent with our calculated secondary crater projectile diameters for Vallis Planck, which are mostly <\u20092\u2009km (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the implied projectile diameters for the secondary craters that carved Vallis Schrödinger range from 2.3 to 5.2\u2009km, which are considerably larger than theory would suggest. This suggests that the canyon-carving secondary craters for the more proximal Vallis Schrödinger formed by near simultaneous impact of clusters of ejecta fragments, rather than by impact of individual ejecta fragments. Clusters of secondary craters are commonly observed35,36 and produce shallow d/D as observed in the Schrödinger rays. Further, those clusters of fragments spread out with radial distance beyond the continuous ejecta blanket36. Thus, it is logical that clusters closer to the point of impact (i.e., within the continuous ejecta blanket) would have a smaller spread (be more tightly clustered) and produce simple craters like those observed. In the more distal portions of Vallis Planck, where the areal density of ejecta fragments is lower, the secondary craters are more likely to be formed by individual fragments.', 'As shown in Fig. 4, the transition in fragment size is abrupt and coincides with the edge of the continuous ejecta blanket. The transition is evident both between the rays and within the Vallis Planck data, where one crater lies within the continuous ejecta. This suggests that the difference in fragment size (or crater size) cannot be attributed to target heterogeneities between the two rays. Either side of the transition, fragment sizes are consistent as a function of distance, which is one of the criteria used to discriminate secondary craters from primary craters37.', 'The canyon-forming rays are asymmetrically distributed around the Schrödinger basin and do not converge at the basin center. Rather, the bearings of Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck converge at 78.21947°S, 143.71996°E (Fig. 1). If that convergence is the point of first impact38, then a line from that point through the basin center suggests a SSE to NNW trajectory (33.5° west of north; Fig. 1) for the impacting asteroid or comet. Thus, rather than a point explosion, like that characterizing small impact events (e.g., Meteor Crater on Earth39), the distance between that point of impact and the center of the basin implies a distributed impact zone. That distributed impact zone is reflected in the bearings of other, smaller rays of ejecta (Supplementary Fig. 3) that were produced by material ejected as the projectile penetrated deeper into the target and it moved towards the basin center40. A distributed impact zone may imply a relatively low primary impact angle38,41,42. Likewise, it may imply relatively low angles for secondary ejecta, ranging from 20 to 45° (ref. 42). Because the secondary craters are circular, the ballistic flight angles are probably in the upper end of that range (i.e., 30 to 45°; ref. 43).', 'Alternatively, the rays may be lateral sprays of ejecta44 (i.e., part of a butterfly pattern) from an impact with a trajectory of 22.3° east of north, as implied by the largest swath of continuous ejecta (Fig. 1). In that case, ballistic launch angles would have been higher. We derive from published data44 that they would have been 51.3\u2009±\u20096.5° and 46.0\u2009±\u20096.9° for Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck, respectively.', 'The minimum kinetic energy necessary to produce measured craters along Vallis Schrödinger is 1.68\u2009×\u20091020\u2009J. Because most craters are overlapping, the minimum kinetic energy is likely to be overestimated (\u2009~\u200915%) in regions with high secondary crater density. However, gaps between identified craters in other regions offset this effect. Assuming a similar distribution of excavating impacts along the entire crater ray implies a total kinetic energy of 3.39\u2009×\u20091020\u2009J. Values for Vallis Planck are less well constrained, but higher (\u2009~\u20091.21\u2009×\u20091021\u2009J) because of its greater length. The energy to produce the grand canyons on the Moon are 1200–2200 times larger than the nuclear explosion energy once planned to excavate a second Panama Canal on Earth, more than 700 times larger than the total yield of US, USSR, and China’s nuclear explosion tests, and about 130 times larger than the energy in the global inventory of nuclear weapons45,46,47,48 (Supplementary Table 1).', 'The extrapolated convergence of Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck suggest a trajectory 33.5° west of north for the asteroid or comet that produced the Schrödinger basin. In contrast, the continuous ejecta blanket covers the greatest distances in a direction 22.3° east of north. We note that direction is downslope, towards the center of the SPA basin. Thus, ejecta may have flowed farther in the downhill direction, towards the SPA basin center, and ejecta blanket extent may not be a measure of the impactor’s trajectory. Towards the center of SPA, the edge of the continuous ejecta blanket is ~1\u2009km below the rim of the Schrödinger basin, while the topography rises ~4\u2009km in the opposite direction. Nonetheless, an impactor trajectory 22.3° east of north, as implied by the largest swath of continuous ejecta, rather than 33.5° west of north as implied by the orientation of crater rays, remains possible and is consistent with the rays being lateral sprays of ejecta44. In either case, the trajectory of the basin-forming impact is away from the south pole.', 'Two other asymmetries exist in the Schrödinger basin. A portion of the peak ring is not visible at the surface in one quadrant. That observation was attributed to a preexisting weakness in the crust produced by an older Amundsen-Ganswindt basin-forming impact event2. Also, the peak ring rises higher on one side of the basin than on the other, which has been attributed to a change in crustal thickness from 20 to 40\u2009km in the target rocks hit by the Schrödinger impactor14,19. Those pre-impact target properties should not, however, have produced two rays that converge near the edge of the Schrödinger basin, rather than its center. An oblique impact away from the south pole must still be the root cause for that convergence. We also note that those peak-ring asymmetries are not aligned with the trajectory of the projectile, implying target properties were more important than trajectory in shaping the peak ring.', 'The Schrödinger impact trajectory has important implications for the pending Artemis missions to the south polar region. If ejecta had been distributed symmetrically around the basin, scaling relationships for complex crater ejecta49 imply 176 +59-44 m (at the edge of the Artemis exploration zone) to 42 +29-17 m (at the south pole) of ejecta would cover the region. However, a shallow impact trajectory away from the south pole implies highly asymmetric ejecta with a thinner and potentially absent distal ejecta blanket over the Artemis exploration zone. This resolves one of the two greatest uncertainties in estimating the amount of post-SPA debris in the Artemis exploration zone. Still needed is a similar assessment of the distribution of ejecta around the Amundsen-Ganswindt basin which has the potential to cover SPA ejecta, too.', 'The asymmetric ejecta distribution implied by Schrödinger’s crater rays suggests there is less Schrödinger impact ejecta covering candidate landing sites and, thus, astronauts and robotic assets will find it easier to sample SPA and underlying primordial crust samples. Impact craters of order 1\u2009km (similar in size to Arizona’s Meteor Crater) can penetrate, excavate, and deposit on the surface material from beneath the Schrödinger impact ejecta blanket. Excavation depth is approximately 1/10 the crater diameter50, which would be 100–200\u2009m for craters 1–2\u2009km diameter. An impact code parameterized for lunar regolith,51 suggests excavation depths down to 300\u2009m are possible for a 1\u2009km diameter crater. Those values are consistent with the observed excavation and transient crater depths of the 1.25\u2009km Meteor Crater, which are ~150\u2009m and ~335\u2009m, respectively52. Of the 5251 impact craters >\u20091\u2009km in diameter within the Artemis exploration zone, 3243 of them have diameters between 1 and 2\u2009km (ref. 53), indicating access to superposed units (Amundsen-Ganswindt and SPA ejecta) may be common.', 'The Schrödinger impact basin is the second youngest basin on the lunar surface, so samples of impact melt could be used to test its estimated 3.81 +0.013-0.014 Ga age (ref. 24) and, thus, test the lunar impact cataclysm hypothesis, which posits an enhanced period of impact bombardment at that time54; this is the highest priority objective of the National Research Council3. Samples from the underlying SPA impact ejecta blanket will provide samples of SPA impact melt, from which the age of the oldest and largest basin on the Moon can be determined. SPA excavated the entire crustal column and upper mantle55, so a cross-section of the Moon to a depth of ~100\u2009km may be accessible, albeit dismembered. Where craters puncture the SPA ejecta blanket, they can expose primordial crust. Excavated SPA material and any primordial crust can be used to test the lunar magma ocean hypothesis for planetary differentiation and the giant impact hypothesis for the origin of the Earth-Moon system, among many other objectives. Because the Schrödinger impact event dispersed the bulk of its ejecta away from Artemis candidate landing sites, those objectives are more likely to be met.', 'The well-preserved Schrödinger basin crater rays provided an opportunity to calculate the velocity of secondary impactors (0.95 to 1.28\u2009km/s), the size distribution of those impactors (up to 5.2\u2009km diameter), and kinetic energy that excavated the resulting canyons (3.39\u2009×\u20091020\u2009J for Vallis Schrödinger and 1.21\u2009×\u20091021\u2009J for Vallis Planck). The orientations of the rays imply a primary impact bearing of 33.5° west of north and an impact angle <\u200945° if they formed from downrange ejecta or, alternatively, a bearing of 22.3° east of north if they formed from lateral ejecta. Whereas Arizona’s Grand Canyon was carved by water over the last 5 to 6 million years and from integrated paleocanyons that formed over 70 million years56,57, the Moon’s Vallis Schrödinger and Vallis Planck were carved by streams of impacting rock in less than 10\u2009min.', 'Spacecraft images and elevation data were derived from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Data were accessed through the Data Node for Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Planetary Data System (PDS) products using its Geographic Information System (GIS) QuickMap tool58, which integrates LROC images with Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) elevation data. We used Wide-Angle Camera (WAC) images (100\u2009m/px); narrow-angle camera (NAC) images (0.5 to 2\u2009m/px); NAC region of interest (ROI) mosaics in the Lunar Globe (3D) view; and terrain elevation and slope derived from the LOLA (version SLDEM2015 (\u2009+\u2009LOLA)) (ref. 59). Secondary craters were identified photogeologically and topographically. QuickMap arc and elevation transect tools were used to measure rim-to-rim diameters of secondary craters in ejecta rays. Three rim-to-rim measurements were taken (i) along the crater ray, (ii) approximately perpendicular to the ray, and (iii) another location where the crater rim was well defined. If the crater rims were ambiguous or the crater seemed heavily modified, a fourth, additional measurement was taken. Possible craters without clearly defined crater rims, too heavily modified craters or craters that are more likely to have been caused by a separate (later) event were disregarded. Some craters in Vallis Planck are marked as “inferred” craters. These likely craters are included in the figures but were not used for any crater scaling or energy calculations. Based on the rim-to-rim diameters, the craters were then (manually) approximated first with a polygon and then with a circle. The final diameter measurement used in subsequent calculations is the diameter of the circle. We compared the average of the three rim-to-rim diameter measurements with the circle diameter. For most craters in Vallis Schrödinger this “error” is less than 5%. It is slightly higher in Vallis Planck due to canyon wall modifications affecting the rim-to-rim diameter measurements. Depth measurements were taken along the profile lines used for the rim-to-rim diameter measurements. Along each of those profile lines, the elevation of the crater rims and the lowest point was determined. The depth was then calculated as (rim_1 + rim_2)/2 – low. For each crater the maximum depth out of those three or four profiles was then selected. The SLDEM has a typical vertical accuracy of ~3 to 4\u2009m which is sufficient for the depth measurements. For each secondary crater, measurements were made of the distance from the Schrödinger basin center, the intersection point with an inferred transient crater rim14 on that trajectory, the intersection point of the two largest crater rays (Fig. 1), and the intersection point with the transient crater rim on this trajectory. The procedure accounts for all possible ejection points and, therefore, can be used to estimate minimum to maximum secondary ejecta velocities. For visualization of the results we used ArcMap (v. 10.5.1) and ArcGIS Pro.', 'The crater rays present a unique opportunity to calculate impact velocity (\\(\\nu\\)) using measured distances between the secondary craters and their ejection point in a ballistic formula for a curved planetary surface:', 'where Φ\u2009=\u2009R/2Rp. We considered ejection and secondary impact angles (ϴ) of 20°, 30°, and 45° to account for uncertainty in primary impact angle and ejecta launch position.', 'Calculated secondary impact velocities and the diameters of each crater were then used with an analytical scaling relationship for dry sand60,61 assuming anorthositic norite material8 with a density of 2,660\u2009kg/m3 (ref. 62) and a gravity-dominated impact regime, to determine the sizes of impactors and kinetic energy that produced the secondary craters. The secondary craters that produced the canyons are several hundred kilometers away and were formed by impacts at speeds close to 1\u2009km/s. This speed is only just below the speed range of the impact experiments that have been used to develop the crater scaling relationships that we apply in this work60. These scaling laws have been shown to be appropriate for some conditions at even lower impact speeds43,63,64,65,66.', 'All data associated with this study are shown in figures and provided in Supplementary Information.', 'Kring, D.
