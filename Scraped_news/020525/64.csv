LA Coast Community Accelerates Towards Pacific Amid Increasing Landslides,https://www.sciencealert.com/la-coast-community-accelerates-towards-pacific-amid-increasing-landslides,"[""As if Los Angeles doesn't have enough to contend with in the aftermath of its catastrophic fires, NASA is now warning slow landslides are accelerating to threaten hundreds of buildings on the Palos Verdes Peninsula."", ""While the threat hopefully isn't immediate, such unstable land can suddenly collapse, as with the Mud Creek landslide in 2017, so researchers are trying to better understand the warning signs."", ""This region on the Palos Verdes Peninsula has been slowly slipping towards the ocean for decades, but new radar data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JLP) has found the rate of this ocean-bound slide has increased."", ""The area of land on the move has also expanded substantially since California's Geological Survey mapped out the at-risk boundaries in 2007, now encompassing many more buildings."", '""We\'re seeing that the footprint of land experiencing significant impacts has expanded, and the speed is more than enough to put human life and infrastructure at risk,"" JLP\'s geoscientist Alexander Handwerger warns.', ""Radar measures and data from the European Space Agency's Copernicus satellite indicate that during Autumn of 2024 residential land was moving as much as 10 centimeters (4 inches) per week towards the Pacific Ocean."", 'This increase in motion followed record-breaking rainfall in 2023 along with further heavy downpours in early 2024.', '""The large majority of landslides around the world are triggered by intense or prolonged rainfall,"" NASA physical scientist Dalia Kirschbaum explains on YouTube.', 'Just as they have worsened fire conditions, warming global temperatures have also increased these extra strong deluges of rain, making landslides yet another threat exacerbated by human-caused climate change.', ""As the atmosphere warms, its capacity to hold water increases, leading to more extreme rain events as well as more severe dryness when it's not raining. This dramatic speed-up of the water cycle is creating a phenomenon called hydroclimate whiplash where conditions jerk rapidly from extremely wet to extremely dry and back again."", 'In 2022, Handwerger and colleagues were surprised to discover that landslides move faster during rainy seasons than dry seasons, regardless of whether the soil is dry or already wet.', ""Handwerger plans to continue investigating these risks by studying how hydroclimate whiplash will influence the earth's movement."", 'A better understanding of these interactions could inform monitoring networks that provide alerts to state officials and communities.']"
NASA finds parts of Palos Verdes Peninsula is creeping toward the ocean several inches a week,https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/02/04/nasa-shows-how-much-land-is-moving-palos-verdes-peninsula/78211058007/,"['Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory found that portions of land on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, home to an affluent Southern California city that faced an emergency declaration last year, have crept toward the Pacific Ocean by as much as four inches a week, according to a news release.', 'Parts of the Los Angeles County peninsula “are part of an ancient complex of landslides and has been moving for at least the past six decades,” according to the news release. The active area expanded after heavy rain drenched Southern California in 2023 and early last year, the news release said.', 'The findings were from data collected by NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, an imaging radar instrument that was attached to a jet. The flights took place between Sept. 18 — which was about two weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Rancho Palos Verdes — and Oct. 17.', 'It comes as Southern California Edison announced in January that it’d be restoring power to specific areas in Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills, two cities that call the peninsula home.', ""Last September, Newsom declared a state of emergency for Rancho Palos Verdes in response to the accelerated land movement that disrupted many residents' utility services, including electricity and gas. The loss of utility services triggered evacuation warnings for some residents."", 'Properties identified as Southern California Edison alerted properties had been alerted by Southele land movement” over the past 18 months was putting “the utilities serving the area” at risk, and that service could b discontinued.', ""“The ground movement affecting your neighborhood has created unsafe and hazardous conditions, which have already impacted SCE's infrastructure, causing power poles to lean and power lines to fail,” the July 30th update read. “The impact on SCE's equipment caused by these hazardous conditions increases the risk of system failure, fire ignition, or other public safety hazards.”"", 'In late August, a landslide collapsed a power line, leading to a small brush fire, USA TODAY reported. Southern California Edison said in an update that the fire showed that they could not mitigate the public safety risk from land movement in the area. By early September, the utility provider cut power to more than 200 homes and businesses, according to the emergency declaration.', 'Paris Barraza is a trending reporter covering California news at The Desert Sun.

NASA Radar Shows a Surge in Landslide Activity in California,https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/nasa-radar-shows-a-surge-in-landslide-activity-in-california,"['In Southern California, the growing risk of landslides has put many communities on edge, demonstrated by radar data from NASA focused on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County.', 'The peninsula, which sits south of Los Angeles and juts out into the Pacific Ocean, contains an ancient landslide complex that has been active for the past six decades. However, exacerbated by intensifying bursts of rainfall due to climate change, the gradual movement of the landslides has drastically accelerated in recent years. ', ""The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team, featuring collaboration between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech, has been eyeing the progress of the Palos Verdes landslides, recently reporting heightened activity that occurred during the fall of 2024."", 'Radar imagery from ARIA revealed that during a four-week period (September 18, 2024 to October 17, 2024), land in the residential area of the peninsula slid toward the ocean by as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) per week. The data was captured from four flights of NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), a radar instrument mounted to an aircraft that flies over areas to measure Earth deformation.', 'The acceleration of landslides in the peninsula can be attributed to record-breaking rainfall in California in 2023 and heavy precipitation in early 2024, according to NASA. ', 'California is especially vulnerable to rapid shifts in weather trends that climate scientists are starting to call weather whiplash.', 'A prime example of weather whiplash is the startling turn from dry to wet conditions that California experienced a few years back; from 2020 to 2022, the state went through a drought that marked its driest three-year period on record. Then, from late December 2022 to March 2023, severe rainfall raged across the state, leading to over $4 billion in property damage and at least 22 deaths.', 'Cycles of precipitation are routine in California due to the process of El Niño and La Niña, fueled by continuously changing climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean. However, the impact of extreme climatic swings has escalated with the warming of the atmosphere, causing it to hold more moisture and, in turn, amplifying precipitation. ', 'Read More: Worsening Climate ""Whiplash"" Helps Explain Why California\'s Wildfires Were so Ferocious', 'The Palos Verdes landslides have threatened multiple communities on the peninsula, but they’re perhaps most disastrous to the city of Rancho Palos Verdes on the coast. The Ancient Altamira Landslide Complex that the city sits on takes up over two of its roughly 14 square miles. A major portion of this complex is the Portuguese Bend landslide, which has greatly disturbed the neighborhood of the same name. ', 'The Portuguese Bend neighborhood has seen a substantial increase in landslide activity starting in 2023, as surface water from heavy rainfall percolated into the ground, adding weight to the unstable soil. The active landslide complex, according to the city of Rancho Palos Verdes, has expanded from 380 acres to 700 acres. ', 'The city notes that the landslide has decelerated since October 2024 due to drier weather conditions and the dewatering wells. Increased landslides are likely to return with wet weather, but the city hopes to curb them through the Portuguese Bend Landslide Remediation Project, a long-term effort planned since 2017; the project aims to remove water trapped underground and prevent rainwater from entering the ground, with objectives like infilling fissures in the earth and planting more native vegetation.', 'Part of the domino effect of climate change, landslides are expected to become increasingly prevalent in the coming years, not just in California, but elsewhere across the U.S. and the globe. In the U.S., the areas most likely to be affected by landslides are mountainous, like the Pacific Coast Ranges, the Rockies, and Appalachia.', 'Our writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.
