Trump’s Gaza relocation comment is liable to kill his own diplomatic agenda,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-repeated-baffling-claim-gaza-visit-netanyahu-rcna190680,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'UPDATE (Feb. 4, 2025, 8:35 p.m. E.T.): During a joint press conference Tuesday night with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Donald Trump said: “The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we’ll do a good job with it, too.”', 'As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday and King Abdullah II of Jordan does the same on Feb. 11, one question keeps bubbling up to the surface: Can Donald Trump, the self-professed “peacemaker” who has eyed the coveted Nobel Peace Prize for many years, go where no U.S. president has gone before by striking a transformational, comprehensive peace deal in the Middle East? ', 'Trump’s critics would answer with a big eye roll. And yet his pressuring of Netanyahu to sign onto the first stage of a three-phase ceasefire deal with Hamas — three more hostages were freed over the weekend in return for more than 100 Palestinian prisoners, the fourth round of prisoner exchanges since the deal took effect in mid-January — at least gives some credibility behind the ambition. Trump clearly has Middle East peace on his mind, and the Trump administration’s desire to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and four Arab countries, is never far from its lips. As national security adviser Mike Waltz said before Trump even stepped foot into office for his second term, Israeli-Saudi normalization is a “huge priority” for the team. ', 'Trump clearly has Middle East peace on his mind.', 'But Trump can kiss all of this goodbye if he intends to move forward with his ongoing calls to expel the Palestinian population from Gaza, an idea he referenced during his joint press conference with Netanyahu at the White House. While he didn’t specifically use the word “expel” in his remarks, his suggestion that Palestinians might want to think about packing up their things and going to another area while reconstruction commences has caused shock and trepidation across the Arab world. Trump even suggested that his plan was in the works, with various countries contacting him and pledging assistance. Whether or not that’s the case, Trump appears increasingly invested in making this relocation scheme a reality. “Gaza is a demolition site right now,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “You can’t live in Gaza right now.” ', 'If this were just another one-off, rambling comment from Trump, perhaps it could be dismissed as a nothing-burger. But it isn’t. Trump has referenced this idea on earlier occasions, first on Jan, 28, when he name-dropped Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Jordanian King Abdullah for help in taking Gaza’s population in, and again on Jan. 31, when he was signing executive orders in the Oval Office. Asked by a reporter about Egypt and Jordan’s refusal to play along, Trump matter-of-factly stated that they didn’t have a choice: “They will do it. They will do it. They’re gonna do it, OK? We do a lot for them, and they’re gonna do it.”   ', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'Trump’s pretensions aside, Egypt and Jordan have their own reasons for not wanting to turn themselves into Trump’s enforcers. The most obvious, of course, is that such a proposition is extraordinarily unpopular in the Arab world. Countries throughout the Middle East disagree on a lot of things, but dislocating more than 2 million Palestinians from their homes in Gaza and opening the door to Israeli annexation of the coastal enclave — a fantasy ultranationalist Israeli ministers like Bezalel Smotrich surely dream about — certainly isn’t one of them. If there was any dispute about that, the Arab League put it to rest over the weekend, when it released a statement that such plans “threaten the region’s stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples.” ', 'Egypt and Jordan also have self-interested reasons for dismissing any Gazan relocation effort. Jordan, for one, is already hosting more than 2 million Palestinians who are registered as refugees, making approximately half of the kingdom’s population of Palestinian origin. As a resource-poor country, Jordan doesn’t have the luxury of sustaining a new influx of new refugees and wouldn’t want to, even if Washington or its Gulf allies picked up the tab (the U.S. already provides Jordan with $1.45 billion in foreign aid every year). For Egyptian President Sisi, the issue is less about economics and more about security. This is the same guy, after all, who led a 2013 military coup against a democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood-led government (Hamas was established in 1987 as an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood), killed more than 800 people in the process and jailed tens of thousands more in an attempt to snuff out any resistance. If Sisi wasn’t willing to let Palestinians into Egypt when Israeli military operations in Gaza were at its height, he’s unlikely to do so when the guns have fallen silent (for the time being). ', ""Encouraging or compelling Palestinian civilians to leave Gaza, even if it’s ostensibly to accelerate reconstruction, is liable to kill Trump's diplomatic agenda in the Middle East."", ""Encouraging or compelling Palestinian civilians to leave Gaza, even if it’s ostensibly to accelerate reconstruction, is liable to kill Trump's diplomatic agenda in the Middle East. At the top of the wish list is an Israeli-Saudi normalization accord, something his predecessor Joe Biden couldn’t finalize before his term ended, despite a year-and-a-half of talks with Israeli and Saudi officials. Such a deal would be a groundbreaking accomplishment for Washington in a region often associated with sunk costs, self-defeating policies and missed opportunities. And just as important for Trump, it would be an extremely impressive achievement he could rightfully brag about.  "", 'Yet none of it will happen if Palestinians are forced to leave their own lands. It would snuff out an expansion of the Abraham Accords before the Trump administration even got the ball rolling. Although the Saudi government may have been open to a normalization deal with Israel before the war in Gaza, it’s no longer content with token Israeli concessions on behalf of the Palestinians. The Saudis now want a concrete pathway toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said in September, “The [Saudi] kingdom will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. We affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that.” The Saudi foreign minister reiterated that position in November, and it’s about as clear as it can get: Normalization without a Palestinian state (or at least a tangible process that leads to one) is impossible. ', 'Trump, therefore, needs to ask a fundamental question: What’s more important to him? Doing something all of his predecessors couldn’t do — shepherding formal diplomatic relations between Israel and the Arab world’s most important state — or catering to the whims of Israel’s ultranationalists by proposing a cockamamie scheme that equates to deporting more than 2 million Palestinians from their own homes? The first is difficult to achieve but still doable; the second would cause more problems than they’re worth by compromising Washington’s diplomatic relationships in the Middle East, pushing his dream deal further away, and even risking the collapse of a ceasefire deal in Gaza he helped usher into being. And in this scenario, Trump can forget about seeing his name in the annals of Nobel history.', 'Daniel R.

But today, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting, Trump raised the idea again. Many times, in fact. He explained that he believes that Palestinians would welcome the opportunity to leave the hellish Gaza, which is no longer habitable, to move to new communities that would be built in other countries with money that would be donated by wealthy states in the region. Even though Egypt and Jordan insist they won’t welcome Gazans, Trump says they will.', 'But Trump saved his most unexpected proposal for Gaza until his evening joint press conference with Netanyahu.', '“The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,” Trump declared. “We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.

Asked who would live there, he described how it would be a sort of international zone where anybody would be free to live.', 'If there were any doubt as to whether this was a deliberate proposal of Trump’s, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, posted a meme with the famous Albert Einstein quote about insanity, echoing Trump, who had repeatedly pointed out that everything that has been tried in the past in Gaza has not worked. Trump’s team is using this as another example of Trump breaking with the failed elite consensus.', 'However, the most fundamental flaw of the proposal is the assumption that the Palestinian population primarily is interested in living in a peaceful and prosperous place somewhere else. In reality, Palestinians are largely supportive of Hamas terrorism, they see Gaza as their homeland, and they don’t think Israel should exist. They will not want to leave. And other Arab countries won’t want to take them precisely because they know that it would mean importing a terrorism problem.', 'As far as the second part of Trump’s Gaza plan, there would be no real authority for the U.S. to swoop in and claim ownership in Gaza. And for a president who campaigned on putting an end to endless wars and disentangling from foreign interventions, it would be bizarre to send troops to help create some sort of American economic outpost in one of the most dangerous hot spots in the world.', 'We don’t know what the ultimate play will be here.

Donald Trump’s Gaza plan: the key takeaways,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-gaza-strip-plan-take-over-move-palestinians-ownership,"['The US president has unveiled a plan for the US to take long-term ownership of the Gaza Strip. Here are are the key points from the press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Donald Trump and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, addressed reporters at the White House, where the US president announced his intention to take over the Gaza Strip, move Palestinians to neighbouring countries and redevelop the territory for occupation by “the world’s people”. Here are the main takeaways from their joint press conference on Tuesday evening:', 'In a shock announcement, Trump said the US will “take over” and “own” the Gaza Strip. The US president said he envisioned a “long-term” US ownership of the territory after all Palestinians were moved elsewhere. He did not explain how and under what authority the US can take over the land of Gaza. “We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” he said. He said the US would “level” destroyed buildings and “create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.”', 'The US president called Gaza a “symbol of death and destruction” and that the only reason people want to go back there is because they have nowhere else to go. The 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza should move to neighbouring countries with “humanitarian hearts” and “great wealth”, Trump said. Earlier he had called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians. He said they could be split up across a number of separate sites. Forced displacement of the population would probably be a violation of international law and would be fiercely opposed not only in the region but also by Washington’s western allies. Some human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing.', 'He went on to say that Gaza could become “the Riviera of the Middle East” where “the world’s people” could live there, echoing the previous sentiments of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who said Gaza had very valuable “waterfront property”.', 'Trump gave a vague answer when asked a question on whether he supported a two-state solution. Asked if his view that Palestinians should be relocated from Gaza was a sign that he was against the two-state policy that has been the foreign policy approach of the United States for decades, Trump said no. “It doesn’t mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life,” he said. “They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It’s been horrible.”', 'Trump claimed high-level support among unnamed leaders he had spoken to. “This is not a decision made lightly,” he said, adding that “everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.” He said the move would bring “great stability to that part of the Middle East”.', 'Trump did not rule out sending US troops to secure Gaza. “As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,” he said. On Trump’s idea of taking over Gaza, Netanyahu said the US president “sees a different future for Gaza”, adding: “I think it’s something that could change history.”', 'Trump said he would probably announce a position on Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank in the next month. “We haven’t been taking the position on it yet,” he said. Trump added that he planned to visit the Gaza Strip, Israel and Saudi Arabia.', 'Netanyahu described Trump as “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House”. The Israeli leader said “we have to finish the job in Gaza”, and said “Israel will end the war by winning the war.” Netanyahu praised Trump for “thinking outside the box with fresh ideas” and “showing willingness to puncture conventional thinking”.', 'The Saudi government, in a statement, stressed its rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians from their land and said it would not establish relations with Israel without establishment of a Palestinian state.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.', 'Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu’s government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.', 'Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahu’s desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.', 'The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.', '“This push by Trump doesn’t square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it,” Telhami said. “It’s hard to see the Saudis going along with it.”', 'Netanyahu arrived in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump’s second term comes as the prime minister’s popular support is lagging.

Trump says US will ‘take over’ Gaza Strip and doesn’t rule out using American troops,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/politics/netanyahu-trump-white-house-meeting/index.html,"['', 'President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States “will take over” the Gaza Strip — possibly with the help of American troops — while the Palestinians who live there should leave, a stunning proposal that would dramatically reorient the Middle East and subject a population of more than a million to further displacement.', '“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,” Trump said during a joint press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, later describing his vision for the area as a new “Riviera.”', '“We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,” he said.', 'Asked whether he was willing to send US troops to fill a security vacuum in Gaza, Trump did not rule it out.', '“As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece that we’re going to develop it,” he said.', 'Trump’s comments are a remarkable assertion from a sitting American president, particularly one who rose to political power in the United States through his criticism of America’s longest wars in the Middle East and pledges to return US investments back to its citizens. They open a host of questions about how Trump’s land-grab would proceed, what its legal authorities would be and who would pay for the effort.', '“I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,” Trump told reporters in the East Room of the White House. He said later: “This was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”', 'There will be many in the region who oppose Trump’s plan, despite his claim that all of his interlocutors love it. Already, Egypt and Jordan have rejected the notion of accepting additional Palestinian refugees, wary of destabilization and fearful they will never be allowed back home.', 'Trump suggested that was exactly what he envisioned: a future in Gaza that largely does not involve Palestinians.', '“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,” Trump said in the Oval Office earlier in the day. “I heard that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They live like hell. They live like they’re living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative.”', 'Later, he added that Palestinians could be among those who return to Gaza, but he was clear he did not envision the strip as a permanent home for them.', '“Palestinians also. Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there,” he said.', 'Trump, a former real estate developer, said during his press conference that he had studied the matter “closely, over a lot of months.”', 'Those comments followed his suggestion earlier in the day that Gazans move to a new location provided by one or more nations in the Middle East.', '“I mean they’re there because they have no alternative. What do they have? It is a big pile of rubble right now,” Trump said moments before hosting Netanyahu for Oval Office talks.', 'Trump’s suggestion that Gazans leave the strip permanently amounts to a provocative stance that will endear him to Israel’s most conservative politicians but is generally a non-starter for Israel’s neighbors, who have said they are unwilling to accept new Palestinian refugees from the enclave.', 'At first on Tuesday, Trump framed the matter as a humanitarian one, saying it was impossible to believe anyone would want to remain in the war-torn territory.', '“Why would they want to return? The place has been hell,” Trump said, ignoring a reporter who cried out: “Because it’s their home.”', 'Instead of Gaza, he suggested the Palestinians be provided a “good, fresh, beautiful piece of land” to live.', 'Netanyahu, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office, smiled as Trump was speaking. The Israeli leader, under conflicting pressures domestically, was in Washington to ascertain exactly where Trump stands on the next phase of a ceasefire in Gaza.', 'But Trump’s dim views of Gaza as a permanent home for Palestinians was certain to provide grist for far-right allies of the Israeli leader, who have called on Netanyahu to abandon the temporary truce that was struck last month.', 'Two Arab officials expressed puzzlement, concern and pessimism in the immediate wake of Trump’s unexpected remarks.', 'It was “rough, raw, hard to grasp and digest,” one official said, adding that they “need clarity and further development to become understood.”', 'A second official said the comments could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza, stressing the “profound implications such proposals have on the lives and dignity of the Palestinian people, as well as the broader Middle East.”', '“The reality remains that 1.8 million people in Gaza would resist such an initiative and refuse to leave,” the diplomat said. “Saudi Arabia is unlikely to pursue peace under these circumstances, and other nations may reconsider their commitments to the Abraham Accords.”', 'Trump’s comments, meanwhile, drew skepticism from congressional lawmakers, including from some within his own party.', '“We’ll see what our Arab friends say about that. I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza,” said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. “I think that might be problematic. But I’ll keep an open mind.”', 'The American president’s proclamation laying claim to Gaza as US territory did not appear likely to convince Hamas to return immediately to the negotiating table.', 'Trump said he was still determined to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. “We’d like to get all of the hostages, and if we don’t, it will just make us somewhat more violent,” he said.', 'Trump has claimed credit for the hostages-for-ceasefire agreement struck in the days before he entered office – and even officials in the outgoing Biden administration acknowledged Trump’s imminent arrival helped apply pressure on Israel and Hamas.', 'Netanyahu, perhaps seeking to ingratiate himself with his host, praised Trump’s efforts.', '“I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,” Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.', 'But for all of his prodding to get the deal inked, Trump will still need to oversee the remaining two phases of the three-phase plan.', '“We’ll see what happens. We’re dealing with very complicated people, but a deal can absolutely get done,” he said.', 'There was plenty for Trump and Netanyahu to discuss beyond the immediate matter of the ceasefire agreement.', 'There is the prospect of a broader normalization of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia, that former President Joe Biden had been pursuing before the October 7, 2023, attacks. Trump, who openly pines for a Nobel Peace Prize, may see his opportunity in such a pursuit, which could transform the entire Middle East and create a new bulwark against Iran, a common foe to Jerusalem and Riyadh.', 'It’s not clear his comments Tuesday will be helpful. In a statement on X following Trump’s remarks, the Saudi Foreign Ministry restated its long-held position that it will not commit to normalization of relations with Israel without guarantees of a Palestinian state.', '“Saudi Arabia will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that,” the statement said.', 'Whether Netanyahu is interested in diplomacy – or whether he instead sees Trump’s arrival in Washington as a moment to take decisive action against Iran, potentially even taking out its nuclear program – remains to be seen.', 'Ahead off his arrival, there was speculation Netanyahu could use the talks to take Trump’s temperature on a direct strike, seizing a moment when Iranian proxies have been decimated, Iran’s nuclear ambitions appear to be accelerating and while he has friendlier ties to Washington.', 'Before Netanyahu arrived, Trump signed a directive authorizing a tough approach to Iran meant to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon while warning of “obliteration” should he be assassinated by Tehran’s operatives.', 'Trump said he’d left directions for his team on how to respond should he fall prey to an Iranian assassination plot.', '“I’ve left instructions,” Trump said. “If they do it, they’ll be obliterated.”', 'Netanyahu’s visit lasted several hours and included the joint press conference, all meant to demonstrate Trump’s solidarity with Israel.', 'But the comity between the men belied a relationship that’s more complicated than it sometimes appears – with nothing less than the future of the Middle East potentially riding on Trump’s words.', 'In the lead-up to last November’s election, there was little question among Biden’s team that Netanyahu favored a Trump victory, believing he would enjoy a far wider remit from the American government to prosecute his war aims with Trump in office instead of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.', 'Those predictions have not been wrong.', 'Already, Trump has lifted a hold on heavy bomb deliveries to Israel, rolling back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel amid its war in Gaza.', 'But while Trump is popular in Israel, and Netanyahu enthusiastically welcomed his return to the White House, things haven’t always been so cheerful.', 'When Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election victory in 2020, Trump was enraged at what he saw as betrayal. In the months that followed, Trump accused Netanyahu of disloyalty and fumed to the esteemed Israeli reporter Barak Ravid, now a CNN analyst: “F**k him.”', 'Even three years later, after Hamas launched the worst terrorist attack in Israel’s history, it was clear Trump’s sore feelings hadn’t entirely faded.', '“(Netanyahu) was not prepared. He was not prepared, and Israel was not prepared,” Trump said in an interview shortly after the attacks, comments that drew condemnation even from Republicans.', 'But Trump’s remarks Tuesday, delivered next to Netanyahu, suggest the animosity has been forgotten.', 'The prime minister is planning to remain in Washington well beyond his Tuesday talks with Trump. He arrived to Blair House, the presidential guest residence, late Sunday and is expected to stay until the end of the week, including for meetings on Capitol Hill.', 'This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.', 'CNN’s Alex Marquardt, Kaitlan Collins, Zeena Saifi, Lucas Lilieholm and Irene Nasser contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

I call on the prime minister to announce the adoption of the plan as soon as possible and to begin immediate practical progress.”', 'Iran’s foreign policy is driven by the principles of “dignity … wisdom and interest”, government spokesperson, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said on Wednesday, in response to US president Donald Trump saying that Washington would contact Tehran.', 'If you are just tuning into today’s developments and Trump’s extraordinary remarks about the US setting its sights on Gaza, here is what you need to know to quickly bring you up to speed.', 'Trump has declared that the US will ‘take over’ the Gaza Strip, and that he envisioned a “long-term” US ownership of the territory after all Palestinians were moved elsewhere. Gaza, he said, could be transformed into the ‘Riviera of the Middle East’. The US president did not explain how and under what authority the US could assume control of Gaza. “We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” he said. He said the US would “level” destroyed buildings and “create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.”', 'The Saudi government, in a statement, stressed its rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians from their land and said it would not establish relations with Israel without establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile Hamas condemned Trump’s calls for Palestinians in Gaza to leave as “expulsion from their land”. One Hamas figure described the remarks as ‘absurd’ and ‘ridiculous’, while the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations said that world leaders and people should respect Palestinians’ desire to remain in Gaza.', 'Several Democrats slammed Trump’s plan with Democratic senator Chris Murphy saying of Trump: “He’s totally lost it.” Democratic representative Jake Auchincloss described the proposal as “reckless and unreasonable” and called for an examination of Trump’s motives, which he said often contained a “nepotistic, self-serving connection”.', 'Some Republicans have also derided the proposal. Justin Amash, a former Republican member of Congress whose father was expelled from his home by Israeli forces in 1948, was appalled. “If the United States deploys troops to forcibly remove Muslims and Christians – like my cousins – from Gaza, then not only will the US be mired in another reckless occupation but it will also be guilty of the crime of ethnic cleansing. No American of good conscience should stand for this.”', 'The US president called Gaza a “symbol of death and destruction” and that the only reason people want to go back there is because they have nowhere else to go. The 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza should move to neighbouring countries with “humanitarian hearts” and “great wealth”, Trump said. Earlier he had called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians. He said they could be split up across a number of separate sites. Forced displacement of the population would probably be a violation of international law and would be fiercely opposed not only in the region but also by Washington’s western allies. Some human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing.', 'He went on to say that Gaza could become “the Riviera of the Middle East” where “the world’s people” could live there, echoing the previous sentiments of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who said Gaza had very valuable “waterfront property”.', 'Trump gave a vague answer when asked a question on whether he supported a two-state solution. Asked if his view that Palestinians should be relocated from Gaza was a sign that he was against the two-state policy that has been the foreign policy approach of the United States for decades, Trump said no. “It doesn’t mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life,” he said. “They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It’s been horrible.”', 'Trump claimed high-level support among unnamed leaders he had spoken to. “This is not a decision made lightly,” he said, adding that “everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.” He said the move would bring “great stability to that part of the Middle East”.', 'Trump did not rule out sending US troops to secure Gaza. “As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,” he said. On Trump’s idea of taking over Gaza, Netanyahu said the US president “sees a different future for Gaza”, adding: “I think it’s something that could change history.”', 'Trump said he would probably announce a position on Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank in the next month. “We haven’t been taking the position on it yet,” he said. Trump added that he planned to visit the Gaza Strip, Israel and Saudi Arabia.', 'Netanyahu described Trump as “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House”. The Israeli leader said “we have to finish the job in Gaza”, and said “Israel will end the war by winning the war.” Netanyahu praised Trump for “thinking outside the box with fresh ideas” and “showing willingness to puncture conventional thinking”.', 'The Guardian’s David Smith has put together this sketch of the mood in the White House today.', '“The venerable East Room, where Abraham Lincoln lay in state and Pablo Casals played cello, had turned into a mosh pit. Sweaty reporters, photographers and camera crews were crammed elbow to elbow. The Guardian shoehorned its way into a corner where a panel had fallen off the wall. Never used to happened in Joe Biden’s day.', 'The president began by boasting about how he got a “beautiful” US embassy built in Jerusalem, ranting about his predecessor and giving a shout out to his staff.

A better life is not necessarily tied to the physical space that you’re in today. A better life is about better opportunity, better financial conditions, better aspirations for you and your family.', '“That doesn’t occur because you get to pitch a tent in the Gaza Strip and you’re surrounded by 30,000 munitions that could go off at any moment. It’s a dangerous place to live today and the president is saying, ‘let’s make it better for these people.’”', '“Donald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship,” the Israeli far-right politician wrote on X after Trump’s shock remarks.', 'Trump’s comments on Tuesday were not the first time he has suggested turning the home of 1.8 million Palestinians into a business opportunity for developers.', 'They echo comments he made during his presidential campaign, and that is his son in law and former White House adviser, Jared Kushner, made in March last year.\n\nKushner praised the “very valuable” potential of Gaza’s “waterfront property” and suggested Israel should remove civilians while it “cleans up” the strip. The Guardian’s Patrick Wintour reported the comments on 19 March 2024.', 'Trump repeated the sentiments while campaigning in late 2024. On 7 October 2024, the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel, Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, “They’d have, there was no ocean as far as that was concerned. They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place – the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate.”', 'Hewitt had asked Trump if Gaza “could be Monaco” and Trump said it could be “better than Monaco”.\n\nBernie Sanders warned undecided voters in October, saying, “Trump has said Netanyahu is doing a good job and has said Biden is ‘holding him back.’ He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. And it is no wonder than Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office.”', 'Kushner, a former property dealer who is married to Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, made his comments in an interview at Harvard University on 15 February 2024.\n\nKushner said at the time that he thought Israel should move civilians from Gaza to the Negev desert in southern Israel. He said that if he were in charge of Israel his number one priority would be getting civilians out of the southern city of Rafah, and that “with diplomacy” it could be possible to get them into Egypt.', '“But in addition to that, I would just bulldoze something in the Negev, I would try to move people in there,” he said. “I think that’s a better option, so you can go in and finish the job.”', 'He reiterated the point a little later, saying: “I do think right now opening up the Negev, creating a secure area there, moving the civilians out, and then going in and finishing the job would be the right move.”', 'Saudi Arabia said it would not establish ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state, contradicting President Donald Trump’s claim that Riyadh was not demanding a Palestinian homeland when he said the US wants to take over the Gaza Strip.', 'Saudi Arabia rejects any attempts to displace the Palestinians from their land, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that its stance towards the Palestinians is not negotiable.', 'Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has affirmed the kingdom’s position in ‘a clear and explicit manner’ that does not allow for any interpretation under any circumstances, the statement said.']"

Some specific occupations and areas of expertise appear likely to be restricted, one of the sources familiar with the offer said, suggesting that the effort is far less sweeping than in civil service agencies that are not considered to be doing national security work.', 'There’s also a caveat for Ratcliffe to retain flexibility to work through the timing of officer departures in critical areas, according to another source familiar with the matter.', 'Read more about the move.', 'USAID staff around the world are being put on administrative leave Friday and ordered to return to the United States, according to an agency directive issued Tuesday night.', 'As of 11:59 p.m. Friday, “all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs,” according to the USAID website, which was back online after going dark.', '“For USAID personnel currently posted outside the United States, the Agency, in coordination with missions and the Department of State, is currently preparing a plan, in accordance with all applicable requirements and laws, under which the Agency would arrange and pay for return travel to the United States within 30 days and provide for the termination of PSC and ISC contracts that are not determined to be essential.”', '', 'As the name implies, a direct hire is a government official directly employed by the US government, as opposed to contractors who make up a huge part of the USAID workforce. Many of those contractors have already been furloughed and laid off.', 'CNN reported earlier that staffers were receiving individual emails on Tuesday informing them that they were being put on leave. Then, the agency-wide statement came.', 'Hundreds of contractors had previously been shut out of USAID’s IT systems and premises before Tuesday.', 'The statement on the website ends with: “Thank you for your service.”', 'CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.', 'The US Postal Service says it has temporarily suspended accepting international parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice.', 'It did not provide a reason for the change.', 'The announcement comes just days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that terminated the “de minimis” exemption, a long-standing rule that allowed anyone, including exporters, to ship packages worth less than $800 to the United States without duties or needing to undergo inspections.', 'It also follows the introduction of a broad-based 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the US, which took effect on Tuesday.', 'The new rule could also affect e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu, which have built their gargantuan business models around this exemption. The relaxed restrictions and tax exemptions on cheap products have allowed more than a billion packages to pour into the US at low prices for consumers looking for deals on clothing to household goods.', 'While it is unclear whether the suspension was related to the executive order, experts have told CNN the delivery of international parcels into the US would be “slowed down” if every package must be examined.', 'Currently, US Customs and Border Protection has the authority to open and inspect all international packages, though in practice it doesn’t open every single item.', 'CNN’s Fareed Zakaria discusses President Donald Trump’s comments that the United States “will take over” Gaza — possibly with the help of American troops — while the Palestinians who live there should leave, a stunning proposal that would dramatically reorient the Middle East and subject a population of more than a million to further displacement.', 'Asked Tuesday night about President Donald Trump’s remarks that the US will “take over” the Gaza Strip, GOP senators largely refused to comment as they dashed to-and-from floor votes, including Trump ally Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch.', 'Others expressed some skepticism.', 'Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called it an “interesting proposal” but also “problematic.”', '“We’ll see what our Arab friends say about that. I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza. I think that might be problematic. But I’ll keep an open mind,” he said.', 'Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said that “there are probably a couple of kinks in that Slinky, but I’ll have to take a look at the statement.”', '“I don’t know what to make of it,” said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. “Check back with me tomorrow, that’s a good idea.”', 'Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the idea “crazy, and you can quote me.” He said it would “blow apart the Abraham Accords,” adding that “all the progress that we have made including the brave and costly battles that Israel has waged would be effectively undercut by this crazy notion.”', 'Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democratic on the Foreign Relations Committee, said, “No, I don’t think it’s something that is in America’s interest.”', 'She added: “This idea, I think it fails to recognize the need to have a Palestinian state, and the fact that until we address the concerns of the Palestinians, there will continue to be conflict in the region.”', 'Democratic Sen.
