The payloads experienced about two minutes of lunar gravity forces, which was a first for New Shepard, the company noted on its mission page.', 'While the payloads capsule was in the sky spinning, the booster successfully returned to the surface for a clean touchdown about 2 miles north of Launch Site One', 'The capsule eventually followed, deploying parachutes to make a soft landing in what Watts described as a “beautiful touchdown.” Immediately following touchdown, a capsule recovery team drove out to open the hatch and extract some of the payloads.', 'From launch to capsule touchdown, the flight lasted 10 minutes 6 seconds.', 'NASA played a big part in NS-29. More than half of the 30 payloads flying on the mission are supported by the agency’s Flight Opportunities Program. This allowed NASA to gather more data as it works to return astronauts to the moon as part of its Artemis program.', 'Four of the payloads on board were from Honeybee Robotics, a division within Blue Origin’s In-Space Systems business. Honeybee’s experiments tested technologies focused on penetrating, excavating and processing lunar regolith, the company said.', 'Club for the Future, Blue Origin’s nonprofit, also flew thousands of postcards as part of its Postcards to Space program.', 'New Shepard is a reusable rocket-capsule combo named after Alan Shepard, the first American to reach space. The vehicle is best known for carrying paying customers on brief trips to suborbital space.', 'NS-29 was unique in that it was the first time the company paired the dedicated payloads capsule with a recently-debuted booster. Blue Origin, which was founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, now has a fleet of three capsules and two boosters in service.', 'Plus, the company’s much bigger orbital rocket, New Glenn, made its debut launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in January.', '', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
