We already looked at early offers, but now Amazon has tweaked its deals, so let’s have another look.', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is available with a free storage upgrade (to 512GB) and it includes $80 store credit. The 1TB variant is available in the US too, you can get it from Samsung.', 'The offer for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ is different. The 256GB model comes with a $100 gift card, so its effective price is $900. The 512GB model is $1,020, which is $100 less than MSRP (and only $20 more than the cost of a 256GB model, not including the promotional gift card).', 'The deal for the vanilla Samsung Galaxy S25 is structured the same way – get the base storage (128GB in this case) with a $100 gift card or pay a bit extra ($60 more) for the next storage tier (256GB, but you don’t get a gift card). For the S25+ we’d say you can live with the base storage, for the S25 we’d recommend you skip the gift card and get the storage upgrade.', 'Is the S25 series a bit... boring? Instead of spending nearly $900 for a 256GB Galaxy S25, you can get a 256GB Galaxy Z Flip6. And for $50 more you can get a 512GB model. The flip form factor and the usability of the large cover display can inject a bit of excitement into using your phone that isn’t there with standard bar phones.', 'The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 is there for those who subscribe to the “bigger display = better display” ideology. And while there is no sheath for an S Pen, this model does support the Bluetooth-enabled S Pens, which the S25 Ultra no longer does.', 'We haven’t looked at Samsung tablets in a while and now is a good time – the Galaxy Tab S10+ is almost $300 off. This tablet has a 12.4” 120Hz OLED display, a Dimensity 9300+ chipset, expandable storage, DeX and a large 10,090mAh battery with 45W charging.', 'A cheaper 12.4” model is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. This one has a 90Hz IPS LCD instead of an OLED panel and is powered by the Exynos 1380 chipset. It does have DeX, but only on the tablet itself (no external video). The battery is the same at 10,090mAh with 45W charging.', 'You can go smaller – and cheaper – with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, basically a 10.9” version of the FE+. The battery is smaller at 8,000mAh (but still supports 45W charging), everything else is the same.', 'And before we forget – the Tab S slates come with an S Pen (magnetically attached to their backs) with Bluetooth, air gestures and all. Funny how it’s possible on a $350 tablet, but not on a $1,300 phone.', 'We will wrap up with an oddball suggestion – Microsoft has created distilled versions of the DeepSeek R1 AI model that can run locally on Copilot+ PCs, starting with ones powered by the Snapdragon X chips. Like Microsoft’s own Surface Laptop, for example. It’s powered by the 12-core Snapdragon X Elite and comes in 13.8” and 15” sizes (both with touchscreens).', 'We may get a commission from qualifying sales.', 'Making decent phones', 'Those trends being?', '(nothing. absolutely nothing)', 'PHONE FINDER', 'ALL BRANDS\nRUMOR MILL', 'Home News Reviews Compare Coverage Glossary FAQ RSS feed Youtube Facebook Twitter Instagram', '© 2000-2025 GSMArena.com Mobile version Android app Tools Contact us Merch store Privacy Terms of use']"
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Review,https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review,"['For many years, Samsung has typically been one of the first Android phone makers to deliver a hot new device with the latest Qualcomm chips at the start of the new year. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ends up in an unenviable position in 2025, though, as it follows on the heels of the OnePlus 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9, all of which have shown solid advancements to their own product lines and just how capable the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra may be the best that Samsung can do, but it really has to knock it out of the park to stay at the top of the smartphone class, especially when its $1,299 starting price is the highest of these four devices.', '', 'Samsung has made some of the most significant design changes for the Ultra line in several years with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and yet it still looks pretty same-y. The new design has curved corners and flat sides – a shift away from the angular corners and rounded sides of predecessors. But the Galaxy S25 Ulta remains a large slab. The back of the phone is largely featureless save for the three large and two small bumps for the camera array and laser auto-focus system.', 'While I can’t say the color isn’t pretty, it’s not jaw-dropping. OnePlus is out there etching wood grain into the back of its OnePlus 13, RedMagic is doing all sorts of bold craziness (including frost-like geometric patterns and see-through panels), and Samsung just has flat, muted colors. This is coming from the company that launched the S20 with a vibrant back panel that provided a close approximation to a bubble catching the sunlight. Sure, Samsung’s going with supposedly robust Gorilla Armor 2 glass on the front and back and titanium in the frame of the phone, but these lend little to the visual appeal of the device, and to my knowledge, none of them prevent the phone from shattering on concrete like any flagship phone out there.', 'The camera setup on the back of the S25 Ultra is also a curious and worrying choice. While the layout is familiar, each of the larger bumps now has a small relief at the bottom – think the pipes in Mario games. This might provide ever-so-slightly more visual intrigue, but the ability of these gaps to gather debris is all but guaranteed, and on the off chance something got under there with a little leverage, I’d expect some damage to the camera itself.', 'The one thing setting the S25 Ultra apart from its competition is the S Pen, which still has a little slot at the bottom edge of the phone. It tucks away conveniently, and springs out with a pleasing little pop. And it provides responsive stylus inputs for handwriting and doodling with far greater accuracy than a finger can manage. This year, Samsung took away the Bluetooth connection to the phone, which enabled some extra features, like the ability for the S Pen to serve as a remote camera shutter button though. I’m reminded of when Samsung dropped the SD card slot from its phones – sure, most people might have not been using it, but that didn’t make it any less convenient to have. And on that note, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that Samsung includes just a single SIM card in its tray. It supports two eSIMs, but more is always better in my book, and Samsung could have offered more.', 'Beyond the stylus and minor aesthetic choices, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is much like all the other flagship smartphones out there. It’s massive (6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in), weighty (218 grams), a little hard to use one-handed, and built well. You’ll get IP68-grade water and dust protection, which is about as good as it gets, though OnePlus went above and beyond this year by adding IP69 protection that can hold up against hot water jets as well as submersion.The anti-glare finish does a great job cutting down on reflections without impacting image quality from the display. Beyond that, though, the S25 Ultra’s screen isn’t blowing the competition out of the water.', 'Samsung fits in an excellent display. The screen stretches 6.9 inches across and has a sharp 1440x3120 resolution. The screen can reach a peak 120Hz refresh rate but can drop down as low as 1Hz to conserve energy. It’s bright and vibrant, making it a joy to watch shows and movies or play games on. The display is paired with potent speakers as well, which provide clear stereo audio and enough volume to listen to podcasts while tackling chores or taking a shower.', 'Samsung continues to situate a fingerprint scanner underneath the display, and it proves quick and reliable for unlocking the phone. Facial recognition is also supported.', 'The overall quality of the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn’t surprising. Samsung knows how to make a great phone, and this line is meant to be the cream of the crop. But it feels just a bit less special this year because it hasn’t done much to change from prior years while its competitors have. Sure, it has the S Pen, albeit somewhat neutered this year. Sure, it has Samsung DeX, giving it the ability to work like a portable computer, but that capability may not be far away from seeing broader availability on Android devices. And AI features are rolling out so fast and loose that none of them seem unique to any given phone, no matter how much Samsung hypes their capabilities.', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is available widely online, at retailers, and at mobile carriers at a starting price of $1,299. It comes with 256GB of base storage and 12GB of memory. 512GB of storage bumps the price to $1,419 and 1TB of storage jumps up to $1,659. The phone comes in four main colors – Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Whitesilver – as well as three Samsung online-exclusive colors: Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Pinkgold.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra launches with Android 15, and Samsung continues to promise seven years of Android OS and security updates, which is great to see from a device as expensive as this. Samsung still provides a flexible take on Android with its One UI, giving you plenty of tools to tailor it to the look and feel you prefer. While I haven’t found anything objectionable about Samsung’s approach to the operating system, I continue to be irked by Samsung’s attempts at locking down the ecosystem. Samsung has a handful of default apps that replace typical Google apps you’d find on almost any other Android phone, such as Chrome and Calendar. Samsung then uses its first-party apps to integrate some features, like its AI summarization of web pages or its ability to have AI check your calendar for events. If you want to take advantage of those features, you end up stuck with Samsung’s apps, and that can mean a big ecosystem shift.', 'While the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra may have a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip akin to that in other recent Android flagships, Samsung’s is a special version with souped up cores. It features six cores running at the same 3.53GHz as its competitors but two cores are boosted to 4.47GHz, up from the 4.32GHz you’d see in others like the OnePlus 13. It sounds like a minor difference, but it is enough to give Samsung a slight performance edge. In Geekbench 6’s single-core CPU test and Vulkan GPU test, the Galaxy S25 Ultra offered the fastest speeds I’ve seen from an Android phone. It edged out the OnePlus 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9 in these tests by as much as 6% and only fell to the ROG Phone 9 in the multi-core test by 0.27%.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra also had impressive GPU performance results in 3DMark. But this is also where the cracks started to show. For one thing, it didn’t manage to jump ahead of the Asus, OnePlus, or RedMagic in these tests. In some cases, it was even a good ways behind, especially since RedMagic basically proved itself nearly magical with how much performance it could eke out of the GPU. But the bigger problem for Samsung was its ability to sustain.', 'Invariably, after one benchmark run, the performance of the S25 Ultra would throttle for subsequent runs, sometimes by upwards of 20%. Of the Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered Android phones I tested recently, the S25 Ultra also performed the worst in the Steel Nomad Light stress test, which runs the benchmark 20 times in a row. In this stress test, the S25 Ultra started with a high of 2611 points but dropped promptly to 2116 points for the second run, then fell into the 1800s and eventually bottomed out at 1279 points. By contrast, the RedMagic 10 Pro and Asus ROG Phone 9 were both able to remain above 2150 points for all 20 runs. The OnePlus 13 also saw its results only sink as low as 1662 points. Samsung may be throttling more aggressively, with performance dipping even before the chipsets internal temps exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Samsung’s phone may stay cooler as a result, but all of these phones are getting uncomfortably hot by the end of the stress test. And I’ve noticed the S25 Ultra warming up simply while I’ve been browsing the web – something I didn’t notice from these other phones.', 'All this is to say the Galaxy S25 Ultra is an incredibly performant phone, and it feels lightning fast in everyday operation. But it seems to struggle with heat, and its ability to serve as a top-tier gaming phone will be impacted by this. It will be a strong gaming phone for those who want to dip their toes from time to time, but it won’t be the supreme option.', 'The networking speed of the S25 Ultra at least doesn’t encounter compromises. I could see speeds over 400Mbps on T-Mobile’s networking in testing, and the phone supports Wi-Fi 7 for the latest Wi-Fi networks.', 'Battery life is solid, easily lasting through a day of heavy use or two days of moderate use. But the 5,000mAh battery isn’t all that impressive when the OnePlus 13 is packing in two 3,000mAh cells and the RedMagic 10 Pro has bumped up to 7,000mAh. Even the charging speeds Samsung offers are on the slow side with just 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging', 'Samsung was never going to fail to impress with the sheer specifications of its camera system on the Galaxy 25 Ultra. It packs a powerful array of sensors with a wide range of focal lengths. Here’s what you’ll find:', 'For all of its technical prowess, the Galaxy S25 Ultra camera system manages to still feel a bit bland. Perhaps this is because Samsung has a color filter system akin to Apple’s Photographic Styles. You can apply these while shooting or after the fact, but with the camera running at its defaults, I felt many of the photos I took simply lacked punchy contrast and vibrancy, not to mention the warmth I’d gotten used to on the OnePlus 13. The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s main sensor snaps very sharp, detailed photos, but there’s a difference between that and a photo that looks good.', 'The ultra-wide camera certainly helps squeeze a lot into the frame, but it does so at the cost of noticeable distortion. Looking at a series of ceiling photos I took, the equilateral hexagon pattern on the ceiling showed all-too-obvious elongation when snapped with the ultra-wide. Some textures exhibit sharpening artifacts that make them look slightly more processed than the main sensor, and this breaks down the consistency between the two sensors. In certain scenarios, such as extreme close ups, the S25 Ultra prompted me to use a focus assistance tool which actually swapped from the main sensor to a cropped view of the ultra-wide, and the result is a drop in quality – not what I’d want from a tool meant to be helpful.', 'Samsung has some strong zoom prowess here combining both a 10MP 3x sensor and 50MP 5x sensor. The 3x tightens in on subjects well while keeping them plenty sharp. The 3x sensor even proves sharper than cropping in on the 200MP main sensor. I’ve noticed some sudden shifts in how the camera system wants to handle lighting when switching between the main and 3x telephoto, though, and it again hinders the overall camera experience.', 'I love that Samsung includes a 5x optical sensor on the S25 Ultra. Though I don’t love it as much as the 10x it might have included. Going back to look at photos I took using the 10x sensor that was on the S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra, it doesn’t appear to me that Samsung has made meaningful improvement on its ability to get close to far-off subjects by switching to a 5x optical sensor and then cropping to get closer. The 5x optical sensor on the phone now does a good job getting close to the quality of the old 10x when zoomed in, but it would have just been that much neater to see it start at 10x and then have the potential to reach even farther out.', 'Now, as it stands, Samsung is still readily winning the telephoto war, as the 5x sensor here plainly beats the Google Pixel 9 Pro’s and the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s own 5x sensor. It’s day and night when comparing their ability to capture accurate detail on a far-off subject. This is perhaps the one edge the Galaxy S25 Ultra is keeping on the OnePlus 13 as well, as the latter phone doesn’t get much actual detail when zoomed in very far beyond 6x. OnePlus still has a knack for making an image that pleases the eye with bolder contrast and color on those super-zoomed photos, but Samsung’s ability to get actual detail is unrivaled here – too bad OnePlus didn’t borrow the Oppo Find X8 Pro’s 6x telephoto sensor.', 'The selfie camera on the phone is perfectly respectable, but just like its partners in this phone, it doesn’t dazzle. The selfie camera captured lifelike, if a little dry, colors and decent sharpness. OnePlus and Google just provide better looking selfies.', '', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile, elegant, and powerful phone. It should stand out as the best Samsung has to offer, but after years of iteration on this device and a price tag that sets it certainly above many of its competitors (except Apple), the Galaxy S25 Ultra frequently had me asking, “is this the best Samsung can do?” Samsung’s displays, once the best, now have little to stand out from the many excellent competitors. The phone’s performance may top the charts briefly, but quickly sinks below the competition in sustained usage. And even the technically impressive cameras fail to offer the character that might make them lovable. Samsung really needed near-perfection this year, and all it delivered was greatness.', '']"

The display is large at 6.9 inches, and it features a Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with a QHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Another benefit of this larger screen is that you’ll be able to really enjoy the S Pen, which adds a whole layer of interaction with your device. If you care for stylus input, this is the only device in the Galaxy S25 series that comes with an S Pen.', 'This model also has the most capable camera system in the Galaxy S25 series. The primary camera has a 200MP sensor, while the ultrawide and periscope shooters clock in at 50MP, and there’s another 10MP telephoto camera. We’ve yet to test these, but knowing Samsung, we’re almost sure this phone will make it to our list of the best camera phones.', 'This one comes with a 5,000mAh battery, which you can charge at 45W wired or 25W using Qi2 wireless charging. Of course, like all other devices on this list, the Galaxy S25 Ultra gets an industry-leading seven-year update promise.', 'Is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra a bit too much for your needs? We can agree that it is a bit overkill, and maybe something like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus offers a better balance between experience and price. We did mention that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus offered the best experience and price for most users last year, and while we can’t pass judgment quite yet, the same will likely be true with the Galaxy S25 Plus.', 'This device is $999.99. It is not cheap, but it is much more reasonable for a high-end flagship phone. What do you sacrifice for a $300 price cut? Well, for starters, it has no S Pen. The display is smaller at 6.7 inches, but it still gets the same specs with a QHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.', 'The camera quality is slightly reduced, offering a 50MP main sensor, a 10MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultrawide shooter. Its battery is also smaller at 4,900mAh, and wireless charging is downgraded to 15W.', 'Otherwise, the phone is a high-end device. Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and 12GB of RAM, it still delivers amazing performance.', 'The obvious difference is that it will not come with an S Pen, but the device is fantastic if you can live without the stylus. It still gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12GB of RAM, so performance will be nearly as stunning. Of course, you still get that beloved seven-year update promise!', 'Most people ignore the lower-end models of the Galaxy S series, but I would personally pick this one. Not many of us need that much to be happy with a phone, and the simplicity of the Samsung Galaxy S25 may be more enticing to many of you.', 'For starters, this is a more pocketable handset, and many of us prefer smaller phones. It’s also much more affordable at $799.99; you all know how much I like saving money! Despite the smaller size and lower price point, the Galaxy S25 is still an awesome high-end smartphone.', 'Performance won’t be hindered, as this model still carries a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and 12 GB of RAM. It’s just as powerful as the rest.', 'The display is smaller at 6.2 inches and is the only model with a Full HD resolution. That said, the Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel will still look fabulous and keep the 120HZ refresh rate.', 'The camera system is the same as the one you’ll find in the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. It does, however, have a smaller 4,000mAh battery, and charging speeds are reduced to 25W wired and 15W wireless.', 'Otherwise, the design, performance, and general high-end experience are nice to have at a lower price point. And, of course, it still gets a seven-year update promise.', 'Remember, you only have a few days until these phones are released, on February 7, 2025. These free gift card offers shouldn’t be available after the pre-order period ends, so act quickly.', '']"

Getting notifications to show on the lock screen, with content available for some apps, took me several days to get right. The new Quick Settings panel is quite awful when expanded, if I’m being brutally honest. I don’t know, guys, but this is a mixed bag of software.', 'On a brief camera note, I think this camera can take some exceptional pictures.

The phones are powered by a custom-built Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, helping to bring those many, many AI features to life."", 'Gemini and I, surprisingly, became friends.', ""I'm not alone in feeling severe AI fatigue. As someone who tends to be AI-averse (do I really need it to write my emails, brainstorm ideas or summarize a PDF?), I tend to be wary of AI-heavy announcements like the one Samsung had at its Galaxy Unpacked event in January."", 'Once I got my hands on the devices, I put my skepticism aside and was surprised.

', ""Ultimately, it's the AI features that operate discreetly that won me over, like Circle to Search. This is a Google-powered feature that came out last year and lets you circle anything on your screen to quickly see product information and links. Now, Circle to Search can recognize a song playing in the background of a video or even a tune you hum or sing, and I had a lot of fun testing this out. When I hummed niche Taylor Swift songs like I Hate It Here and Foolish One, it nailed both. (Step aside, Shazam.) To be fair, I'm not sure how often I'll use this particular aspect of Circle to Search, but the tool as a whole remains impressive. "", 'The AI Select tool also served me well, but primarily for translating text. My Spanish vocab has (sadly) gotten rusty since high school. So when I came across an email in Spanish, I tapped the tool on the right-hand side of the screen, circled the text I wanted to translate and within a couple taps, it was quickly transformed into English (and hopefully, accurately). ', 'Here are two Portrait Studio images of me entirely created by AI.', ""Not all AI features are a home run, though. Portrait Studio, which uses AI to create stylized portraits (kind of like caricatures an artist might sketch of you at the beach or on a boardwalk), is fun to play with but feels like a novelty. It did an admittedly great job replicating details like my hijab, eye shape and smile. But I'm not sure how useful a tool like this is in the long run. Similarly, Drawing Assist, which turns your sketches into different stylized illustrations, is impressive at transforming my crappy drawings into pleasing images. I don't have any real use for this tool, as I'm not going to be framing these random images of cats and flowers. "", ""The biggest disappointment, so far, has been the Now Brief. This is designed to learn your habits – like if you usually check the weather, read the news and consult your calendar each morning – then surface any relevant suggestions to simplify those routines. In the week I used these phones, the only time I was even slightly impressed with this feature was when it showed a highlight of the images I'd taken that day. But otherwise, Now Brief simply lists the weather, my events that day and articles that are irrelevant 90% of the time. That's not to say it won't eventually learn more about me and get better, but it hasn't proven its value just yet."", 'The S25 and S25 Plus have a trio of lenses on the back: wide, ultrawide and 3x telephoto.', ""The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus share the same camera specs as last year's series: a 50-megapixel wide camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera.

Google’s Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL represent a winning balance of style and camera performance. And at the more affordable end, London-based phone maker Nothing, combines transparent design with refreshingly gimmick-free camera systems in the Phone (2) and Phone (2a).', 'As with every new phone launch, the S25 Ultra is also competing with its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, with relatively modest changes year-on-year. From a camera point of view, the only hardware difference is a higher resolution ultra-wide camera, up from 12MP to 50MP, while the rest of the phone gets a slightly revamped design, more powerful internals and an even more generous lathering of AI-labelled features than last year.', 'As ever, Samsung’s 2025 Ultra is also one of the most expensive non-folding phones on the scene, costing more than even Apple’s 16 Pro Max. So do the new AI features and upgraded internals make it a worthy successor and a winning choice over the competition, or do its high price and heavy dose of deja vu limit its appeal?', 'There are a few headline design changes for the S25 Ultra when compared to last year’s S24 Ultra. It’s thinner – 8.2mm compared to 8.6mm – it’s lighter – 218g compared to 232g, and the flat corners and rounded sides have been swapped out for rounded corners and flat sides. Interestingly, this move from rounded to flat actually makes the new S25 Ultra feel a bit chunkier than its predecessor, despite the numbers.', '', 'The phone’s 6.9-inch screen is also a little larger than the 6.8-inch S24 Ultra screen, making the S25 Ultra one of the largest-screened flagships around, and a perfect-sized gaming and watching option.

That means the interface renders at a lower resolution to save battery, and while you can override this, with our imperfect eyesight, everything looked fine at FHD+.', 'In fact, when outdoors, everything looks better than fine. The anti-glare display, matched with the S25 Ultra’s peak brightness of 2600 nits, ensures it’s easy to see what’s on-screen even in direct sunlight.', 'The screen’s large, but Samsung’s one-handed mode is intuitive enough for easy left or right-handed use without any stretching – just activate it in the settings – and if you are a fan of pen input, the extra screen size matched with the pop-out pen make for a wonderfully precise way of editing photos.

The caveat is that the ceiling for photo quality isn’t quite as high as some alternatives like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo X200 Pro, especially when you pinch in.', 'Background blur, for example, showcases an unnatural mottling, which is a sign of heavy processing, especially from the telephoto cameras, while devices with larger tele sensors and/or more pared-back processing don’t tend to produce this effect.', 'Picture clarity is strong for shots taken in bright environments, even up to 10x zoom, though going beyond pulls up some fringing and ghosting, and beyond 30x generates visible AI-style clean-up work, smoothing lines and blocking colors.', 'Highlights and shadows preserve a lot of detail in auto mode, but we’d be okay with losing a bit of shadow detail, and photos showcasing a bit more contrast and depth in blacks to give them a bit more of a classical look. By contrast, the S25 Ultra’s pictures have a bit of that HDR-style, shot-on-a-smartphone look.', 'In low light, Samsung’s photos do a good job of brightening up scenes and grabbing usable shots, but still try and pull too much color out, so can make night skies look too navy blue, light leaking into the frame look too yellow, and certain parts of the scene look a bit muddy. What’s noticeably better is detail throughout the zoom range, suggesting the S25 Ultra would be a great shout for any gig-lovers and keen zoomers.', 'The hardware upgrade this year – the 50MP ultra-wide – is welcome, and does ensure a level of quality in bright environments even when pulled right back. The ultra-wide features autofocus, locks on super-close to a subject with roughly 4cm macro capture, and crams plenty of detail into shots, even when lighting isn’t perfect. Being a wider focal length than competing ultra-wides, there’s more distortion too, but the added range it adds is great to have.', 'The telephoto cameras both focus nice and near to subjects, with the 3x locking on as close as 16cm, and the 5x locking on as close as 22cm in our tests. When compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, which can’t focus closer than 1m or more, the S25 Ultra fast becomes a fantastic choice for food and product photography.', 'A lot of our grumbling about Samsung’s zingy, processed pictures, which won’t appeal to traditionalists, can be corrected for in Expert RAW, which is like Pro Mode on dynamic range steroids. This composites RAW files to give you greater dynamic range in a lossless format, and is particularly powerful when matched with a steady hand or steadied phone, able to capture supremely editable shots across cameras. It’s a faff compared to point-and-shoot auto mode, but if you’re prepared to put in the effort, the results could well be worth it.', '', 'Another highlight is Samsung’s Pro Video mode. The new LOG feature is a superb addition which we got plenty of use out of in our two weeks with the phone, though it’s worth noting, Pro Mode doesn’t allow you to switch between cameras once you’ve started recording, one of our few bugbears with it. The footage itself was impressive, and while it won’t topple Apple’s ProRes, considering its comparably minute file size, it’s a winning middle-ground for folks like us who can’t justify an external drive for a few minutes of Apple’s finest footage.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s selfie camera is mostly a hit. With autofocus, you can get creative with your selfie photos and videos getting up close and personal or far and wide for group selfies, and they look great until the lights drop, after which they’re just competitive. We still prefer selfies from the Pixel 9 Pro, which handles skin tones with more nuance, balancing flattering with natural a bit better, but it’s great to see the S25 Ultra has no dud cameras around the front or back.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra runs Android 15 with OneUI 7.0, and the whole interface has had a lick of paint to bring it in line with other Androids on the scene. The pull-down notification screen can be swiped down from the left, the quick toggles from the right, and there’s a new Now Brief widget on your homescreen by default.', 'Now Brief, a headline feature of the S25 series, uses AI to pull together data from your Samsung Galaxy Watch, Spotify listening habits, calendar, location, and even YouTube profile to feed useful information to you, updated morning, noon, and night. It’s unclear how much better the feature will get over time, but it’s fair to say that right now, it’s very light touch stuff, and definitely isn’t a reason to jump ship to Samsung if you’re on the fence.', '', 'Fortunately, the meat on the UI bone is ample, with Samsung’s interface jam-packed with features for productivity, gaming, and a ton of useful software, The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is also super-powerful, and heat is managed well, even when tearing through top-tier titles like Wuthering Waves and Genshin Impact.', 'The S25 Ultra’s speakers sound markedly better than those of past Samsung phones – less tinny and more full-bodied – and even when covering the bottom-firing speaker when gaming, sound wasn’t too badly muffled.', 'The phone’s S Pen is also a nice touch, working well with the AI Sketch to Image feature and Samsung Notes for a neat perk when compared to the competition. There is also a suite of image editing tools baked into OneUI that remove objects and reflections, enable generative fill when expanding or rotating an image, and more – all introduced with the Galaxy S24 series – and all the useful Galaxy AI tools we covered when reviewing the S24 Ultra are back for round two.', '', 'These AI tools include call assist for real-time translation during calls, writing assist for help proofing or translating your written content, a live interpreter, as well as transcription and summarising of recordings. Samsung also gives users the option to disable cloud AI, so all information can be processed on-device, which should help convince AI skeptics thinking about picking up an S25, Plus, or Ultra to take the plunge.', 'Samsung’s storage options for the S25 Ultra start at 256GB with 12GB RAM. This is respectable but isn’t class-leading, especially considering the phone’s high asking price. With Android being more powerful and demanding than ever, especially with the AI baked in at a device level, we can’t help but feel more RAM would future-proof the S25 series and keep it in line with the competition, which features up to 24GB RAM in the similarly priced Honor Magic 7 Pro RSR edition. Nevertheless, the promise of seven years of software updates is an impressive commitment to future-proofing and we can’t argue with the smooth experience with the phone on launch.', '', 'On paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s 5000mAh battery is looking more outdated than ever. The same capacity as the 2022 Galaxy S22 Ultra. While competitors like Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo, and Honor are pioneering new battery tech to make two-day battery life possible, the S25 Ultra is comfortably capped at a little over a day. Thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite’s efficient performance, we comfortably hit 9 PM with 10-30 percent in the tank without fail every day in our two-week review period. Still, we definitely wouldn’t trust the S25 Ultra on a weekend away like we might the OnePlus 13.', 'It’s also worth noting that the S25 Ultra’s charging times fall behind the flagship competition too (outside Apple and Google camps). It charges at 45W wired, fully powering up in around an hour, while the wireless charging time is hours, especially when you have a case on it, reducing efficiency. This further relegates the S25 Ultra to the realms of nightly charges, while other phones only call for occasional top-ups every few days by comparison.', 'If you want to get the best from the S25 Ultra, it helps to be a Samsung loyalist. The phone talks to your Samsung watch to pull info into your Now Briefing about your sleep and activity. It’s going to manage your Samsung home appliances better than the competition out of the box, and you won’t be able to flow between your S25 Ultra and non-Samsung tablet with handwritten notes and files quite as easily as you can a Tab S series slate.', '', 'This flow between Samsung tech even helps the S25 Ultra feel like a better camera phone. Editing RAW photos on your Samsung Tablet taken on the S25 Ultra, quickly pinging over large video files for editing on Capcut or Lumafusion, there’s real value to this cohesion.', 'If you’re not bound to Samsung’s ecosystem and are looking for the absolute best camera phone, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn’t it, in our opinion. In auto mode, its photo processing swings too big with sharpness and saturation, while the hardware laying the foundation isn’t best-in-class. We were occasionally left wishing we shot in RAW or at least in Pro mode, even if most casual shots look great.', ""We also appreciate the telephoto cameras besting the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro series when it comes to close-up photography. They aren’t advertised as telemacro cameras, but both the 3x and 5x focus relatively close, so product shots look more premium, and they're also solid portrait options too. One real win this year is the LOG video, which should be a boon for creators."", '', ""Everything else about the phone is predictably good; performance and OneUI all make for a smooth experience, it's great for gaming, the screen looks stunning, and the S Pen is a unique feature that will appeal to some."", ""While the S25 Ultra's battery life won't best the 6000mAh competition, it got us through a day despite the larger screen, making the S25 Ultra an expensive, but exceptional phone, perfect for Samsung fans, and very good for everyone else."", ""For anyone looking for the best value and battery life, the OnePlus 13 edges ahead of the S25 Ultra, packing similar internals and a much higher-capacity cell for a fraction of the price, though it misses out on the camera versatility of Samsung's top-tier flagship with a less flexible telephoto."", 'For more reach, the Oppo Find X8 Pro’s a great choice, and its portraits also edge ahead of Samsung’s for us. The Vivo X200 Pro’s zoom is ultimately more nuanced and best-in-class for telemacro capture, and if you tend to shoot at the 70mm range more than 120mm, you may prefer the Honor Magic 7 Pro. All these phones deliver bigger batteries, faster charging, but none support pen input.', 'Of course, for anyone not sold into the Samsung ecosystem, you could choose the impressive Pixel 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL. While the camera mix is more limited than the S25 Ultra, with three cameras instead of four, its photo processing wins out for us.', 'Basil Kronfli is a freelance technology journalist, consultant, and content creator.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: My pros and cons,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review,"['When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra takes AI on phones to the next level with the ability to perform actions across multiple apps at once. It also delivers a superior camera experience along with crisp HDR video, plus fantastic Snapdragon 8 Elite performance and super long battery life. I just wish Qi2 wireless charging support didn’t require a case.', 'Impressive AI agent upgrades', 'Bigger and brighter display', 'Great Snapdragon 8 Elite performance', 'Superb cameras', 'Very long battery life', 'Now Brief feature underwhelms', 'No Qi2 magnets built in', 'S Pen loses Bluetooth', ""Why you can trust Tom's Guide Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you. Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate."", 'Here’s the most ironic thing about the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The moment it launched, lots of people were calling out Samsung for copying the iPhone’s design.', 'But after testing this device I actually think the S25 Ultra is the closest Samsung has come to convincing me to ditch my iPhone.', 'The 6.9-inch display on the latest Ultra is brighter; the cameras are more versatile and arguably just better; and the S25 Ultra is packed with smarter AI features I wish the iPhone 16 Pro Max had, like the ability to perform multiple actions at once across apps using just your voice. And it’s all wrapped up in a design that — while Phone-like — is lighter than its main rival.', 'Samsung did cut some corners with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The S Pen no longer has Bluetooth. And the newly added Qi2 charging support forces you to buy a compatible case. No magnets here.', 'But overall the performance, battery life and AI smarts on the Galaxy S25 Ultra add up to the best Android phone I’ve tested and possibly the best phone period.', '', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a release date of February 7, and it still starts at the same “yikes”- inducing starting price of $1,299 / £1,249 for 256GB of storage. You can upgrade to 512GB for $1,419 or 1TB for $1,659 but while pre-orders are still happening you can get 512GB for the same price as 256GB and 1TB for the usual 512GB price.', 'Samsung is also offering up to $1,200 off, which includes up to $900 in instant trade-in credits and up to $300 in Samsung credits. Check out our Galaxy S25 Ultra deals page for the best discounts available.', '', 'As they say, haters are gonna hate. But I think some of the criticism around the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s design being too iPhone-like is warranted. The sides are flat now just like the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the corners are rounded, which means the Samsung digs into your hand less than the Galaxy S24 Ultra.', 'But I actually blame Samsung for not copying the iPhone enough. I’m talking about the left and right edges of the design. They’re too sharp for my taste and make the phone less comfortable to hold and use. Apple does a better job of beveling these edges so they’re smoothed out.', 'The titanium frame feels as sturdy as ever, and the thinner bezels allowed Samsung to increase the screen size slightly from 6.8 to 6.9 inches. I also like the floating camera design on the back. It looks better than the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s unsightly patch.', '', 'Measuring 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches and weighing 7.69 ounces, the Galaxy S25 Ultra has nearly the same dimensions of the iPhone 16 Pro Max while being noticeably lighter than Apple’s 7.99-ounce handset when I was holding both phones. The S24 Ultra weighed in at 8.22 ounces while being a slightly thicker 0.34 inches.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra color options are not exactly wild. There’s Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue and Titanium Whitesilver. I tested the Silverblue hue and I think it has just enough pop without being too in your face.', '', 'If you’re feeling more adventurous, Samsung.com is also offering online exclusive colors like Jadegreen, Jetblack and Pinkgold.', 'There’s two design trade-offs I need to talk about here. One way Samsung cut down on the weight is a notable downgrade to the S25 Ultra that removes the Bluetooth radio from the S Pen. That means you can’t perform air gestures like taking photos remotely, though Samsung says it removed Bluetooth because not enough people were using the features.', 'The second trade-off is that the S25 Ultra has half-assed Qi2 charging support. I say that because the magnets are not built into the phone itself. So if you want to easily attach to magnetic Qi accessories like docks and car mounts you’re going to have to spring for a special case.', '', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s display is the closest to perfect we’ve tested yet, and that’s saying something because the S24 Ultra was frickin’ good.', 'The size has grown from 6.8 to 6.9 inches, thanks to slimmer bezels. And that makes this an even more immersive canvas for movies, games and more.', ""When watching the trailer for “Superman” side by side with its predecessor, the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s display was a bit more vivid and brighter than the S24 Ultra when viewed outdoors. I then watched the same trailer on the S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max indoors, and I'd say they were neck and neck with the Samsung doing slightly better in darker scenes like those with stars."", 'In our lab testing, the Galaxy S25 Ultra turned in a max brightness of 1,860 nits. That doesn’t eclipse the insane score the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL turned in (2,469 nits), but it does beat the iPhone 16 Pro Max (1,553 nits) by a fair margin.', '* lower is better', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra also turned in better scores for color saturation, covering 128.1% of the sRGB color gamut and 90.8% of the DCI-P3 color space. The iPhone 16 Pro Max hit 114.1% and 80.9%, respectively.', 'Samsung even won out in terms of color accuracy with a Delta-E score of 0.24 (where 0 is perfect). Apple’s flagship scored 0.26. You can get even richer colors if you set the Samsung display to Vivid mode.', '', 'The S25 Ultra’s screen promises better durability, too, though we have not been able to test it. It’s made of Corning Gorilla Armor 2, which is designed to provide better drop protection and better scratch resistance.', ""However, according to a torture test by YouTuber JerryRigEverything (Zack Nelson), the screen on the S25 Ultra isn't as tough as on the S24 Ultra. In 2024, Nelson’s set of mineral picks only started to cause damage on the S24 Ultra’s screen at level 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness, with deeper grooves emerging at level 8. This time around, he saw faint scratches at level 6."", '', 'There’s always that one feature that you want to show your family and friends when checking out a new phone, and with the Galaxy S25 Ultra that’s cross-app actions. With Google Gemini now deeply integrated into Samsung’s flagship, you can accomplish multiple things at once using just your voice.', 'There’s always that one feature that you want to show your family and friends when checking out a new phone, and with the Galaxy S25 Ultra that’s cross-app actions.', 'For example, I pressed the side button on the S25 Ultra and said “Look up the date and time of the Oscars and add it to my calendar and then text it to Mike.” The phone then looked up the info, and I could see it connecting to Google Workplace to make the addition to my calendar. It then sent the text to my brother with the relevant info.', 'That’s pretty impressive, and it shows the potential of agentic AI on your phone.', 'I also asked Gemini to look up the top 5 rooftop bars near me in New York City and then output the list to Samsung Notes, making sure to include the phone number and address for each one. Within several seconds, I had my list.', 'Cross-app actions work with Samsung’s apps, Google’s apps and third-party apps like WhatsApp and Spotify. And I’d certainly like to see this list expand.', '', 'Another helpful new AI feature is AI Select, a key part of Samsung’s One UI 7 software that can look at the content on your screen and provide contextually relevant suggestions. For example, I could easily turn a portion of a YouTube Short video into a GIF with a couple of taps.', '', 'Note that this feature is different from the popular Circle to Search, which gains new powers with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. You still long press the home button to activate Circle to Search, but it can now recognize emails, phone numbers and URLs on your screen; you just tap and go. Plus, Circle to Search can now recognize sounds or music in things like videos.', 'Personalization is another big theme with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and One UI 7, and that comes with two major AI features. The first is Now Brief, which can give you a quick summary to start your day. You’ll be able to see the latest weather, your upcoming appointments and the latest news at a glance, as well as suggested Spotify playlists.', 'The idea is that Now Brief will get smarter over time as it learns more about you via what’s called the Personal Data Engine. Think of it as a personalized large language model. The Now Brief can also summarize things like the Energy Score from your Galaxy Watch, as well as show highlight photos from your day out.', 'I’d like to give Now Brief more time to see if it lives up to its actionable insights promise, but at least during my testing it was a bit too barebones. Plus, some of the news it suggested was click-bait fodder like “Conservative Crusader Played Secret Role in Spread of ‘Anti-Woke’ Schooling.”', '', 'The Now Bar is a handy tool that’s designed to give you timely info on your lock screen, from sports scores and reminders to timers and directions. It’s very similar to Live Activities on the iPhone, and I like how you can easily flip between multiple alert boxes on your home screen, which are stacked on top of each other like cards. However, I’d like to see Samsung add more partners, such as Uber for seeing your rideshare status at a glance or DoorDash for your delivery updates.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra has lots of other AI powers that are worth trying out. With the help of Google Gemini, I can ask about a video I’m watching on YouTube and get quick answers to questions. For example, I asked Gemini to summarize the top 25 AI features announced during Unpacked and the AI analyzed the video and came back with a list. That’s pretty amazing.', '', 'You can also ask questions about any photos on your screen. I pressed the side button and asked about a church I saw in San Jose and found out that it’s the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph, which is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture. So the S25 Ultra can easily be your tour guide.', 'Last but not least, the Galaxy S25 Ultra makes searching for images in your library easier with natural language. I could just type “flower close-up” and instantly see macro shots I took with the ultra-wide camera, though it strangely left some out. And you can get super specific with your searches, such as “fountain with icicles around it.”', '', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn’t offer much in the way of camera hardware changes. The key upgrade involves the ultrawide sensor, which gets a boost from 12MP on the S24 Ultra to 50MP. This means better detail in your shots, as well as the promise of sharper macro photos.', 'Otherwise, you get the same 200MP main sensor, 50MP 5x telephoto, 10MP 3x telephoto and 12MP front shooter found on Samsung’s previous Ultra model.', 'To test out the S25 Ultra’s ultrawide camera I pointed it at this creek. Comparing the image to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, I preferred the detail in the water and snow from the Samsung shot. The iPhone’s pic is brighter but it offers less contrast in the sunny part of the frame and looks a bit blown out.', 'In macro mode, the S25 Ultra fell behind the iPhone 16 Pro Max in this close-up of a crystal. There’s a lot more definition in the iPhone’s pic while the Samsung looks a bit blurry.', 'When it comes to capturing colors, the S25 Ultra’s 200MP main camera is fantastic. The blues, greens, purples and oranges really pop in this Samsung photo of a mural, and there’s more gradation in the hues versus the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s shot, even if the iPhone’s image is brighter overall.', 'There’s more dimension and depth to some of the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s photos as well. Take this image of the San Jose Museum of Art with a sculpture in front of it. There’s more definition in the brick and the pic feels more 3D.', 'So how about low light? This photo of some plants and a small thinking person sculpture taken in almost complete darkness is a bit brighter through the iPhone than the Samsung, but if you zoom in there’s less noise in the S25 Ultra’s shot.', 'Outdoors in low light, I took this photo of a street with colorful strings of lights hanging down at 5x zoom. I prefer the S25 Ultra’s photo because the lights are more distinct and you can make out more detail at the top of the lamp posts.', 'The funny thing about this portrait shot from the S25 Ultra is that I like it because it does some of the things I generally prefer the iPhone for. My face has a warmer tone to it and my blue shirt pops a bit more off of a more artfully blurred background.', 'It’s a similar story with this selfie. The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers more detail in my hair and wayward eyebrow hairs but the S25 Ultra pulls in more light, especially on my face and eyes.', 'With this 10x zoom shot of a clock, the iPhone 16 Pro Max produces the more inviting, share-worthy shot with its brighter sun bouncing off the bricks and lighter blue sky. But the S25 Ultra wins on details when you look at the bricks themselves and metal around the clock.', 'For more samples, see our dedicated Galaxy S25 Ultra vs iPhone 16 Pro Max photo shoot-out, but overall I think the Galaxy S25 Ultra is easily one of the best camera phones we’ve tested.', '', 'It’s also worth mentioning that the Galaxy S25 Ultra picks up some new AI photo editing tricks. The most notable features include an improved Generative AI edit that does a better job of removing unwanted subjects from your images (including their shadows).', 'In addition, the S25 Ultra gets one of my favorite Galaxy Z Fold 6 features: Sketch to Image. I drew a very crude looking bee on top of a flower with the S Pen, and this phone turned it into a realistic looking bee in seconds.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra steps up its video recording game with 10-bit HDR support for more colorful results, as well as the ability to shoot in Log format for pros who want more creative control over their footage.', '', 'I put the S25 Ultra up against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in this first clip of the Bryant Park fountain, and both phones deliver crisp video. However, as I zoom in to 5x, the Galaxy S25 Ultra delivers a brighter stone in the fountain and crisper looking water. Bonus points for the Samsung offering louder sound with its zoom mic.', 'Samsung also recorded better looking video when I used both phones to record skaters in Bryant Park. As I pan around, the iPhone’s footage looks softer with more of a haze. You can make out more details in the signs around vendor booths as well as in the windows above the rink through the Samsung.', 'The S25 Ultra steals a trick from the iPhone 16 Pro Max and improves upon it with a new Audio Eraser feature. While the iPhone lets you remove unwanted background noise with its Audio Mix, Samsung goes further on the S25 Ultra by letting you fine tune certain sounds, such as wind, voices, music and crowd.', 'In this video you can hear the before and after results with Audio Eraser, which works remarkably well. My voice sounds a bit computerized but overall the Audio Eraser-treated version is a major improvement over the original.', '', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra is powered by an overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip along with 12GB of RAM, and it’s definitely one of the fastest phones we’ve tested.', 'I flipped between over a dozen open apps — constantly dipping in and out of Chrome, Spotify, Photos and more — and the S25 Ultra remained silky smooth under pressure.', 'The S25 Ultra is also a gaming beast. I enjoyed rock solid frame rates when playing “Diabolo Immortal” even with over a dozen enemies on screen. When I unleashed my undead minions on some overgrown spiders while also brandishing my thresher, the gameplay remained fluid.', '', 'The S25 Ultra beat the iPhone 16 Pro Max in some key benchmarks but not all. On Geekbench, which tests a phone’s CPU, the S25 Ultra turned in a higher multi-core score but lower single-core score.', 'But when it came to graphics performance, the S25 Ultra blew away the iPhone with a much higher frame rate in the 3DMark Solar Bay Unlimited test.', 'If you’re transcoding video, though, the Samsung was a good 30 seconds behind Apple in our Adobe Premiere Rush test.', 'It’s not quite the longest lasting phone we’ve tested, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra certainly earns a spot on our best phone battery life list.', 'On the Tom’s Guide Battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 5G at 150 nits of screen brightness, the S25 Ultra’s 5000 mAh battery lasted an epic 17 hours and 14 minutes. That’s about 30 minutes better than the Galaxy S24 Ultra but about 20 minutes behind the iPhone 16 Pro Max.', '', 'However, when we enabled the lower power 60Hz screen mode on the S25 Ultra, this handset lasted an even longer 18:35.', 'The OnePlus 13 is the champ among current flagship as it endured for 19:45 in auto mode with its 6,000 mAh battery.', 'In terms of charging speed, the S25 Ultra remains at 45W, which is faster than the iPhone’s 30W speed but slower than the 80W supported by the OnePlus 13. A drained S25 Ultra reached 71% after 30 minutes of charging, compared to 55% for the iPhone 16 Pro Max and 92% for the OnePlus.', '', 'The One UI 7 update is mostly about sprinkling more AI throughout the system, but there’s some other welcome upgrades outside of that. For example, the notifications and quick settings are now split up, and you access the former with a swipe from the top left and the latter from the top right.', 'I personally like the look of the new quick settings menu. It’s very Control Center-like, but it’s super intuitive.', '', 'In terms of AI features, I like the new call transcript feature. You can see the contents of your call after you hang up, and if it’s a longer call, you can ask for an AI summary.', '', 'Lastly, I like that Samsung has simplified and streamlined the controls in the camera app, so it’s easier to find the various buttons while freeing up more room for your live view.', 'Samsung backs up the S25 Ultra with 7 years of software and security updates. Along with Google’s matching software support for its Pixel phones, that’s the longest period available to any current phone.', '', 'Sure, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is an iterative update, but Samsung has made big improvements where it matters most, including introducing AI features that will save you time and make your life easier. The ability to perform actions across multiple apps at once using your voice has the potential to change how we interact with our phones forever.', 'But it’s clear that Samsung needs to add more partners, both for this AI agent feature and for things like Now Bar. I’m less impressed with the Now Brief (at least until I spend more time with the phone), and I wish Samsung had included Qi2 magnets in the phone itself so you didn’t have to buy a case to connect to magnetic accessories.', 'But overall, I really like the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Its AI smarts, vivid display, mostly top-notch cameras, super smooth performance and long battery life add up to a very impressive flagship — so impressive that I’m tempted to switch to Android myself.', ""Mark Spoonauer is the global editor in chief of Tom's Guide and has covered technology for over 20 years.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: modest update but a mighty phone,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-211144290.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.', ""Samsung's been sitting pretty as king of the Android smartphone heap and Apple's main mobile competition for years, with the Galaxy S series being the company’s top-tier line, and the S25 Ultra being as good as it gets in Samsung land in 2025."", 'Despite an unwavering position at the top alongside Apple, Samsung’s faced some stiff competition over the last 12 months, especially from Chinese powerhouse smartphone makers. The Honor Magic 7 Pro has just dropped with its 180MP periscope zoom camera, and Vivo’s Zeiss co-engineered X200 Pro is hands-down one of the best smartphones for telephoto photography we’ve ever used. Xiaomi’s Leica partnership, meanwhile, has produced the indomitable Xiaomi 14 Ultra, with its 1-inch sensor, variable aperture and classical tuning designed to scratch photography enthusiasts’ camera itch like no other, and let’s not forget Oppo and OnePlus. The Oppo Find X8 Pro and OnePlus 13 are battery powerhouses with Hasselblad co-development, nuanced photo processing and exceptional portrait performance.', 'It isn’t just Chinese phone makers that are giving Samsung a run for its money, though. Google’s Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL represent a winning balance of style and camera performance. And at the more affordable end, London-based phone maker Nothing, combines transparent design with refreshingly gimmick-free camera systems in the Phone (2) and Phone (2a).', 'As with every new phone launch, the S25 Ultra is also competing with its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, with relatively modest changes year-on-year. From a camera point of view, the only hardware difference is a higher resolution ultra-wide camera, up from 12MP to 50MP, while the rest of the phone gets a slightly revamped design, more powerful internals and an even more generous lathering of AI-labelled features than last year.', 'As ever, Samsung’s 2025 Ultra is also one of the most expensive non-folding phones on the scene, costing more than even Apple’s 16 Pro Max. So do the new AI features and upgraded internals make it a worthy successor and a winning choice over the competition, or do its high price and heavy dose of deja vu limit its appeal?', 'There are a few headline design changes for the S25 Ultra when compared to last year’s S24 Ultra. It’s thinner – 8.2mm compared to 8.6mm – it’s lighter – 218g compared to 232g, and the flat corners and rounded sides have been swapped out for rounded corners and flat sides. Interestingly, this move from rounded to flat actually makes the new S25 Ultra feel a bit chunkier than its predecessor, despite the numbers.', 'The phone’s 6.9-inch screen is also a little larger than the 6.8-inch S24 Ultra screen, making the S25 Ultra one of the largest-screened flagships around, and a perfect-sized gaming and watching option. At the bottom of the phone is an S Pen that pops out, a USB-C port, a SIM slot, and a loudspeaker. The buttons are all on the right side, and around the back is the quad-camera system.', 'There’s no getting around the fact the S25 series is more consistent, with the Ultra stepping in line with the standard and Plus versions – flat glass on the front and back, flat sides, and slightly rounded corners – and this consistency is probably a good thing, but it does make this year’s S25 Ultra feel a bit more generic than the more unique Ultras that came before it.', 'Thankfully, from a durability point of view, the S25 Ultra is up there with a Gorilla Armour 2 glass front and back and a grade 5 titanium frame. It’s also IP68 dust and water-resistant, and the screen has an upgraded anti-reflective coating, so everything looks very matte, very glass and metal, and very premium, even if a little safe.', ""There are some flourishes to the S25 Ultra’s design: the camera surround for the primary, ultra-wide, and 5x zoom cameras are more pronounced, appearing to hover atop the glass back thanks to a stepped design that looks cool. We’re big fans of Samsung’s muted, frosted, metallic back panel colors, with options including Silverblue, Grey, Black, and Whitesilver. If you buy the S25 Ultra online, you can pick it up in Jadegreen, Pinkgold, and Jetblack. The version pictured in this review is Silverblue, and while it's mostly silver, an elegant mauve tint shines through when light hits it at a certain angle."", 'In summary, the S25 Ultra’s design looks safe, feels solid, and is undeniably premium. A solid 8/10 for fit and finish, even if it won’t be winning any awards for originality.', 'Samsung screens are always a highlight, and the S25 Ultra’s large, 6.9-inch panel combines tiny bezels with a crisp resolution and a zingy picture. The Dynamic LTPO AMOLED display has a smooth 120Hz refresh rate that can scale up and down based on what’s being displayed. Unlike much of the competition, you can’t lock the screen to 120Hz, with two options – Adaptive and Standard – available. This might irk geeks who want to eke out every frame from swipes, but it should also help get the best battery life from the relatively modest-sized cell.', 'Samsung offers a handful of display options – Eye comfort shield, Adaptive color tone, and Screen mode – which give users control over screen colors and eye care, and these are comprehensive without being class-leading.', 'The phone is also set to Full HD+ resolution by default, despite the actual screen being a sky-high QHD+ with almost 500 pixels in every inch of screen. That means the interface renders at a lower resolution to save battery, and while you can override this, with our imperfect eyesight, everything looked fine at FHD+.', 'In fact, when outdoors, everything looks better than fine. The anti-glare display, matched with the S25 Ultra’s peak brightness of 2600 nits, ensures it’s easy to see what’s on-screen even in direct sunlight.', 'The screen’s large, but Samsung’s one-handed mode is intuitive enough for easy left or right-handed use without any stretching – just activate it in the settings – and if you are a fan of pen input, the extra screen size matched with the pop-out pen make for a wonderfully precise way of editing photos. This works great in Lightroom, and when navigating text and jotting down mindmaps or notes, and if you’re coming from an older curved Samsung Ultra, the flat screen and extra size create a more comfortable, edge-to-edge canvas.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra has three cameras around the back, and one on the front, with the only difference compared to last year’s model being the ultra-wide camera, which is higher resolution this year.', '13mm ultra-wide camera: 50MP resolution sensor with an f/1.9, 120º FOV lens', '24mm primary camera: 200MP resolution, 1/1.3-inch sensor with an f/1.7 aperture lens and OIS.', '67mm (3x equivalent) telephoto camera: 10MP resolution, 1/3.52-inch sensor with an f/2.4 aperture lens and OIS', '111mm (5x equivalent) periscope camera: 50MP resolution, 1/2.52-inch sensor with an f/3.4 aperture lens and OIS', '26mm front camera: 12MP resolution, 1/3.2-inch sensor with an f/2.2 aperture lens and PDAF', 'Shooting modes: Portrait, Photo, Video, Expert RAW, Pro, Pro Video, Night, Food, Panorama, Slow Motion, Hyperlapse, Portrait Viudeo, Dual Rec, and Single Take.', 'New for this year, Samsung’s adding LOG capture to the S25 Ultra’s pro video recording, and for video editors, this adds plenty of scope for custom looks and contrast-correction in the edit. This comes complete with exposure monitoring and focus-peaking, taking the S25 Ultra’s video up a level for creators.', 'If you’re coming from a Samsung S23 or S24 Ultra, you’ll know roughly what to expect from the S25 Ultra’s camera. Its photos look reliably good throughout the zoom range from 13mm through to around 150mm, which is undeniably impressive for a smartphone. The caveat is that the ceiling for photo quality isn’t quite as high as some alternatives like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo X200 Pro, especially when you pinch in.', 'Image 1 of 13', 'Image 2 of 13', 'Image 3 of 13', 'Image 4 of 13', 'Image 5 of 13', 'Image 6 of 13', 'Image 7 of 13', 'Image 8 of 13', 'Image 9 of 13', 'Image 10 of 13', 'Image 11 of 13', 'Image 12 of 13', 'Image 13 of 13', 'Background blur, for example, showcases an unnatural mottling, which is a sign of heavy processing, especially from the telephoto cameras, while devices with larger tele sensors and/or more pared-back processing don’t tend to produce this effect.', 'Picture clarity is strong for shots taken in bright environments, even up to 10x zoom, though going beyond pulls up some fringing and ghosting, and beyond 30x generates visible AI-style clean-up work, smoothing lines and blocking colors.', 'Highlights and shadows preserve a lot of detail in auto mode, but we’d be okay with losing a bit of shadow detail, and photos showcasing a bit more contrast and depth in blacks to give them a bit more of a classical look. By contrast, the S25 Ultra’s pictures have a bit of that HDR-style, shot-on-a-smartphone look.', 'Image 1 of 5', 'Image 2 of 5', 'Image 3 of 5', 'Image 4 of 5', 'Image 5 of 5', 'In low light, Samsung’s photos do a good job of brightening up scenes and grabbing usable shots, but still try and pull too much color out, so can make night skies look too navy blue, light leaking into the frame look too yellow, and certain parts of the scene look a bit muddy. What’s noticeably better is detail throughout the zoom range, suggesting the S25 Ultra would be a great shout for any gig-lovers and keen zoomers.', 'The hardware upgrade this year – the 50MP ultra-wide – is welcome, and does ensure a level of quality in bright environments even when pulled right back. The ultra-wide features autofocus, locks on super-close to a subject with roughly 4cm macro capture, and crams plenty of detail into shots, even when lighting isn’t perfect. Being a wider focal length than competing ultra-wides, there’s more distortion too, but the added range it adds is great to have.', 'Image 1 of 17', 'Image 2 of 17', 'Image 3 of 17', 'Image 4 of 17', 'Image 5 of 17', 'Image 6 of 17', 'Image 7 of 17', 'Image 8 of 17', 'Image 9 of 17', 'Image 10 of 17', 'Image 11 of 17', 'Image 12 of 17', 'Image 13 of 17', 'Image 14 of 17', 'Image 15 of 17', 'Image 16 of 17', 'Image 17 of 17', 'The telephoto cameras both focus nice and near to subjects, with the 3x locking on as close as 16cm, and the 5x locking on as close as 22cm in our tests. When compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, which can’t focus closer than 1m or more, the S25 Ultra fast becomes a fantastic choice for food and product photography.', 'A lot of our grumbling about Samsung’s zingy, processed pictures, which won’t appeal to traditionalists, can be corrected for in Expert RAW, which is like Pro Mode on dynamic range steroids. This composites RAW files to give you greater dynamic range in a lossless format, and is particularly powerful when matched with a steady hand or steadied phone, able to capture supremely editable shots across cameras. It’s a faff compared to point-and-shoot auto mode, but if you’re prepared to put in the effort, the results could well be worth it.', 'Another highlight is Samsung’s Pro Video mode. The new LOG feature is a superb addition which we got plenty of use out of in our two weeks with the phone, though it’s worth noting, Pro Mode doesn’t allow you to switch between cameras once you’ve started recording, one of our few bugbears with it. The footage itself was impressive, and while it won’t topple Apple’s ProRes, considering its comparably minute file size, it’s a winning middle-ground for folks like us who can’t justify an external drive for a few minutes of Apple’s finest footage.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s selfie camera is mostly a hit. With autofocus, you can get creative with your selfie photos and videos getting up close and personal or far and wide for group selfies, and they look great until the lights drop, after which they’re just competitive. We still prefer selfies from the Pixel 9 Pro, which handles skin tones with more nuance, balancing flattering with natural a bit better, but it’s great to see the S25 Ultra has no dud cameras around the front or back.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra runs Android 15 with OneUI 7.0, and the whole interface has had a lick of paint to bring it in line with other Androids on the scene. The pull-down notification screen can be swiped down from the left, the quick toggles from the right, and there’s a new Now Brief widget on your homescreen by default.', 'Now Brief, a headline feature of the S25 series, uses AI to pull together data from your Samsung Galaxy Watch, Spotify listening habits, calendar, location, and even YouTube profile to feed useful information to you, updated morning, noon, and night. It’s unclear how much better the feature will get over time, but it’s fair to say that right now, it’s very light touch stuff, and definitely isn’t a reason to jump ship to Samsung if you’re on the fence.', 'Fortunately, the meat on the UI bone is ample, with Samsung’s interface jam-packed with features for productivity, gaming, and a ton of useful software, The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is also super-powerful, and heat is managed well, even when tearing through top-tier titles like Wuthering Waves and Genshin Impact.', 'The S25 Ultra’s speakers sound markedly better than those of past Samsung phones – less tinny and more full-bodied – and even when covering the bottom-firing speaker when gaming, sound wasn’t too badly muffled.', 'The phone’s S Pen is also a nice touch, working well with the AI Sketch to Image feature and Samsung Notes for a neat perk when compared to the competition. There is also a suite of image editing tools baked into OneUI that remove objects and reflections, enable generative fill when expanding or rotating an image, and more – all introduced with the Galaxy S24 series – and all the useful Galaxy AI tools we covered when reviewing the S24 Ultra are back for round two.', 'These AI tools include call assist for real-time translation during calls, writing assist for help proofing or translating your written content, a live interpreter, as well as transcription and summarising of recordings. Samsung also gives users the option to disable cloud AI, so all information can be processed on-device, which should help convince AI skeptics thinking about picking up an S25, Plus, or Ultra to take the plunge.', 'Samsung’s storage options for the S25 Ultra start at 256GB with 12GB RAM. This is respectable but isn’t class-leading, especially considering the phone’s high asking price. With Android being more powerful and demanding than ever, especially with the AI baked in at a device level, we can’t help but feel more RAM would future-proof the S25 series and keep it in line with the competition, which features up to 24GB RAM in the similarly priced Honor Magic 7 Pro RSR edition. Nevertheless, the promise of seven years of software updates is an impressive commitment to future-proofing and we can’t argue with the smooth experience with the phone on launch.', 'On paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s 5000mAh battery is looking more outdated than ever. The same capacity as the 2022 Galaxy S22 Ultra. While competitors like Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo, and Honor are pioneering new battery tech to make two-day battery life possible, the S25 Ultra is comfortably capped at a little over a day. Thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite’s efficient performance, we comfortably hit 9 PM with 10-30 percent in the tank without fail every day in our two-week review period. Still, we definitely wouldn’t trust the S25 Ultra on a weekend away like we might the OnePlus 13.', 'It’s also worth noting that the S25 Ultra’s charging times fall behind the flagship competition too (outside Apple and Google camps). It charges at 45W wired, fully powering up in around an hour, while the wireless charging time is hours, especially when you have a case on it, reducing efficiency. This further relegates the S25 Ultra to the realms of nightly charges, while other phones only call for occasional top-ups every few days by comparison.', 'If you want to get the best from the S25 Ultra, it helps to be a Samsung loyalist. The phone talks to your Samsung watch to pull info into your Now Briefing about your sleep and activity. It’s going to manage your Samsung home appliances better than the competition out of the box, and you won’t be able to flow between your S25 Ultra and non-Samsung tablet with handwritten notes and files quite as easily as you can a Tab S series slate.', 'This flow between Samsung tech even helps the S25 Ultra feel like a better camera phone. Editing RAW photos on your Samsung Tablet taken on the S25 Ultra, quickly pinging over large video files for editing on Capcut or Lumafusion, there’s real value to this cohesion.', 'If you’re not bound to Samsung’s ecosystem and are looking for the absolute best camera phone, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn’t it, in our opinion. In auto mode, its photo processing swings too big with sharpness and saturation, while the hardware laying the foundation isn’t best-in-class. We were occasionally left wishing we shot in RAW or at least in Pro mode, even if most casual shots look great.', ""We also appreciate the telephoto cameras besting the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro series when it comes to close-up photography. They aren’t advertised as telemacro cameras, but both the 3x and 5x focus relatively close, so product shots look more premium, and they're also solid portrait options too. One real win this year is the LOG video, which should be a boon for creators."", ""Everything else about the phone is predictably good; performance and OneUI all make for a smooth experience, it's great for gaming, the screen looks stunning, and the S Pen is a unique feature that will appeal to some."", ""While the S25 Ultra's battery life won't best the 6000mAh competition, it got us through a day despite the larger screen, making the S25 Ultra an expensive, but exceptional phone, perfect for Samsung fans, and very good for everyone else."", ""For anyone looking for the best value and battery life, the OnePlus 13 edges ahead of the S25 Ultra, packing similar internals and a much higher-capacity cell for a fraction of the price, though it misses out on the camera versatility of Samsung's top-tier flagship with a less flexible telephoto."", 'For more reach, the Oppo Find X8 Pro’s a great choice, and its portraits also edge ahead of Samsung’s for us. The Vivo X200 Pro’s zoom is ultimately more nuanced and best-in-class for telemacro capture, and if you tend to shoot at the 70mm range more than 120mm, you may prefer the Honor Magic 7 Pro. All these phones deliver bigger batteries, faster charging, but none support pen input.', 'Of course, for anyone not sold into the Samsung ecosystem, you could choose the impressive Pixel 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL. While the camera mix is more limited than the S25 Ultra, with three cameras instead of four, its photo processing wins out for us.']"

Here’s how it works.', ""As you can see in either our review of the Galaxy S25 or our Galaxy S25 Ultra review, there are plenty of reasons to be intrigued by Samsung's new phones even if the new hardware hasn't changed that much. That's because Samsung has put the emphasis on Galaxy AI this time around, bringing a bunch of new AI-powered features while enhancing others that had launched with the Galaxy S24 a year ago."", ""Unlike some of my colleagues, I haven't had a chance to get my hands on the Galaxy S25 models yet, not even for a brief hands-on time. So when one of the new Galaxy phones does make its way to me, the feature I'm going to make a beeline toward is the newfound support for cross app actions."", ""Up until now, AI on your smartphone hasn't been much of a multitasker. Cross app actions changes that, as you can now use the Gemini assistant on board the Galaxy S25 to interact with both Google and Samsung apps. There's also support for Whatsapp and Spotify at launch."", 'Even better, Galaxy AI can now support multiple commands at once. If I want to look up what time the Super Bowl starts, I can also tell Gemini to send a text inviting my friends over at that time while blocking out an item on my calendar.', ""But there's more to it than that, according to Samsung. You'll also be able to snap a photo of what's in your refrigerator and have the AI come up with recipe of what you have on hand. You can give your assistant a research assignment and have them paste the results in a note. And all of this can be done with a single command — or so the sales pitch goes."", ""I'm very intrigued by the promise here, which is the ability to take care of different tasks without having to jump from one app to the next. Instead, Gemini handles it all for you, potentially saving you time. That's the kind of AI feature I want more of on my phone."", ""My colleagues have tested out cross app actions for their reviews, but I have a few other questions I'm hoping to get answered, either by using the feature myself or with more information surfacing overtime. Here's what I'm specifically hoping to find out."", '', 'Years of using digital assistants have made me a little paranoid that my seemingly reasonable request is going to produce the AI equivalent of a ""huh?"" Presumably, Galaxy AI responds well to natural language commands, but I\'m still curious to see if I have to phrase my request in a very specific way to get the result I want. How much trial in error is this going to require?', 'In a similar vein, I\'d like to know what happens if I request a cross app action that isn\'t supported. Ideally, the Galaxy AI would flag the specific part of my request that requires an app it can\'t quite work with yet — anything more helpful than a terse ""I can\'t do that."" Make me aware of what you can do.', '', ""I'm going to assume Samsung and Google put the emphasis on their own apps out of the gate as they could make sure those offerings were ready to go when the Galaxy S25 was. And let's be frank — a lot of people are going to use the on-device apps for texting, mail, notes and more."", ""But clearly, Samsung's going to want third-party apps to app support of their own. And if buy into the Galaxy S25, I'm going to want to be kept up to date on which apps those are and when I can expect cross app actions support to arrive for some of the big hitters beyond Whatsapp and Spotify."", ""That's not going to be an answer I find out right away, but it's still something I'm eager to learn."", '', ""Samsung doesn't add its features in a vacuum. On the other side of the mobile platform street, Apple's busy rolling out its own AI-powered features in the form of Apple Intelligence. And one of the still-to-come improvements will give Siri the ability to interact with other apps. That will mean Apple's assistant can perform complex actions with those apps and send messages directly within them. The word is that functionality is coming via the iOS 18.4 update, which is expected this spring."", ""I'm interested to see just how that behavior works at launch, including which apps will work with Siri right away and just how that compares to cross app actions on the Galaxy S25. Based on the rumors, it sounds like we'll have tha answer soon enough."", ""Not long after Samsung showed off the Galaxy S25 lineup for the first time, I suggested that the Galaxy S25 will be where the rubber meets the road for AI on smartphones — meaning here's where we'll find out if this is the game-changing evolution we've been promised.

The S25 phones are the first Android devices to support Qualcomm's Snapdragon Satellite connectivity feature, but there's a catch. While the S25 Ultra is capable of sending messages via satellite, only Verizon users will be able to make use of this feature."", ""This is because Samsung, unlike Apple and Google, did not sign an agreement with satellite network provider Skylo. Instead, it handed the responsibility to carriers. This is a frustrating limitation, but it's a step in the right direction."", ""Despite the limited rollout, the S25 Ultra can send messages over satellite.

Samsung Galaxy S25+ Review,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus,"['A high-end handset with advanced AI and top-notch performance', '', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25+ offers a nearly identical experience to the Ultra, with leading AI and outstanding performance, in a slightly smaller, stylus-free design for less money.', ""The Samsung Galaxy S25+ (starting at $999.99) delivers nearly every perk of the Galaxy S25 Ultra (starting at $1,299.99) in a slightly smaller and lighter package for $300 less. Highlights include a stunning, high-resolution display, blazing-fast performance, and useful Galaxy AI features. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is our Editors' Choice winner for Android phones thanks to its unmatched camera system and artist-friendly S Pen stylus, but if the Ultra is too big or expensive for you, the S25+ hits its own sweet spot in terms of size, features, and performance at a more palatable price."", 'The Galaxy S25+ sits in the middle of the S25 lineup, which includes the larger Galaxy S25 Ultra and the smaller Galaxy S25 (starting at $799.99). The S25+ shares the design and cameras of the base S25 but has a large, high-resolution screen like the Ultra.', ""Coming in at 6.24 by 2.98 by 0.29 inches (HWD) and 6.70 ounces, the S25+ is slightly narrower, thinner, and lighter than last year's Galaxy S24+ (6.24 by 3.0 by 0.30 inches, 6.95 ounces). The S25+ is appreciably smaller than the S25 Ultra (6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches, 7.69 ounces) but significantly larger than the base S25 (5.78 by 2.78 by 0.28 inches, 5.71 ounces)."", '', 'The S25+ and S25 both have Samsung Armor Aluminum frames and use Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to cover their screens and back panels. For comparison, the Ultra employs titanium for its frame and the stronger Gorilla Armor 2 material for its front glass. All three models have an IP68 rating, meaning they can withstand dust and water just as well as other premium handsets like the Apple iPhone 16 Pro and the Google Pixel 9 Pro, both of which start at $999.', ""The button and port layout remains the same as previous models. A volume rocker and power/side button are on the right, while a pill-shaped antenna indent is on the left. A SIM card tray, USB-C port (v3.2), and speaker slit sit on the bottom edge, while two mic holes are in the top edge. There's no headphone jack. Three individual camera lenses are stacked vertically on the back. The S25+ features bold black rings around each lens, a departure from the smaller silver rings of the S24 series."", ""Although the phone is large, its rounded corners make it comfortable to hold. Its build quality is excellent; the metal and glass materials form watertight seams. There's nothing wrong with the design, but it's not as eye-catching as it once was. In fact, it's barely changed in the last three years at all. Samsung should consider revising the design next year to keep things fresh and exciting."", ""The S25+ and the S25 are widely available at retail channels in the same colors: Icyblue, Mint, Navy, or Silver Shadow. Three other color options are available exclusively via Samsung's site: Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold. I find this color palette much more fun than the business-like options of the S25 Ultra. I tested the Navy variant. Its metallic finish creates a beautiful, rich color that I don't want to cover with a case (other than a transparent one). Your finger oils will show up on the rear panel as smudges, however."", ""Samsung sticks to an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor as the phone's most secure biometric authentication method. It works consistently in testing, though not as flawlessly as the Ultra's. Face unlock is also an option, but not for authentication in bank-grade applications. Apple and Google have offered secure face-based biometrics for years, and this is something Samsung needs to add."", 'The Galaxy S25+ carries over the same display as its predecessor: a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a resolution of 3,120 by 1,440 pixels, a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and a maximum brightness of 2,600 nits. Samsung sets the phone to a resolution of 2,340 by 1,080 pixels by default, but I tested it at the full resolution.

The bokeh tool can be a little aggressive, but you can dial that down in the Gallery app if you wish."", ""Video recording is available at up to 8K resolution at 30fps, though I noticed some jitters with walk-and-talk footage, especially in low light. Dropping to 4K60 improves stability, reduces shake, and enhances brightness, making it the better choice if you want to shoot at a higher resolution than HD. The phone's optical image stabilization works well to counter hand movements. Colors look good across all settings but are more vibrant at 4K and below. Of note, Samsung has added support for Log video capture. This is for professionals who want to be able to apply color profiles after the fact."", ""All Galaxy S25 phones ship with Android 15 and Samsung's One UI 7 atop it. Matching Google's Pixel policy, the S25+ will receive seven generations of OS updates and seven years of security upgrades."", ""One UI brings a great deal of functionality, like Galaxy AI and Samsung's custom tweaks.

I couldn't tell any difference in the speed or quality of the results."", 'Below are some highlights from testing:', 'Cross App Actions let you make complex requests using Google Gemini, the new default assistant. Normally, when you request information, it\'s up to you what you do with it. Gemini lets you request information and then take action in one request. For example, asking Gemini to ""Create a workout plan for a 45-year-old man and place it in Notes"" does exactly that. In testing, Gemini found the information online, organized it, created a note in Google Keep, and pasted in the information.', 'Natural language search in the Settings and the Gallery apps lets you find things by merely describing concepts. For example, you can go into Settings and search for ""I missed a notification"" using your voice or text. The Galaxy S25+ will bring you the Notification History option, which is otherwise accessible via Settings > Notifications > Advanced Settings > Notification History.', ""The Gallery search tool works in the same way. You can still search for general image types like screenshots or motion photos, but you can also ask for more specific things. I searched for pictures of statues, and the Gallery app found them. It didn't mix up humans for statues or vice versa, which is quite impressive."", 'Natural language search is separate from Gemini and uses Bixby on the backend. You can directly ask Bixby to find things in the Gallery app, but Bixby does not work exactly the same as searches in specific apps.', 'The Gallery app has some great offline capabilities in the S25 series. You can perform generative edits like removing or resizing items in photos, for instance. Best Face lets you replace faces in group photos as long as the original image is a motion photo; the final result is a still image.', 'Audio Eraser analyzes videos, categorizes the sounds, and lets you remix the audio in real time. It does a great job of removing wind noise, though it can struggle with overly loud background music.', 'In a test video, I played ""I Am the Walrus"" by the Beatles while talking. I used Audio Eraser to remove my voice from the video, then used the enhanced Circle to Search feature to identify the background song (it can now recognize music playing on your device). Sure enough, Circle to Search correctly identified the song.', 'Portrait Studio attempts to turn faces into works of art in several styles, such as comics, sketches, and watercolors. But as you can see below, it consistently got my skin tone incorrect and sometimes arguably changed my race.', ""Overall, most of these AI functions make the Galaxy S25+ easier to use. You don't need to learn how your phone works because you can talk to it like a person. It generally understands what you're trying to do. I especially appreciate how context-aware menus break from the rigid hierarchy of menus and nested options."", ""The Samsung Galaxy S25+ offers nearly everything that makes the Ultra great in a slightly smaller and more affordable package.

Beaten only by the iPhone 14, which was essentially an iPhone 13 with some very minor upgrades.', ""It's getting to the point where I’m wondering whether my money would be better spent buying a Galaxy S24 Ultra instead."", 'When you look at the Galaxy S25 Ultra specs, and compare them to last year’s model, there isn’t a whole lot of what I’d consider “new” stuff. The screen is marginally bigger at 6.9-inches, and the chipset has been upgraded to a newer and faster model. There’s also a version of Qi2, though it relies on a specialist case if you want the magnetic benefits.', 'Really the only major hardware upgrade is the 50MP ultrawide camera. That’s a useful upgrade, even if it is long overdue, and it’s going to help the Galaxy S25 Ultra claim a position on our best camera phones page. But it’s not the kind of upgrade that makes buying a whole new phone worthwhile.', 'In fact there are a couple of places where the Galaxy S25 Ultra is either a downgrade compared to last year or still not on par with some of its main rivals.', 'The S Pen is proving to be the most infamous of these, with Samsung stripping out the Bluetooth functionality and related features from the stylus — claiming they weren’t popular enough to keep around. Samsung claims that a Bluetooth enabled pen will go on sale as a standalone product, but that feels like a price hike with extra steps.', 'Tom’s Guide Phones Editor John Velasco also pointed out that the loss of Air Gestures meant that the Galaxy S25’s desktop mode (DeX) isn’t nearly as useful this time around. So it’s no surprise that it hasn’t stopped a petition trying to return the decision from appearing.', 'Other notable omissions include any meaningful rise in wireless charging speeds, which is still stuck at 15W. The maximum amount of RAM available in the U.S. is also 12GB, despite rumors that a 16GB model could make an appearance. RAM is very important for on-device AI, and we’re seeing other Android flagships like the Pixel 9 Pro boost its memory up to 16GB. Given how much Samsung has emphasized AI in the Galaxy S25 series, it’s a massive surprise that the Ultra model now has the same amount of RAM as the standard and Plus models.', 'There’s more to a phone than mere hardware, and software does play a big part in what the device can do. Unfortunately it’s unclear whether the Galaxy S25 offers much that won’t also come to older phones.', 'Samsung has spent a great deal of time discussing how the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s software can benefit the phone and its users. AI in particular has been at the forefront of Samsung’s marketing, offering up a bunch of ways Galaxy AI is improving this year.', 'A big part of how Galaxy AI has changed involves the addition of AI agents, and multimodal capabilities that allow Galaxy AI to see and understand multiple kinds of input — including speech, text, images and video. All with the aim of making the process of communicating with AI more natural. It’s a big change for Samsung, even if these aren’t particularly unique capabilities.', 'For all the benefits Samsung has been lauding, it’s unclear whether these improvements are general upgrades to Galaxy AI — or features kept exclusively for the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung hasn’t been particularly clear on this point, and the last thing anyone wants is to pick up a new $1,300 phone only to find that all its best features are also available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra.', ""On the one hand Samsung does have the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which promises to offer greater performance and helps power more advanced on-device AI processing. But on the other hand, we've already seen that some features, like the Now Bar, are already available as part of the One UI 7 beta — meaning it's available (in some form) on the year-old Galaxy S24 Ultra as well. Likewise improvements to Circle to Search and other Google-made AI features are likely to make their way to Pixels and other Android phones in the coming weeks and months."", 'Not knowing what the future holds for Galaxy AI, and other software flourishes, makes me even more hesitant to take the plunge and pick up a Galaxy S25 Ultra. We don’t know what One UI 7 has in store for older Galaxy phones, and if last year is anything to go by we could see a bunch of new AI features and upgrades make their way to older phones.', 'Heck, even the Samsung Galaxy A35 supports some Galaxy AI features — and that’s $900 cheaper than the S25 Ultra. And bearing all that in mind, it has me seriously doubting whether the Galaxy S25 Ultra is worth it.', 'If you have an older phone, or maybe even a mid-range model then perhaps the S25 Ultra will be a worthwhile upgrade. There’s a lot on offer here, and while it does cost a lot, I have no doubt that the S25 Ultra will be one of the best phones you can buy. But that doesn’t change the fact that this is a very disappointing upgrade, and it feels like Samsung hasn’t tried that hard to give us a substantial upgrade.', 'Whether its downgrades to the S Pen, minimal extra hardware, or software that could easily come to older phones in the near future, the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn’t really seem to have a unique selling point. Worse still the rounded design means that it’s lost its visual distinctiveness compared to other phones.', 'If you’re spending $1,300 on a brand new phone, the last thing you need is either the same thing as last year, or something that doesn’t stand out against the competition. Unfortunately the Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to hit both those boxes.', 'I shot professional headshots with the Galaxy S25 Ultra — here’s how it compares to the iPhone 16 Pro Max', ""Nothing Phone 3a launch date just got confirmed — there's not long to wait"", 'Best Samsung Galaxy S25 cases in 2025']"

Here’s how it works.', 'I’ve never been a huge fan of ultra-wide cameras, even on some of the best camera phones. Too often, the cameras don’t have a high enough resolution to produce crisp photos when scrutinizing the detail, or there’s too much warping on the edges. I’ve always felt the physical limitation of the small sensors and lenses used in smartphone ultra-wide cameras hold them back from delivering the more impressive shots of main and telephoto cameras.', 'I’ve also never been a fan of how Samsung’s ultra-wide cameras in its Galaxy S-series, with photos that appear noisy and lacking sharpness, even occasionally looking a bit smudged when peering deeper into a shot.', 'However, with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the South Korean tech giant appears to have turned a corner with its ultra-wide cameras. That’s because the S25 Ultra comes with a 50-megapixel rather than the 12MP ultra-wide camera of the Galaxy S24 Ultra.', 'It’s been a common idea that megapixels don’t mean a great deal when it comes to smartphone cameras, especially those on the best phones. But I’m starting to see a shift in the sands in that there’s only so much smart computational photography can do with 12MP sensors and images. In contrast, more detail sucked in by a higher megapixel sensor effectively means more data to process and, thus, more scope to get a better photo.', 'With the caveat that others on the TechRadar team and I are continuing to test the Galaxy S25 suite of smartphones, I quickly pitched the ultra-wide camera of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the 12MP ultra-wide on my iPhone 16 Pro Max; my main phone.', 'In the photo samples below, you’ll see the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s ultra-wide camera in its default 12MP mode – an annoying default, but I understand it saves on file size – and 50MP shots, alongside 12MP iPhone 16 Pro Max snaps.', 'At a quick glance, it’s not particularly easy to see huge differences between the shots other than different interpretations of colors; Samsung, as usual, favors punchier colors over the iPhone’s more muted take.', 'But look closer, and you’ll see finer details in the foreground of the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s 50MP ultra-wide shots vs the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s. Punch into a shot, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra resolves sharper details than its rival.', 'The same is broadly true when comparing the 12MP ultra-wide versus the 50MP shots on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. You have to go on the hunt for changes, as both shots use the same camera sensors; just the 12MP images are being produced with pixel-binning to make a 50MP snap smaller.', 'Still, from what I can tell, this process naturally loses some detail on a shot but also removes a degree of dynamic range; in the 12MP shots, shadows and highlights are more uniform, whereas in the 50MP photos, there’s more of a gradient from light to dark.', ""I find this pertinent, as recent conversations about flagship phone cameras have focused on how they tend to produce somewhat flat photos by bringing up the shadows and pulling down bright parts. This can bring out more detail but results in a photo that doesn't look quite true to life and ends up lacking some contrast that can help make a photo pop."", 'So, my key takeaway for anyone planning to get a Galaxy S25 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode in the ultra-wide camera for the best results.', 'And I think this is a sign that Apple should look to follow the example set by the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro, as well as the Pixel 8 Pro, and adopt a larger pixel count with the ultra-wide camera on the iPhone 17 Pro.', 'Head to the comment and let me know which ultra-wide photos you prefer, and do check out our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review; also, keep TechRadar bookmarked as we’ll have more thoughts and experiences with the Galaxy S25 phones as we keep digging into them.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', 'Roland Moore-Colyer is Managing Editor at TechRadar with a focus on phones and tablets, but a general interest in all things tech, especially those with a good story behind them.
