Complementary methods for the robust detection of tissue MNPs, including pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, confirm the presence of MNPs in human kidney, liver and brain. MNPs in these organs primarily consist of polyethylene, with lesser but significant concentrations of other polymers. Brain tissues harbor higher proportions of polyethylene compared to the composition of the plastics in liver or kidney, and electron microscopy verified the nature of the isolated brain MNPs, which present largely as nanoscale shard-like fragments. Plastic concentrations in these decedent tissues were not influenced by age, sex, race/ethnicity or cause of death; the time of death (2016 versus 2024) was a significant factor, with increasing MNP concentrations over time in both liver and brain samples (P\u2009=\u20090.01). Finally, even greater accumulation of MNPs was observed in a cohort of decedent brains with documented dementia diagnosis, with notable deposition in cerebrovascular walls and immune cells. These results highlight a critical need to better understand the routes of exposure, uptake and clearance pathways and potential health consequences of plastics in human tissues, particularly in the brain.', 'Environmental concentrations of anthropogenic microplastic and nanoplastic (MNP), polymer-based particulates ranging from 500\u2009µm in diameter down to 1\u2009nm, have increased exponentially over the past half century1,2. The extent to which MNPs cause human harm or toxicity is unclear, although recent studies associated MNP presence in carotid atheromas with increased inflammation and risk of future adverse cardiovascular events3,4. In controlled cell culture and animal exposure studies, MNPs exacerbate disease or drive toxic outcomes, but at concentrations with unclear relevance to human exposures and body burdens5,6. The mantra of the field of toxicology—‘dose makes the poison’ (Paracelsus)—renders such discoveries as easily anticipated; what is not clearly understood is the tissue distribution and internal dose of MNPs in humans, which confounds our ability to interpret the controlled exposure study results.', 'So far, visual microscopic spectroscopy methods have identified particulates in organs, such as the lungs, intestine7 and placenta8. These methods are often limited to larger (>5\u2009µm) particulates; thus, smaller nanoplastics are unintentionally excluded. As a new approach, pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) has been applied to blood9, placentas10 and recently major blood vessels3,4 in a manner that appears more cumulative, quantitative and less biased when coupled with orthogonal methods. Py-GC/MS data between labs has been comparable, providing confidence in this method for human tissue analysis3,9,10. Here we applied Py-GC/MS in concert with visualization methods to assess the relative distribution of MNPs in major organ systems from human decedent livers, kidneys and brains.', 'We obtained de-identified, postmortem human liver (right central parenchyma), kidney (wedge piece containing cortex and medulla) and brain (frontal cortex) samples, retrospectively from 2016 and 2024 autopsy specimens (Supplementary Table 1), in cooperation with and approval from the University of New Mexico (UNM) Office of the Medical Investigator (OMI) in Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM), under the guidance of a trained forensic pathologist (D.F.G.) who selected consistent regions from all organs. Py-GC/MS measurements of MNP concentrations in decedent liver and kidney specimens were similar, with the median value of total plastics at 433 and 404\u2009µg\u2009g−1, respectively, from 2024 samples (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). These were higher than previously published data for human placentas (median\u2009=\u200963.4\u2009µg\u2009g−1)10 and testes (median\u2009=\u2009299\u2009µg\u2009g−1)11. Brain samples, all derived from the frontal cortex, exhibited substantially higher concentrations of MNPs than liver or kidney (two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), P\u2009<\u20090.0001), but comparable to recently published Py-GC/MS data from carotid plaques4, with a median of 3345\u2009µg\u2009g−1 (25–75%: 1,267–5,213\u2009µg\u2009g−1) in 2016 samples and 4917\u2009µg\u2009g−1 (25–75%: 4,026–5,608\u2009µg\u2009g−1) in 2024 samples (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1).', 'a, Microplastic concentrations in liver, kidney and brain decedent human samples (n\u2009=\u200920–28 separate participants for each timepoint; Supplementary Table 1) from the UNM OMI. Data are shown on a log10 scale, with the bar representing the group median value and 95% confidence interval. Orange-colored symbols in the 2016 brain samples were analyzed independently at Oklahoma State University. P values from Mann–Whitney tests (two-sided) indicate significant differences in samples from the same organ between 2016 and 2024 (with more comprehensive statistical treatments in Supplementary Methods—Statistical analysis). Brain MNP concentrations were significantly higher than liver and kidney, analyzed by two-way ANOVA (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). b, Overall distribution of 12 different polymers suggests a greater accumulation of PE in the brain relative to liver or kidney (average shown per group; see Extended Data Fig. 1 for individual data). c, PE (which was in the highest abundance and consistently had the highest confidence spectra) concentrations in all organs followed similar trends compared to total plastics (also represented as group median value and 95% confidence interval; two-sided Mann–Whitney test). d, Additional brain samples from specimens collected from 1997 to 2013 were obtained from the Duke Kathleen Price Bryan Brain Bank in North Carolina (n\u2009=\u200913, blue diamonds; NC), the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center in Massachusetts (n\u2009=\u20099, green diamonds; MA) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Brain and Tissue Bank at the University of Maryland (n\u2009=\u20095, orange diamonds; MD) show lower concentrations of microplastics. Brain samples from decedents with diagnosed dementia (n\u2009=\u200912, purple circles) from UNM exhibit far greater MNP concentrations than brain tissues from participants without dementia from New Mexico (red thin-outline diamonds; NM). Overall linear regression trend was significantly nonzero (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) with an R2\u2009=\u20090.3982; summary points for 2016 and 2024 normal UNM OMI brains reflect mean\u2009±\u2009s.d. N66, nylon 66; ABS, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; N6, nylon-6; PMMA, poly(methyl methacrylate); PU, polyurethane; PC, polycarbonate; PS, polystyrene.', 'Liver and brain samples from 2024 had significantly higher concentrations of MNPs than 2016 samples on both post hoc multiple comparisons of the two-way ANOVA (Supplementary Tables 4–7 and Supplementary Fig. 6), consistent with results from a multiple regression analysis of brain concentrations considering the potential influence of other demographic variables (Supplementary Tables 8–10). Five brain samples from 2016 (highlighted in orange in Fig. 1a) were analyzed independently by colleagues at Oklahoma State University using Py-GC/MS, and those values were consistent with our findings (P\u2009=\u20090.49 for a Student’s t test comparing UNM and OSU data). The proportion of polyethylene (PE) in the brain (75% on average) was greater relative to other polymers and compared to PE in the liver and kidney (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). PE, polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) concentrations specifically increased from 2016 to 2024 in liver and brain samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2). PE predominance was confirmed with attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis from five brain samples, although other polymers were not as consistent in prevalence, possibly due to differences in prevalence across size distributions and limited sampling (Supplementary Tables 9–13 and Supplementary Figs. 17–25).', 'To expand these findings, we obtained brain tissue from earlier time frames (1997–2013) with a mean age of death comparable to the NM cohorts (52.8\u2009±\u200934.3\u2009years) from locations in the eastern United States, along with samples from a repository of dementia cases at UNM. Py-GC/MS analysis revealed lower overall MNP concentrations in East Coast samples (median\u2009=\u20091,254\u2009µg\u2009g−1; Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1d). While geographical differences cannot be ruled out, we applied a simple linear regression including all normal brain biospecimen data, which revealed significantly increasing trends for total plastics, PE, PP, PVC and SBR (Extended Data Fig. 2). To extend findings to a specific neurological condition, Py-GC/MS was conducted on 12 dementia cases collected in the NM OMI. These cases included Alzheimer’s disease (n\u2009=\u20096), vascular dementia (n\u2009=\u20093) and other dementia (n\u2009=\u20093) specimens from 2019 to 2024. Py-GC/MS analysis revealed total plastics concentrations in dementia samples (median\u2009=\u200926,076\u2009µg\u2009g−1; Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1) that were higher than in any normal frontal cortex cohort (P\u2009<\u20090.0001 by two-sided t test). Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood–brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase MNP concentrations; thus, no causality is assumed from these findings.', 'Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and polarization wave microscopy, refractory inclusions were identified in all organs histologically (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 7–16). Within the liver, these inclusions were widely dispersed but also notably aggregated within acellular regions consistent with the expected frequency and morphology of lipid droplets, with rod-shaped particles in the 1–5\u2009µm size range (Extended Data Fig. 3a). In the kidney, an elevated presence of refractile inclusions of similar sizes was noted in glomeruli and along tubules (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). Based on elevated concentrations of polymers identified by Py-GC/MS in these tissues, we suspected that much of the MNPs may be present in the nanoscale range, too small for visualization by light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was therefore conducted on the dispersed KOH-insoluble pellets obtained from the liver and kidney (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Fig. 9). While this visualization method cannot provide spectroscopic confirmation of polymer composition, we observed common shapes and sizes across samples and tissue types. Particulates isolated from the pellets and well-dispersed appeared shard-like and were typically less than 0.4\u2009µm in length, consistent with recent findings of nanoplastics in farmed mussels12. SEM with energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed that particles observed in livers, kidneys and brains were principally composed of carbon (Extended Data Figs. 4–7). Based on the larger morphology of particulates observed in situ versus those isolated and dispersed from the pellets of digested tissue, we postulate that aggregation of nanoplastics may occur in the liver and kidney.', 'a,b, Polarization wave microscopy (a, black arrows indicate refractory inclusions; inset is a digital magnification for clarity) and SEM (b, visual fields are 15.4 and 20.1\u2009µm wide) were used to scan sections of brain from decedent human samples. c, Large (>1\u2009µm) inclusions were not observed; additional polarization wave examples are highlighted (white arrows highlight submicron refractory inclusions). Resolution limitations of these technologies drove the use of TEM to examine the extracts from the pellets used for Py-GC/MS. d, Example TEM images resolved innumerable shard- or flake-like solid particulates following dispersion, with dimensions largely <200\u2009nm in length and <40\u2009nm in width. e,f, Polarization wave microscopy reveals substantially more refractile inclusions in dementia cases, especially in regions with associated immune cell accumulation (e) and along the vascular walls (f). All images were collected on a small subset of participants (n\u2009=\u200910 for normal brains; n\u2009=\u20093 for dementia cases) to provide visual evidence to support analytical chemistry.', 'In brain tissues, larger (1–5\u2009µm) refractile inclusions were not seen, but smaller particulates (<1\u2009µm) were noted in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Figs. 10–15). Given the resolution limitations of light microscopy, we examined resuspended brain pellets by TEM, which revealed largely 100–200\u2009nm long shards or flakes (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 9 and 16). In situ, we confirmed that particles found in the brain were carbon-based by SEM with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS; Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7). In dementia samples, many refractile inclusions were prominent in regions with inflammatory cells and along the vascular wall (Fig. 2e,f). MNP uptake and distribution pathways are poorly understood, and the mechanism of how nanoplastics are delivered to and taken up into the brain is unknown. Insights from Daphnia magna suggest clathrin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis may underlie nanoplastic translocation within the intestine13; we posit a similar uptake may occur in human ingestion of lipids that would also facilitate selective transfer into the brain. While blood was not cleared from the decedent’s organs during autopsy, it is unlikely that the nanoplastics in the brain are selectively contained in the vascular compartment, as the kidneys and livers would also have comparable blood volumes.', 'While we suspected that MNPs might accumulate in the body over a lifespan, the lack of correlation between total plastics and decedent age (P\u2009=\u20090.87 for brain data) does not support this (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, total mass concentration of plastics in the brains analyzed in this study increased by approximately 50% in the past 8\u2009years. Thus, we postulate that the exponentially increasing environmental concentrations of MNPs2,14 may analogously increase internal maximal concentrations. Although there are few studies to draw on yet performed in mammals, in zebrafish exposed to constant concentrations, nanoplastic uptake increased to a stable plateau and cleared after exposure15; however, the maximal internal concentrations were increased proportionately with higher nanoplastic exposure concentrations. While clearance rates and elimination routes of MNPs from the brain remain uncharacterized, it is possible that an equilibrium—albeit variable between people—might occur between exposure, uptake and clearance, with environmental exposure concentrations ultimately determining the internal body burden.', 'Although the current data derive from multiple tissue banks and two analytic sites replicating key results, the new analytical Py-GC/MS methods applied here are yet to be widely adopted and refined into standardized tests for clinical specimens. Both analytical laboratories (UNM and OSU) observed a ~25% within-sample coefficient of variation, which does not alter the conclusions regarding temporal trends or accumulation in brains relative to other tissues, given the magnitude of those effects. Numerous quality control steps ensure that external contaminants are not impacting the results, including Py-GC/MS assessment of KOH and formalin storage control sample ‘blanks’ and measurements of the polymer composition of all plastic tubes and pipette tips that are essential in the digestion and measurement process (Supplementary Figs. 2–4). Decedent specimen collections over the past 30\u2009years were not focused on minimizing external plastic contamination. However, given the consistent nature of handling and processing across all organ samples within objectively clean clinical and forensic settings, the significant accumulation of MNPs in the brain cannot be dismissed as an artifact of contamination. Furthermore, the 2016 samples were stored for 84–96\u2009months compared to only 2–4\u2009months for the 2024 samples, which exhibited greater concentrations of polymer. Thus, contamination from plastic storage vessels should not influence the conclusions. For the brain, especially, greater attention to anatomical features, such as white versus gray matter, vascularization and glia content, should be carefully evaluated in future studies to reduce variation. Finally, by obtaining only a single sample from each organ for each participant, distribution heterogeneity within tissues remains uncharacterized.', 'Our estimates of polymer mass concentration could be impacted by several factors that may lead to overestimation or underestimation. The KOH digestion extensively eliminated biological material from the pellets through saponification of triglycerides and denaturing of proteins (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the final pellets still contained unknown residual biomatrix, which could present challenges for mass spectral interference. KOH reduced the liver and kidney mass by 99.4%, while the brain samples were reduced by 91.8%, that is, the resultant average pellet mass derived from 500\u2009mg of starting material was approximately 3\u2009mg and 41\u2009mg, respectively. This discrepancy is proportional to, and consistent with, the mass of the polymer measured. However, unknown organic molecules likely remain and influence the resultant Py-GC/MS spectra. Lipids have been noted as a potential source of interference in Py-GC/MS analysis of PE16. Our method of KOH digestion and physical separation of solids was designed to reduce this concern, rather than augment it with a liquid–liquid extraction in organic solvents that would selectively drive lipid partitioning. Furthermore, the spectra suggest a reduction of longer carbon chains in the pyrolysis chromatogram, which is potentially due to advanced oxidative degradation of the MNPs and excess carbonyl formation that may lead to an underestimation of the concentration, as our standards are created with pristine polymers17,18. Finally, given the observed small size of nanoscale particles isolated from the human specimens (typically <200\u2009nm in length), it is likely that ultracentrifugation incompletely collected nanoplastics in the analytical samples, also contributing to potential underestimation. The shape and size of observed nanoparticles in the isolated material from human specimens taxes the limits of modern analytical instrumentation but may reflect an end-stage product of plastic degradation that is uniquely suited for human uptake and accumulation.', 'The present data suggest a trend of increasing MNP concentrations in the brain and liver. The majority of MNPs found in tissues consist of PE and appear to be nanoplastic shards or flakes. MNP concentrations in normal decedent brain samples were 7–30 times greater than the concentrations seen in livers or kidneys, and brain samples from dementia cases exhibited even greater MNP presence. These data are associative and do not establish a causal role for such particles affecting health. For this, refinements to the analytical techniques, more complex study designs and much larger cohorts are needed. Given the exponentially rising environmental presence of MNPs19,20,21, these data compel a much larger effort to understand whether MNPs have a role in neurological disorders or other human health effects.', 'The same tissue collection protocol at the UNM OMI was used for 2016 and 2024. Small pieces of representative organs (3–5\u2009cm3) were routinely collected at autopsy and stored in 10% formalin. Additionally, decedent samples from a cohort with confirmed dementia (n\u2009=\u200912) were included, also collected at the UNM OMI under identical procedures. Limited demographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity, cause of death and date of death) were available due to the conditions of specimen approval; age of death, race/ethnicity and sex were relatively consistent across cohorts (Supplementary Table 1). Additional brain samples (n\u2009=\u200928) were obtained from repositories on the East Coast of the United States to provide a greater range for the year of death (going back to 1997). All studies were approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards.', 'Py-GC/MS is an informative and reliable method to determine plastic concentrations in liquid and solid tissue samples, with ample assurance of accuracy, quality and rigor3,4,9,10. Briefly, solid particulates are isolated from chemically digested tissue samples and then combusted to reveal signature mass spectra for select polymers (see full details in Supplementary Methods—Pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS)). Thus, the Py-GC/MS output is derived from enriched solid polymer particles and not soluble components from the digested tissue. Samples (~500\u2009mg) were digested with 10% potassium hydroxide for at least 3\u2009days at 40\u2009°C. Samples were then ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 4\u2009h to generate a pellet enriched in solid materials resistant to such digestion, which included polymer-based solids10. A 1–2\u2009mg portion of the resulting pellet was then analyzed by single-shot Py-GC/MS and compared to a microplastics-CaCO3 standard containing the following 12 specific polymers: PE, PVC, nylon 66, SBR, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon-6, poly(methyl methacrylate), polyurethane, polycarbonate, PP and polystyrene. Py-GCMS operating settings and polymer pyrolyzate targets are described in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, with examples of spectra from samples, standards and blanks shown in Supplementary Figs. 2–4. Polymer spectra were identified via F-Search MPs v2.1 software (Frontier Labs). The resulting data were normalized to the original sample weight to render a mass concentration (µg\u2009g−1).', 'Details of statistical analyses (normalization steps, two-way ANOVA and multiple regression) are provided in the Supplementary Methods—Statistical analysis.', 'Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.', 'More extensive methods and results are provided in the online Supplementary Information.

Researchers found a spoon's worth of nanoplastics in human brains — the latest evidence that plastic is accumulating in our bodies,https://www.businessinsider.com/microplastics-human-brains-high-levels-2025-1,"['The brain is the most well-protected organ in the human body, but it has a surprisingly high amount of microplastic pollution, according to a study published in Nature Medicine on Monday.', 'Researchers examined 52 brain samples from autopsies and found they contained seven to 30 times more microplastics and nanoplastics than the kidney and liver samples.', 'The amount of plastic the researchers found in the average brain sample is about equivalent to a plastic spoon, Matthew Campen, the lead author, said.', 'He said measurement methods are still being developed. ""We\'re working hard to get to a very precise estimate,"" Campen said in a press conference on Monday.', 'The brain samples were taken from the prefrontal cortex, which controls behavior and is involved with decision-making. Most of the plastics found were nano-sized shards or flakes of polyethylene, which is used in plastic bags, plastic food wrapping, and plastic water bottles.', ""It's unclear what effect this may have on neurological health. In the study, the 12 people with documented dementia had higher levels of nanoplastics in their brain samples compared to samples from people without dementia."", '""We cannot say, from this study, that micro-nanoplastics are causing dementia,"" Jaime Ross, an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island who wasn\'t involved with the study, told Business Insider.', 'Dementia patients often have impaired blood-brain barriers, meaning the elevated levels of micro- and nanoplastics may have been a symptom and not a cause of the disease.', '""I think it\'s going to be challenging for clinicians to distill the important parts of this down for patients,"" said Campen, a toxicologist and professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico. ""The big thing that patients need to hear is that it\'s not known that there are health effects that are caused by the plastics at this point.""', ""Microplastics have been found in many parts of the human body, including the heart, liver, testicles, and breast milk. Experts don't fully understand the health impact, though some studies have linked microplastics to heart disease, strokes, and low sperm count. Researchers are also investigating whether they play a role in the risk of developing certain types of cancers."", '""It wouldn\'t surprise me if micro-nanoplastics are affecting us. We just don\'t know to what extent, yet,"" said Ross, who coauthored a paper published in 2023 that found behavioral changes and brain inflammation in mice after they drank microplastic-polluted water for three weeks straight.', 'Unlike the kidney, liver, and other organs, the human brain has a protective filter called the blood-brain barrier that blocks many harmful pathogens and toxins.', ""Campen said it's unclear from his research how so many nanoplastics are managing to cross the blood-brain barrier, but the brain's high proportion of lipids, or fats, likely plays a role."", '""If you\'ve ever cleaned a Tupperware bowl that had bacon grease or butter in it, it takes a lot of soap and hot water. It\'s really hard to get the plastics and fats apart. We think that\'s part of this process,"" Campen said.', 'The latest study didn\'t show higher levels of micro- and nanoplastics in older brains compared to younger brains, suggesting our bodies can pass enough of these plastics in our feces to prevent buildup. ""So we\'re not just accumulating these over time, over our lifetimes,"" Campen said. More research is needed to confirm that finding.', 'The study did, however, find an increase in micro- and nanoplastics in brain and liver samples taken from individuals who died in 2024 compared to 2016. Campen said this increase is likely because there are more plastics in the environment.', '""This is significant because it suggests that if we were to reduce environmental contamination with microplastics, the levels of human exposure would also decrease,"" Tamara Galloway, a professor of ecotoxicology at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the research, said in a statement.', ""Microplastics are inescapable — they're in our food, air, water, and trash."", 'You can reduce your exposure by washing your hands before you eat, removing plastic from food before microwaving, and avoiding drinking from plastic bottles.', '']"

Our brains are no exception.', 'NUGROHO RIDHO/MOMENT/GETTY IMAGES PLUS', 'By Laura Sanders', 'FEBRUARY 3, 2025 AT 11:00 AM', 'Our brains are increasingly plastic. Minuscule shards and flakes of polymers are surprisingly abundant in brain tissue, a study of postmortem brains shows.', 'This appraisal of microplastics and nanoplastics, published February 3 in Nature Medicine, raises questions and worries about what this plastic is doing to us.', '“The findings are both significant and concerning,” says Raffaele Marfella, a cardiovascular researcher at University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli” in Naples, Italy. He and colleagues recently found that people with more micro- and nanoplastics, or MNPs for short, in blood vessel plaques were at higher risk of heart attacks, strokes and death.', 'Plastic levels are tricky to measure. To get the full picture, researchers used several different methods to measure MNPs in 91 brain samples collected from people who died as far back as 1997. The measurements all pointed to substantial increases over the years. From 2016 to 2024, the median concentration of MNPs increased by about 50 percent, from 3,345 micrograms per gram to 4,917 micrograms per gram.', '“The levels of plastic being detected in the brain are almost unbelievable,” says study coauthor Andrew West, a neuroscientist at Duke University. “In fact, I didn’t believe it until I saw all the data” from multiple tests with different samples.', 'Unbelievable, but not surprising, given how plastic has permeated the world. “Microplastics are in the food we eat, the water we drink and even the air we breathe,” says Richard Thompson, a microplastic pollution expert at the University of Plymouth in England, who helped discover microplastics. Of course they’ve made their way into human tissue, he says. Earlier studies have found them in lungs, intestines, blood, liver and placenta.', 'In the samples collected in 2024, concentrations of MNPs in brain tissue were about 10 times higher than levels in liver and kidney tissue, the researchers report. Scientists had wondered if the blood-brain barrier, a cellular do-not-pass zone, could keep these polymers out. That doesn’t seem to be the case.', '“This study clearly demonstrates that they are there and in high concentrations,” says Phoebe Stapleton, a toxicologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. “The next steps will be to understand what they are doing [in the brain] and how the body responds to them.”', 'In addition to the levels of MNPs being described, their shapes are unexpected, Stapleton says. Thin, sharp particles — not solid grains — were present in the brain tissue. Many lab studies of MNPs experiment with engineered beads of polystyrene, a plastic extensively used in food industry, medical supplies and more. But the brains didn’t have much polystyrene; there was, however, abundant polyethylene, another common household plastic that shows up in grocery bags, shampoo bottle and toys. And the shards didn’t look like beads. “The aged shards that wind up in the brain look like nothing we have used yet in the lab,” West says.', 'Higher MNP levels appeared in 12 brains of people with dementia diagnoses. That result can’t say anything about whether one caused the other. Brain changes that come with dementia could allow more plastic to enter, for instance.\n\nPuzzlingly, MNP levels weren’t linked to age at death, but did vary quite a bit among people, the study shows. Researchers are keen to understand why some people have high levels while others seem to have avoided buildup, West says.', 'The results come with caveats. The sample sizes were relatively small. Contamination risks and variability in measurements can make interpretation hard. And this study didn’t follow plastic levels in living people, so it’s not known if or how MNPs might fluctuate over time.', 'Big questions remain, including how MNPs get into the brain, whether they can be removed and — perhaps most pressing — if they are harmful or benign. “Simply put, we do not know the health implications of microplastics in the brain,” West says. But he also says that it would be a mistake to wait to get all the answers before addressing the issue. “People are wondering, ‘Is this the next asbestos, or the next lead, or is it even something much worse than what we’ve seen — harder to detect and harder to get rid of?’”', 'Sponsor Message', 'Questions or comments on this article?

Microplastics look like a ‘car crash’ in mice brains,https://www.popsci.com/health/mouse-brain-microplastics/,"['BY ANDREW PAUL', 'POSTED ON JAN 27, 2025', 'Microplastics are everywhere, both across nature and inside our bodies. And while evidence shows these synthetic particulates aren’t great for you, the medical community still isn’t entirely sure how the plastic specifically affects health, as well as its influence on preexisting conditions like an increased risk of heart attack or stroke. For the first time, however, experts succeeded in visually tracking the movement of microplastics through brain blood vessels in mice—and the pile-ups resembled a microscopic “car crash.”', 'The findings, published in the journal Science Advances by a team at Beijing’s Peking University, expand on existing research already showcasing microplastic’s potential neurotoxicity.', '“Nanoscale plastics can breach the blood-brain barrier, [but] how [microplastics] cause brain functional irregularities remains unclear,” wrote the study’s authors.', 'Researchers relied on a fluorescence imaging technique known as two-photon microscopy to get a clearer look on ingested microplastic movements in real-time. In order to do so, however, they first needed to create a small, transparent window into the skulls of lab mice. They then trained the tool on the direct cranial opening after providing their test subjects with water mixed with tiny spheres of fluorescent polystyrene. Previous studies have recorded an estimated 12 nanograms of microplastics per milliliter of blood in humans, so researchers approximated a proportional amount of polystyrene to deliver to the mice. Still one of the most common plastics, polystyrene is found in many toys, packaging, and home appliances. From there, they waited and watched. ', 'According to the study announcement, glowing cells began appearing in brain blood vessels around three hours later. Closer examination suggested they were a combination of neutrophils and phagocytes, two immune system cells responsible for eating harmful foreign objects. Some likely got stuck in the many curves of the smaller blood vessels around the brain’s cortex. But more plastic-laced cells also stacked “like a car crash,” explained Peking University biomedical researcher and study co-author, Haipeng Huang.', 'These pile-ups eventually resembled blood clots, similarly minimizing blood flow to the brain anywhere from days to weeks.

The human body’s blood circulation volume is around 1,200 times larger, with wider vascular diameters that likely reduces the potential for microplastic obstructions.', 'At the same time, our narrowest capillary microvessels measure 8-10 nanometers—not far off from the 8-9 nanometer diameters in mice venous vessel terminal branches. Knowing this, some microplastic obstructions are “likely to have detrimental consequences for cardiovascular health and may result in more severe adverse effects, especially in patients with underlying conditions similar to myocardial infarction,” the researchers caution.', 'Nature noted that previous studies support the latest observations, particularly one that discovered “tiny, weathered plastic shards” in brain tissue, including blood vessel walls and immune cells, in human bodies donated to research.

Such particles have been found in multiple parts of human bodies: arteries, hearts, lungs, blood, placentas, breast milk, penis and testicles, among others."", 'Finding the particles in higher concentrations in the brain was a surprise because of the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain against infection.', '""For those of us who work in the brain, showing that the highest levels (of microplastic) were measured in that organ is profound and a bit concerning,"" Richardson said.', 'The researchers think one reason there are higher levels of microplastic in the brain is because the liver and kidneys are built to filter toxins from the body, said Marcus Garcia, a doctor of pharmacy at the University of New Mexico and part of the team that did the research.', '""We think the liver and kidney are doing their jobs,"" he said. ""On the other hand, the brain has limited clearance systems,"" he said.', 'Another possibility is that brain tissue is about 60% fat, meaning the plastics might stick to it better.', '""If you\'ve ever cleaned a Tupperware bowl that had bacon grease or butter in it, you know it\'s hard to get fat off plastic,"" said Campen.

Johnson, MD', 'DISCLOSURES\n\n\n|\nFebruary 03, 2025', '', '00:00\n10:08', 'This transcript has been edited for clarity.', ""Hello. I'm Dr David Johnson, professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia. "", ""Plastics are a daily part of our lives that we use all the time. We have a plastic water bottle in our hand when we travel, we cook with plastics, our groceries come wrapped in plastics, and our food gets heated up in plastic containers. This speaks to the incredible growth in plastic production over the past seven decades, stretching back to the 1950s, during which it's estimated that approximately 9 billion tons of plastic have been produced."", ""We may think we’re addressing this through recycling. Although this sounds good in theory, it's estimated that only about 10% of plastic actually gets recycled. Much of our unrecycled plastic instead gets dumped in unregulated land sites or into water or gets burned and aerosolized. With its subsequent degradation or upregulation, plastic becomes a composite of the air, water, and soil. "", 'Plastics are found in a variety of textiles, the dynamics of which are altered by chemical weathering, transferring them further into the environment. Furthermore, plastic microbeads are routinely used in medicines, cosmetics, personal care products, abrasives, and in 3D-printing powder. ', 'As such, plastics are routinely ingested by and progressively infiltrate virtually all lifeforms on the planet. In fact, it’s estimated that the average American currently ingests the equivalent of 5 grams of plastic — roughly the mass of a credit card — once a week. You can breathe it in through aerosolization and you can ingest it, although there’s not much risk from dermatologic exposure. ', ""Plastics are categorized as microplastics when they're < 5 mm in size, which is something we can generally see, and nanoplastics when they're < 1 μm in size, which you obviously can't see. Histologically, detecting nanoplastics requires spectroscopy or some type of fluorescent micrologic analysis, meaning they won’t be found in your routine pathology report. "", 'As covered in a 2024 review article, ingested plastics accumulate in the gastrointestinal (GI) and pulmonary tracts, where they exhibit inflammatory properties. The authors noted that multiple animal studies conducted in a variety of nematodes and fish models have shown that microplastics have a dramatic effect on gut dysbiosis. In humans, they decrease the Bacteroidetes phylum, which is the anti-inflammatory phylum we also see decreased in inflammatory bowel disease. Basically, ingestion of plastics increases dysbiosis and decreases diversity, setting up an imbalance in your GI tract. ', 'Animal studies have also consistently shown that microplastics cause dramatic changes to gut integrity. The intestinal barriers are reduced, leading to downregulated expression of tight junction proteins like claudin, zonulin, or occludin. This allows for translocation of bacteria, the plastics themselves, or the microbiome’s metabolites, not only through the intestinal wall but also throughout virtually every organ in your body. Numerous studies have now shown that these plastic nanoparticles can be found anywhere in the body, including the brain. ', 'Plastic exposure is highly disruptive. Inflammatory cytokines that are upregulated as a result include tumor necrosis factor‒alpha, interleukin-6, and others that change gut integrity, as well as blood-brain barrier integrity. ', 'What does this all mean in terms of disease? These plastics are not invoking cell death, but they are certainly changing cell structure and cell function. Multiple cellular analyses and in vivo studies have repeatedly shown the negative biological toll of microplastic exposure. ', 'One recent study that caught my eye due to its striking results appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers enrolled 304 patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid artery disease, whose excised carotid plague was then analyzed. Of these patients, 150 (58%) had nanoplastics identified in their plaque. These patients had a hazard ratio of having an associated cardiac event, stroke, or death of any cause approximately 4.5 times greater than those without nanoplastics detected in their plaque. ', 'In terms of GI diseases, given that these plastics change gut integrity, upregulate a variety of cytokines, and decrease biome diversity and Bacteroides phylum, it makes sense that there’s an emerging association with inflammatory bowel disease. Beyond animal studies, there are some longitudinal studies conducted in humans showing an increased likelihood of these nanoparticles being identified in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. ', ""A recent animal model study showed that the ingestion of nanoplastics was able to produce a Crohn's disease–like illness in a mouse. This was provoked in mice orally exposed to nanoplastics, but not in the control population without such exposure. "", 'There’s also evidence suggesting a link with liver disease. This includes a recent experimental animal study providing evidence of a strong association between microplastic exposure and the development of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. A very recent review looked at the methodologic reasons why this makes sense, which shows that nanoparticles get transported to the portal vein and induce various cytokine upregulations in the liver.', 'A retrospective, comparative cohort analysis looked at liver biopsies obtained from patients with cirrhosis. It showed that significant nanoparticle deposition was evident in those with cirrhosis, as opposed to none of the patients without underlying liver disease. ', ""This is a potential epidemiologic nightmare. The environmental risk is explosive and continues at incremental rates. It's estimated that by 2050, the annual production of plastics will exceed 1.1 billion tons per year. "", 'There are some directives being put in place to combat this.', 'In late 2023, the European Union passed a chemical legislation measure to block or restrict microplastics being added to products. When considering the scale of this measure, keep in mind that they are present in virtually everything we see— medications, cosmetics, etc. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Assembly approved an agreement in 2024 to investigate ways to potentially make and enforce policies related to exposures to nanoplastics and microplastics in humans. ', 'In terms of what we can do ourselves, making clinicians and patients aware of this issue is a good first step. ', ""Mitigation strategies can include things like reducing your exposure to plastic in consumptive forms (eg, water bottles, cooking materials), improving management practices around how plastics are processed and ultimately dealt with as they're dumped back into the environment, and looking at ways that we can limit plastics in consumer products and developing biodegradable alternatives. "", ""Although we need longitudinal scientific studies to further corroborate the adverse health effects of microplastics and nanoplastics, I think the scientific evidence thus far has some striking implications. I believe it's real. How far we go with this and its implications are yet to be defined. Nonetheless, we should be on high alert. "", 'Nanoplastics are something that we need to consider, particularly in GI as well as virtually all other disease states. The evidence is yet to be determined, but it’s very alarming at this point. ', 'Please consider this as you talk with your patients and when thinking about your own personal health. ', ""I'm Dr David Johnson. Thanks for listening."", 'David A.

While cell culture and animal studies hint at potential harm, understanding what this means for people is far more complex.', 'Researchers like Matthew Campen, a biochemist and environmental scientist at the University of New Mexico, investigate how inhaled pollutants, including MNPs, affect cardiovascular and neurological health. He and his team focused on these particles’ accumulation and distribution in human organs.', 'Their findings, published in Nature Medicine, revealed that MNPs accumulated at higher levels in the brains of deceased individuals compared to livers or kidneys with a greater buildup in individuals with dementia.1 In addition, plastic concentrations were higher in 2024 than in 2016 across these organs, suggesting a steady rise in environmental plastic exposure. These results underscore the urgent need to understand exposure routes, uptake, clearance pathways, and the potential health consequences of MNPs, particularly in the brain.', 'To investigate the buildup of inhaled microplastics in human organs, researchers analyzed liver, kidney, and brain samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024. Traditional microscopic spectroscopy methods often miss the tiniest nanoplastics, which are likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and nestle in hidden parts of organs. This can lead researchers to underestimate the scale of tissue pollution with MNPs. To overcome this limitation, Campen and his team turned to pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, a newer technique for detecting plastic residues in human tissue.', 'Their findings were striking. The brain tissue contained the highest levels of MNPs, while the liver and kidneys had comparable concentrations. Notably, the 2024 liver and brain samples had significantly higher MNP concentrations than the 2016 samples. Multiple factors, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, or cause of death did not influence these plastic concentrations. However, the year of death was a significant factor.', 'Curious whether this pattern existed in older brain tissue and if neurological conditions affected plastic accumulation, the researchers expanded their study. Analyzing brain samples from 1997–2013, they found higher plastic concentrations in more recent tissue. Campen’s team also observed greater particle buildup in the brains of individuals with documented dementia compared to those without.', 'When the team examined the types of plastics present, they found polyethylene was the most common, alongside polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene-butadiene rubber. To visualize how these particles accumulate, the team used various microscopy techniques. Their images revealed aged, shard-like plastic fragments embedded in tissues. In the liver and kidney, these fragments ranged from one to five micrometers in size, while brain samples contained even tinier particles less than one micrometer in the parenchyma. In dementia cases, the fragments clustered inside of inflammatory cells and along blood vessel walls.', 'These findings suggest that environmental MNP levels are rising and may make their way into human organs at increasing rates. While the study uncovered an association between plastic accumulation and certain health conditions, larger and more diverse studies are needed to confirm long-term trends and potential health risks.', 'Retinal neurons derived from human stem cells are a promising source of replacement cells for regenerating damaged or diseased retinas.

These indicators signal others to keep a safe distance from the contagious individual. But Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause a range of lung infections, from mild bronchitis to life-threatening pneumonia, that are acutely asymptomatic yet cause inflammation and destruction of tissue.1', 'In chronic infections, these bacteria form a biofilm of extracellular polymer matrix around themselves that shields them from antimicrobials, enzymes, and neutrophils.2 Now, in a paper published in Cell, a group of scientists investigated the underlying mechanism and reported that the biofilm hides Pseudomonas bacteria from sensory neurons in mice, preventing signals from reaching the brain and reducing sickness symptoms.3 These findings provide a deeper understanding of how biofilm-forming bacteria evade the lung-to-brain communication channel, a potentially crucial tactic in persistent infections.', '', 'Almost a decade ago, Elise Granton, currently a physician-immunologist at the University of Calgary and coauthor of the study, tested the effects of P. aeruginosa in mouse lungs using two variants: one that formed a biofilm and one that did not. “We thought this would be pretty simple,” said Bryan Yipp, a physician-immunologist at the University of Calgary and coauthor of the study. “We just could not pin down the exact reason why some of the mice were sick without the biofilm and the biofilm mice were completely unsick,” he added. The team knew that neutrophils could sense the bacteria with or without biofilm, so they started to look beyond the immune system. “Maybe the biofilm is hiding the bacteria. What could it be hiding?” Yipp wondered.', 'Previous studies showed that one of the main bacterial toxins, a surface molecule called lipopolysaccharide (LPS), that causes inflammation and other symptoms is shielded by biofilm components.4 To understand how the exposure of LPS causes sickness, the team studied the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an LPS receptor. When mice lacking TLR4 in nociceptive sensory neurons were infected with non-biofilm forming bacteria, they showed reductions in hypothermia and overall sickness scores. To tease this apart further, the researchers specifically knocked out TLR4 in the lung nociceptive neurons and exposed the cells to bacteria that did not form a biofilm. Mice with intact TLR4 displayed characteristic illness symptoms, while those lacking the receptor showed drastically reduced sickness symptoms.', 'The turning point came when Luke Brown, a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary and coauthor of the study, joined the project. Once they knew that sensory neurons could ‘see’ the bacteria, Yipp and his team wondered how this interaction might send signals to the brain to bring about behavioral changes. They reached out to Deborah Kurrasch and Jaideep Bains, behavioral neuroscientists at the University of Calgary, to find answers to their questions.', ""“[We] asked them, ‘Are we totally crazy?’” Yipp recounted. “And quite quickly, the people that are invested in stress responses and behavior said it's probably the hypothalamus and it's probably these neurons. To them, it made perfect sense!”"", 'Following up on this thread, the team looked into the hypothalamus and saw that a greater number of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons showed activity after treating the lungs with LPS in control mice as compared to those lacking TLR4 in neurons. CRH neurons respond to stress and modify behavior accordingly.5 Blocking the activity of CRH neurons in mice treated with non-biofilm bacteria alleviated their symptomatic sickness.', ""“We're just beginning to understand how the brain becomes aware that there are infections in the body. What's exciting is that now there seems to be a diversity of different neurons that can detect different types of pathogens and relay the signals to the brain to evoke sickness,” said Stephen Liberles, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study."", ""Next, the team will study different types of lung infections and their interactions with the nervous and immune systems. “We're totally thinking in a different way. How many neurological processes, your mood, and definable pathological diseases might originate because of things that have gotten into the lung and activated the neural system,” Yipp said."", '', 'A reimagined lipid vehicle for nucleic acids could overcome the limitations of current vectors.', 'In this webinar, Ethan Shelkey and Aurita Menezes will highlight key aspects in the design of cell-based assays.', 'Discover how alternative animal models provide new perspectives on physiological and biochemical processes.', 'Experts from the Women’s Brain Foundation and bit.bio will explore the importance of sex-specific in vitro models for neurological research and drug discovery.', 'Discover how scientists are designing the next groundbreaking vaccines against infectious diseases.', 'Inventia Life Science, an innovator in 3D cell culture technologies, announces the launch of RASTRUM™ Allegro, a groundbreaking advancement in 3D cell culture technology designed to accelerate drug discovery and disease research with unprecedented scalability, reproducibility, and efficiency.', 'Learn how a target enrichment approach improves the discovery and characterization of viral pathogens.', 'Zymo Research is proud to introduce the Master the Microbiome Grant, a global initiative dedicated to advancing research in microbiomics, metagenomics, and microbial sciences.', 'New Kits Offer Broad Antibody Compatibility and Long-Term Stability for Flow Cytometry and Western Blot Applications', '© 1986-2025 THE SCIENTIST.

Microplastics may accumulate in the brain at higher levels than in the kidney or liver,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250203/Microplastics-may-accumulate-in-the-brain-at-higher-levels-than-in-the-kidney-or-liver.aspx,"['', 'Plastic micro- and nanoparticles are more concentrated in postmortem brain samples from 2024 than those from 2016', 'A recent Nature Medicine study assessed the relative distribution of microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) in major organ systems from decedent human kidneys, livers, and brains.', 'MNPs range in size from as small as 1 nanometer up to 500 micrometers in diameter. Their environmental concentration has increased exponentially over the past 50 years. However, the extent to which they are harmful or toxic to humans is unclear. Recent research has linked MNP presence to higher inflammation and risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.', 'MNPs have also been seen to worsen disease or drive toxic outcomes in some animal exposure studies, but the relevance of the concentrations for human exposures is unclear. Research has not fully explored the tissue distribution and internal dose of MNPs in humans. Particulates have been detected in organs, such as the intestines, lungs, and placenta, using visual microscopic spectroscopy methods. However, smaller MNPs are often overlooked as these methods are mostly limited to larger (>5\u2009µm) particulates.', 'A recent approach, namely pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), is less biased when coupled with orthogonal methods and is more quantitative and cumulative. Furthermore, the data generated by Py-GC/MS is more comparable across laboratories, which makes the results more robust.', 'The present study combined the Py-GC/MS and visualization methods to explore the relative distribution of MNPs in liver, kidney, and brain tissues of human bodies that underwent autopsy in 2016 and 2024.', 'A total of 53 brain samples from 2016 and 2024 were analyzed to quantify MNPs. These estimates were compared with similar analyses that were conducted between 1997 and 2013 to understand the change in the rate of MNPs accumulation in brain tissues.', 'For this study, small pieces (3–5\u2009cm3) of postmortem human liver (right central parenchyma), kidney (wedge piece containing cortex and medulla), and brain (frontal cortex) samples were obtained from 2016 and 2024 autopsy specimens and stored in 10% formalin. Brain samples were also obtained from repositories on the East Coast of the United States.', 'MNP concentrations were found to be almost similar in decedent liver and kidney specimens from the 2024 sample, with the median value of total plastics at 433 and 404\u2009µg/g, respectively. In comparison to liver and kidney specimens, MNPs concentration in brain tissues was higher. Py-GC/MS estimates of MNPs in brain samples from 2016 and 2024 samples were 3345\u2009µg/g and 4917\u2009µg\u2009/g, respectively. The MNP concentration in liver and brain samples from 2024 was higher compared to the 2016 sample. The results were in line with those from a multiple regression analysis of brain concentrations, taking into account the influence of other demographic variables.', 'The proportion of polyethylene (PE) in the brain was higher compared to other polymers. The proportion was also higher compared to PE in the liver and kidney. In liver and brain samples, between 2016 and 2024, the concentrations of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), PE, polypropylene (PP), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) were increased. Polymers other than PE were not as consistent in prevalence. This could be driven by limited sampling and variation in prevalence across size distributions.', 'Comparing these results with those from earlier time frame frames (1997–2013), it was noted that overall MNP concentrations were lower in samples from the eastern coast of the US. Additional analysis also showed that total plastic concentrations in dementia samples were higher than in a normal frontal cortex, although no causality was established. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed that particles observed in kidney, liver, and brain samples were principally composed of carbon.', 'Particulates (<1\u2009µm) were noted in the brain parenchyma, and examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed largely 100–200\u2009nm long shards or flakes. Between 2024 and 2016, the total mass concentration of plastics in the brains increased by approximately 50%. Increasing environmental concentrations of MNPs could, therefore, lead to rising internal maximal concentrations.', 'The current study noted an increasing trend of MNP concentrations in the brain and liver. Most of the MNPs found in tissues appeared to be nanoplastic shards or flakes and consisted of PE. In the future, more complex study designs using larger sample sizes are needed to refine current analytical techniques and understand whether MNPs influence neurological disorders and other human diseases.', 'Currently rated 5.0 by 1 person', 'Posted in: Medical Science News | Medical Research News', 'Tags: Brain, Chromatography, Cortex, Dementia, Electron, Electron Microscopy, Gas Chromatography, Inflammation, Kidney, Liver, Lungs, Mass Spectrometry, Medicine, micro, Microscopy, Nanoparticles, Placenta, Polymers, Research, Spectrometry, Spectroscopy', 'Written by', 'Priyom holds a Ph.D. in Plant Biology and Biotechnology from the University of Madras, India.

Those shards, smaller than the eye can see, were concentrated in the walls of arteries and veins of brain as well as in the brain’s immune cells.', '“It’s a little bit alarming, but remember that dementia is a disease where the blood brain barrier and clearance mechanisms are impaired,” Campen said.', 'In addition, there are inflammatory cells and atrophy of brain tissue with dementia, which may create “a sort of sink for plastics to go,” he said.', '“We want to we want to be very cautious in interpreting these results as as the microplastics are very likely elevated because of the disease (dementia), and we do not currently suggest that microplastics could cause the disease,” Campen said.', 'Finding plastic deposits in the brain does not prove they cause damage, said Phoebe Stapleton, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. She was not involved in the new study.', '“It is unclear if, in life, these particles are fluid, entering and leaving the brain, or if they collect in neurological tissues and promote disease,” she said in an email. “Further research is needed to understand how the particles may be interacting with the cells and if this has a toxicological consequence.”', 'In fact, researchers did see signs that the body’s liver and kidneys may be capable of flushing some plastics from the body, Campen said. Whether that can happen in the brain, he said, is unknown.', 'Finding higher levels of microplastics in human tissues today “makes sense” because plastic manufacture, plastic pollution and human exposure to plastics have all been increasing rapidly, said pediatrician and biology professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and the Global Observatory on Planetary Health at Boston College.', '“More than half of all plastic ever made has been made since 2002 and production is on track to double by 2040,” said Landrigan, who was not involved in the new study.', 'Landrigan is the lead author of a March 2023 report from the Minderoo – Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health, a global consortium of scientists, health-care workers and policy analysts charged with following plastics from creation to final product.', 'In the 2023 report, the consortium determined plastics are associated with harms to human health at every single stage of the plastic lifecycle.', '“Studies have found these plastics in the human heart, the great blood vessels, the lungs, the liver, the testes, the gastrointestinal tract and the placenta,” Landrigan said.', '“The biggest question is, ‘OK, what are these particles doing to us?’ Honestly there’s a lot we still don’t know,” he said. “What we do know with real certainty is that these microplastic particles are like Trojan horses — they carry with them all the thousands of chemicals that are in plastics and some of these chemicals are very bad actors.”', 'By invading individual cells and tissues in major organs, nanoplastics can potentially interrupt cellular processes and deposit endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, heavy metals and per- and polyfluorinated substances, or PFAS.', 'Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society.', '“We have some pretty good indications that microplastics and nanoplastics cause harm, even though we are a long way from knowing the full extent of that harm,” Landrigan said. “I would say we have enough information here that we need to start taking protective action.”', 'The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN the FDA says current scientific evidence doesn’t show that microplastics or nanoplastics detected in foods pose a risk to human health.', '“Research underway not only helps address current data gaps in our understanding of exposure to microplastics but it also aims to develop improved tools to measure the toxicity of microplastics to humans, said Kimberly Wise White, the council’s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs.', '“This work is important given the unvalidated methods often applied by researchers which can lead to unreliable or misleading outcomes, the complex nature of microplastics, and the many variables that can affect human health,” she said.', 'For the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers examined brain, kidney and liver tissues harvested from people who underwent a forensic autopsy in 2016 and 2024.

They're in our air, water and food, and you can even find them in cosmetics, clothing and dust. With that in mind, it's not surprising that microplastics have been found in human blood, saliva, liver, kidneys and placenta."", ""Unfortunately, microplastics are everywhere, including your home. Studies suggest these tiny particles could be harmful and have negative health effects. Thankfully, there are things you can do to be more proactive about your health. Before you cook your next meal, let's head to the kitchen and see which items may be secretly hiding microplastics among your food and cookware.    "", 'Microplastics have become a serious problem for pollution, but now scientists worry about the potential health effects too. An estimated 22,000,000 micro and nanoplastics are inhaled by humans each year, and that is largely because they are so hard to avoid. You can be exposed to microplastics in three ways: inhalation, ingestion or touch.', 'Microplastics have been shown to cause a number of issues in the human body. Microplastics and nanoplastics found in blood vessels have been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and, in more severe cases, even death. Tissue inflammation, cell death and lung and liver impacts have all been noted. In animals and marine life, it can also cause oxidative and DNA damage, as well as cancer. Mice were shown to have reduced sperm count, ovarian scarring and hereditary metabolic disorders. ', 'Studies continue as much is still unknown about the exact effects of microplastics, but studies so far have been sobering. They are inspiring many home chefs to reconsider what they are putting in their kitchen -- and in their bodies. ', 'Unfortunately, microplastics are more common than you think. These are some places they may be hiding in your kitchen. ', ""A new study found that plastic and non-stick cookware released microplastics into food during cooking, greatly heightening one's exposure to these potentially harmful pollutants. Australian researchers estimate that Teflon-coated cookware contains thousands, maybe millions, of microplastic particles, while a simple crack or fracture in your pan could mean exposure to over two million microplastic particles. "", 'Your Uber delivery could inadvertently be damaging your health, and it has nothing to do with what you order. With the rise of home delivery services, plastic containers are more common than ever, but these containers can easily add microplastics into your food when heated or washed. One study found that all reusable plastic takeout containers typically used by restaurants contain microplastics.

When you ingest the food, you also ingest microplastics that settle into your body and bloodstream. ', ""It may come as a surprise, but microplastics could be hiding in your tea bags. When you brew tea, the bag is exposed to extremely high temperatures that can release its microplastics. This comes from polypropylene, a key component in the manufacturing of tea bags. Researchers at Spain's Autonomous University of Barcelona found that billions of microplastic and nanoplastic particles are released from a single tea bag for every millimeter of water it is submerged in. "", 'That bottle of paprika could be full of microplastics, depending on how it is packaged. Many spices today use plastic packaging, which is concerning because one recent study found microplastics in all plastic containers tested. This can result in food contamination, something that has increased in recent decades.

The data showed an increasing trend in microplastic contamination of brains from 1997 to 2024.', 'The most common plastic found was polyethylene, which is used in plastic bags and food and drink packaging. It made up 75% of the total plastic on average. The particles in the brain were mostly nanoscale shards and flakes of plastic. The plastic concentrations in the organs were not influenced by the age of the person at death, or the cause of death, their sex or their ethnicity.', 'Sign up to Detox Your Kitchen', 'A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.', '', 'The scientists noted that only one sample from each organ was analysed, meaning the variability within the organs remains unknown, and that some variation in the brain samples could be due to geographic differences between New Mexico and the US east coast.', '“These results highlight a critical need to better understand the routes of exposure, uptake and clearance pathways and potential health consequences of plastics in human tissues, particularly in the brain,” said the researchers.', 'Prof Tamara Galloway at the University of Exeter in the UK, who was not part of the study team, said the 50% increase in levels of brain microplastics over the past eight years mirrored the increasing production and use of plastics and was significant. “It suggests that if we were to reduce environmental contamination with microplastics, the levels of human exposure would also decrease, offering a strong incentive to focus on innovations that reduce exposure,” Galloway said.', 'Prof Oliver Jones, at RMIT University in Australia, said the new research was interesting, but the low number of samples and the difficulty of analysing tiny plastic particles without contamination meant care should be taken when interpreting the results.']"

You can’t see them or smell them but tiny pieces of plastic are everywhere. They’re on your clothes, the couch, the car seat. You’re breathing them in and eating them in your food. Yeah they’re small, but many in the scientific community believe they’re a huge problem.', 'Microplastics: By definition, they’re no bigger than an eraser on a pencil.', 'MCNEIL: The smallest size is smaller than we can even see with the human eye of like one-seventieth the width of your hair.', 'WANSCHURA: That’s Anne McNeil, a chemist at the University of Michigan.', 'MCNEIL: The term microplastic came to be used more widely around the early 2000s when a captain of a boat had noticed all these small plastic fragments floating in the ocean, and he dredged up some just using a fishing net and brought them to shore. And his hypothesis at the time was that, you know, these smaller pieces of plastic are breaking off the larger pieces of plastic, and they really need to be studied separately from the larger plastic waste that we had been studying already.', 'WANSCHURA: Even though microplastics are everywhere, scientists are still trying to grasp the scope of the problem.', 'MCNEIL: This is a, like, super active area of research right now asking the question of, “How bad is it for the environment?” I would say any pollutant that we put out there is doing some damage to the environment.', 'WANSCHURA: And it’s not entirely clear what they’re doing to our bodies. Some newer studies have raised concerns they can kill cells, reduce fertility and be a vehicle for other contaminants.But despite the unknowns, scientists agree that we should work to keep them out of our environment.', 'Today’s story is about a group of researchers in Michigan who are trying to figure out how to get microplastics out of our tap water.', 'This is Points North, a podcast about the land, water and inhabitants of the Great Lakes. I’m Dan Wanshura.', 'The beginning of the story doesn’t actually start with microplastics though – it starts with baby diapers. Michael Livingston takes it from here.', 'LIVINGSTON: Takunda Chazovachii was a graduate student at the University of Michigan when he made an unconventional discovery. It was 2019, and he was working on a project funded by Proctor and Gamble – the company that makes Pampers. The goal was to find a way to recycle the super absorbent part of the diaper. The part that keeps everything well– contained.', 'Takunda Chazovachii was a graduate student at the University of Michigan in 2019. (courtesy: Anne McNeil)', 'CHAZOVACHII: A baby uses six to ten diapers a day in their first year… So, that’s a lot of diapers.', 'LIVINGSTON: Diapers are made of something called polymers – chemical compounds where molecules link together in long, repeating chains like a zipper. According to one study, approximately 20 billion used diapers end up in landfills each year.', 'So, Takunda’s hard at work in Ann Arbor, Michigan, trying to figure out how to give diapers a second life. And by using some chemistry, Takunda is able to change the diaper polymers into something entirely new… something sticky. An adhesive. Like something you’d find on sticky notes.', 'CHAZOVACHII: The bandages that you get in the hospital are based on pressure sensitive adhesives. Tape that’s pressure sensitive adhesive as well.', 'LIVINGSTON: These adhesives made out of diapers is where the lab’s research with microplastics all stems back to. But it couldn’t have happened without a happy accident. That summer, Takunda takes on an intern – a bright high school student named Edwin Zishiri.', 'CHAZOVACHII: I’m Zimbabwean. His parents are from Zimbabwe. … That’s how I kind of met, met the family. ', 'LIVINGSTON: It didn’t take long for Takunda to take Edwin under his wing.', 'CHAZOVACHII: And he’s a very intelligent kid. Actually, when I was working with him … I was on my toes because he was very curious.', 'Edwin Zishiri was a high school intern at the University of Michigan in 2019. (courtesy: Anne McNeil)', 'LIVINGSTON: It’s the end of August, Takunda needs to run some tests on his diaper adhesives.', 'CHAZOVACHII: Edwin was already in the lab when I came in.', 'LIVINGSTON: Edwin was at their shared station tinkering with tiny shreds of vulcanized rubber from car tires – a new material the lab was trying to recycle. Takunda starts working next to him. As he’s working, Edwin keeps dumping the tire pieces into a clear glass jug between him and Takunda.', 'Each little black shred is around the width of a human hair. Eventually, he finishes his experiments and takes off for the day. Takunda is the last one in the lab. He looks down at his diaper adhesives.', 'CHAZOVACHII: They’re just ridiculously sticky.', 'LIVINGSTON: Almost instinctively, he dumps all those adhesives into the same jug as Edwin’s tire shreds. The solution starts to mix, turning the contents into a deep black– like Dr. Pepper.', 'CHAZOVACHII: I remember maybe just shaking the container, just interested in that, and shaking the container, and everything was all mixed up.', 'LIVINGSTON: Takunda cleans his station, packs up for the day, and leaves the jug behind.', 'CHAZOVACHII: And then I pulled out my funnel and closed it, and then just went, turned off the lights.', 'LIVINGSTON: The next day. Takunda returns to the lab and finds the mixture in the jug is no longer dark and murky. That surprises him.', 'CHAZOVACHII: The whole mix is just clear. The whole container is clear. I’m like, what happened? ', 'LIVINGSTON: He immediately gets Edwin.', 'CHAZOVACHII: I went through the door that goes to the kitchen, and Edwin was sitting in the kitchen. And I said, “Oh, Edwin, let me show you something.', 'LIVINGSTON: They peer inside the jug.', 'CHAZOVACHII: And then we see this little blob floating around with all that micronized rubber just, you know, like, adhered onto that little piece of … little blob.', 'The day after Takunda Chazovachii mixed his adhesives with Edwin Zishiri’s micronized rubber, the adhesives seemed to collect the particles in a “little blob.” (credit: Takunda Chazovachii)', 'LIVINGSTON: Somehow the adhesives Takunda made from diapers had collected all the black rubber shreds – like a magnet.', 'CHAZOVACHII: Then we just looked at it and I was like, “Wow, this is interesting.” The conversation was now, “What just happened and let’s try to explain it.” ', 'LIVINGSTON: Takunda whips out his phone and snaps a picture. He has never seen anything like this before. Takunda shows the picture he took of the blob to Dr. Anne McNeil, the chemistry professor we met earlier.', 'MCNEIL: So, this white part here is the adhesive, and then all the black coating on the top, and the bottom of this white part is the microplastics.', 'LIVINGSTON: Anne points at her computer screen, she’s kept Takunda’s picture for over five years now. For most of her life, Anne has studied organic chemistry but she says she’s always wanted to find ways to help the planet.', 'Dr. Anne McNeil is a chemistry professor at the University of Michigan. (courtesy: Anne McNeil)', 'MCNEIL: From the time I was like a little kid, I had all these save the Earth books in 50 easy steps and stuff like that when I was growing up. And I never quite found the right alignment of my interest in chemistry and my interest in the environment.', 'LIVINGSTON: Anne’s 47 now. She wears square glasses and has salt and pepper hair. When she sees Takunda’s discovery she immediately lands on an idea: What if his adhesives could capture microplastics in water in our homes?', 'A single load of laundry releases several million microplastics into wastewater from the washing machine. Anne says it ends up going back to our crops, our sewer systems, eventually our drinking water. It’s just one example of how we’re in a vicious cycle of ingesting plastic waste.', 'But this idea for a filter would take time, money and repeated failure. That’s after this:', '(sponsorship message)', 'LIVINGSTON: Research can’t happen without funding and meanwhile, the money for Takunda’s work on diaper recycling is running out. But their team of researchers take a hundred-to-one shot at applying for a 2 million-dollar grant from the National Science Foundation. If they get it, they could use the money for more research into how the adhesives could be used to collect microplastics. But Takunda isn’t optimistic.', 'CHAZOVACHII: There’s a lot of applications in. I would be surprised if we make it to the second round. ', 'LIVINGSTON: While their application goes through, he and Anne begin experimenting – trying to confirm if his diaper adhesives could really capture microplastics in water. The work involves coating different materials with the adhesives and passing a solution tainted with microplastics through them. The prototype experiment involved coating tiny beads with the adhesives.', 'MCNEIL: Water can flow very quickly, still through there, and it’s a pretty tortuous flow, because they’re hitting beads, and like, they have to get around it. There’s not a single straight path through.', 'LIVINGSTON: The early results look promising. The adhesives seem to be doing their job – attracting the microplastics to the beads. But the new year comes, and things get difficult. Takunda completes his graduate program and takes a new job as a chemist. The COVID-19 pandemic starts making lab work difficult. But Anne and her team keep working with Takunda’s adhesives. And around this time they discover a huge problem. When they pull the beads out and look at them through a microscope, they discover the adhesives don’t hold up.', 'MCNEIL: The coatings didn’t look as good– they weren’t as pristine as they did when they went in. … We started to realize that adhesives, especially these types of adhesives, they can move over time.', 'LIVINGSTON: The adhesives are literally falling off the beads and even shedding into the water, reintroducing some of the microplastics.', 'MCNEIL: It’s not functioning the way we want, and some of that shedding can also cause it to shed in the water', 'LIVINGSTON: Do you get disappointed when that happens. Is there ever a sense of like, “Oh, dang, we had it wrong and now we got to do something else?”', 'MCNEIL: It’s all part of research. Research is defined by its downs, and you can’t let any single down get you down. You have to just figure out what it’s telling you and then improve the design moving forward.', 'LIVINGSTON: Even though the filter isn’t working after nearly a year of experiments – Anne and her team keep moving. She says science is like a slow moving ball. Sometimes discoveries like Takunda’s make the ball roll faster but it only takes one small set back to take momentum away. The diaper adhesives are going to need more study.', 'Now it’s the summer of 2020, pandemic lockdowns are still in place but Anne’s interest in microplastics research has only grown. That August, Anne and her team win the 2 million-dollar grant from the National Science Foundation. This is huge and it comes at just the right time. It not only funds the work with adhesives but also helps expand microplastics research across the university.', 'MCNEIL: We had a good story and a good approach. Fortune lined up for us pretty well on that one.', 'LIVINGSTON: More of Anne’s students start working on projects to track, map, capture, and remove microplastics from the environment. And they have an idea to get the ball rolling on the adhesives again. Instead of using the adhesives on tiny beads, they start coating sheets of stainless steel mesh with the stuff.', 'MCNEIL: Almost like a fishing net. If you stuffed the fishing net in there and had it really irregularly, sort of cramped in there, it would allow lots of points of interaction along the way. So, the goal was just increasing surface area.', '(sounds of lab)', 'LIVINGSTON: To get an idea of what these experiments look like, a couple of Anne’s students run a quick test for me.', 'THURBER: Microplastics are dangerous so we wear glasses, safety glasses and also gloves for these. ', 'LIVINGSTON: That’s Henry Thurber.', 'RAMKUMAR: What he’s going to show you here now is how the project has improved over time. ', 'LIVINGSTON: And that’s Malavika Ramkumar. The students set what looks like a cloudy bottle of water on a workstation.', 'Henry Thurber, a student at the University of Michigan, holds a solution tainted with microplastics before passing it through a filter. (credit: Michael Livingston / Points North)', 'THURBER: So this contains 10 micron diameter polystyrene beads. So those are micro plastics that you commonly find in the environment.', 'LIVINGSTON: Henry pours the microplastic solution into a machine that pumps it through a filter.', '(sounds of pumping device)', 'THURBER: Microplastic solution goes through this pump, goes all the way down, and then this water spins up… goes through the stainless steel mesh … and then goes down and circulates through.', 'LIVINGSTON: Are we going to be able to see anything visually, like a difference in the water? Is it going to be a little clearer?', 'THURBER: Yes, so I would say in about 10 minutes, we can take the water out, and then you’ll be able to see that it is a lot clearer.', 'LIVINGSTON: Actually, only about five minutes go by and the water starts changing from cloudy to clear.', 'LIVINGSTON: I’m already starting to see, yeah, less bubbles.', 'RAMKUMAR: I mean, the capture rates of this method are pretty high, right? Like, what do you see at 10 minutes? ', 'THURBER: I would say probably 99% of the microplastics are captured in nine or in 10 minutes, probably 90% in two and a half minutes.', 'LIVINGSTON: 99% of microplastics – captured in a matter of minutes. And Henry says all this equipment is perfectly suited for the home.', 'THURBER: Using that recycled adhesive for microplastics– so, that’s fairly cheap. The stainless steel we’re coating it on very commercially available, which is also great. And then this spin down setup itself would only cost, like $20 or $30 on Amazon.', 'A solution tainted with microplastics before (left) and after (right) passing it through a prototype filter. (credit: Michael Livingston / Points North)', 'LIVINGSTON: This is a huge step toward a final product for Anne’s lab. Now, they can start testing less concentrated microplastics solutions – something closer to drinking water.', 'MCNEIL: Yes, we can reliably count like 15 particles per liter, and then we can show with the mesh that we could remove those particles quantitatively like, that was a pretty cool day. … I get to experience those joys with them.', 'LIVINGSTON: It’s 2024 now, and the microplastics filter seems closer to reality than ever – if not for one familiar problem that keeps haunting them. Even when using a stainless steel mesh, Anne believes the adhesives could still be shedding.', 'MCNEIL: It’s just like when you paint your car or you paint your house or whatever, or window frames, like you can physically break off some of the coating because it’s not chemically bonded. It’s just another layer on top of that layer. That’s one of the limitations that we’re working on now. That is honestly the biggest limitation of that.', 'LIVINGSTON: It’s the big setback with this project. If the adhesives flake off the mesh, it poses the risk of putting microplastics back into the water. Bottom line: the diaper adhesives aren’t perfect.', 'LIVINGSTON: Do you often feel like you’re chasing perfection? Is that sort of a quality of science?', 'MCNEIL: That’s definitely, I would say, one of my biggest struggles in this area, and maybe in science in general, is knowing when to stop, or knowing when to say, “It’s good enough. Now move to this other thing.”', 'LIVINGSTON: But Anne says she’s not moving on when it comes to the idea of a microplastics filter. Her team is going to keep trying to find a way to make them a reality. She says there’s a need for these devices. Filters specifically targeting microplastics can only be a net positive for keeping them out of our bodies and the environment.', 'Most home filters out there don’t specifically target microplastics. And no filter has ever used adhesives to do it. Anne is so hopeful she’s going to find a solution using these adhesives, that she’s patenting the idea. And she’s in talks with a business partner about eventually getting them out on the market, when that day comes.', 'LIVINGSTON: You’re putting in work to innovate and come up with solutions that all of us can benefit from, right? What motivates you in that work?… With science being such a slow process and such a slow moving ball to come into the lab every day and get it done?', 'MCNEIL: If our work can help in any way, that gives us all the hope we need to get out of bed each day and come in and work on the problem. We know what the challenges are in front of us, and if we can make that small little nudge forward that’s worth getting up for in coming into lab.', 'LIVINGSTON: More than five years later, Anne is still grateful for Takunda’s happy accident. Without it, she wouldn’t be so close to breakthroughs in microplastics research. For her team, getting microplastics out of water is a problem that can be solved, and it doesn’t matter how many setbacks it will take to figure it out.', 'Points North: The Squeaky Sand Phenomenon', 'Points North: Complete With His Language', '', 'Featured image: Microplastic particles stick to a molecular sieve bead covered with adhesives derived from diapers.

Those shards, smaller than the eye can see, were concentrated in the walls of arteries and veins of brain as well as in the brain’s immune cells.', '“It’s a little bit alarming, but remember that dementia is a disease where the blood brain barrier and clearance mechanisms are impaired,” Campen said.', 'In addition, there are inflammatory cells and atrophy of brain tissue with dementia, which may create “a sort of sink for plastics to go,” he said.', '“We want to we want to be very cautious in interpreting these results as as the microplastics are very likely elevated because of the disease (dementia), and we do not currently suggest that microplastics could cause the disease,” Campen said.', 'Finding plastic deposits in the brain does not prove they cause damage, said Phoebe Stapleton, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. She was not involved in the new study.', '“It is unclear if, in life, these particles are fluid, entering and leaving the brain, or if they collect in neurological tissues and promote disease,” she said in an email. “Further research is needed to understand how the particles may be interacting with the cells and if this has a toxicological consequence.”', 'In fact, researchers did see signs that the body’s liver and kidneys may be capable of flushing some plastics from the body, Campen said. Whether that can happen in the brain, he said, is unknown.', 'Finding higher levels of microplastics in human tissues today “makes sense” because plastic manufacture, plastic pollution and human exposure to plastics have all been increasing rapidly, said pediatrician and biology professor Dr. Philip Landrigan, director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and the Global Observatory on Planetary Health at Boston College.', '“More than half of all plastic ever made has been made since 2002 and production is on track to double by 2040,” said Landrigan, who was not involved in the new study.', 'Landrigan is the lead author of a March 2023 report from the Minderoo – Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health, a global consortium of scientists, health-care workers and policy analysts charged with following plastics from creation to final product.', 'In the 2023 report, the consortium determined plastics are associated with harms to human health at every single stage of the plastic lifecycle.', '“Studies have found these plastics in the human heart, the great blood vessels, the lungs, the liver, the testes, the gastrointestinal tract and the placenta,” Landrigan said.', '“The biggest question is, ‘OK, what are these particles doing to us?’ Honestly there’s a lot we still don’t know,” he said. “What we do know with real certainty is that these microplastic particles are like Trojan horses — they carry with them all the thousands of chemicals that are in plastics and some of these chemicals are very bad actors.”', 'By invading individual cells and tissues in major organs, nanoplastics can potentially interrupt cellular processes and deposit endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, heavy metals and per- and polyfluorinated substances, or PFAS.', 'Endocrine disruptors interfere with the human reproductive system, leading to genital and reproductive malformations as well as female infertility and a decline in sperm count, according to the Endocrine Society.', '“We have some pretty good indications that microplastics and nanoplastics cause harm, even though we are a long way from knowing the full extent of that harm,” Landrigan said. “I would say we have enough information here that we need to start taking protective action.”', 'The American Chemistry Council, an industry association, told CNN the FDA says current scientific evidence doesn’t show that microplastics or nanoplastics detected in foods pose a risk to human health.', '“Research underway not only helps address current data gaps in our understanding of exposure to microplastics but it also aims to develop improved tools to measure the toxicity of microplastics to humans, said Kimberly Wise White, the council’s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs.', '“This work is important given the unvalidated methods often applied by researchers which can lead to unreliable or misleading outcomes, the complex nature of microplastics, and the many variables that can affect human health,” she said.', 'For the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers examined brain, kidney and liver tissues harvested from people who underwent a forensic autopsy in 2016 and 2024. For comparison, researchers also looked at brains from people who died between 1997 and 2013.', 'Brain tissue samples were gathered from the frontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with thinking and reasoning. It’s the part of the brain which is most affected by frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and later stages of Alzheimer’s disease.', 'whereas some of the larger particles that are a micrometer to five micrometers go into the liver and kidneys,”', 'Microplastics are fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) or about the size of a pencil eraser, to 1 nanometer. A strand of human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter.', '“Based on our observations, we think the brain is pulling in the very smallest nanostructures, like 100 to 200 nanometers in length. These are roughly the size of two COVID viruses side by side,” said Campen, who is also the director of the New Mexico Center for Metals in Biology and Medicine.', 'Nanoplastics are the most worrisome plastics for human health, experts say, because the minuscule pieces can take up residence inside individual cells.', '“Somehow these nanoplastics hijack their way through the body and get to the brain, crossing the blood-brain barrier,” Campen said. “Plastics love fats, or lipids, so one theory is that plastics are hijacking their way with the fats we eat which are then delivered to the organs that really like lipids — the brain is top among those.”', 'The human brain is about 60% fat by weight, far more than any other organ. Essential fatty acids, such as omega 3s, are key to the strength and performance of the brain’s cells. Since the human body can’t produce essential fatty acids on its own, they must come from food or supplements.', 'Diet is the main route of exposure for micro- and nanoplastics, Landrigan said, however some are also airborne: “When people are driving down the highway and their tires are abrading on the surface of the highway, a certain amount of microplastic particles are thrown into the air.', '“If you live near the coast, some of the microplastic particles that are in the ocean get kicked into the air through wave action,” he said. “So ingestion is probably the dominant route, but inhalation is also an important route.”', 'There are many steps individuals can take to reduce their exposure to plastics and their plastic footprint, experts say.', '“It’s important not to scare the hell out of people, because the science in this space is still evolving, and nobody in the year 2025 is going to live without plastic,” Landrigan said.', '“I say to people, ‘Listen, there are some plastics that you can’t escape. You’re not going to get a cell phone or a computer that doesn’t contain plastic.’ But do try to minimize your exposure to the plastic that you can avoid, especially single-use plastics.”', 'It’s hard to avoid foods wrapped in plastic film because they are ubiquitous, Landrigan said, but you can take the food out of the plastic wrapping before you cook it or put it in the microwave.', '“When you heat plastic, that accelerates the movement of the microplastics out of the wrapping into the food,” he said.', 'Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic, suggested the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.

Try to avoid plastic water bottles, if you can possibly do so,” Landrigan said.', 'A March 2024 study found 1 liter of bottled water — the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters typically purchased by consumers — contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics. Some 90% of those were nanoplastics.', '“Use a metal or glass drinking cup instead of a plastic cup. Store your food in glass containers instead of in plastic ones,” Landrigan said. “Work in your local community to ban plastic bags, as many communities around the United States have now done. There is a lot you can do.', '“And at a societal level, you can join forces with other people who care about children’s health to push for restrictions on plastic manufacture and for the use of safer chemicals in plastics,” he said. “Just because we don’t know everything there is to know about every chemical in plastics does not mean we should not take action against the plastic chemicals we know are bad actors.”', 'Editor’s Note: This story was originally written in August 2024 based on a preprint, which is an early copy of a paper that had not yet been peer-reviewed.

"Microplastics Can Block Blood Flow in The Brain, Study in Mice Shows",https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-can-block-blood-flow-in-the-brain-study-in-mice-shows,"['With microplastics now permeating our food and our bodies, researchers are keen to assess the potential damage these tiny fragments could be doing. A new study shows how plastics may lead to dangerous blood flow blockages in the brain.', 'The study, led by a team from the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences in Beijing, involved tracking microplastics in blood vessels moving through mouse brains in real time – the first time microplastic movement has been tracked in this way.', 'Using high-resolution laser-based imaging techniques, the researchers found microplastic-laden immune cells becoming lodged inside blood vessels in the cortex area of the brain.', '""Our data reveal a mechanism by which microplastics disrupt tissue function indirectly through regulation of cell obstruction and interference with local blood circulation, rather than direct tissue penetration,"" write the researchers in their published paper.', '""This revelation offers a lens through which to comprehend the toxicological implications of microplastics that invade the bloodstream.""', 'The researchers found some similarities between the blockages here and blood clots, while also looking at the subsequent impact on mouse behavior. Mice with microplastics in their blood performed less well than their plastic-free peers on movement, memory, and coordination tests, pointing to impaired brain function.', 'Microplastics are defined as plastic fragments less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) in diameter. As you might expect, the smaller specks of plastic were found to be less likely to cause blockages than larger ones.', 'While the microplastic blockages were cleared up over the course of a month, and most cognitive behaviors in the mice returned to normal, the researchers suggest there could be links here to neurological problems like depression and anxiety, as well as an increased risk of strokes and cardiovascular disease.', '""These findings indicate that mice display multifaceted abnormalities in neurobehavioral regulation, resembling depressive states associated with disrupted cerebral blood flow,"" write the researchers.', ""While it's not certain that the same processes are happening in human brains – there are significant differences in terms of immune systems and blood vessel sizes – mice are biologically similar enough to us as a species to make this a real concern."", ""There's a lot more to explore in terms of the mechanisms behind these blockages, the long-term effects, and which animals could be affected. The researchers also point to other studies that have begun to analyze potential links between microplastics and disease risk, though no direct relationship in humans has yet been found."", '""The use of larger mammals or animal models that more closely resemble the human circulatory system, such as non-human primates, is thus crucial for studying this process,"" write the researchers.', '""The potential long-term effects of microplastics on neurological disorders such as depression and cardiovascular health are concerning.""', 'The research has been published in Science Advances.']"
