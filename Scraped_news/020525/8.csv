Bondi has served as a top surrogate for Trump and his efforts to refute the results of the 2020 election. She has criticized other prosecutors for charging the president with a variety of offenses. Bondi also defended Trump during his first impeachment trial, which came following allegations that he had withheld military aid to Ukraine as he urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former President Joe Biden.', 'Bondi won the race to become Florida attorney general in 2010, serving between 2011 and 2019.

Agents filed a lawsuit Tuesday looking to prevent the Department of Justice from publishing agents’ names.', 'California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff said on the Senate floor that Trump’s “campaign of retribution is happening.”', '“Top FBI agents have been fired,” he added, according to The New York Times. “Would she have defended these FBI agents at the risk of her own job, as one senior FBI leader has done? Of course not, and let us not pretend otherwise.”', 'Schiff argued that the country “cannot afford” to have an attorney general more concerned with defending Trump rather than the American people.', 'Meanwhile, Republican Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt called Bondi “supremely qualified” and said that the Justice Department has “gone astray.”', 'Trump has a history of having his attorneys general leave the department, which happened twice in his first term after his relationship with Jeff Sessions and William Barr soured.', 'Republicans pushed Bondi during her confirmation hearing to make significant changes to the department and to reprimand any member of staff who showed what they viewed as bias against conservatives.

All Republicans voted to confirm and all but one Democratic senator, John Fetterman, voted against.', 'Bondi takes charge at a tumultuous time for the department, which has already been making sweeping personnel changes across senior leadership positions and last week fired the prosecutors who worked on the criminal cases against Trump at the direction of the president himself.', 'The upheaval means that Bondi faces an array of challenges. As attorney general, she serves at the pleasure of the president and needs to retain Trump’s confidence to survive. But her predecessors in Trump’s first term found it tricky to please Trump without crossing ethical or legal lines.', 'Trump replaced his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after he recused himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia and, later, soured on his last attorney general, William Barr, after he refused to endorse Trump’s false 2020 election claims.', 'During her confirmation hearing, Bondi insisted the justice department would remain independent by continuing the policy that restricts interactions with the White House, and would not allow the FBI to pursue a list of Trump’s perceived enemies, as identified by FBI director nominee Kash Patel.', 'But both those pledges – perhaps the two most central for the justice department to resist political pressure from the White House – have already come under scrutiny in the days since Bondi vowed to follow the no-contacts policy and that there would be no “enemies list” under her tenure.', 'Morale has suffered among the department’s 115,000 employees as a result of the mass purges and the expectation that the department could in effect become an extension of the White House once Bondi is sworn in and if Trump more overtly leans on her to do his bidding.', 'The FBI, which is overseen by the justice department, has been battered by deep anxiety over its future and whether Bondi will actually rein in the more extreme impulses of Patel, a close and fiercely loyal ally of Trump’s, should he be confirmed as FBI director.', 'Last week, the acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, instructed the interim FBI director Brian Driscoll to produce a list of FBI agents who worked on cases against January 6 rioters and their respective roles in order to inform personnel decisions.', 'The list is widely expected inside the FBI to be used as the basis to fire agents and other employees who worked on cases that have angered Trump, after Bove fired scores of senior career officials who led components involved in the Trump criminal cases.', 'In the memo outlining the list, which was sent to the justice department as ordered earlier on Tuesday, Driscoll also confirmed that he had been told to fire eight senior executive officials at FBI headquarters unless they chose to take early retirement instead.', 'Bondi graduated in 1987 from the University of Florida and earned her law degree in 1990 from Stetson University. She was a county prosecutor in Florida before successfully running for Florida attorney general in 2010 in part due to regular appearances on Fox News.', 'In 2013, during Bondi’s tenure as Florida attorney general, her office received nearly two dozen complaints about Trump University and her aides have said she once considered joining a multi-state lawsuit brought on behalf of students who claimed they had been cheated.', 'As she was weighing the lawsuit, Bondi’s political action committee received a $25,000 contribution from a non-profit funded by Trump. While Trump and Bondi both deny a quid pro quo, Bondi never joined the lawsuit and Trump had to pay a $2,500 fine for violating tax laws to make the donation.']"

She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his perceived adversaries.', 'Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two indictments.', '“Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.', 'But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign.', 'While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule potential investigations into Trump’s adversaries. And she has repeated Trump’s claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice Department “had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s got to stop.”', 'Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., praised Bondi as “accomplished and competent” but said his “grave concern is really about President Trump and what he is clearly demanding.”', '“That clearly is a loyalty oath to him as opposed to a demand for straightforward, candid advice, including if the president is asking for something to be done like the prosecution of a political adversary,” Welch said.', 'Bondi’s confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved in the Jan. 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to mass firings.', 'Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on the Jan. 6 cases — which Trump has described as a “grave national injustice.” Bove, who defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would carry out a “review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.”', 'Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office who were hired to help with the massive Jan. 6 investigation.', 'Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed Trump’s campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system.', '“They targeted Donald Trump,” Bondi told lawmakers. “They went after him — actually starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him.” She added, “If I am attorney general, I will not politicize that office.”', 'Trump nominated Bondi for attorney general after it became clear that his initial pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, could not win enough support from Republican senators to be confirmed.', 'Bondi has been a fixture in Trump’s orbit for years, and a regular defender of the president-elect on news programs amid his legal woes. In a 2023 Fox News appearance, she suggested that “bad” Justice Department prosecutors would be investigated under the Trump administration.', '“The investigators will be investigated,” she said.', 'Smith has said politics played no part in his decisions and the evidence his team gathered was sufficient for Trump to have been convicted at trial on charges of scheming to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.', 'Smith dropped that case and a separate one charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after Trump’s election win in November, citing longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting criminal cases against a sitting president.', 'Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

These constitutional provisions abolished slavery, established birthright citizenship, required equal protection under the law, and prohibited racial discrimination in voting. ', 'Ms. Bondi’s record raises serious doubts about her commitment to upholding these and other civil rights. Time and again, she has prioritized partisan ideology over truth and the rule of law, refusing to answer direct questions about her ability to administer justice impartially. Her confirmation comes at a time when we need an independent Department of Justice more than ever—one whose leader remembers why it was founded.', 'Now that she has been confirmed, Ms. Bondi must follow the rule of law, not weaponize the Department of Justice to advance an extreme, hateful agenda that undermines the rights of everyday Americans and consolidates power in the hands of the few.', 'Our country stands at an inflection point. We must choose whether to fight for a nation rooted in equality, fairness, and justice—or allow division, political ideology, and hateful attacks to take hold. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and our network of pro bono attorneys choose democracy—a system where Black people, communities of color, and all Americans have a fair shot, and where the rule of law for the people prevails over the rule by the few. We will fight in and out of the courtroom to defend civil rights. No matter the obstacles, we are committed to the pursuit of  a democracy that delivers on its promises for everyone.”', '###', 'About the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law— Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy to mobilize the nation’s leading lawyers as agents for change in the Civil Rights Movement. Today, the Lawyers’ Committee uses legal advocacy to achieve racial justice, fighting inside and outside the courts to ensure that Black people and other people of color have the voice, opportunity, and power to make the promises of our democracy real. The Lawyers’ Committee implements its mission and objectives by marshaling the pro bono resources of the bar for litigation, public policy, advocacy and other forms of service by lawyers to the cause of civil rights.', '', '', '']"
