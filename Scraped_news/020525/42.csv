It Doesn’t Hurt To Love Ke Huy Quan: An AUGUSTMAN Exclusive,https://www.augustman.com/sg/people/it-doesnt-hurt-to-love-ke-huy-quan-an-augustman-exclusive/,"['', '', 'When I was eight, I hated Ke Huy Quan for being Short Round.', 'When my parents bought a new laser disc (LD) player, one of the first LDs they also bought was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Harrison Ford was already one of my favourite actors, but that movie made me an even bigger fan. While I loved a good scoundrel like Han Solo, I particularly loved the adventuring academic. As an eight-yearold, perpetually bored in primary school, something about someone who goes from campus to the jaws of danger in just two scenes appealed to me, so Professor Henry “Indiana” Jones Jr. was very easily my favourite fictional character of all time then.', '', '', '', 'As a boy, I never wanted to be my heroes. I yearned to be the person fighting alongside him. As much as I loved Frodo Baggins, I wanted to be Samwise Gamgee. I loved Han Solo, but I wanted to be Chewbacca. In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, I especially loved Indy, and I especially wanted to be Short Round, his orphaned Asian sidekick.', 'Sadly, there was this Vietnamese-born Chinese American kid named Ke Huy Quan playing Short Round. Whenever I lived out my Indiana Jones fantasies at the playground, my mind went to the Asian boy who got to be on set with Harrison Ford, who received instruction from Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, and who got to shout, “Indy!” as he evaded trouble. The obsession I had for Ke Huy Quan turned to jealousy, and in my immature mind, he deserved my wrath.', 'Of course, as an eight-year-old, I had no idea that the person I hated was struggling and would continue to have a hard time surviving as an actor for years. After his memorable portrayal of Data in 1985’s The Goonies, roles for Quan dried up. His appearances in Taiwanese movies and shortrun American sitcoms were limited.', 'To gain the attention of Hollywood, the actor even tried changing his name. “For a long time, people didn’t know how to pronounce my name. When I was younger, my manager suggested I changed it to a more American name. So, at one point, I was called Jonathan,” he tells me. Having spent most of my formative years in the pre-woke era, I was not surprised.', 'However, Quan stayed true to himself. “When I got back into acting, I chose to go by my birth name again. The thought of people not knowing how to pronounce my name made me a little hesitant, but I told myself that if I work hard enough, people will learn how to say my name.” It is pronounced “Kee-Hwee-Kwahn”.', 'Because Quan’s Hollywood career started so brightly, the drought was particularly challenging. “I didn’t know much when I started in the business. I was 12 years old. I had just immigrated to the US four years earlier, learning the language and assimilating into my new life,” he recalls. “All of a sudden, I was cast in this big movie starring Harrison Ford, and working with the kings of Hollywood, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. I had the most incredible time working with these men, and I learnt so much from them.”', 'Working on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was particularly formative. Quan says, “That experience shaped who I am today—my love for this industry, my love of acting, and my work ethic. Being on the set taught me how to treat people, and that success does not mean that you must be an asshole. I’ve been extremely fortunate and have worked with very successful people who are the kindest, most humble, generous people I’ve ever met. That experience was nothing but positive.”', 'For his performance as Short Round, Quan was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. It paved the way for his next big role as Richard ‘Data’ Wang in The Goonies in 1985, a year after the release of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Despite his success, Quan remained grounded, and did not fall off the rails like many successful child actors.', '“My parents were very strict,” says Quan. As Asian children growing up in the ’80s and ’90s, we shared a small knowing laugh. Our parents were probably strict in similar ways. “I was always surrounded by my family. They kept me level-headed and grounded. They wouldn’t let me do any crazy stuff. My parents would have killed me if I did drugs. They raised me with very traditional Chinese values.”', 'Apart from that, he was never interested in the glitz, glamour, and temptations of the Hollywood party scene. “I was going through puberty, trying to find my own identity, my own belonging. Going to Hollywood parties was the last thing on my mind. I just wanted to find myself and find a job. After work, I went straight home. I never liked that scene anyway. I’m not a party guy. I’m very homey.”', 'After The Goonies, Ke Huy Quan found some success in Asia, but it was in Hollywood that he sought success. It was where he got his first break—to him, professionally, Hollywood was home. However, opportunities were scarce for an Asian actor in the ’90s.', 'As the roles dwindled, Quan quit acting and enrolled at University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts. “Those two years I was there, I learnt so much about the entire movie-making process—not just from an actor’s point of view, but also from the director’s, cinematographer’s, editor’s, and sound designer’s perspective. That’s when I began to understand this industry and my perspective broadened. Seeing myself behind the camera was just as liberating as seeing myself in front of it. It opened many doors for me.”', 'Ke Huy Quan’s first job after the School of Cinematic Arts was assisting Corey Yuen, a legendary Hong Kong action film director, on the set of X-Men in 2000, where he met the young associate producer Kevin Feige, now President of Marvel Studios and the primary producer of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise since 2007.', 'Quan brought the same energy and positivity he has always possessed to that job. “It was incredible. With the education and experience of working with Corey Yuen. I started down a career path that, in retrospect, prepared me for Love Hurts.”', 'The action thriller-romcom is Quan’s latest and first-ever leading role in a Hollywood film. It follows his Oscar-winning performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once, which marked his return to acting after a two-decade hiatus. In Love Hurts, Quan plays Marvin Gable, a seemingly mild-mannered real estate agent hiding a dangerous past. When a former partner in crime returns seeking revenge, Marvin is thrust back into the world of violence and forced to confront the choices that have haunted him.', 'It was also a personal project for Ke Huy Quan. “We made this movie for action fans. We wanted to make sure that it was entertaining and that the fight scenes were incredible. They were the most demanding aspect of this shoot. There are five big action sequences, and each gets crazier, more complex, and more intense. Their style is similar to what Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung did in the ’80s. These greats focused on the action sequences to ensure they delivered.', '“The cast is incredible, too. Oscar winner Ariana DeBose, Daniel Wu, Mustafa Shakir, Marshawn Lynch—all incredible actors. In terms of the dramatic elements, playing off them was easy. When you work with great actors, they make it easy.” Quan’s Goonies co-star Sean Astin has a small role as Cliff Cussick, Gable’s real estate boss and mentor. “The day Sean arrived on set, I dropped everything and ran to give him a big hug,” he recalls. “We’re brothers for life because of that movie.”', 'Love Hurts continues a renaissance in Hollywood’s portrayal of masculinity, where leading men use intelligence, sensitivity, and kindness rather than pure muscle to win the day. This flag has been flown by protagonists such as Eddie Redmayne’s Newt Scamander from the Fantastic Beasts series, and Astin’s Samwise Gamgee in The Lord of the Rings movies. Quan began flying it as Waymond Wang and continues to do so as Marvin Gable. It’s a welcome change from the deluge of muscled superheroes solving plot points today with punches and laser beams.', '“For a long time, we defined masculinity by how tall a man was, how big his muscles were, how much weight he could lift, and how many guys he could beat up. I have always disagreed with that.” Quan shares, “To me, my dad was a real man. He was an extremely successful businessman in Vietnam. My siblings and I were born during the Vietnam War, and he wanted the family to have a better future, so he gave everything up—his business, his entire wealth—to get us all to the United States.”', 'Ke Huy Quan portrays Love Hurts’s Marvin Gable in this way. “At first, you can beat him, but he eventually becomes a genuine badass.” In this case, art mirrors reality. “In real life, a badass is not defined by how many guys he can beat up. A badass works hard, ensures his family is taken care of, treats his wife with a lot of love and everyone, with respect and kindness, and takes nothing for granted. He also offers help without expecting anything in return. To me, that is a real man and a badass.”', 'Now that I’m 38, I love Ke Huy Quan and everything he is and represents. Hollywood can be fickle. Like an eight-year-old boy, it can get bored quickly and move on to the next thing that appeals to it. But I’m happy we have finally reached a point in filmdom’s history when Ke Huy Quan is a leading man, as he deserves to be.', 'So, I’m sorry for hating you when I was eight, Mr. Quan. I’ve learnt my lesson from you, and I promise to keep my head down, work hard, and focus on being a better person.', 'Credits:', 'Hair + Makeup Mira Chai', 'Shot on location at Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel', 'BY \nAUGUSTMAN SINGAPORE\nSEP 05, 2024 | 14 MIN READ', 'BY \nFARHAN SHAH\nAUG 07, 2024 | 10 MIN READ', 'Yes, I agree to the Privacy Policy.', '', '', '']"

But we just got one of the most complete ever, as Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Jeff Cohen, Kerri Green, and screenwriter Chris Columbus gathered to celebrate Ke Huy Quan getting his hands and feet imprinted outside of the famed TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.

While Brolin (Brandon Walsh), Feldman (Mouth), Cohen (Chunk), and Green (Andy) all turned out for Quan, the absences of Sean Astin (Mikey) and Martha Plimpton (Stef) were definitely noticed.', 'As part of this Goonies reunion, Brolin gave a speech in his he said, in part, “I won’t say much other than after The Goonies, I too lived in the ethers of our business for 19-plus years. The only difference being that I was still chipping away at leftovers and trading stocks full time while you pursued a whole other profession and excelled in it famously…I could not be happier for you. I know we all are, all us Goonies, here for an honor that is not only totally deserved but celebrates all that is right in this industry. Love you, pal.” Steven Spielberg – who was obviously a vital figure in Quan’s career – sent a letter as well.', 'As a childhood favorite of many of our readers, that The Goonies cast still remains tight enough to join for reunions like this and show their support to one another is pretty incredible. And honestly, that’s so much better and nostalgia-driven than any follow-up could touch.

"Ke Huy Quan On Blowing Up, Kicking Ass, And Turning Leading Man",https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/ke-huy-quan-focus-interview/,"['Ke Huy Quan is in the eye of the storm. He’s been here before, of course. When he was barely a teenager, he was a global icon — we all grew up gasping at his adventures, from battling Thuggees in a cave system lousy with voodoo in Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, to being menaced by Robert Davi and Joey Pants in The Goonies. Those blockbusters put him on the map. But after decades of quiet, during which a retired-from-acting Quan suspected that his Hollywood journey had stopped for good, that storm is whirling again, fiercer than ever.', 'As an adult actor, he’s won an Oscar for his comeback role(s) as Waymond in mind-melting multiverse romance Everything Everywhere All At Once. He’s met and taken photos with seemingly every celebrity in Hollywood, including, recently, both Billy Crystal and Mickey Mouse simultaneously. He’s joined the MCU with Loki, played a pangolin in Kung Fu Panda 4. Good things keep happening to him.', 'And it seems like the whole world is cheering him on. When Empire sits down with the immensely likeable star at a seafood restaurant in Calabasas, Los Angeles, for a lunch of oysters and octopus (it’s hard not to think of the moment at the end of The Goonies where Quan’s Data says, “The octopus was really scary!”, despite the scene with the beast having been left on the cutting-room floor), he’s preparing to fly to Taiwan to present at the Golden Horse Awards, Asia’s equivalent of the Oscars. Finally, he’s accepted everywhere, all at once. And, now in his fifties, he wants to do everything, preparing to fulfil some long-harboured dreams.', 'The first: to star in a high-octane Hollywood action flick. The forthcoming Love Hurts, his first leading role in America, is the culmination of decades of action training by Quan. Directed by John Wick stunt-maestro Jonathan Eusebio, it has been an experience that, yes, hurt — but was worth every bruise. Quan is making up for lost time, and a little pain isn’t going to slow him down.', 'EMPIRE: It’s almost two years on from your Oscar win. Does it feel like life has totally changed?', 'Ke Huy Quan: On a personal level, nothing’s changed. I still live in the same house. I still drive the same car. I still go to the same places. I don’t have an assistant. My wife, Echo, helps me. But on a professional level, oh, it’s night and day. I spent so many years desperately trying to persuade filmmakers that I’m right for a role: “Please put me in this movie.” But now, filmmakers are coming to me. They’ll say, “We have this script. We think you’re perfect for this.” That’s how Love Hurts started.', 'Incredibly, given you’ve been acting since you were 12, this is your first leading-man role in a Hollywood movie.', 'I actually passed [on Love Hurts] a couple of times, because when I read it, I thought, “Wait, this is not for me. Why are you asking me?” I was so confused. I thought it was written for somebody like Jason Statham, because I’ve been conditioned to think that when you have an action star, he needs to look like The Rock or Stallone or Schwarzenegger. I didn’t think anybody that looks like me could star in this role. Luckily, they didn’t give up on me. They came back for a third time. I was at an event with Steven Spielberg and he was asking me, “Ke, how are you doing?” I said, “Steven, I’m not doing so well.” Because of all the love and support that I had gotten during that whole award season, I was so worried that whatever I was going to do next, I would disappoint. So I was having trouble picking my next project. Steven was very generous. He said, “Ke, let’s have lunch.” And I told him about this project and kind of pitched it to him. He said, “Ke, it’s great. Do it.” I went in and they had these really elaborate slides with me as the main character. That’s when I started to see it a different way. “Oh, they’re trying to create a different kind of action hero. Not the type that we’ve seen for decades, but something new.”', 'Talking of Spielberg, your first-ever movie — and your first taste of action — was Temple Of Doom.', 'It was my first exposure to action. For the big finale (in which Quan’s Short Round tussles with a voodoo-doll-tormenting child), I was trained for a couple of days with a taekwondo instructor. I still remember his name — Philip Tan. That was my first time doing it on camera, and I loved it.', 'You were also taught to swim by Harrison Ford. Was he a patient teacher?', 'He’s a great teacher. And to this day I know how to swim because of him. I mean, I’m not as good as him. (Laughs) He has great forms, but I can only do a couple of styles.', 'You then got yourself a black belt.', 'After Indiana Jones, I came back to LA, and my brother and I immediately went and studied. We would go to taekwondo classes Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And then on Tuesday and Thursday, we would watch Hong Kong movies. I even went and bought a sandbag and put it in my backyard: we would go to the television and rewind the sequences that we loved, watch them again and then go out and try to do those moves. I really wanted to go and make action movies. I fantasised about working with Jackie Chan or Sammo Hung and then also in Hollywood. Unfortunately, nobody hired me. And I made two movies that I really love, but they were low-budget, independent action movies that nobody really saw.', 'Those are the Chinese films Breathing Fire (1991) and Red Pirate (1997). In the latter, you play the hero, an ass-kicking cop who at one point slides down a bannister with two guns. It feels like a hybrid of Jackie Chan and John Woo.', 'Oh yes, that slide was Chow Yun-Fat in A Better Tomorrow. Classic! With Red Pirate, that director (Chen Chi-Hwa) was Jackie Chan’s director. He collaborated with Jackie Chan on many movies. So I was super-excited and I poured everything I knew into that movie. I did all the fights myself, all the falling, all the twirling around, jumping. I had bruises every day, but I didn’t mind. I was really happy because I was living my dream.', '""I don\'t know how to do fight scenes any other way, except to go full power.""', 'Yet it was shortly after that movie that you walked away from acting.', 'That was actually the last movie I ever did before stepping away. I was disappointed, because I had a great time and worked really hard, but it didn’t do anything. Nobody really talked about it. I did a few movies in Asia, and a 40-episode TV series, but they never became big hits. It was a tough period, because when I went back to Asia [after Indiana Jones and The Goonies], I was treated like a big movie star. You know, there would be fans waiting for me at the hotel I was staying in, and at the studio where we were working. But that never turned into a meaningful career. So when that dried up, I came back [to America]... and then it was even worse!', 'You’ve spoken about making the decision to quit acting after auditioning for a role with only two lines, and then not getting it.', 'That was after I finished Red Pirate, where I was the star. I came back to Hollywood and my agent said, “Well, we don’t have much, but we want to keep you working. There’s this role that only has two lines. It’s a Vietcong role. You want to go try out for it?” And when I couldn’t even get that, that was one of the lowest points of my life.', 'You were really going through it. But then you picked yourself up and applied to USC film school. Did you have a grand plan of where it would lead to?', 'No, not yet, because I was really lost at that time. And stepping away was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. I was just like, “Let me learn as much as I can about the movie business.” Every department — producing, script-writing, cinematography, editing, sound — I tried to learn something about it. So hopefully, when I came out, I would have a career behind the camera.', 'You made a comedy-horror short called Voodoo, which is still shown to students there.', 'I edited and did the cinematography for that. I’m very proud of it. It was one of those classes where you partner up with a classmate. We shot it on film, 8mm, and we would splice the film on this tiny machine. And I would have all these different takes taped to the wall. I was in a good place, because I was surrounded by people that were just as passionate about movies as I am.', 'Funnily enough, like Temple Of Doom, it has a voodoo-doll theme.', 'That wasn’t my idea. It was my partner [Gregg Bishop] who directed the movie. But we all grew up watching the same movies, and he was heavily influenced by Spielberg and the Indiana Jones films.', 'Then everything started spinning in a whole new direction. You started working on action sequences from behind the camera.', 'I had known [legendary action choreographer and director] Corey Yuen many years prior to that. He’s very good friends with my cousin up in Seattle, so every time I went to Seattle I would see him, and he would ask, “Ke, what have you been up to?” When he found out that I had graduated, it was just perfect timing. He calls and says, “I’m in Toronto. Why don’t you fly up?” I literally had no clue what was going on. I landed and a driver took me to set. I walked on set and said, “What movie is this?” And then I found out that it was [2000’s] X-Men.', 'You were just thrown into it like that?', 'I was thrown into it. I had zero experience of action choreography. Corey took me under his wing and taught me. And because of my taekwondo background, I was tasked with training Hugh Jackman all the moves for the big finale. It was a great fight. After we designed it, me and another action choreographer would walk out the fight in front of the entire cast and crew. Over 100 people. And a young man named Kevin Feige was off to the side talking to the producer, saying, “That guy over there is Short Round from Indiana Jones!” (Laughs) He couldn’t believe it. And that was my first job, right out of college.', 'You went on to work with Wong Kar Wai on films like 2046. With all that experience behind the camera, did you ever get the itch to direct yourself?', 'Oh yes. I thought about it, for sure. But you know, Spielberg always says, “Listen to your intuition. It never shouts, it whispers.” And something was telling me that that’s not what I should be doing at that time.', 'Now you’re where you’re at, is that itch coming back?', 'Right now, my main focus is to be a part of as many interesting projects as I can as an actor.I want to play characters that I didn’t get the opportunity to do when I was younger. Directing is something that I think is a little bit further down the line, because it’s very time-consuming. And there are so many different characters I want to play. So many wonderful filmmakers I want to work with.', 'Let’s talk about some of your upcoming roles. Everything Everywhere... saw you bust some martial-arts moves, including with a weaponised fanny-pack. But Marvin Gable in Love Hurts, estate agent and secret one-man army, is on another level.', 'They tailored [that role] to me, to everything that I know. We have an incredible action team. And [producer] David Leitch and his company, 87North, are very good with this genre. Going into this movie, I was mentally prepared, and I was physically ready, because I trained with them for three months. And it was really trying to find out, while we were training, what I can still do. Mentally, I think I can do everything, but a lot of those moves I haven’t done in decades. One of the things I’m very proud of is I did all the fights myself. There were stunt doubles for the wire rigs where I get thrown across the room. But all the punches, all the kicks, I threw myself. Every day, I would soak in a salt bath for half an hour. It was a lot of fun, but it was physically so demanding that halfway through the shoot, I told my wife, “I don’t think I can do this again.” Then, when the trailer came out and I saw how great it is, I told her, “I can’t wait to do this again.” (Laughs)', '""I want to go out of my comfort zone and play a diabolical, really bad guy.""', 'Is there one show-stopping sequence you were especially excited about, going in?', 'There are five big action sequences, each one very different, and I was very involved. One of the fights I’m very proud of is the big finale, the epic fight between Daniel Wu and I. We really went at it. That’s the way I know. I don’t know how to do fight scenes any other way, except to go full power.', 'Is it surreal to suddenly be the main selling point for the film, after all this time?', 'It’s incredible. I never thought I would one day see a trailer with the Universal Studios logo before it, and then the movie be advertised with my name. Honestly, everything that has happened in the last two years, I never thought would happen. It feels great. But also, stepping into this movie, I knew what being number one meant, because I’ve seen it. I’ve seen how Tom Hiddleston does it [on Loki, which co-stars Quan]. I’ve seen how Harrison Ford does it. You really set the tone. Everybody looks to you. I went in thinking, “Okay, now I’m in this position, how am I going to treat my cast and crew?” And I hope they’re happy.', 'Then there’s The Electric State, in which you play some manner of genius scientist.', 'I play Dr Amherst. A character that Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt traverse America to look for. They need to find this doctor to understand what’s going on.', 'With that and Loki’s Ouroboros, you’re becoming Hollywood’s go-to guy for dispensing information.', 'Yeah, isn’t that something? (Laughs) I spent my entire life searching for info, and now people are coming to me for info. [The Electric State] was a very different experience because there were a lot of mocap actors. We would rehearse with the mocap actors, shoot a couple of takes with them, then they would step aside and now we’re just acting as if to nothing. It was a real first. Loki, everything was practical — except the Temporal Loom, which we had a giant poster of so we knew what we were looking at.', 'And then there’s Fairytale In New York, to be directed by Sisu’s Jalmari Helander, which hasn’t started shooting yet.', 'I was pitched Fairytale before I won the Oscar. It’s a Christmas movie, it’s a badass action movie, and I fell in love with the pitch right away, Because I’ve always wanted my own Christmas movie, but an ass-kicking Christmas movie, kind of like Die Hard. We recently got the second draft, and I can tell you it is awesome. I’m a cab driver on Christmas Eve, something happens, and it’s really like a man-on-a-mission-type movie. It’s non-stop action. Once it takes off, it’s a big rollercoaster ride.', 'So you’re finally getting the action movies you always wanted.', 'Isn’t that ironic? Like, nobody wanted to hire me to be in an action movie when I was in my twenties, when I was in the best shape of my life!', 'Do you think you have a lot of years of action in you still?', 'That is what I hope. I don’t want to be perceived as an action star. I hope I’m perceived as an actor who does action well. So I’m going to take it one step at a time. The best part about being an actor is, you get to play a variety of different characters. I love Ouroboros because he’s so different than Waymond, and Waymond is so different than Marvin Gable.', 'Finally, Tom Hiddleston wrote a tribute to you when you were picked as one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People of 2023. He said, “His positivity is the most profound kind of spiritual strength.” That positivity is in the DNA of a lot of your characters, too. But would you be up for going against type and playing a bad guy?', 'I would love to play a bad guy. Like a Bond villain. Or the kind of thing Hugh Grant does in Heretic. I want to go out of my comfort zone and just play this diabolical, really bad guy. (Laughs) That would be a lot of fun.', 'Originally published in the March 2025 issue of Empire.

', 'Quan’s remarkable return to the big screen, highlighted by his Academy Award-winning performance as Waymond Wang in 2022’s Everything Everywhere All At Once, came after a lengthy two-decade hiatus that put a lot of separation between his childhood and adult film roles. But as you’ll find out below, he hasn’t exactly been in hiding — in fact, an uplifting thread of consistency has signified Quan’s lengthy screen career, buoyed by the unwavering support of Echo Quan, his wife of more than 20 years.

Within a year, he was back at work in another Steven Spielberg movie collaboration — this time in the role of Richard ""Data"" Wang in The Goonies, holding down the fort as the gang’s gadget-savvy resident James Bond fan. ', 'RELATED: Ke Huy Quan is a ""Different Kind of Action Star"" in First Trailer for Love Hurts', ""Quan continued to act into his early 20s, landing roles in the Japanese film Passengers and, as some sitcom fans might remember, as Jasper Kwong in later seasons of TV's Head of the Class (1990-1991). On the big screen, Quan also appeared in Breathing Fire (1991) and opposite Pauly Shore and Brendan Fraser in Encino Man (1992), before his acting opportunities began to taper and he decided to take a fresh approach to the screen industry — this time from the other side of the camera."", 'Quan entered the film program at the University of Southern California in the 1990s, graduating in 1999 after developing Voodoo, a student-created horror-comedy flick that earned the Audience Award at the 2000 Slamdance Film Festival. “…I started working for some really fun and great people,” Quan shared with Entertainment Weekly in 2022, including a productive professional relationship with action choreographer Corey Yuen.
