And the Agriculture Department predicts prices will go up another 20 percent this year."", 'A big reason for these sky high egg prices, the bird flu outbreak that started in 2022. Since then, efforts to limit the spread of the virus have led to the slaughter of more than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, the vast majority of them egg laying chickens. Two perspectives on this story.', 'David Anderson is a professor and livestock economist at Texas A and M University. And Angela Rasmussen is a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. David, let me start with you.', 'Help us by putting these prices, these high prices into perspective. In the historical context, where do they stand?', 'David Anderson, Texas A&M University:', ""Well, these are all time record high prices. So, you know, in a historical context, we're at the peak. We're the highest they've ever been."", 'John Yang:', 'Are there some regions of the country that are harder hit the prices are higher than in others?', 'David Anderson:', ""Well, yeah, there are. Particularly if we look at the coast, New York and California, we certainly see higher prices there for the same reason they're always higher in those locations. One is it's a long way from where we produced the majority of the eggs in the U.S. to those markets. But you know, once you get down, if you're going to deliver to a store in New York City, you know, it's probably a little more costly to get to those markets."", 'John Yang:', 'And David, how big a factor is bird flu in this and are there other factors as well?', 'David Anderson:', ""That really is the key factor. That really is the factor in these prices. You know, we have other things like a long term increase in demand for eggs as we've increased our protein in our diets. Eggs compete as a protein source with meats and other vegetable protein sources."", 'But you know, those long term trends and increasing demand are really dwarfed by this sudden shock to the system of a disease outbreak that wipes out a portion of our supplies.', 'John Yang:', ""Angela, let me ask you about this disease outbreak. Tell us about this latest strain of the bird flu and why it's so persistent."", ""Angela Rasmussen, University of Saskatchewan: So there's actually multiple strains of the bird flu that are currently circulating in wild birds as well as in the nation's dairy cattle. We actually have multiple spillovers occurring to these different poultry farms. Some of these viruses are coming from wild birds, some of these viruses are coming from wild birds that have contracted the virus from the dairy cows."", ""There's a number of other species, such as cats as well, that are also getting infected. So there's actually quite a lot of H5N1 influenza viruses circulating around in the environment in other species of animals. And that is partly responsible for both the increased number of flock outbreaks as well as the increased number of human cases."", 'John Yang:', ""Talk about those human cases. The CDC says that in the United States there are about 66 human cases. And last recently we had the first death of in the United States. What's the risk to humans and how worried should people be about it?"", 'Angela Rasmussen:', ""Yeah, so this is a really complicated question because people should definitely be concerned about it. But at this time, the risk to the general population is quite low. And part of the reason for that is we've seen no evidence of sustained human to human transmission with these viruses."", ""So every one of these human cases is actually getting the virus from animal, either from a bird, the case that you mentioned that was severe and died was contracting the virus from a backyard flock of poultry, or they're getting it from dairy cattle. So these are a lot of occupational exposures that we're seeing. We're not actually seeing the virus spread from human to human."", ""That said, that's good news, but it's still very concerning because the more human cases there are, the greater the likelihood that this virus could mutate to be able to transmit efficiently from human to human. So while the risk to the population is low unless you're handling or in close proximity with one of these animal species, we really do need to keep an eye on this to make sure that any human to human transmission is detected before it has the opportunity to spread outward into the human population."", 'John Yang:', 'And Angela, should people be concerned or worried about eating eggs, for instance?', 'Angela Rasmussen:', ""So eggs are actually quite safe to eat, as is milk, as long as it's cooked or pasteurized. I wouldn't recommend eating raw eggs right now because we do know that eggs can support the growth of influenza viruses. In fact, that's how we often grow vaccines for flu. They really grow up a lot of virus. So make sure you cook the eggs, make sure you're drinking pasteurized milk, but otherwise the food supply is safe."", 'John Yang:', ""David, what's it going to take to bring these prices down to Earth?"", 'David Anderson:', 'Well, the first thing we need is the disease to quit occurring and wiping out chicken farms. And the second thing is just time. Time to rebuild flocks to replace the lost birds. And that just takes a little bit of time.', 'John Yang:', ""Talk about that how? I mean, we're talking about the flocks that have been destroyed. As soon as it shows up in a flock, they — to try to keep it from spreading, they destroy the flock. How long does it take to rebuild that flock?"", 'David Anderson:', ""Well, it takes about 26 weeks to grow a hen, a pullet, they're called, to get them to where they start laying eggs. And then it takes a little while longer eggs fully sized. The first ones are kind of small. So to get to the eggs, the large ones that we see at the store, or extra large, if you like, those takes a little bit longer."", ""And so, you know, just think about, you know, here we are with biology. That's really our time constraint. It just takes some time to do that. You know, although we can look at egg prices and they're highly volatile. You know, we go back to 2022, '23, and went from over $5 a dozen to $0.84 per dozen by May of '23. So the potential for lower prices is there.

US egg prices expected to climb further as farmers strained by bird flu outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/egg-prices-bird-flu,"['About 14.7 million egg-laying hens have been affected as wholesale price of eggs climbs as much as 40 cents a week', 'Egg prices in the US have risen steeply over the last several weeks. Experts say they are likely to climb further as an avian flu outbreak decimates flocks across the country.', 'Though the avian flu has been in the US since 2022, the largest outbreak started in October and is still affecting millions of hens. About 14.7 million egg-producing chickens have been affected by the avian flu since the start of January, surpassing the number of hens affected in all of 2023, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).', '“Based on the amount of birds that we have lost in the last few months, and the hen population, there just isn’t enough production to support the amount of demand that we have,” said Karyn Rispoli, managing director of eggs at the price-tracking firm Expana. “We’re at a point now where we’re truly in a shortage.”', 'In December the number of table eggs produced fell 4.5% compared with the same period last year, according to the USDA. With more hens infected with the avian flu in January, the number of eggs will probably continue to drop.', 'The avian flu is specifically affecting hens that produce table eggs as they are kept alive longer than broiler chickens, which are used for meat, making them more susceptible to infection during their lifetime. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that human infections of the avian flu are rare.', 'The wholesale price of a dozen large eggs has been climbing as much as 40 cents a week as farmers struggle to produce enough eggs to keep up with demand. As of 24 January, the wholesale price of a dozen large eggs was $7.24 in New York, $6.84 in the midwest and $8.35 in California.', 'But consumers often end up paying a different price at the store. Many grocery stores sell eggs at prices lower than their wholesale cost, taking a loss to ensure customers come back to the store for other items. Though average wholesale prices in mid-January were around $5.80, the average price of eggs in stores was just above $4 – up from around $2.50 a year ago.', 'Still, people are starting to see prices increase in some stores. Videos on social media show people shocked at seeing $15 cartons of eggs. “I’m going to have to start reselling,” one TikTok user jokes in a video.', 'Higher egg prices especially affect restaurants and bakeries, which often have to buy eggs wholesale.', '“We’re known for our French macarons … and also these big stuffed cookies that are filled with cheesecake or Nutella – all items that are egg-heavy,” said Henry Crawford, co-owner of Sugar Bakery, which he runs with his wife, Ela, in Santa Cruz, California. The bakery uses about 800 eggs a week for its desserts. Sixty eggs used to cost about $13 for the business, but over the last several weeks the price has shot up to $19.', '“It’s making the margins a lot smaller,” Crawford said, adding that it’s difficult to raise prices for customers. “People become accustomed to paying a certain price.”', 'Many Americans might feel a sense of deja vu as they read the price labels on egg shelves at the grocery store. Egg prices shot up in December 2022, after an earlier outbreak of avian flu, but eventually came back down after demand cooled following the holiday season.', 'But this year, prices have yet to fall. “Retail demand in January hasn’t really let up all that much,” Rispoli said. People have “gotten used to higher egg prices, so it’s not really acting as a deterrent”.', 'Ending the current avian flu outbreak will be tough. Egg producers have been lobbying the federal government to help fund vaccine research and biosecurity to address the outbreak. The virus can spread from wild birds to domestic hens, and while the disease is known to spread from bird-to-bird contact, scientists are still unsure whether infections are airborne.', 'If a single chicken in a flock is infected, the whole flock becomes at risk of infection. Orders for new chicks can take up to a year and a half to be fulfilled, meaning it is unclear when the number of egg-producing hens will get back to normal levels.', 'Egg prices may become a sticky political point as Donald Trump and a Republican majority return to Washington. When a reporter asked the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, about the rising cost of eggs on Wednesday, Leavitt blamed the Biden administration for high prices.', '“This is an example of why it’s so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump’s nominees,” she said.']"

Egg prices have steadily risen in recent months due to a spike in bird flu; outbreaks in egg-laying chickens are affecting the national supply, driving up costs. Holiday baking and cold-weather stockpiling also increased demand, and prices to boot, with a dozen grade-A large eggs costing $4.15 in December, up from $2.51 the year before (a 36% increase).

Then you just need to make sure they keep well.', 'Eggs in the shell that are stored at a consistent temperature of 40°F will last three to five weeks, Claire Edgemon, a dietitian at Baylor College of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. (If you’re not sure whether to toss or keep your eggs, you can try this freshness test: Submerge the egg in water. “If it sinks, it is fresh,” Edgemon says. “If it floats, it has a pocket of air and its quality has decreased.”)', 'The best place to store eggs in the shell is at the back of your refrigerator, says Zumpano. Just be sure to keep them in their original carton. “Storing them in the egg holder in the door of the fridge exposes the eggs to temperature and air variations,” says Edgemon.', 'You can freeze eggs to extend their shelf life, but that requires a little prep work. That’s because eggs can’t be frozen in the shell. “The yolk contains no water, so will form a gel instead of freezing,” explains Edgemon.', 'To freeze eggs, remove the shell and gently scramble them, placing them in freezer containers and labeling them with the number of eggs and the date, suggests Walter. Frozen eggs are good for up to a year. “If you like egg whites, you can do the same with egg whites alone as well,” says Walter.', 'Naria Le Mire, a dietitian specializing in functional gut health, has her own favorite method for freezing eggs: “Personally, I enjoy making egg bites or frittatas in bulk, freezing them and reheating them as needed,” she tells Yahoo Life. “This not only helps prevent food waste but also makes meal prep faster and more cost-efficient.”', 'When you’re ready to use the frozen eggs, Walter recommends defrosting them in the refrigerator overnight. “For the egg whites, it is ideal to let them sit for 30 minutes at room temperature before using so that they respond to beating better,” she says.', 'Besides freezing them, there are other steps you can take to extend the shelf life of eggs, especially if you’re buying in bulk. Walter suggests these four methods:', 'Pickling: Pickle hard-boiled eggs in a vinegar brine with spices. This not only preserves them, but also adds a unique flavor.', 'Dehydrating: Dehydrate eggs by scrambling them and drying them in a dehydrator (set it to 165°F, the minimum temperature that safely kills salmonella). Then use a blender to grind the dehydrated eggs into a powder and store the powder in an airtight container. When you want to use them, simply rehydrate with water.', 'Curing: Cure eggs in a mixture of salt and sugar, which preserves them.', 'Storing in oil: Submerge hard-boiled eggs in oil, such as olive oil, in a sealed jar. This can prevent oxidation and maintain freshness for a longer period of time.', 'Whichever preservation method you choose, just be sure to store the eggs in the fridge after.', 'While egg whites deliver about half of an egg’s protein, Edgemon explains that the yolk provides the other half, along with most of the vitamins and minerals. So experts recommend using them in cooking rather than just tossing them.', '“Egg yolks are super versatile,” says Walter. “You can save them for two to four days in the refrigerator and use them to bake, make a salad dressing like a Caesar or a sauce like homemade mayonnaise or aioli, use as an egg wash” — brushing it on breads and pastries before baking — “make some seasonal ice cream or even make some eggnog to sip as our temperatures dip.”', 'Le Mire adds that you can also use egg yolks as a binder in recipes like meatloaf. “Being creative and preventing food waste is essential in this economy,” she says.', ""Liquid egg whites cost a bit more than a carton of eggs, but in some cases they can be cost-effective, particularly if you're only using egg whites and discarding the yolks, says Le Mire. “For example, at Costco, you can get a pack of egg whites for around $12, which contains 60 servings!” she says. “By combining whole eggs and liquid egg whites in your meal planning, you can stretch your budget and reduce waste.”"", 'Just keep in mind that packaged liquid eggs don’t last long after opening — about three days, says Edgemon — so if you don’t plan on using them quickly, it may not save money in the long run.', 'Eggs are a complete source of high-quality protein — meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids, which are building blocks for bones and muscle, explains Walter. “Foods higher in protein boost your satiety levels and keep you fuller longer so they lend to weight management,” she adds.', 'In addition, eggs — and in particular, the yolks — contain many vitamins (A, riboflavin, folate, pantothenic acid, B6, B12, C, D, E) and minerals (phosphorus, selenium, calcium, zinc), says Edgemon. “The egg yolks also contain choline, a much-needed nutrient for metabolism, nervous system and liver health, and antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which are helpful for eye health,” she says.', 'The nutrient-dense food also contains healthy fats, including omega-3 fatty acids, which can help support cardiovascular health.', 'As far as cholesterol concerns, research shows that for most people, eggs will not negatively impact cholesterol levels, says Edgemon. Zumpano explains that “since egg yolks contain cholesterol — the whites do not — it was once thought to avoid them to prevent high blood cholesterol values, but clinical research has proven that to be only an association. Data does not show that eggs can increase cholesterol unless eaten in excess.”', 'In fact, adds Edgemon, “eggs have been shown to increase the healthy cholesterol [HDL].” Lichtenstein explains that the historical target has been to consume less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day. This is close to the average U.S. intake already — “hence, the guidance changed from recommending eggs be avoided to [saying] it is fine to eat an egg a day or a couple of eggs every other day,” says Lichtenstein, “just as long as they are not accompanied by bacon or sausage, which are high in saturated fat.”', 'That said, if you have a family history of high cholesterol, Edgemon says it might be wise to limit egg consumption. But in general, elevated cholesterol is more often linked to diets high in processed foods and low in fiber, says Le Mire — not necessarily eggs. “If someone is concerned about cholesterol levels, they should first review their intake of highly processed foods and fiber,” she says.', 'If you don’t have eggs on hand or simply can’t — or don’t want — to eat them, you can use several egg alternatives.', 'Chia seeds. When mixed with water, chia seeds form a gel that acts as a binder similar to eggs in baked foods. For one large egg equivalent, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends mixing 1 tablespoon of chia seeds with 3 tablespoons of water and then letting it stand for five minutes.', 'Flax seeds. Like chia, flax seeds can be a substitute binding agent. Just add a tablespoon of ground flaxseed to 3 tablespoons of water. Let it thicken for five minutes and then use it to replace one large egg.', 'Tofu. Looking to whip up some breakfast? Try scrambling 2 ounces of cubed, firm tofu instead of a large egg. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends sprinkling the tofu scramble with nutritional yeast and a pinch of salt or pepper. You can even add a dash of turmeric to get that egg-like color.', 'Applesauce. If you’re baking, the best replacement for eggs is something that’s both moist and rich. Applesauce fits that bill. Or you can swap in a mashed banana, pureed avocado or silken tofu. Using ¼ cup of these plant-based ingredients can replace one large egg.']"
