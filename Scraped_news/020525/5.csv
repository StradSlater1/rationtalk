But Wright stressed that none of the funding was used to provide condoms in Gaza.', 'According to Wright “approximately 70%” of the $45m “was earmarked for Gaza and the rest for West Bank”.', 'The agency did provide $100,000 worth of male condoms to Gaza last year, Wright said, “but none of it was funded by the United States”.', 'So what was the money for? Wright says that it was used to equip “six maternity units for normal deliveries; 3 units for C-Sections; Caravans/prefabs for 40 safe spaces”, where survivors of sexual violence can receive medical referrals and counselling.', 'The grant was also intended to “support the expansion of mental health and psychosocial support services, as well as the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse”.', 'In addition, Wright explained, the US funds were intended to pay for “life-saving medicine and supplies to prevent maternal mortality, as well as 500,000 dignity kits with key hygiene and sanitation items; 30,000 Mama and Baby kits with essentials for new mothers and newborns, and menstrual health supplies”.', 'The agency is currently hoping to receive a humanitarian waiver from the state department to unfreeze the funds, “to enable us to continue our lifesaving work”.', 'Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told the Fox congressional correspondent Chad Pergram that she has “not made a final decision” on whether to vote for Tulsi Gabbard or Robert F Kennedy Jr but plans to watch video highlights of the confirmation hearings to inform her decisions. “I need to get the clips of both hearings of the parts that I missed” Collins said.', 'Given the great length of the hearings, many supporters and opponents of Trump’s cabinet picks are doing the same. But reactions to the clips on social media are a political Rorschach test.', 'To take one example, video of a fiery exchange between Kennedy and Bernie Sanders during a tense Senate health committee hearing on Thursday has been widely seen online, but with sharply different assessments of who won out.', '“In many ways, President Trump and Mr Kennedy have asked some of the right questions,” Sanders began. “Problem is their answer will only make a bad situation worse.”', 'The senator then pressed Kennedy to promise that, as health secretary, he would fight to guarantee health care to every American.', '“I’m going to make America healthier than other countries in the world right now — we’re the sickest” Kennedy said, before Sanders cut in to repeat his question.', 'Kennedy then pivoted, and addressing the senator as “Bernie”, accused him of “corruption” for supposedly “accepting millions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry”. Before Kennedy had even finished the prepared attack, his supporters in the room applauded.', 'Sanders, however, replied that the charge was false. “Oh no, no, no”, he said. “I ran for president, like you. I got millions and millions of contributions. They did not come from the executives; not one nickel of PAC money from the pharmaceutical industry. They came from workers”. Sanders supporters in the room clapped.', '“In 2020,” Kennedy insisted, “you were the single largest receiver of pharmaceutical money”.', '“Because I had small contributions from workers” employed by drug companies, Sanders interjected.', '“Bernie, you were the single largest receiver of pharmaceutical dollars” Kennedy insisted.', '“No, from workers in the industry” Sanders explained.', 'Video of the exchange, captioned, “RFK Jr. calls out Bernie Sanders direct to his face!” was enthusiastically shared by Kennedy supporter Elon Musk on his social media platform, racking up over 10 million views.', 'Supporters of Sanders on the same platform pointed out that he was correct that taking small-dollar donations from workers employed by drug companies was not the same as taking money “from the pharmaceutical industry”, but their comments were far less seen on the platform controlled by Musk.', 'The Congressional Black Caucus has denounced Donald Trump’s “racist” attempt to blame diversity for the midair collision between a US military helicopter and an American Airlines jet approaching Reagan National airport near Washington DC on Wednesday.', 'After expressing sympathy for the victims, and confidence in the ability of federal investigators to determine the cause of the accident, a statement from the caucus strongly criticized Trump’s response:', 'However, the opportunity to fully focus our sympathies on those who are in mourning and who may not have even retrieved their dearly departed was marred by a truly disgusting and disgraceful display of racist political prognostication. President Trump, without evidence or regard for the gravity and solemnity of this incident in which American lives were lost, held a press conference to falsely blame the diversity initiatives of past administrations for the cause of this incident. Not only are the President’s claims untrue, they also speak to the Republican Party’s desire to divide us as a country.', 'To be clear, diversity, equity, and inclusion are American values. Diversity policies work to benefit all Americans who have traditionally been kept out of opportunities, including white women, veterans, and aging Americans, not just the Black and minority communities that Trump and Republicans want to scapegoat and villainize for political gain. We are not going back!', 'Caucus chair Congresswoman Yvette D Clarke, a Democrat from Brooklyn, shared video of Trump’s remarks on Bluesky, with the comment: “While families grieve and our nation mourns the 67 victims of last night’s heartbreaking crash, Donald Trump and his cronies are already abusing this tragedy to further their racist, repugnant agenda”.', 'Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump just insisted that Egypt and Jordan, which have refused to cooperate with his proposal to “just clean out” the entire population of the besieged Gaza Strip, by resettling Palestinians in their countries, will eventually agree.', 'Asked if there is “anything you can do to make” President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and King Abdullah II of Jordan accept that population transfer, Trump replied: “They will do it. They will do it.”', '“What makes you say that?” the reporter asked.', '“They’re going to do it, OK?” Trump replied. “We do a lot for them, and they’re going to do it.”', 'Trump did not elaborate on what kind of pressure he plans to exert, but the recent freeze of US foreign aid made exceptions for military assistance to Israel – whose longstanding major arms packages from the US have expanded further since the Gaza war – and Egypt, which has received generous US defense funding since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.', 'Jordan, which also has a peace deal with Israel, and controlled the West Bank and East Jerusalem until they were seized by Israeli forces in 1967, is also a major recipient of US aid.', 'Trump’s first impeachment was over his demand that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “do us a favor” in return for military assistance.', 'Donald Trump has said the US will put a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, Reuters reports.', 'Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, reportedly said he would decide probably by tonight whether or not those tariffs would apply to oil.', 'Trump has previously pledged to sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products coming in to the US from Mexico and Canada, two of the country’s biggest trading partners.', 'Joining Democratic congressional leaders at the press conference, Altadena resident Jackie Jacobs described the moment she realized it was time to evacuate.', 'The 88-year-old said she received a message telling her and her husband to “get out” and they did just that, carrying with them only the clothes that they were wearing.', 'The Eaton fire tore through Altadena,a historically Black town in the San Gabriel Valley, claiming nearly every house on their street, including their home.', '“Everything now is in ashes,” she said.

He later testified after the chief US district judge in Washington authorized Patel to have limited immunity from prosecution, which forced his testimony.', 'Under oath and under close questioning from Senator Cory Booker, Patel clarified that while he had heard and witnessed Trump issue a declassification order for some documents, he did not actually know whether they applied to the documents the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago.', 'Booker is seizing on this to say Patel is happy to “lie” on behalf of Trump in public to support him, which he said was disqualifying. “He is refusing the transparency he claims to adhere to,” Booker adds.', 'House Democratic leaders on Thursday came to Altadena to survey the damage from the Eaton fire that burned through historically Black neighborhoods, vowing to fight for more federal aid without conditions.', '“There’s no Democratic way or Republican way to respond to a crisis in an extreme weather event like these horrific wildfires, there is an American way,” House leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said at a press conference after touring the devastation. “We want to make sure that Congress and the American people stand with the people of this amazing community.”', 'Donald Trump and Republicans have threatened to impose conditions on federal disaster aid for Los Angeles to rebuild after the wildfires, though on a visit to the region last week he told residents and officials: “We have to work together to get this really worked out.”', 'Led by congresswoman Judy Chu, who represents the fire victims of Altadena, Jeffries toured the area with House Democratic whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and House Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar of California.', 'House Democratic leaders are in Altadena today to tour the devastation from the fire.\n\n“We cannot condition any assistance to the people of Altadena, the people of Pasadena, the people of Los Angeles County, the people of California,” Jeffries said. pic.twitter.com/Me1IJbS0em', '“There is enough Fema money to last us up until March but we will need supplemental money, as has happened in every major disaster in this country,” Chu said, adding that it is unprecedented for Congress to attach partisan conditions to federal disaster aid.', 'Chu and Jeffries also warned that the Trump administration’s now-paused freeze on federal grant and loan funding threatened to impact communities like Altadena as they recover from disaster.', 'Jeffries added: “California has sent more money to the federal government year after year after year than they ever get back in return.

On Friday night, the Department of Justice moved to fire several senior FBI executives — including the head of the Washington field office. Additionally, DOJ is demanding a list of FBI personnel who investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.', 'What’s next? DOJ says the list will be reviewed “to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary” — raising the possibility that they’ll fire some or all of the thousands of FBI staff who worked on the January 6 investigation. Meanwhile, legal advisers are preparing to sue to block the firings if they go forward.', 'Is this normal? Absolutely not. I asked two scholars of FBI history if there was any precedent for this. Both said no. Agents can be fired for corruption or incompetence after a review, but a mass firing for participating in an investigation is unheard of, they said.', 'What’s the larger context? The firing of top officials could make the FBI less effective in critical areas such as counterterrorism. And mass firings of FBI staff involved in the January 6 investigation would serve as a warning to bureau employees about what happens if they investigate Trump’s political allies, corroding the independence the agency depends on to enforce federal law.', 'What’s the long-term fear? Both historians mentioned potential long-term fears for the rule of law — and for civil liberties — if Trump continues on this path. “This is what authoritarian secret service and intelligence operations look like,” Beverly Gage, a history professor at Yale University who wrote a book about the FBI, told me. “They are the security wing of one man, serving at his behest, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. … We’ve got a lot of battles ahead, but it is extremely bad news.”', 'As a reminder: Logging off doesn’t mean turning off your brain.

"DOJ Warned: Firing Of Prosecutors, FBI Agents Involved In Jan. 6 May Trigger Legal Action",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/doj-jan-6-firing-warning-legal-action_n_679a2affe4b0535cbc5fce98,"['', 'A group of attorneys have put the Justice Department “on notice,” warning that the continued firing of prosecutors or FBI agents could trigger swift legal action. In recent days, Trump appointees have begun terminating or threatening to terminate people who lawfully investigated Jan. 6 or President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home when he was under criminal indictment for allegedly illegally retaining classified documents.', 'Lawyers representing some of these now-former career officials said in a letter to deputy acting Attorney General Emil Bove that the firings that began last week may violate simple due process rights and that those targeted for termination are profoundly concerned that the Justice Department is now “planning to publicly disseminate the names of those employees they plan to or will actually be terminating, despite the risk of stigmatization.”', 'Attorney Mark Zaid and representatives of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, including the watchdog’s executive chair Norm Eisen and its board member and retired federal judge Nancy Gertner, wrote, “The continuation in this course of action is a direct assault on the national security of the American citizens you have sworn to faithfully and unselfishly serve.”', 'Last week, the FBI’s acting director Brian Driscoll informed staff at the bureau that Bove — who once represented Trump in his criminal cases — asked for a list of FBI agents or other employees who worked on Jan. 6 prosecutions. Bove said he would then “determine whether any additional personnel actions were necessary.”', 'A former U.S. attorney who investigated Jan. 6 said that they knew at least 25 of 30 agents who had been fired or transferred to another office, according to Politico. Meanwhile, at least six of the senior most leaders at the FBI were also pushed out, NBC News reported on Jan. 31. The Justice Department announced last week that over a dozen prosecutors who worked on criminal probes of Donald Trump under former special counsel Jack Smith were fired after being deemed unable to “faithfully implement” Trump’s agenda.', '“Given your significant role in prosecuting the president, I do not believe that the leadership of the department can trust you to assist in implementing the president’s agenda faithfully,” that firing memo said, according to The New York Times.', 'Over the weekend, Zaid, Eisen and Gertner, in a letter to Bove argued that the firings violate federal privacy laws, which already bar the disclosure of federal officials’ records without their consent.', '“As you well know, FBI agents routinely investigate violent and sophisticated criminals — many of whom are ultimately prosecuted and incarcerated, and harbor animosity toward law enforcement,” they wrote. “These agents include individuals with decades of sensitive experience at the FBI and public exposure of their identities would subject them to immediate risk of doxing, swatting, harassment or possibly worse.”', 'Indeed, they added, the prospect of this harm has already been “threatened by some who were convicted of crimes for their activities on Jan. 6, 2021.”', 'Trump pardoned or commuted over 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters, including those who were convicted of violent police assault or were convicted of engaging in a violent conspiracy to seditiously stop the nation’s transfer of power.', 'The lawyers for the fired prosecutors and agents say that, at a minimum, individuals who were let go should have been given a written proposal of “disciplinary action or termination” and then given a chance to respond and, if necessary — and at their own expense — find an attorney to appeal the decision.', '“If you proceed with terminations and/or public exposure of terminated employees’ identities, we stand ready to vindicate their rights through all available legal means,” the Feb. 2 letter to FBI acting director Driscoll, U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, and James McHenry, the acting attorney general, states.', 'When Trump was asked if he had a role in the firings at the DOJ and FBI, he said “no” but immediately followed it up with attacks on the agency and its staff, saying, “We have some very bad people over there.”', 'Trump added, “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing because they were very bad.”', 'The Justice Department memo penned by Bove last week echoed Trump’s sentiments. Bove characterized the Jan. 6 prosecutions as a “grave national injustice” and wrote: “I will not tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous Administration at any U.S. Attorney’s Office. Too much is at stake. In light of the foregoing, the appropriate course is to terminate these employees.”', 'Bove, the second highest-ranking legal official in the nation, said he intends to investigate how the Justice Department under the Biden administration tapped prosecutors to work the Jan. 6 cases through the department’s probationary hiring program.', 'In an email to HuffPost on Monday, Zaid said: “We are undertaking every effort to prevent these illegal purges but the reality is we are preparing more for the legal challenges to hold the government and its officials accountable for the destruction they are waging.”', ""By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Some were notified while Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the agency, sat answering questions from senators for his confirmation hearing Thursday.', 'Trump transition officials in recent months have signaled plans to push aside leaders promoted by former FBI Director Christopher Wray.', 'The leadership changes have drawn internal consternation, in part because these officials didn’t have anything to do with prosecutions of Donald Trump, which have been the focus of the president’s ire.', 'The personnel moves come as hundreds of FBI agents who were assigned to investigate the January 6 US Capitol attack and Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents are bracing for the possibility that they could be forced out or punished, similar to what has happened to dozens of career Justice Department lawyers.', 'The changes highlight how the new administration has moved quickly to deliver on Trump’s vow to strike back at so-called weaponization at the FBI. Trump has falsely accused agents of abuse in their court-ordered search of his Mar-a-Lago home and of their treatment of Capitol rioters.', 'Some agents say the criticism belies the fact that FBI agents and supervisors can’t choose which assignments they are given as part of their job. The FBI workforce is broadly conservative, and many agents initially had qualms about being assigned to the Capitol attack and Trump cases, viewing the prosecutions as heavy-handed, people familiar with the matter say. Some Justice Department lawyers leading January 6 cases complained that they believed agents sometimes slow-walked some of their work.', 'The FBI declined to comment.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nPeople on Kash Patel’s so-called ‘enemies list’ taking drastic steps for protection before his potential FBI takeover', 'The FBI Agents Association officials met with FBI director nominee Kash Patel in recent weeks to raise those concerns, urging him to protect agents who did their work investigating violent crimes with oversight from judges, FBI supervisors and Justice Department lawyers, according to people briefed on the meeting.

Trump administration was sued Tuesday in two separate civil complaints related to a request for information about FBI employees who worked on cases involving President Donald Trump and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and a third suit challenging the removal of data from federal health agency websites.', 'The lawsuits are the latest in a growing number of legal salvos seeking to block — or slow down — the rapid-fire series of executive actions Trump and his allies have taken since he returned to the White House on Jan. 20.', 'The three cases were filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.', 'The first case, a class-action complaint, was filed by a group of nine unidentified FBI agents and employees of the agency against the Department of Justice.', 'That suit seeks to block the publication or dissemination of information in surveys the plaintiffs or their supervisors have been ordered to fill out identifying “their specific role” in cases involving the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot criminal cases, and the criminal prosecution of Trump himself for retaining classified records after leaving the White House in early 2021.', 'The suit says the survey was issued “to identify agents to be terminated or to suffer adverse employment action.”', '“Upon returning to the Presidency, Mr. Trump has ordered the DOJ to conduct a review and purge of FBI personnel involved in these investigations and prosecutions,” the suit says.', '“This directive is unlawful and retaliatory, and violates the Civil Service Reform Act.”', 'The suit says the plaintiffs “reasonably fear that all or parts” of a list of FBI agents who worked on the Jan. 6 and Trump cases “might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution by the now-pardoned and at-large Jan. 6 convicted felons.”', 'The complaint says that some of the plaintiffs’ personal information “has already been posted by Jan. 6 convicted felons on ‘dark websites.’”', 'A second suit, filed by the FBI Agents Association and seven unnamed agents against the DOJ, also notes the survey requesting information about whether the agents worked on Jan. 6-related criminal investigations.', 'That complaint asks a judge to protect the plaintiffs “from Defendants’ anticipated retaliatory decision to expose their personal information for opprobrium and potential vigilante action by those who they were investigating.”', 'An attorney for the agents in the second suit, Chris Mattei of Koskoff, Koskoff and Bieder, said in a statement, “The DOJ’s plan to release the names of FBI agents who investigated January 6th is an appalling attack on non-partisan public servants who have dedicated their lives to protecting our communities and our nation.”', '“It is clear that the threatened disclosure is a prelude to an unlawful purge of the FBI solely driven by the Trump Administration’s vengeful and political motivations,”  said Mattei. “Releasing the names of these agents would ignite a firestorm of harassment towards them and their families and it must be stopped immediately.”', 'CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ on the suits.', 'The third lawsuit was filed by the advocacy group Doctors for America against the Office of Personnel Management, the Health and Human Services Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration.', 'That complaint challenges the abrupt removal Friday from CDC and FDA websites “a broad range of health-related data and other information.”', 'Zach Shelley, an attorney for Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is representing Doctors for America in the suit, told CNBC that “without the information that the CDC and these other agencies have taken down, more people are going to get sick, more people are going to suffer and more people are going to die.”', 'Shelley said that under the Trump administration, “agencies are taking action that undermines their stated mission.”', 'The suit says that data is regularly used by “health professionals to diagnose and treat patients and by researchers to advance public health, including through clinical trials meant to establish the safety and efficacy of medical products.”', 'The removal of the data came two days after Charles Ezell, OPM’s acting director, issued a memo that ordered federal agency heads to “terminate” programs “that promote or inculcate gender ideology” and remove all websites, social media accounts and other media that have that goal.', 'Ezell’s order came more than a week after Trump signed an executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”', 'The suit says that before that unannounced removal, the datasets had been on the websites for years.', 'Their removal “creates a dangerous gap in the scientific data available to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, deprives physicians of resources that guide clinical practice, and takes away key resources for communicating and engaging with patients,” the suit says.', 'The CDC removed web pages for its Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System, pages devoted to data on “Adolescent and School Health,” as well as pages for “The Social Vulnerability Index” and “The Environmental Justice Index,” according to the suit.', 'Also removed was a report and web pages related to HIV infections, the complaint says.', 'The FDA removed several pages, including one titled “Study of Sex Differences in the Clinical Evaluation\nof Medical Products,” and another titled “Diversity Action Plans to Improve Enrollment of\nParticipants from Underrepresented Populations in Clinical Studies.”', '“The decisions by CDC, FDA, and HHS to remove the webpages and datasets contradict their stated missions and are causing and will cause substantial harm to Plaintiff and its members, as well as other physicians, researchers, and patients who rely on the removed webpages and datasets,” the suit says.', 'Spokespeople for OPM, HHS and CDC declined to comment on the lawsuit.

On Friday, the Justice Department fired at least 30 federal prosecutors who worked on January 6 criminal cases. Meanwhile, thousands of FBI agents have been asked to fill out a survey by today detailing their role in probing the Capitol insurrection.', 'The Trump administration has also fired Rohit Chopra, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.', 'Meanwhile, the Education Department has placed on leave at least 55 employees who had attended diversity trainings during the first Trump administration.', 'Global stocks are tumbling after President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on goods from China. The White House said the tariffs are needed to hold the three countries “accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.” Trump is also threatening new tariffs on the European Union.', 'Economists have widely criticized the tariffs, which are expected to raise consumer prices. The Wall Street Journal published an editorial headlined “The Dumbest Trade War in History.” Mexico and Canada responded by issuing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. This is Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.', 'President Claudia Sheinbaum: “Mexico does not want confrontation. We start from the collaboration between neighboring countries. Mexico not only does not want fentanyl to reach the United States, but we do not want it to reach anywhere. Therefore, if the United States wants to fight criminal groups and wants us to do it jointly, we must work in an integral way.”', 'We will have more on the Trump tariffs after headlines.', 'The future of USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development, is in doubt after a dramatic weekend. The agency’s website has been down since Saturday, and workers have been told not to come to work today at the agency’s headquarters. On Saturday, USAID’s director of security and his deputy were placed on leave after they attempted to block Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing USAID’s classified systems.', 'New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote, “This is a five alarm fire. The people elected Donald Trump to be President — not Elon Musk. Having an unelected billionaire, with his own foreign debts and motives, raiding US classified information is a grave threat to national security. This should not be a partisan issue.”', 'On Sunday, Musk said, ”USAID is a criminal organization” and that it is “Time for it to die.” Musk also said Trump agrees that “we should shut it down.” Trump weighed in by claiming the aid agency is run by a “bunch of radical lunatics.” Doctors Without Borders warns the dismantling of the U.S. humanitarian aid system will cause an “unmitigated humanitarian disaster affecting millions of the world’s most vulnerable people.” We will have more on this story later in the show.', 'The top-ranking career U.S. Treasury Department official has been forced out of the agency after he resisted a demand by Elon Musk and his associates at DOGE to gain access to the government’s vast payment system, which disburses trillions of dollars in federal payments each year. Trump’s new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ended up giving Musk access to the system, which includes sensitive information about taxpayers, Social Security recipients and government contractors.', 'Musk is also accused of waging a takeover at the Office of Personnel Management, where career civil servants have been locked out of computer systems.', 'President Trump has reiterated his threat to retake the Panama Canal, hours after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama on his first foreign trip in his new post. According to the State Department, Rubio demanded “immediate changes” in Panama to reduce China’s influence in the country, including at the canal. Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino spoke on Sunday.', 'President José Raúl Mulino: “The sovereignty of Panama is not up for debate. That is very important. … There is no doubt that the canal is operated by our country, and it will continue to be so.”', 'President Trump has threatened to cut off funding to South Africa, the home country of Elon Musk. In a post online, Trump wrote, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.” Trump was referring to a land reform law in South Africa where the country’s white minority still owns the vast majority of farmland 30 years after the end of apartheid rule. South Africa’s Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources Gwede Mantashe responded to Trump’s threat earlier today.', 'Gwede Mantashe: “You passed an exploration act, therefore Trump will withhold funding to South Africa. And I said, ’Let’s mobilize Africa. Let’s withhold minerals to U.S.’ That is it. If they don’t give us money, let’s not give them minerals.”', 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has landed in Washington to meet with President Trump. It’s Netanyahu’s first trip to the United States since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him in November for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza.', 'Netanyahu’s trip comes just days after Hamas released three more hostages held in Gaza in exchange for 183 Palestinians jailed by Israel. The Palestinian Prisoners Society said many of the released Palestinians showed signs of torture and starvation.', 'Meanwhile, Arab foreign ministers have formally rejected calls by Trump to transfer Palestinians in Gaza to Egypt and Jordan. In a joint statement, the ministers wrote, “We affirm our rejection of [any attempts] to compromise Palestinians’ unalienable rights, whether through settlement activities, or evictions or annex of land or through vacating the land from its owners.”', 'Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an emergency U.N.

The hospital is suffering a major staffing shortage as nearly two years of civil war in Sudan has nearly decimated the health system.', 'In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least 773 people were killed over the past week after rebels seized the eastern city of Goma. Another 3,000 people have been wounded in Goma, according to Congo’s Health Ministry. Local health officials say morgues are filled beyond capacity and hospitals are overwhelmed. This is Abdou Rahmane Sidibé, a surgeon with the Red Cross in Goma.', 'Dr. Abdou Rahmane Sidibé: “We are generally used to treating gunshot wounds. These are entry-exit wounds that reach an organ or a limb. But in recent days, we have received many injuries, not only from bullets, because these are civilians who do not wear bulletproof vests. As a result, we have seen many abdominal injuries. In addition to that, we have received injuries caused by explosive devices. The use of explosives in a populated area has resulted in many injuries. These are complex wounds. The medical care is very difficult and complicated.”', 'Aid groups warn Goma’s population of more than 2 million people is at risk of “catastrophic” humanitarian consequences. There have also been widespread reports of rape by armed groups against women and girls.', 'The DRC has called for an arms embargo on Rwanda over its backing of M23 rebels, and for Rwanda to withdraw its troops from the region. The DRC is home to vast reserves of metals and rare minerals, which Rwanda, the U.S., China, Europe and Uganda have all exploited at the expense of the Congolese people.', 'U.S. Navy and Air Force warplanes carried out airstrikes on northern Somalia on Saturday targeting the Islamic State.

The U.S. also bombed northwest Syria on Thursday.', 'The Trump administration is preparing to end Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for over 300,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, as Trump escalates his crackdown on immigrants. The affected individuals were granted TPS status in 2023 and received an 18-month extension by the Biden administration, but the order seeks to end their protections just 60 days after the termination notice is published, a move that lawyers say is “plainly illegal.”', 'Meanwhile, Venezuela has reportedly agreed to accept deportation flights from the U.S. after talks with Trump envoy Richard Grenell, who met with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas Friday. Grenell returned to the U.S. from Caracas with six Americans who had been jailed in Venezuela.', 'In more immigration news, the Trump administration is seeking to access a database, maintained by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, with information on hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children. Rights advocates warn Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, could use the data to further its crackdown, separating more families and causing more harm to the children.', 'Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is visiting troops on the militarized southern border today. He posted ahead of his trip, ”POTUS wants 100% operational control of the border—and we will deliver. BORDER SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY.”', 'Major demonstrations have taken place across U.S. cities in recent days to protest the assault on immigrant communities. In Los Angeles, thousands of protesters rallied into the night Sunday, defying a heavy police presence. A group of demonstrators shut down the 101 freeway in downtown L.A. In Atlanta, thousands marched along Buford Highway on Saturday after ICE announced “targeted operations” in the city.', 'Here in New York, the NYU Langone Health hospital system has canceled appointments for some of its young transgender patients following Trump’s executive order that aims to cut off federal support for hospitals that provide gender-affirming care. Hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have also started canceling gender-affirming care for youth, including prescriptions and refills. But some doctors are standing up for their young patients. Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a pediatrician at University Hospital of Brooklyn, has told his patients, “I’m willing to go to jail to continue to provide your care.” In Washington, D.C., hundreds marched to Children’s National Hospital in solidarity with trans patients who lost their care.', 'The New York Times is reporting more than 8,000 government web pages across more than a dozen agencies have been taken down since Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrubbed pages containing health information related to LGBTQ care and to HIV. The State Department has deleted references to transgender travelers on its advisory page. The department has also stopped using the LGBTQI+ acronym; pages now just say ”LGB” to remove references to trans and intersex people.', 'Louisiana has indicted a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Louisiana patient online. An arrest warrant has been issued for Dr. Margaret Carpenter, as well as the mother of the patient, who was a minor, on a felony charge of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs. Under Louisiana’s abortion ban, Dr. Carpenter could face a 15-year prison sentence, $200,000 in fines and the loss of her medical license.

The Real Reason Trump’s Purge of Career DOJ Officials Should Alarm You,https://www.justsecurity.org/107110/trump-purge-justice-department/,"['by Sara Zdeb', 'January 30, 2025', '2020 presidential election, 2028 presidential election, Corruption, Democracy, Department of Justice (DOJ), election law, elections, Trump administration first term, Trump administration second term', '', '', 'Since taking office last week, the Trump administration has fired, demoted, and reassigned career investigators and prosecutors across the Department of Justice, moving rapidly to politicize an institution over which the president has reportedly said he has an “absolute right” to total control. Much has been said in recent days about the impact of these unprecedented personnel moves on the Department’s independence and continued ability to address urgent national security and public safety threats, not to mention the morale of its workforce. But the ouster of career Department officials creates another, more insidious potential threat: that Trump and his allies will use the Department to hold onto power in future election cycles, as they tried and failed to do in 2020.', 'As a former Senate investigator, I led the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies, including then-Acting Civil Division Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, to conscript the Department into helping overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Our investigation laid the groundwork for the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack’s (“January 6 Select Committee”) examination of the same misconduct, and was the first congressional inquiry to expose Trump’s repeated calls to Department leaders about the investigations he wanted them to conduct.', 'We also exposed Clark’s scheme to supplant then-Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and insert the Department in the appointment of swing state electors, along with other efforts by Trump and his allies to use the Department to overturn the election. By now, the ending of this chapter in the January 6 story is familiar: after Department leaders threatened mass resignations in a dramatic Oval Office meeting, Trump backed down from installing Clark as Acting Attorney General. As then-committee chair Dick Durbin said when we released our investigative findings, it was only because of “a number of upstanding Americans in the Department of Justice [that] Donald Trump was unable to bend the Department to his will.”', 'The Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation underscored a basic feature of the nation’s chief law enforcement agency: much of its work is guided by internal norms, not laws passed by Congress. These norms were put in place after Watergate to protect the Department’s independence from politics and ensure its decisions to investigate and prosecute are based only on the facts and the law. Oversight by Congress and independent Inspectors General can expose when the Department strays from its norms, but their implementation ultimately comes down to the principles of 115,000 individual Department employees.', 'One norm that is central to the Department’s independence is its longstanding policy restricting communications between Department officials and the White House about individual investigations, criminal prosecutions, and civil enforcement actions. This policy and a companion typically issued by the White House has been reaffirmed by Attorneys General and White House Counsels of both parties, and it’s designed to ensure that federal investigations and prosecutions are driven by facts, not politics. In 2020, these restrictions were flouted by high-ranking officials including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who repeatedly asked Department leaders to open criminal investigations of false election fraud claims.', 'The Department’s norms don’t just insulate law enforcement decisions from politics—they also insulate politics from inappropriate law enforcement. Federal prosecutors have a well-established, legitimate role in enforcing criminal laws passed by Congress, including laws that punish the corruption of government processes (think bribery and fraud) and electoral processes (think campaign finance violations and ballot fraud). Because of the sensitivity of these types of enforcement actions, Department policy typically requires agents and prosecutors to consult with the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section before initiating them. These consultation requirements help ensure the Department applies the same standards to similar cases, so a Republican politician is treated no differently than a Democratic politician who engaged in the same misconduct. More broadly, they help ensure the Department makes decisions to investigate and prosecute based on the facts and the law, not politics or other improper considerations.', 'Norms also play a critical role in ensuring the Department stays in its lane during elections. The Public Integrity Section’s Election Crimes Branch has explained in longstanding internal guidance that the Department’s role in election crime cases is limited, and that “the Department does not have a role in determining which candidate won a particular election, or whether another election should be held because of the impact of the alleged fraud on the election.” This guidance also recognizes that “the fact of a federal criminal investigation may itself become an issue in [an] election”—a reality that undoubtedly motivated Trump’s demand that Department leaders “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me.” For these reasons, internal policy makes clear that “the Department should not engage in overt criminal investigative measures in matters involving alleged ballot fraud until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded.”', 'Department officials deviated from this longstanding norm in 2020 at the encouragement of then-Attorney General William Barr. Days after the 2020 election, when claims of a stolen election were in full swing, Barr issued a memo that loosened the Department’s longstanding restrictions on taking overt investigative steps in election fraud matters until the election is certified. The memo reportedly prompted objections by current and former Department prosecutors and led the longtime career head of the Public Integrity Section’s Election Crimes Branch to resign his position. Over the objection of career officials in the Public Integrity Section, Barr simultaneously directed federal prosecutors to investigate certain election fraud claims, including debunked allegations that Georgia election workers had secretly tabulated suitcases full of fake ballots. At the time Georgia’s elections had not yet concluded, with runoff elections scheduled a month later on January 5, 2021.', 'The extent of the Department’s deviation from longstanding norms during this period has never been fully examined, in part because the Department refused to divulge details of its work in response to bipartisan questioning by Senate staff, and in part because of the January 6 Select Committee’s understandable focus on Barr’s ultimate conclusion that there was no election fraud sufficient to alter the outcome of the election. Barr’s memo was withdrawn in early 2021, but the fact he issued it in the first place, and the way it enabled investigations beyond what the Department historically permitted, underscores how precarious even longstanding norms can be depending on who leads the Department.', 'The ongoing purge of career officials should worry anyone who cares about keeping politics out of the Department and the Department out of the business of deciding elections. Since last Monday, the administration has fired, demoted, and reassigned career investigators and prosecutors across numerous Department offices and law enforcement components. Those impacted include senior leaders in the Department’s Criminal and National Security Divisions, at least a dozen career prosecutors previously assigned to Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigations, and senior career leaders of the Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, among others.', 'The mass firing of Special Counsel Smith’s team has gotten significant attention, and deservedly so, for the message it sends to any Department employee thinking of investigating or prosecuting misconduct involving the president. But Americans should be just as alarmed by the reassignment and demotion of Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer, whose obscure-outside-the-Beltway title and low profile belie his critical role in upholding the Department’s norms. Until this week, he served as the Department’s senior-most career official. For decades and across administrations of both parties, Mr. Weinsheimer and his predecessors in that role advised Department leaders on ethics and recusal requirements and the longstanding requirements that keep politics and other improper considerations out of the Department’s work.', 'Equally concerning is the reassignment and subsequent resignation of Corey Amundson, the longtime career head of the Department’s Public Integrity Section. That office’s apolitical career prosecutors play an indispensable role in ensuring politically sensitive cases are handled appropriately, and that the Department doesn’t overstep its role in election-related matters. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation revealed that in at least one instance, Mr. Amundson pushed to restrain the Department from inserting itself in a 2020 election-related investigation, warning that doing so “risks great damage to the Department’s reputation, including the possible appearance of being motivated by partisan concerns.”', 'The ousters of Mr. Weinsheimer and Mr. Amundson aren’t surprising, but they should alarm anyone who cares about the Department’s adherence to norms that uphold the rule of law. Of course, the Department’s norms aren’t just the province of high-ranking career officials—every investigator and lawyer must follow them, and the Department is filled with principled career and non-career employees at all levels who do. But the ongoing purge of the very officials responsible for policing those norms signals to the Department’s entire workforce that their jobs are at risk if they, too, prioritize rules that keep politics out of law enforcement.', 'In 2020, Trump tried and failed to use the Department to hold onto power. Although some Department officials strayed from certain norms, enough principled individuals took a stand when it mattered. He is now ousting the apolitical career officials responsible for ensuring the Department upholds its norms and traditions of independence. In doing so, he is laying the groundwork not only to use the Department for his own personal, political goals throughout his administration, but also to succeed in doing in the next election what he failed to do in 2020.', 'Editor’s note: This piece is part of the Collection: Just Security’s Coverage of the Trump Administration’s Executive Actions ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'by Konstantin F.

Trump and attorney general nominee Kash Patel have both disingenuously insisted they knew nothing about personnel changes at the bureau.', '“I wasn’t involved in that,” Trump told reporters. “I’ll have to see what is exactly going on after this is finished.”', '“All FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,” Patel said in sworn testimony at his Senate confirmation hearing.', 'Bove initially wanted FBI acting Director Brian Driscoll to provide a list of all those who had participated in the 1,000–plus individual cases. Driscoll was supposed to have been the acting assistant director, but an Inauguration Day White House press release mistakenly switched his name with that of the intended acting director, Robert Kissane, according to The Wall Street Journal. Rather than admit and correct the error, the White House let it stand.', 'As an acting director by accident, Driscoll’s position was precarious enough that he might have been expected to simply comply. But Driscoll was still a stand-up FBI agent by whatever title, and he refused. Bove sought to assemble his own list by sending out the survey.', '“We understand that this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts,” Driscoll said in a bureau-wide email. “I am one of those employees.”', 'The FBI Agents Association advised its members to comply and suggested a lawyerly reply to question #11.', '“The responses in this survey are provided based upon my current knowledge, information and belief.

I have been told I am ‘required to respond’ to this survey, without being afforded appropriate time to research my answers, speak with others, speak with counsel or other representation. I have not been advised if these answers are being provided for informational purposes, administrative inquiry, Security Division inquiry or criminal inquiry. I have not been advised of my rights in this matter. To the best of my ability and belief, I have performed my duties in accordance with the DIOG [FBI Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide], federal statutes and the Constitution of the United States and the matters I worked on were properly predicated under DIOG and were opened and investigated at the direction of the Department of Justice.”', 'One knowledgeable source says that some 1,500 agents played significant roles in the Jan. 6 investigation, with another 5,000 assigned lesser tasks.

They’re staring at their form and their computer saying, ‘Do I check this box? Do I not check this box?’” In its Feb. 2 email to its members about the 12-question survey, the FBI Agents Association noted, “Adding insult to injury is that four years ago today, we lost two incredible FBI agents, Daniel Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger, doing the meaningful, yet dangerous work that our members do every day.”', 'Alfin, 36 and, Schwartzenberger, a 43-year-old mother of two, were shot to death while serving a search warrant on a child porn suspect who opened fire with a high-powered rifle.', '“We remember how dark and tragic that day was.,” the email continued. “Today, we continue to remember and honor them, their families, friends, and colleagues. While it is nearly impossible to block out the noise right now, we are reminded that like Dan and Laura, we do the jobs we do because it is a calling to protect and serve—and that we believe in protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution of the United States.”', 'Special Correspondent', 'michael.daly@thedailybeast.com', 'Got a tip?

""Is anyone in DOJ or FBI really going to investigate that now?”', 'Stephen Gillers, a New York University professor of law emeritus and legal ethics expert, said Trump appears to be trying to achieve two goals: punishing his perceived enemies and deterring future criminal probes.', '“The motive is retribution,” Gillers said. “At the same time, he also warns others that they will suffer the same fate if they cross him. So a second motive is deterrence. What we have then is both revenge and behavior modification.” ', 'A spokesperson for the Justice Department, now run by an acting deputy attorney general appointed by Trump, declined to comment. ', 'Among those fired Monday were multiple career prosecutors who worked on the team of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump with mishandling classified documents and interfering in the 2020 election. They include Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Anne McNamara and Mary Dohrmann, an official familiar with the matter said.', 'Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to revamp the Justice Department and the FBI, accusing both of pursuing politically motivated “witch hunts” against him. Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland repeatedly said Trump’s own actions, not political bias, resulted in the criminal prosecutions.', 'Trump’s election victory suggested that voters still support him and his vows to shake up Washington. “The scales of justice will be rebalanced,” Trump said in his inaugural address last week. “The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.”', 'A former career Justice Department official who worked during Trump’s first term and asked not to be named, citing fears of retribution, said the firings were driven by revenge but were also strategic. ', '“He fired them out of anger and spite,” the former Justice Department official said. “He is trying to intimidate other officials in an effort to get them to submit to him personally rather than to their jobs and the Constitution.” ', 'A second former Justice Department official predicted that acts of retribution would continue if Kash Patel, Trump’s nominee, is confirmed as FBI director.', 'Patel, whose confirmation hearing is Thursday, has blamed career civil servants for being part of a “deep state” plot to undermine Trump’s presidency. Patel published a list of 50 people in a 2023 memoir who he said were members of the “executive branch deep state.” ', 'The second former Justice Department official said: “The firings are designed not just to punish these career officials who were simply doing their jobs, but to send a chilling and sinister message to other career employees that they better not stand in the way of people like Kash Patel who have vowed to target Trump’s political opponents.”', 'Last week, Justice Department officials reassigned four senior career prosecutors also involved in Trump investigations to a crackdown on sanctuary cities. The former officials warned that the loss of prosecutors with decades of experience will slow federal counterterrorism, criminal and cyber investigations and potentially put the public at risk.', 'The reassigned prosecutors were moved to a new Justice Department task force created last week that will investigate state or local officials who resist or fail to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts.', 'A third former Justice Department official said the demotions of the senior career prosecutors would weaken the department and the FBI.', '“Only a fool could think that introducing turmoil into — and removing expertise from — our national security mission is a good idea,” said the third former official, who also requested anonymity because of concerns about retribution.', 'George Toscas, a senior civil servant in the Justice Department’s National Security Division who was involved in the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s estate in Florida, in 2022, was reassigned to the sanctuary city task force last week, NBC News reported last week.', 'So was Eun Young Choi, a career prosecutor in the National Security Division, who helped convict Ross Ulbricht, a cryptocurrency backer who helped found Silk Road, a black market on the dark web that sold illegal drugs, The Washington Post reported.', 'During the 2024 campaign, Trump promised to pardon Ulbricht, a folk hero in the libertarian and crypto communities, if they supported him. On his first full day in office, Trump pardoned Ulbricht and denounced the federal prosecutors who convicted him.', '“The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me,” Trump wrote.   ', 'The second former Justice Department official said reassigning career prosecutors put the public at risk.  ', '“The senior career DOJ officials who have been targeted are in charge of investigating the most sensitive and complex national security threats facing the country — from active terrorist plots to Chinese cyberattacks,” the former official said. “They are extraordinary public servants who have devoted their professional lives to national security. There’s just no way to replace their decades of experience and leadership.”', 'Multiple Republicans in Congress, though, have said the Justice Department and the FBI need sweeping reform. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” last month that Patel “represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.” ', '“There are serious problems at the FBI,” Hagerty added. “The American public knows it.”', 'Timothy Naftali, a senior research scholar at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs and former director of the Nixon Presidential Library, said Trump’s victory in November is a sign of the support he still enjoys from voters. ', 'Naftali said Trump and President Richard Nixon are similar in that they both tend to view the world in terms of allies or enemies. He said Trump, though, has been far more successful than Nixon at convincing Americans that all of the investigations of his conduct have been improper. ', 'Until that public perception fades, Naftali said, Trump is likely to continue to openly retaliate.', '“He’s managed to convince people that the exercise of investigative powers against Donald J. Trump is always illegitimate,” Naftali said. “That’s amazing. That gives him latitude. That’s the era we are living in.”', 'David Rohde is the senior executive editor for national security at NBC News.

The precise number is unclear because the department did not release names, but the trial team consisted of at least 18 lawyers.', 'The justice department has gone through seismic change in the first days of Trump’s second term, with top officials demoted out of the deputy attorney general’s office and ousted from top positions in key components including the criminal, civil and national security divisions.', 'Once the wider purges are completed, the expectation is for lawyers loyal to Trump to be installed in the vacancies. They could end up serving there for years, putting their own stamp on the department and transforming its future legal ideology to be aligned with Trump’s agenda.', 'The personnel changes have come in waves: first it was the heads of the national security division and the public integrity section, which Trump has blamed for pushing to open the criminal cases into his mishandling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.', 'Sign up to This Week in Trumpland', 'A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration', '', 'Next have been the career lawyers in the deputy attorney general’s office, including the top non-political official Brad Weinsheimer, who had been appointed on an interim basis by Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, until it was made permanent by Trump’s last attorney general, Bill Barr.', 'But Weinsheimer had the misfortune to have been one of two people Trump’s lawyers met with in 2023, when they had tried and failed to get a meeting with the then attorney general, Merrick Garland, in an effort to stave off an indictment in the classified documents case.', 'The Trump White House then sent the memo to fire any remaining members of Smith’s team on Monday, a particularly aggressive move because they too were career prosecutors who in theory had civil service protections from being fired on political grounds.', 'In the weeks ahead, in another instance of the White House directing parts of the justice department, the fired special counsel prosecutors are expected to face bruising scrutiny in a politically charged investigation.', 'Trump last week signed an executive order tasking the attorney general to produce a report about “weaponization of the federal government” that is all but certain to encompass the special counsel cases and submit the findings to the deputy chief of staff for policy – at the White House.']"
