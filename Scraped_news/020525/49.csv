"Kevin Durant’s Contract, Salary, and Net Worth: Examining the Suns Star’s Deal Amid Trade Rumors",https://www.profootballnetwork.com/nba/kevin-durant-contract-salary-net-worth-phoenix-suns-stars-trade-rumors/,"['Kevin Durant’s legacy as one of the most dominant forces in NBA history is undeniable. From his days with the Oklahoma City Thunder to his championship runs with the Golden State Warriors, and more recently a failure with a super team with the Brooklyn Nets, Durant has consistently shown why he’s considered one of the game’s greatest players.', 'Now, as a member of the Phoenix Suns, Durant is helping lead a star-studded roster that has elevated the team to contender status in the Western Conference. But with the Suns dealing with a massive payroll, Durant’s contract and financial future are key to understanding the franchise’s outlook.', 'As trade rumors swirl, the question arises: How much is Durant making, and how does his financial situation impact the Suns as they build for the future?', 'Durant is currently signed to a four-year, $194.2 million contract extension he signed with the Nets in 2022; he was traded to the Suns during the 2022-23 season. The deal, which runs through the 2025-26 season, pays him an average annual salary of approximately $48.5 million, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league.', 'For the 2024-25 season, Durant is set to earn $51.179 million, and this contract is fully guaranteed, ensuring he’ll collect every penny regardless of any injuries or changes in performance. The Suns’ roster is filled with high-priced players like Bradley Beal and Devin Booker, and Durant’s deal places him among the highest earners in the league.', 'Despite some talk of potential trade rumors, his contract makes him a centerpiece for the Suns in their pursuit of an NBA title.', 'Durant’s presence is crucial as the Suns are under pressure to build a championship-winning squad. But with their hefty payroll, the team must balance star power with financial constraints to ensure their long-term success. His contract is a significant commitment, but his ability to deliver in clutch moments and perform at an elite level justifies the investment.', 'Over the course of his illustrious career, Durant has accumulated nearly $447.9 million in career earnings from NBA contracts alone, according to Basketball Reference. This figure reflects not only his on-court success but also his marketability and sustained excellence as one of the league’s most coveted superstars.', 'As of now, Durant’s net worth is estimated to be around $300 million, according to Sportskeeda. Durant has signed lucrative partnerships with major brands like Nike, which produces his signature line of sneakers, and other endorsements with companies such as Beats Electronic, American Airlines, FanDuel, and Panini.', 'His investments outside of basketball, including stakes in tech companies, sports teams, and media ventures, have also contributed to his ever-growing net worth.', 'Phoenix is currently dealing with an astronomical payroll due to the acquisition of Beal and the existing contracts of Booker and Durant. In fact, the 2024-25 Suns are the first NBA team to have a combined team salary and luxury tax exceeding $400 million.', 'This massive commitment to their star players has placed immense pressure on the Suns’ front office to build a championship-caliber team around them while managing a rapidly escalating payroll.', 'Fun Fact: For the 2024-25 season, the Suns will be paying Beal, Booker, and Durant more than the entire rosters of teams like the Charlotte Hornets ($159.5 million), Utah Jazz ($156.6 million), Orlando Magic ($151.5 million), and Detroit Pistons ($125.5 million).', 'With Durant playing a key role in the team’s future, his financial impact will be felt not just on the court but in the Suns’ long-term financial plans. Whether or not the Suns can balance their massive payroll and financial strategy while competing for titles remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Durant’s presence is worth every penny as the Suns continue to push for greatness in the NBA.', '']"

Warriors’ interest in Kevin Durant heats up — but not without competition,https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2025/2/4/24359050/warriors-trade-deadline-news-kevin-durant-steph-curry-draymond-green,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Warriors are looking to reunite Durant and Steph Curry in the Bay.', 'Rumors of Kevin Durant reuniting with Steph Curry in the Bay are heating up — but competition for Durant’s services is increasing by the hour.', 'Per an article in The Athletic by Sam Amick, Anthony Slater, and David Aldridge, Durant has been on several teams’ radar as the trade deadline approaches. The Golden State Warriors aren’t alone in their pursuit — reportedly, the Dallas Mavericks, who recently did the unthinkable by shipping off franchise cornerstone Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick, have also inquired about Durant, with the hopes of reuniting him with former Brooklyn Nets teammate Kyrie Irving.', '“League sources say the Dallas Mavericks, fresh off their Luka Dončić-for-Anthony Davis swap that sent shockwaves through the Association, have dreams of adding Durant to their Davis-Kyrie Irving-led group. While the likelihood of Dallas pulling this off now appears unlikely, the mere idea of Durant joining Dallas’ star-studded group sheds new light on the thinking of Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison after he was roundly ridiculed for the Dončić deal. Whether it’s Durant (now or later), or perhaps even the Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James in the summer if he were to decline his player option for next season, the 52-year-old Harrison appears to be targeting big-time stars with whom he’s very familiar from his past life as a top Nike executive. The goal, of course, is to win a championship as soon as possible.”', 'In addition to the Mavs, the Houston Rockets are also reportedly in the mix:', '“League sources say the Houston Rockets, whose longtime interest in the Suns’ Devin Booker is likely to be revisited before the deadline, are known to be contemplating a pursuit of Durant as well. While the Rockets (32-17) have not been interested in pursuing older stars like James Harden and Durant in the recent past, the impressive speed of their rebuild may have changed the internal equation on that front. They are currently third in the Western Conference, with every reason to believe a game-changing addition at the deadline might vault them into true title contender status.”', 'With the Phoenix Suns struggling to acquire Jimmy Butler — who is reportedly only interested in the Suns as a destination — due to Bradley Beal’s reticence to waive his no-trade clause, they are increasingly considering deals involving Durant as an alternative to landing Butler.', 'If the Warriors are to bring Durant back, it may come at a steep cost:', '“In exploratory conversations, the Warriors have only been met with an exorbitant asking price in theoretical structures — essentially everything of future value — considering the tricky spot the Suns seem to find themselves. League sources say four-time All-Star forward Draymond Green, who has an established relationship with fellow Michigan State alum and Suns owner Mat Ishbia, is among the Warriors players Phoenix is known to covet.”', 'On the surface, swapping Draymond Green for Durant sounds like a no-brainer. But Green is a franchise cornerstone who still has value on the defensive end. Curry may have a lot to say about parting with his longtime partner in crime, but having Durant as the replacement could more than sweeten the bitterness of Green’s potential departure.', 'The Suns are also reportedly interested in Jonathan Kuminga:', '“The Suns also have indicated a level of interest in fourth-year forward Jonathan Kuminga, a player the Warriors drafted seventh overall in 2021, have been protective of in most trade discussions for years and still view as part of the future. But Durant’s potential availability, and this once-unthinkable notion of him reuniting with the franchise he helped lead to two titles, has a way of altering the discussion.”', 'While a potential three-team trade involving the Miami Heat is also being floated, with Andrew Wiggins potentially being shipped off to the Heat in such a scenario:', 'Kuminga will be a restricted free agent this summer and is searching for an annual salary upwards of $30 million. Both the Warriors and Suns have cluttered salary structures, but both ownership groups have shown a willingness to pay up for players they desire. The Warriors also have a potential path to help guide Butler to Phoenix, if they pull the trigger on an Andrew Wiggins-centric trade with Miami that has been discussed.', 'Whatever the case, bringing Durant back to Golden State will not be without its compromises and sacrifices. But if the goal was to help Curry acquire scoring support, the Warriors might as well target arguably the greatest scorer of all time — one who is quite familiar with Curry’s tendencies and Steve Kerr’s intricate offense.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

But so did the idea of the Dallas Mavericks sending Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, as did the idea of De'Aaron Fox and Zach LaVine being involved in the same trade — and not being directly traded for each other, at that. Anything can happen in this sport — literally, anything."", 'Here are three ideal trade destinations for Durant.', ""Bet you didn't expect the Heat to be one of the teams. Jimmy Butler wants a new home, and the Heat want to find him one. To date, though, they're still together, and chances are the Heat will get underwhelming trade offers for Butler. Instead, how about the Heat trade for Durant, attempting a last-ditch run at a championship?"", ""Miami could send Nikola Jović, Kel'el Ware, Duncan Robinson, Terry Rozier and two future first-round draft picks to Phoenix for Durant and cash considerations. The Suns get two compelling players on rookie deals in Jovic and Ware, future draft capital and potentially more picks by rerouting Robinson and/or Rozier."", ""Durant would be quite the upgrade for a team that has dipped its toes into the star trade waters but come up short of late (e.g. Damian Lillard in 2023). Durant, Butler, first-time All-Star Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo would form an overwhelming quartet of players who can handle the rock, with the bulk of that group being able to consistently score in isolation and carry a substantial scoring burden. It's also a group of players with a plethora of postseason experience. "", ""That said, the Heat may prefer to just let the light go out on the Butler era, and the Suns may prefer a trove of future first-rounders over multiple young players who have already shown what they're capable of. Plus, having to emphasize the dollar signs to make this trade work could make executing the trade as stressful as negotiating it."", ""What's better than a team making a blockbuster trade? A team making two blockbuster trades in a span of four days, of course! Victor Wembanyama is a one-of-one, and he's now paired with an All-Star-caliber point guard and a dynamite scorer in Fox. Throw Durant in-between the two stars, and the Spurs have an elite scoring trio with three players who can score in a variety of ways. What would be unique about this trio is that it's three players at vastly different career points; Durant is 36, Fox is just entering his prime and Wembanyama is only 21."", ""San Antonio could send Devin Vassell, Keldon Johnson, Blake Wesley, two future unprotected first-rounders and two second-rounders to Phoenix for Durant. The Suns get two immediate starters with an upward trajectory, a former first-rounder in Wesley and respectable draft capital on top of it. In the aftermath of this move, the Spurs still have the emerging Stephon Castle and Julian Champagnie and scrappy Jeremy Sochan, among others. San Antonio's theoretical Big 3 would be surrounded by young, developing scorers. Following the trade deadline, the Spurs could raid the buyout market, adding veterans to further supplement a young core."", 'What could stop this trade from taking place, though, is the Spurs feeling they need to take a breather after swinging a blockbuster deal for Fox and preferring to trade away their depth for a player in their late 20s, as opposed to someone who, while still sensational, is likely within five years of retirement in Durant.', ""The Rockets have been stockpiling ammunition to acquire a player like Durant, who doesn't play his age. This is an opportunity for Houston to strike. Houston could send Reed Sheppard, Jabari Smith Jr., Dillon Brooks and three unprotected first-rounders to Phoenix for Durant. The Suns get two former No. 3 overall picks in Sheppard and Smith, much-needed draft capital, and they could attempt to flip Brooks for more value."", ""It's an absolute haul for the Rockets to give up, but the time is now for a squad that's the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference. In the aforementioned trade proposal, the Rockets move on from a handful of players whose long-term roles in Houston are murky, specifically Sheppard and Smith. Plus, they would still have a healthy amount of depth for the short term and plenty of assets to make another impact move in the offseason or ones that follow."", ""Upon arrival, Durant becomes the focal point of the Rockets' offense, taking some attention off Alperen Sengun and Jalen Green. He gives an offense that, while respectable, needs some oomph. Outside of acclimation with his new teammates, Durant's game doesn't have to change with the Rockets. He can operate with the ball in crunch time, play to his strengths and be the veteran enhancement for a team that's ready to be a perennial contender. Moreover, Green can play with aggression off the dribble, which is where he's at his best, without burdening the bulk of the scoring load out on the perimeter."", ""Durant can also be a mentor for Amen Thompson, a fellow forward with a noticeable wingspan; Fred VanVleet can still serve as a composed floor general; Tari Eason can continue to progress; and any depth that's still needed can come on the buyout market. Durant makes the Rockets a legitimate NBA contender over the next two years and provides head coach Ime Udoka with rotation clarity."", 'Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

As good of a coach as Vrabel was/is, Titans fans continuously got frustrated with him for hiring his coaching staff from a network of people he had an existing working relationship with. It’s not uncommon for coaches to hire people they know well. We see it almost every time a new head coach is hired. But over time, it became Vrabel\'s most toxic trait. His kryptonite, despite a stellar resume. He gave jobs to coaches that were not qualified for them and he didn’t know when to let guys go. Vrabel is now bringing the ""buddy hire"" philosophy with him to New England. The Patriots have already hired a number of Vrabel\'s old staff members from Tennessee, but none of them are more eye-opening than Todd Downing. Downing was hired by the Patriots on Monday to be the new wide receivers coach under OC Josh McDaniels. Downing spent two seasons as Tennessee’s tight ends coach before being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2021. Vrabel had made a habit of promoting his offensive coordinators from that same role. Downing\'s tenure as OC was a massive failure. The Titans offense plummeted from a top-five unit to the 17th-highest-scoring offense in two years. They floundered despite Ryan Tannehill, Derrick Henry and other key offensive play makers staying put after Arthur Smith\'s departure. In November 2022, Downing was at the center of controversy and made headlines for getting a DUI after drinking on the team plane. He was not fired by the team after the incident, but he was let go at the end of the season and later took a job with the New York Jets. Hiring Downing as a wide receivers coach isn\'t guaranteed to lead to failure for the Mike Vrabel Era in New England. Vrabel could have a lot more success with the Patriots then he did in Tennessee. Downing isn\'t necessarily a bad hire, he was always a well-respected position coach. However, Vrabel is already heading down a slippery slope that Titans fans are all too familiar with. It doesn’t seem like he has learned much from his first stint as an NFL head coach. The grass is not always greener and the jury is still out on Brian Callahan, but Titans fans are happy to be done with the headache that is Vrabel\'s hiring tendencies.', 'Since his acquisition by Kent Hughes and the Montreal Canadiens at the end of summer 2024, Patrik Laine\'s name has been the subject of much discussion.

This week is no exception, but unfortunately, this time, it\'s for less favorable reasons. It started Monday morning with a strong outburst from Gilbert Delorme. And it continued during Tony Marinaro\'s show, still on the BPM Sports airwaves. Tony Marinaro believes it will likely be the end of Patrik Laine with the Montreal Canadiens by the summer of 2026 He also called the Finnish forward ""lazy."" It\'s hard to argue with that.

That\'s why this second overall pick in the draft is now on his third team in the League. ""It ended badly with the first two and their coaches.. ""If I had to predict today, Patrik Laine would not be returning to the Canadiens at the end of his contract."" - Tony Marinato See the clip in question: You can guess that it continues to spark many reactions.', 'Ahead of the Super Bowl, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler of ESPN revealed that he\'d ""bet"" Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce will continue playing beyond the matchup versus the Philadelphia Eagles. Kelce directly addressed the subject while speaking with reporters on Monday night. ""I\'ve thought about it, but I still love what I do,"" Kelce explained, as shared by Kevin Patra of the NFL\'s website. ""It\'s moments like these, weeks like these, the month that we just had in the playoffs that make me feel like I could play this game forever. I think I still got a lot of football left in me. I think this year has been one of the most special years of my life. I think it\'s gonna continue to make me want to do more in the football world."" Kelce acknowledged in the fall of 2023 that he had thought about retirement ""more than anyone could ever imagine"" amid his ongoing relationship with entertainment superstar Taylor Swift. However, the 35-year-old then repeatedly said before the start of this season that he still enjoyed being an active player even though he\'s a three-time Super Bowl champion who has nothing left to prove regarding his Hall of Fame resume. Kelce signed a new two-year contract last spring and then suggested he wants to match basketball legend Michael Jordan by earning six career championship rings before he rides off into the sunset. On Monday night, Kelce hinted he could still be playing at the highest level three years down the road. ""I love doing this,"" Kelce continued. ""I love coming into work every day. I feel like I still got a lot of good football left in me. We\'ll see what happens. I know I\'ve been setting myself up for other opportunities in my life. That\'s always been the goal, knowing that football only lasts for so long. You\'ve got to find a way to get into another career, another profession. I\'ve been doing that in my offseasons. But for the most part, I\'m planning on being a Kansas City Chief and playing football."" Per ESPN stats, Kelce led the Chiefs for the 2024 regular season with 97 receptions, 133 targets and 823 receiving yards. Across a pair of January playoff wins, he tallied a total of nine catches for 136 yards and a touchdown. Such stats seem to show he can still offer plenty for a franchise that should remain a Super Bowl contender for the foreseeable future with an in-his-prime Patrick Mahomes leading the charge.', 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.

Only then did he learn that the Mavericks had just stunned the sports world by trading him to the Los Angeles Lakers.', '""You can imagine how surprised I was,"" Doncic said. ""I had to check if it was April 1. I didn\'t really believe it.""', ""The superstar has begun to recover from that shock after his first two days in L.A., and he's growing increasingly excited about a new chapter with LeBron James and his famed new team on the West Coast."", ""And while his past and future teammates say Doncic has never lacked motivation to be great, he now has all the fuel he'll ever need after the Mavericks inherently questioned his talent and determination by making the seismic trade."", '""It was a big shock,"" Doncic said. ""[Dallas] was home, so it was really hard moments for me. ... [But now] I get to play in the greatest club in the world, and I\'m excited for this new journey.', '""... I would say I always take the high road. I had my amazing moments in Dallas with all my teammates, coaches and most importantly the fans. They always supported me, and it was an amazing journey.""', 'The Lakers formally welcomed Doncic on Tuesday, less than three days after they traded Anthony Davis and Max Christie in a three-team deal for the Slovenian scorer who won his first scoring title last season before leading the Mavs to the NBA Finals. Doncic is a five-time All-NBA selection and a five-time All-Star.', ""Stars of Doncic's age and accomplishments are almost never traded in any sport, and particularly not in such an abrupt manner. But when Dallas decided to move on from its 25-year-old centerpiece, the Lakers eagerly gave up Davis -- one of basketball's best big men -- to make it happen."", 'Doncic is still processing the upheaval, but he already is seeing the limitless upside of a career in Los Angeles that will begin alongside James, 40, the top scorer in NBA history.', '""Honestly, it was hard at first,"" Doncic said. ""That first day was really hard. I felt like these last 48 hours was one month. Emotionally, it was really hard, but today was much better. This is the Lakers. It\'s one of the best clubs in history, so I\'m excited to be here.""', ""Had Doncic stayed in Dallas, he was eligible for a five-year, $345 million supermax deal from the Mavericks.

In his typically florid style of discourse, Pelinka said Doncic\'s arrival would bring ""basketball joy to the world.""', '""I think Luka Doncic joining forces with the Los Angeles Lakers is a seismic event in NBA history."" Pelinka said. ""... We have a 25-year-old global superstar that is going to get on the stage of the most popular and influential basketball brand on the globe. And I think when those two powerful forces get together, it brings basketball joy to the world because that\'s how Luka plays. He plays with joy.""', 'Although James was blindsided by the deal along with the rest of the NBA, he quickly made a call to Doncic to welcome him to the Lakers. Doncic has often described James as his idol.', '""It\'s just like a dream come true,"" Doncic said. ""I always looked up to him. There\'s so many things I can learn from him, and I\'m just excited to learn everything and get to play with him. It\'s an amazing feeling.""', ""Doncic hasn't played since Christmas because of a calf strain, but he is close to a return. He will participate in 5-on-5 work at practice Wednesday, and the Lakers will make a plan for Doncic's debut afterward."", 'The Lakers have four games in the Los Angeles area in the next seven days, with a road game against the Clippers on Tuesday night followed by three straight home games.', 'The trade caused an uproar in the sports world, leaving most Mavs fans furious -- including Doncic\'s father, Sasa, who said his son ""absolutely did not deserve this.""', 'The basketball world also was baffled by how quiet the Lakers and Mavericks kept the talks.

There\'s a lot more digging somebody\'s got to do to find out why he got traded. You don\'t just trade him at 25. He just went to the Finals. I feel bad for Luka, man.""', 'The Utah Jazz helped to facilitate the trade and will get Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round draft pick via the Clippers from the Lakers. Dallas also is sending a 2025 second-round selection to Utah.', ""The Lakers acquired Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris from Dallas in the trade. Both praised Doncic's work ethic and leadership -- and both laughed at the widespread notion the Mavs were irredeemably concerned about Doncic's conditioning and work ethic."", '""I hear the stuff about him not being in shape, but if you can go in an NBA game and get 30 and 15 and 10 like it\'s nothing, then I don\'t really know what shape is,"" Morris said. ""You\'re going to see it really soon. You\'ll make the [determination] if he\'s in shape or not.""', 'Morris returns to the Lakers after winning a championship ring with the team in the Florida bubble in 2020. He said the Mavs informed him he had been traded Saturday night, but not where he was going -- he learned that on television and social media.', 'Kleber is on crutches after having surgery on his broken right foot. The German veteran -- best known in L.A. for hitting a particularly spectacular 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat the Lakers in March 2023 -- says he will be reevaluated in eight weeks, hopefully allowing him to return around the postseason.', '""I don\'t know if a guy like Luka needs extra motivation, because I\'ve seen him work, and how competitive he is over the years,"" Kleber said.

We’ve seen De’Aaron Fox push his way to San Antonio to team up with Victor Wembanyama. We’ve even seen a Caleb Martin for Quentin Grimes deal.', 'There will be more before the 2025 NBA Trade Deadline on Thursday, Feb. 6, at 3 p.m. Eastern. What follows is all the latest news, notes and rumors heading into that deadline. It will be updated as news and rumors break between now and then, so check back often for the latest.', 'In what has been one of the wildest roller coasters of an NBA trade deadline we’ve ever seen, of course Kevin Durant getting traded out of Phoenix appears to be picking up momentum.', 'Phoenix — which continues to try to land Jimmy Butler but appears to realize the futility of that effort because there is no third team to take Bradley Beal — has started to listen to offers for Durant. It’s a complete 180-degree pivot from where they were days ago. But it’s not even the strangest part of all this, check out this post from the well-connected John Gambadoro of 98.7 Arizona Sports radio:', 'The KD to Golden State has taken on a life of its own in the last 24 hours. Look I do not know for sure so not reporting. I did talk to several teams today that heard the same thing. One told me ""He will most likely end up in Golden State with Butler to Phoenix"" Will keep digging', 'Jake Fischer at The Stein Line is reporting the same thing — Durant chatter is up because it “appears to be the only way for Phoenix to acquire Miami’s Jimmy Butler before Thursday’s deadline.”', 'In what world does trading away Kevin Durant to bring in Jimmy Butler make any sense for Phoenix? At all.', 'Sending out Beal and filling that spot with Butler undeniably makes the Suns better (we can debate how much, but it’s an upgrade). If Phoenix trades Durant, the only logical move is to pivot to a rebuild around Devin Booker — and land enough picks and young players in that trade to jumpstart the rebuild process.', 'But this has been a wild trade deadline, so we’re not ruling anything out completely.', 'Just 72 hours ago, it seemed a lock that Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic would be out of Chicago before the deadline. That is true for LaVine, who is now in Sacramento with his old Bulls’ teammate DeMar DeRozan trying to lift the Kings into the playoffs.', 'Vucevic, however, may be a Bull past the Feb. 6 deadline after two deals for the big man fell through on Tuesday, reports Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times. He adds that the Bulls are now preparing to have him around past the deadline.', 'Things change fast in the 36 hours before the deadline, but it may not be fast enough for Vucevic.', 'Khris Middleton is out, and Kyle Kuzma is in for Milwaukee? Jusuf Nurkic is out, and Jonas Valanciunas is in for Phoenix?', 'Those deals are getting close, reports long-time NBA scribe Steve Bulpett at Heavy.com. The rebuilding Wizards will pull the trigger if the draft compensation coming back makes it worth their while.', 'Milwaukee wanted to be aggressive heading into the trade deadline, looking for an upgrade and moving on from Middleton — who had surgery on both ankles this offseason and has looked a step slower to the naked eye — but is Kuzma that guy? The Bucks would be banking on the guy who picked up a ring in the bubble with the Lakers to return closer to that form than the guy shooting 28% from 3 this season, scoring seven fewer points a game than he did a season ago.', 'Phoenix wants to get Nurkic out the door — he was moved to the bench last month because Nick Richards is the starting five now — and this trade brings Valanciunas in as a solid reserve big. The Wizards have had a lot of interest in Valanciunas in recent weeks.', 'This isn’t a surprise, but we should make it all-but official:', 'Bradly Beal is going to be with the Phoenix Suns after the trade deadline. That was obvious for a few reasons, starting with Beal has a no-trade clause, so he completely controls the process (also, there is no market for him). But if you wanted confirmation, there is this from The Athletic.', 'A league source close to Beal reiterated on Tuesday that there are currently no talks about him waiving the clause, and that he expects to remain in Phoenix through the deadline.', 'KJ Martin, who has been out since Dec. 23 due to a foot injury, is being held out Tuesday night 76ers game because he is on the verge of being traded, something reported by several people around the Sixers including Kyle Neubeck of PHLY Sports.', 'The Sixers are updating KJ Martin to OUT, with a trade pending, source tells me. More to come', 'The 76ers are reportedly looking at multiple trade options for Martin, but all of them largely a salary dump move that does not bring a player back to the Sixers, a league source told NBC Sports. Martin is a 6\'6"" wing who has averaged 6.4 points a game coming off the bench in the 24 games before his injury. He can help multiple teams and is making just under $8 million this season and is under contract for basically the same amount next season.', 'KJ will be the second Martin Philly has traded, they also moved Cody Martin to Dallas for Quentin Grimes.', 'And the Kevin Durant chatter just gets louder and louder... and now Jimmy Butler is even getting dragged into it.', 'Golden State’s interest in re-uniting with Durant is well known — the Warriors are desperately looking for a star shot creator to pair with Stephen Curry, and dancing again with Durant is on the table — but Dallas and Houston also are showing levels of interest, reports The Athletic’s Sam Amick, David Aldridge and Anthony Slater.', 'Dallas getting in the mix after trading away Luka Doncic — for 50 cents on the dollar — is an unexpected twist, and would be difficult for them to pull off because they don’t have a lot of tradable players and picks left. Durant makes $51.2 million, and since Dallas can’t or won’t trade Kyrie Irving, just-acquired Anthony Davis, or P.J. Washington, it becomes a difficult-to-construct five-for-one or worse trade that likely has to drag a third team into the mix.', 'Houston’s GM Rafael Stone has said in the run-up to the deadline that he wants to see what this roster — with its young players — can do in the playoffs before making a move, but Durant could change that dynamic. The Rockets have the players to make the trade with a package based around the expiring Fred VanVleet and a bunch of picks, but that only works if Phoenix wants to totally rebuild. Which it seems like they do not.', 'That same Athletic reports suggest a possible three-team arrangement where Jimmy Butler gets his wish to go to Phoenix, Durant heads to Golden State, and an Andrew Wiggins-based trade package heads to Miami. The question for Phoenix is, why? Swapping out Durant for Butler to play with Bradley Beal and Devin Booker does not make the Suns better, why would they do that? Better to blow the whole thing up and rebuild.', 'It’s all still a long shot, but momentum toward a Durant trade continues to build.', 'Lonzo Ball is more than just one of the best stories of the season, he has returned to being the kind of player every team needs — a solid backup point guard. He’s averaging 7.2 points and 3.5 assists a night, playing 20-25 minutes a night off the bench (although he isn’t playing back-to-backs).', 'That has led to a number of teams calling about him, reports Marc Stein. Ball is on an expiring $21.4 million contract, but the Bulls are likely to keep him on the roster past the deadline and try to re-sign him this summer, according to the report. Of course, if you’re trying to get teams to offer more for a player, that’s exactly what you would leak.', 'Just know that after more than 1,000 days away from the game and three knee surgeries, Lonzo is back and will get another contract this summer.', 'Phoenix went into this trade season looking to land Jimmy Butler and put him alongside Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, but that appears less likely with each passing minute (more on the Heat below; keep reading), so the Suns may pivot.', 'Talk about the Suns trading Kevin Durant, likely to the Golden State Warriors, is getting a lot louder, with league sources confirming to NBC Sports that there are ongoing talks. I’m not the only person reporting this chatter is getting louder.', 'That’s not to say it will happen — would Durant be okay with this? — but the Warriors have called everyone and anyone looking to find a star to put next to Curry, and the Suns didn’t hang up on the call.', 'It’s still highly unlikely the Suns will trade Durant. Phoenix’s preference would remain to find a new home for Bradley Beal, which would allow them to complete a Butler trade. However, that seems less and less realistic. If so, would Phoenix consider a serious pivot? Just keep an eye on the situation.', 'The Lakers were looking for depth at center before they traded their best defender and only quality rim protector to Dallas for Luka Doncic. That has only upped the pressure on Lakers GM Rob Pelinka to find a new center, but he said riding the long-term fit next to Doncic (and LeBron James) could come this summer.', '“We know we have a need for a big,” Pelinka said Tuesday at Doncic’s press conference. “The market for bigs right now, leading into the last two or three days of the trade deadline, is very dry. There’s just not a lot available. So maybe we’ll be able to do some stuff around the margins. I would say, in terms of a big move for that position, it’s probably more realistic that that would be something that comes in the off-season.”', 'Interesting note from David Aldridge and Josh Robbins at The Athletic: The Wizards and Bucks have at least talked about a Kyle Kuzma trade sending Khris Middleton to Washington.', 'Two league sources said the Wizards and Milwaukee Bucks have explored a potential deal in which Milwaukee would send Khris Middleton and draft capital to Washington for Kuzma. This matches what was reported elsewhere on Monday. Exchanging Middleton’s salary for Kuzma’s would help the Bucks move under the second apron, a significant goal for the Bucks.', 'Take that with a grain of salt, but Washington wants out of the Kuzma business and the Bucks might bet he can be an upgrade over the current version of Middleton.', 'Rumors of the Nuggets trying to upgrade by moving on from Michael Porter Jr. have been going around, but Nuggets coach Michael Malone shot that down Monday night. Here’s his response, via ESPN, when asked if he talked to MPJ about his name being trade rumors.', '“No because we’re not trading Michael Porter,” Malone said. “So I’m not touching base with anybody on that. ... And if there’s something coming, obviously [Nuggets GM Calvin Booth] will talk with me and I’m sure we’ll communicate with whatever players. But Michael is a really important piece, he helped us win a championship.”', 'Jimmy Butler isn’t Kevin Durant. On a lot of levels. But particularly in regards to this trade deadline, where if the Suns choose to pivot away from trying to land Butler they can quickly have teams lined up to talk about Durant. Along those same lines, Jimmy Butler isn’t like Luka Doncic, where there would have been an overwhelming level of interest in a trade for the 25-year-old if Mavericks GM Nico Harrison had opened up bidding.', 'Outside of Phoenix, there is not much interest in trading for Butler, Tim Bontemps notes at ESPN. That’s not for a lack of effort by Miami to find trade partner — and both the Suns and Heat have looked at four- and five-team trades — but there is not a pent-up Butler market waiting to break out. A big part of that is Butler can opt out of the $52.4 million he is owed next season and become a free agent next summer, and he has made it clear he wants to get to Phoenix (where he believes owner Mat Ishbia will pay him). Plus, Butler is 35, has seen his game take a step back this season, has a long injury history, and wants to get paid with at least two new years at a high number on this contract.', 'The question the Suns may need to ask themselves: What do we do with Butler if we can’t trade him before the deadline?', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Kevin Durant Trade Rumors: Odds For Phoenix Suns All-Star To Be Traded,https://www.betarizona.com/nba/kevin-durant-trade-rumors,"['It’s been nearly two years to the day that the Phoenix Suns sent shockwaves across the NBA and Arizona sports betting, trading a slew of talent to the Brooklyn Nets for the rights to 14-time All-Star forward Kevin Durant, with the Western Conference franchise still looking for the returns they expected from that windfall.  ', 'In the 122 games that Durant’s suited up for the Suns, the club’s fallen in the Western Conference semifinals and the first round of the NBA Playoffs, with two head coaches (Monty Williams and Frank Vogel) coming and going during that stretch.  ', 'This season, first year head coach Mike Budenholzer has the Suns at 25-24 (.510) and in the 10th and final spot for the play-in round of the sport’s postseason, begging the question of whether GM James Jones will opt to blow things up and part ways with the team’s superstar forward.  ', 'With that in mind, BetArizona.com broke down some hypothetical odds on where KD will be playing once the NBA’s trade deadline passes on Thursday afternoon, with the Suns still sitting as an overwhelming favorite to keep the future Hall of Famer ... right now.

The entire basketball world is still in shock over Luka Doncic getting shipped to the Lakers. ', ""Following that, De'Aaron Fox to the Spurs, which under any set of normal circumstances would me a huge story, feels like a blip on the radar. It isn't. Pairing Fox with Victor Wembanyama is a monster move. "", ""And hey, by extension the Bulls finally got rid of Zach LaVine! He lands in Sacramento, reunited with DeMar DeRozan. It's not nothing, but LaVine to the Warriors, which was being strongly rumored, would've been a sexier deal. "", 'Speaking of the Warriors, what will they do, if anything? How will the Jimmy Butler saga end? Or will it? It remains a possibility that Pat Riley sticks it to him because nobody can present an attractive enough offer and makes him, heaven forbid, stay in Miami. ', ""With that, let's get to a few bold trade deadline predictions, with the understanding that it will be impossible to be bolder than the reality we all just watched get warped by the Mavericks and Lakers. "", ""Maybe I'm just hoping here because I'm a Northern California native with long Warriors ties and am beyond desperate to keep the Stephen Curry championship-contention window open for a few more years, or hell, even just for one more year. Honestly, I don't even need the Warriors to win another one. I just can't watch Curry not even have a chance. I need at least one more playoff run with at least dark horse intrigue for the Warriors. "", 'Durant will give them (me) that, and he would be joining the club under completely different circumstances this time. In 2016, he was overkill. Now he can be the savior. The Warriors definitely needed him before, but this time they need him. Like oxygen. ', ""A few days ago, I wouldn't have entertained this possibility. I was hoping for Zach LaVine or Jimmy Butler, but LaVine went to Sacramento and Butler reportedly told the Warriors he wouldn't sign an extension with them, which, at least in public, killed those talks. "", ""I'm still not ruling out the Warriors saying screw it and trading for Butler anyway, and just hoping they can convince him to stay long term or, perhaps preferably, just letting him opt in for one more run next year if nobody can present a sign-and-trade worth pursuing and then letting his salary come off the books. "", ""But Durant is now the prize, Phoenix appears cooked and is reportedly listening to offers for Durant. Golden State is desperate and reportedly one of the teams hot after Durant. There's smoke. With a little effort, maybe we can will this thing into a full-on bonfire. -- Brad Botkin"", ""Butler must be reeling at the fact that he's no longer the main attraction of this season's deadline after Luka Doncic was dealt in what will likely be the worst trade in NBA history. As a result, the attention around Butler has waned even after all his theatrics and reported tension with Miami's front office. "", ""It's reportedly Phoenix or bust in Butler's mind, with the Warriors being told that he would not sign a contract extension if they trade for him. But Phoenix's path to land Butler goes through Bradley Beal waiving his no-trade clause, which seems increasingly unlikely to happen as no team is chomping at the bit to take him on. "", ""The Heat have no reason to honor Butler's wishes to trade him to a preferred destination, but also, there doesn't seem to be many suitors out there. I think this drama spills into the offseason when teams have more time to assess their options. "", ""So, Butler stays in South Beach to finish the season, and instead ends up elsewhere this summer by either opting out of his $52 million player option and signing with a cap-space team, or opting in and again trying to force Miami's hand, possibly by sign-and-trade, to get him where he wants to go. -- Jasmyn Wimbish"", ""The Dallas Mavericks didn't just give the Lakers Luka Doncic. They were generous enough to leave them with the bulk of the trade assets they entered the deadline period with as well. Dalton Knecht is still in place. So is their 2031 first-round pick. Rui Hachimura and Gabe Vincent represent reasonably palatable matching salary in a follow-up deal, and with Anthony Davis now gone, the Lakers badly need a big man to replace him. "", 'The Brooklyn Nets have their answer. Nic Claxton is a sorely underrated defender that can dunk all of those lob passes Doncic loves to throw. That he comes with a contract that descends in value each year is an added bonus. Whether it costs Knecht, that pick or both, expect the Lakers to land their Davis replacement before the buzzer sounds on Thursday. -- Sam Quinn', 'The Mavericks still need another scoring guard to pair with Kyrie Irving -- and that remains true even after they traded for Caleb Martin from the 76ers on Tuesday. Yes, Irving was brilliant last season (except in the Finals) and has been again this season (in range of another 50-40-90 showing), but now Dallas is expecting him to be No. 1 playmaker without the Luka cushion to absorb defenses, all while turning 33 in March. ', ""Sure, Irving has been very good in Doncic's absence, but doing it in the playoffs, for four rounds if the Mavericks expect to return to the Finals, is a tall task. So Dallas gets him some help in the form of the Jazz's Collin Sexton or the Bulls' Coby White. "", ""Dallas has draft picks to work with. Max Christie, who came over in the Doncic deal, can be an attractive lure, and Daniel Gafford feels expendable with Davis in the fold now alongside Dereck Lively II (although who knows when he'll be back from his broken foot). "", ""However it gets done, Dallas will find a way to replenish at least a sliver of Luka's backcourt scoring. It pretty much has to. By trading Doncic for an old, injury-prone big man, Nico Harrison put his team on a win-immediately-and-at-all-costs timeline. White or Sexton certainly won't replace Doncic, but that isn't Dallas' goal here. They believe Irving and Davis are the championship duo, and they might not be wrong. "", 'The long-term outlook of this Luka trade is disastrous, but you can make a case, and I have made it, that Dallas is actually in a better position to compete for a title this season with Davis, assuming full postseason health. But only if they use every asset available to them to make the supporting cast as strong as humanly possible. -- Brad Botkin', ""It's clear that the Bucks are desperately trying to do something ahead of the trade deadline, but their second-apron restrictions and lack of draft assets is making life difficult. One option that has been discussed is moving franchise icon Khris Middleton, who has become injury prone and inconsistent in recent years. "", ""A Middleton move has most loudly been connected to the likes of Jimmy Butler, Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal, but Butler is insistent on getting to Phoenix, LaVine is off the board and Beal has a no-trade clause. Plus, acquiring either Butler or Beal would require the Bucks to first get under the second apron so they can aggregate salaries, which won't be easy. "", ""Most recently, The Athletic reported that the Bucks have talked to the Washington Wizards about a deal that would bring back Kyle Kuzma, which would not require any cap gymnastics. But if that's the kind of return the Bucks could more feasibly get for Middleton, then it's not worth it. He may not be his old self anymore, but he's still a reliable outside shooter and underrated playmaker whose connection with Giannis Antetokounmpo cannot be replaced. -- Jack Maloney"", ""When Sacramento traded De'Aaron Fox to San Antonio, it didn't just get Zach LaVine, Sidy Cissoko and a bunch of picks. It also opened up an additional roster spot, created a trade exception worth $16.8 million and cleared salary. Approaching the deadline, the Kings are now $10.5 million below the luxury-tax line, and they still have the $12.8 million midlevel exception at their disposal. If they use their newfound flexibility to acquire someone like, say, the Memphis Grizzlies' Luke Kennard, it should be seen as part of -- or at least an extension of -- the Fox trade. I don't feel great about this team's medium- to long-term ceiling, but don't be shocked if the roster is better post-deadline than it was a few days ago. -- James Herbert"", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

"Kevin Durant mock trades: How Warriors, Rockets, Mavericks and others could land Suns superstar",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-mock-trades-how-warriors-rockets-mavericks-and-others-could-land-suns-superstar/,"['', ""Kevin Durant watch is officially on, folks. As the Phoenix Suns continue their desperate pursuit to land Jimmy Butler ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline, it has become abundantly clear that there is no taker out there for Bradley Beal's supermax contract. That means that the Suns will either need to move Durant's salary to fit in Butler, or they will have to consider moving Durant for assets that they could later use to retool the roster around the younger Devin Booker down the line."", ""Durant's former team, the Golden State Warriors, has reportedly been in hot pursuit. According to The Athletic's Sam Amick, both the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets are also in the mix. Other teams are surely interested here as well. "", ""So, what would the Suns want in a Durant deal? In all likelihood, balance. They're still trying to win now, but that doesn't have to mean right now with the 36-year-old Durant headed out the door. They'd likely prefer to add some defense to balance out the scoring from Booker and Beal. Wings and centers are their positional preferences. Picks are valuable here, but primarily as assets they can use to flip down the line. If they can get off of Jusuf Nurkic, then all the better."", ""So with all of that in mind, let's mock out some possible Durant trades. If the 2014 MVP is indeed traded this week, this is what a deal could look like."", ""The first team known to have registered interest in Durant is, unsurprisingly, his former employer: the Golden State Warriors. They badly need another scorer to pair with Stephen Curry. Durant obviously fits the bill. Rarely does a team get a chance to reunite with someone that helped them win two championships. Such an opportunity exists for the Warriors. It's just going to be costly."", ""Phoenix turns one star into three useful players here. Wiggins can immediately slide in as the sort of versatile wing they've lacked. Valanciunas is at least a usable center in small doses. The Suns reportedly have some level of interest in Kuminga. He's the upside play for them here. Perhaps outside of Steve Kerr's untraditional, egalitarian system, he can succeed playing a more typical brand of basketball. Think of how much better Kelly Oubre Jr. looked in Phoenix than he did with the Warriors. That's the model here, except Kuminga is significantly more talented."", 'In addition to the players, Phoenix gets two unprotected Warriors picks. Add those two picks to three they got from the Jazz and suddenly Phoenix has five first-rounders to play with in order to improve. Attaching some of them to Nurkic in order to add more win-now talent would be entirely doable, especially over the summer when Nurkic becomes an expiring contract.', ""The Wizards are our financial facilitator of choice here because they already control Golden State's 2030 first-round pick. The catch is that they only get it if it lands between No. 21 and No. 30. In exchange for eating two meaningful contracts, the protections on that pick become significantly lighter: now, the Wizards get that pick if it lands anywhere between No. 7 and No. 30. Considering how old the Warriors would be with a Curry-Durant-Draymond Green core, a top-six protected Warriors pick would be very valuable. "", ""Golden State would be sacrificing most of its future to get this deal done, but would at least still hold onto Brandin Podziemski and its picks in odd-numbered years. It's a gamble, but, well, at least there's proof of concept. Durant, Curry and Green have won together in the past. They can win together in the future. "", 'Well, well, well, looks like the Suns still might have a path to Jimmy Butler after all. Yes, I know, I said we were trying to balance out the roster. Hear me out: Kevin Durant is better than Jimmy Butler, but if Butler is still the star the Suns think he is, they could use the surplus value generated in making that swap to get picks that they could turn around and trade for size and defense. In this scenario, they get the same two picks from the Warriors they did in the last trade, plus the portion of that 2030 pick we just gave the Wizards. They would then presumably try to attach those picks to Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen or other pricey role players on their roster for upgrades elsewhere.', ""Where do the three other teams factor into this? The Pistons act as our financier here, but they don't need to be paid to cooperate because they could actually use Buddy Hield. They've been a tad short on scoring since Jaden Ivey got hurt, so they simply take on an elite shooter for free and leave it at that."", 'Miami gets Kuminga as the centerpiece of its Butler return. He is a restricted free agent this offseason, so re-signing him would cut into their 2026 cap space plans, but in Randle and Looney, they get two contracts that will expire before then. They have reportedly been interested in Randle in the past, and he could give their offense the boost it needs to reach the playoffs this season. That means quite a bit to Miami, as missing the playoffs this year would mean that they will owe unprotected first-round picks to the Thunder in 2026 and Hornets in 2028 due to previous trades.', ""As for Minnesota? Aside from getting out of the failed Randle experiment, they save a ton of money off of their luxury tax bill by taking Wiggins instead. He does have an extra year on his contract, but he's a far better fit for a Minnesota roster that needs an extra wing far more than it needs an inefficient, ball-handling power forward. I've explored the Wiggins-Randle component of this deal in more depth here."", ""Deep breath, folks. The Mavericks are, by far, the most complicated team to construct a Durant trade for. Here's why:"", ""Essentially, this means we need to construct a legal trade in which Dallas effectively guts its supporting cast to get Durant. We need two helpers to get there, hence the inclusion of the Wizards and Pistons. Even after this deal, the Mavericks would have only 10 rostered players and would need to sign four more. The Suns would need to waive two players (likely Mason Plumlee and Bol Bol). The Wizards would need to waive one, but they're the Wizards, they have plenty of waiveable dudes."", ""Now, the basketball of it all. Lively is the crown jewel of this return. He's a second-year center that just dominated his rookie playoff run and has both All-Star and All-Defense potential. Phoenix would essentially be importing the Dallas center rotation from last season while also adding a bruising, two-way wing in Washington as well as one of the greatest shooters of all time in Thompson. Both of their inclusions make other Suns players expendable. Suddenly, it becomes far easier for Phoenix to trade Grayson Allen or Royce O'Neale if they need to with those players in place. They're getting two good first-round picks and one good second-round pick to help them do so, which they could also use to dump Jusuf Nurkic. Ultimately, this gives the Suns far more flexibility to retool the roster around Booker and, presumably, Lively. With picks and mid-sized salaries at their disposal, they could go for almost any type of roster they want."", ""The Mavericks grow significantly thinner in this deal, but they're not completely bereft of depth. New acquisitions Christie and Martin are still here. So is Valanciunas and reserve ball-handlers Jaden Hardy and Spencer Dinwiddie. That's not exactly a loaded supporting cast... but would Dallas need one? It's hard to imagine a more compatible trio than Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. Every other box, be it center, two-way wing or bench playmaking, is at least partially checked here. If the cap allowed them to keep more depth they surely would, but that's not the CBA we're living in."", ""The Wizards and Pistons are our facilitators here. Washington gets second-year first-rounder Prosper to both send out Valanciunas and eat the Dwight Powell contract. Detroit is a big winner here. We need someone to take in Marshall's money, and the Pistons, with their $14 million in cap space, qualify. Marshall is a very solid two-way wing who could join the Pistons immediately and contribute to their playoff push. To get him, they swap their very good 2025 second-rounder from Toronto for a slightly worse Phoenix pick, which belongs to Washington in reality."", ""Trades of this magnitude almost never happen. When they do, it's almost never during the season. But Dallas has already shown us that the impossible is possible at the 2025 trade deadline, so sure, why not do it again with a Durant blockbuster?"", ""The Rockets, by all accounts, want to keep their young core together for the time being. What if they could make a major trade without breaking it up? Houston is a uniquely enticing trading partner for Phoenix because the Rockets control Phoenix's first-round picks in 2027 and 2029. If the Suns could get those picks back, several other team-building doors suddenly open. They could flip those picks again to teams that want to bet against their future. They could hold onto them and tank if they can't build a winner in the near future. These two first-round picks are more valuable to the Suns than any picks they could get elsewhere."", ""In this deal, they also solve fill two important present holes. Dillon Brooks would immediately become their best 3-and-D wing. Nikola Vucevic could slide in at center. He may not be the rim-protector the Suns are looking for, but he's a viable starter at their weakest position. Adding Brooks hopefully helps the defense enough to survive his presence on that end of the floor."", ""Chicago is seemingly looking for a first-round pick for Vucevic as we speak, but Whitmore is likely more valuable than any pick they could reasonably get. A high-upside scoring wing with two more years left on his rookie deal, the Rockets just haven't had minutes available for him. Chicago obviously would."", ""The question for Houston here is whether or not they're willing to sacrifice two of their best trade assets for a very brief boost in championship odds. Durant could get them to the Finals here and now. He's also 36 with a lengthy injury history. Those picks could be the key to the Rockets landing a younger star later. What holds more value to the Rockets: the upside of landing a top-15 player ever for a short period, or the longer runway that would come with trading for someone younger down the line?"", ""There's no clear answer to that question, and it's not even clear that a Durant trade would preclude another star move down the line. Houston would still have its own picks to work with. It would still control a valuable 2027 swap with the Nets as well, plus its incumbent young talent. Getting Durant would be a short-term play, but not exactly an all-in move. Considering how well he could fit their roster, or any roster for that matter, he's probably worth the price."", ""Here's where we get funky. Durant has played for the Warriors before. The Rockets are a fairly standard star destination. Nobody is expecting Orlando to make an all-in push yet. They by no means need to. Their three best players are all 23 or younger. But really think about where the Magic are right now. They've had back-to-back top-three defenses, but they haven't had a top-20 offense in 13 years. They rank dead last in the NBA in 3-point percentage and it isn't even close. They trail the Wizards by 2.6 percentage points. That's bigger than the gap between the No. 29 Wizards and the 19 Nets at 35.4%. "", ""Injuries have informed those struggles, obviously, but isn't Durant exactly the sort of player who could solve these problems? He's a historically great shooter and late-game creator, but he wouldn't need to take the ball out of the hands of Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner on a possession-by-possession basis like most of the guards they've been linked to would. He'd be purely additive, not even taking away from Orlando's imposing size. A theoretical Magic starting lineup with Durant would feature four players who are 6-10 or taller. Their smallest starter would be the 6-5 Jalen Suggs. Good luck scoring on them! If Durant makes sense as the finishing offensive piece for a young, defense-first team in Houston, then he does for a young, defense first-team in Orlando as well."", ""This is about as all-in as the Magic could reasonably get without touching their core. They'd be giving up four unprotected picks, but given the incumbent youth here, none of them would figure to be especially high. Anthony Black is probably the best asset they're sacrificing in this deal. If Phoenix wants him, it could have him, but in this scenario, they immediately flip him to the Nets for a center that makes more sense with the rest of the Suns roster. Claxton is the best defensive big man they could hope for. Caldwell-Pope has been bad this season. If the Suns could revive him, he's a proven, championship-caliber 3-and-D role player."", ""This sort of deal would raise serious questions for the Magic. Could they cultivate more offense after Durant is gone without picks to trade for it? Because this is a team that plans to win for a far longer time than Durant likely has left in the NBA. Could they afford Durant long-term? Remember, Suggs and Wagner start long-term extensions next season. Banchero does a year later. Durant would have to take a pay cut after his current deal expires in 2026 to finish his career here. But he is one of the few players in the NBA that could make the Magic contenders right now. If anyone is worth an all-in push for them, it's probably him."", ""We're maintaining the same basic principles here that we used in the Magic trade. The picks Memphis has to offer probably aren't going to be especially valuable. They're too young and too good at developing players to send Phoenix any premium picks, so they have to make up for it with the volume of four first-rounders. On balance, these picks are probably slightly more valuable than the ones Phoenix would be getting from Orlando. The Grizzlies are a bit older. They're a bit more volatile given Ja Morant's history and Jaren Jackson Jr's. injury history. But, by and large, the Grizzlies should expected to win for the foreseeable future."", ""This is probably the least inspiring player package of the deals we've covered thus far, but it still gets the Suns three good players. Health has been an issue for Marcus Smart lately, but he's played well when he's been on the floor for the Grizzlies. He's not quite the Defensive Player of the Year he once was, but his ability to defend bigger wings would come in handy on a roster devoted to Booker and Beal. Clarke isn't a traditional center, but he's about as versatile defensively as reserve big men come. Williams was an incredibly promising 3-and-D prospect a year ago, but injuries have ruined this season for him thus far."", 'Detroit is once again our dumping ground. The Pistons get two decent second-rounders to take on Kennard and Konchar. Again, not exactly a bad outcome for them to add another shooter as they attempt to push for a playoff spot. If the Pistons can find a better use for their cap space, there are other teams that could be looped in to eat some money. This deal saves the Suns roughly $14 million in salary and a small fortune in luxury taxes, so worst-case scenario, they have room to take in a bit more salary.', ""The question here is whether or not the Grizzlies would go all-in at this juncture. Their interest in Jimmy Butler suggests they are open to trading for an older star, but he would come at a much lower asset cost. Durant is better. He's also pricier. Giving up picks hurts the Grizzlies more than most teams. When you draft as well as they do, any lost pick is going to sting. They're giving up four first-rounders here. Phoenix would probably ask for standout rookie Jaylen Wells in a deal. Memphis would counter by correctly pointing out that they now need him to guard top opposing wings with Smart gone."", ""Finances matter for Memphis here too. Jackson will get a new deal after next season. That's part of why they're likely hesitant to extend Butler. Would Durant take a pay cut after the 2025-26 season? It's hard to say, but Memphis would have to go deep into the luxury tax to keep Durant, Morant, Jackson and Desmond Bane. Given their track record in the player development department, though, they might be able to handle that. Few teams are better at cultivating cheap supporting talent."", 'The Grizzlies aren\'t the Magic or the Rockets. They\'ve been through real playoff battles before. They know what to expect when the postseason arrives, and they have a better idea of how their team will react when the lights are brightest. Houston and Orlando has room to shrug and say ""eh, we\'ll trade for the next guy."" The time is now for Memphis. Yes, they\'re relatively young, but they have three great players hitting their primes right now, and given Morant\'s athleticism-based style, they don\'t know how long that prime is going to last. They\'re a team that should be open to an aggressive push before Thursday\'s deadline, and there isn\'t a better talent out there than Durant.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

"Kevin Durant mock trades: How Warriors, Rockets, Mavericks and others could land Suns superstar",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-mock-trades-how-warriors-could-make-reunion-possible-plus-three-other-landing-spots/,"['', ""Kevin Durant watch is officially on, folks. As the Phoenix Suns continue their desperate pursuit to land Jimmy Butler ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline, it has become abundantly clear that there is no taker out there for Bradley Beal's supermax contract. That means that the Suns will either need to move Durant's salary to fit in Butler, or they will have to consider moving Durant for assets that they could later use to retool the roster around the younger Devin Booker down the line."", ""Durant's former team, the Golden State Warriors, has reportedly been in hot pursuit. According to The Athletic's Sam Amick, both the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets are also in the mix. Other teams are surely interested here as well. "", ""So, what would the Suns want in a Durant deal? In all likelihood, balance. They're still trying to win now, but that doesn't have to mean right now with the 36-year-old Durant headed out the door. They'd likely prefer to add some defense to balance out the scoring from Booker and Beal. Wings and centers are their positional preferences. Picks are valuable here, but primarily as assets they can use to flip down the line. If they can get off of Jusuf Nurkic, then all the better."", ""So with all of that in mind, let's mock out some possible Durant trades. If the 2014 MVP is indeed traded this week, this is what a deal could look like."", ""The first team known to have registered interest in Durant is, unsurprisingly, his former employer: the Golden State Warriors. They badly need another scorer to pair with Stephen Curry. Durant obviously fits the bill. Rarely does a team get a chance to reunite with someone that helped them win two championships. Such an opportunity exists for the Warriors. It's just going to be costly."", ""Phoenix turns one star into three useful players here. Wiggins can immediately slide in as the sort of versatile wing they've lacked. Valanciunas is at least a usable center in small doses. The Suns reportedly have some level of interest in Kuminga. He's the upside play for them here. Perhaps outside of Steve Kerr's untraditional, egalitarian system, he can succeed playing a more typical brand of basketball. Think of how much better Kelly Oubre Jr. looked in Phoenix than he did with the Warriors. That's the model here, except Kuminga is significantly more talented."", 'In addition to the players, Phoenix gets two unprotected Warriors picks. Add those two picks to three they got from the Jazz and suddenly Phoenix has five first-rounders to play with in order to improve. Attaching some of them to Nurkic in order to add more win-now talent would be entirely doable, especially over the summer when Nurkic becomes an expiring contract.', ""The Wizards are our financial facilitator of choice here because they already control Golden State's 2030 first-round pick. The catch is that they only get it if it lands between No. 21 and No. 30. In exchange for eating two meaningful contracts, the protections on that pick become significantly lighter: now, the Wizards get that pick if it lands anywhere between No. 7 and No. 30. Considering how old the Warriors would be with a Curry-Durant-Draymond Green core, a top-six protected Warriors pick would be very valuable. "", ""Golden State would be sacrificing most of its future to get this deal done, but would at least still hold onto Brandin Podziemski and its picks in odd-numbered years. It's a gamble, but, well, at least there's proof of concept. Durant, Curry and Green have won together in the past. They can win together in the future. "", 'Well, well, well, looks like the Suns still might have a path to Jimmy Butler after all. Yes, I know, I said we were trying to balance out the roster. Hear me out: Kevin Durant is better than Jimmy Butler, but if Butler is still the star the Suns think he is, they could use the surplus value generated in making that swap to get picks that they could turn around and trade for size and defense. In this scenario, they get the same two picks from the Warriors they did in the last trade, plus the portion of that 2030 pick we just gave the Wizards. They would then presumably try to attach those picks to Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen or other pricey role players on their roster for upgrades elsewhere.', ""Where do the three other teams factor into this? The Pistons act as our financier here, but they don't need to be paid to cooperate because they could actually use Buddy Hield. They've been a tad short on scoring since Jaden Ivey got hurt, so they simply take on an elite shooter for free and leave it at that."", 'Miami gets Kuminga as the centerpiece of its Butler return. He is a restricted free agent this offseason, so re-signing him would cut into their 2026 cap space plans, but in Randle and Looney, they get two contracts that will expire before then. They have reportedly been interested in Randle in the past, and he could give their offense the boost it needs to reach the playoffs this season. That means quite a bit to Miami, as missing the playoffs this year would mean that they will owe unprotected first-round picks to the Thunder in 2026 and Hornets in 2028 due to previous trades.', ""As for Minnesota? Aside from getting out of the failed Randle experiment, they save a ton of money off of their luxury tax bill by taking Wiggins instead. He does have an extra year on his contract, but he's a far better fit for a Minnesota roster that needs an extra wing far more than it needs an inefficient, ball-handling power forward. I've explored the Wiggins-Randle component of this deal in more depth here."", ""Deep breath, folks. The Mavericks are, by far, the most complicated team to construct a Durant trade for. Here's why:"", ""Essentially, this means we need to construct a legal trade in which Dallas effectively guts its supporting cast to get Durant. We need two helpers to get there, hence the inclusion of the Wizards and Pistons. Even after this deal, the Mavericks would have only 10 rostered players and would need to sign four more. The Suns would need to waive two players (likely Mason Plumlee and Bol Bol). The Wizards would need to waive one, but they're the Wizards, they have plenty of waiveable dudes."", ""Now, the basketball of it all. Lively is the crown jewel of this return. He's a second-year center that just dominated his rookie playoff run and has both All-Star and All-Defense potential. Phoenix would essentially be importing the Dallas center rotation from last season while also adding a bruising, two-way wing in Washington as well as one of the greatest shooters of all time in Thompson. Both of their inclusions make other Suns players expendable. Suddenly, it becomes far easier for Phoenix to trade Grayson Allen or Royce O'Neale if they need to with those players in place. They're getting two good first-round picks and one good second-round pick to help them do so, which they could also use to dump Jusuf Nurkic. Ultimately, this gives the Suns far more flexibility to retool the roster around Booker and, presumably, Lively. With picks and mid-sized salaries at their disposal, they could go for almost any type of roster they want."", ""The Mavericks grow significantly thinner in this deal, but they're not completely bereft of depth. New acquisitions Christie and Martin are still here. So is Valanciunas and reserve ball-handlers Jaden Hardy and Spencer Dinwiddie. That's not exactly a loaded supporting cast... but would Dallas need one? It's hard to imagine a more compatible trio than Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. Every other box, be it center, two-way wing or bench playmaking, is at least partially checked here. If the cap allowed them to keep more depth they surely would, but that's not the CBA we're living in."", ""The Wizards and Pistons are our facilitators here. Washington gets second-year first-rounder Prosper to both send out Valanciunas and eat the Dwight Powell contract. Detroit is a big winner here. We need someone to take in Marshall's money, and the Pistons, with their $14 million in cap space, qualify. Marshall is a very solid two-way wing who could join the Pistons immediately and contribute to their playoff push. To get him, they swap their very good 2025 second-rounder from Toronto for a slightly worse Phoenix pick, which belongs to Washington in reality."", ""Trades of this magnitude almost never happen. When they do, it's almost never during the season. But Dallas has already shown us that the impossible is possible at the 2025 trade deadline, so sure, why not do it again with a Durant blockbuster?"", ""The Rockets, by all accounts, want to keep their young core together for the time being. What if they could make a major trade without breaking it up? Houston is a uniquely enticing trading partner for Phoenix because the Rockets control Phoenix's first-round picks in 2027 and 2029. If the Suns could get those picks back, several other team-building doors suddenly open. They could flip those picks again to teams that want to bet against their future. They could hold onto them and tank if they can't build a winner in the near future. These two first-round picks are more valuable to the Suns than any picks they could get elsewhere."", ""In this deal, they also solve fill two important present holes. Dillon Brooks would immediately become their best 3-and-D wing. Nikola Vucevic could slide in at center. He may not be the rim-protector the Suns are looking for, but he's a viable starter at their weakest position. Adding Brooks hopefully helps the defense enough to survive his presence on that end of the floor."", ""Chicago is seemingly looking for a first-round pick for Vucevic as we speak, but Whitmore is likely more valuable than any pick they could reasonably get. A high-upside scoring wing with two more years left on his rookie deal, the Rockets just haven't had minutes available for him. Chicago obviously would."", ""The question for Houston here is whether or not they're willing to sacrifice two of their best trade assets for a very brief boost in championship odds. Durant could get them to the Finals here and now. He's also 36 with a lengthy injury history. Those picks could be the key to the Rockets landing a younger star later. What holds more value to the Rockets: the upside of landing a top-15 player ever for a short period, or the longer runway that would come with trading for someone younger down the line?"", ""There's no clear answer to that question, and it's not even clear that a Durant trade would preclude another star move down the line. Houston would still have its own picks to work with. It would still control a valuable 2027 swap with the Nets as well, plus its incumbent young talent. Getting Durant would be a short-term play, but not exactly an all-in move. Considering how well he could fit their roster, or any roster for that matter, he's probably worth the price."", ""Here's where we get funky. Durant has played for the Warriors before. The Rockets are a fairly standard star destination. Nobody is expecting Orlando to make an all-in push yet. They by no means need to. Their three best players are all 23 or younger. But really think about where the Magic are right now. They've had back-to-back top-three defenses, but they haven't had a top-20 offense in 13 years. They rank dead last in the NBA in 3-point percentage and it isn't even close. They trail the Wizards by 2.6 percentage points. That's bigger than the gap between the No. 29 Wizards and the 19 Nets at 35.4%. "", ""Injuries have informed those struggles, obviously, but isn't Durant exactly the sort of player who could solve these problems? He's a historically great shooter and late-game creator, but he wouldn't need to take the ball out of the hands of Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner on a possession-by-possession basis like most of the guards they've been linked to would. He'd be purely additive, not even taking away from Orlando's imposing size. A theoretical Magic starting lineup with Durant would feature four players who are 6-10 or taller. Their smallest starter would be the 6-5 Jalen Suggs. Good luck scoring on them! If Durant makes sense as the finishing offensive piece for a young, defense-first team in Houston, then he does for a young, defense first-team in Orlando as well."", ""This is about as all-in as the Magic could reasonably get without touching their core. They'd be giving up four unprotected picks, but given the incumbent youth here, none of them would figure to be especially high. Anthony Black is probably the best asset they're sacrificing in this deal. If Phoenix wants him, it could have him, but in this scenario, they immediately flip him to the Nets for a center that makes more sense with the rest of the Suns roster. Claxton is the best defensive big man they could hope for. Caldwell-Pope has been bad this season. If the Suns could revive him, he's a proven, championship-caliber 3-and-D role player."", ""This sort of deal would raise serious questions for the Magic. Could they cultivate more offense after Durant is gone without picks to trade for it? Because this is a team that plans to win for a far longer time than Durant likely has left in the NBA. Could they afford Durant long-term? Remember, Suggs and Wagner start long-term extensions next season. Banchero does a year later. Durant would have to take a pay cut after his current deal expires in 2026 to finish his career here. But he is one of the few players in the NBA that could make the Magic contenders right now. If anyone is worth an all-in push for them, it's probably him."", ""We're maintaining the same basic principles here that we used in the Magic trade. The picks Memphis has to offer probably aren't going to be especially valuable. They're too young and too good at developing players to send Phoenix any premium picks, so they have to make up for it with the volume of four first-rounders. On balance, these picks are probably slightly more valuable than the ones Phoenix would be getting from Orlando. The Grizzlies are a bit older. They're a bit more volatile given Ja Morant's history and Jaren Jackson Jr's. injury history. But, by and large, the Grizzlies should expected to win for the foreseeable future."", ""This is probably the least inspiring player package of the deals we've covered thus far, but it still gets the Suns three good players. Health has been an issue for Marcus Smart lately, but he's played well when he's been on the floor for the Grizzlies. He's not quite the Defensive Player of the Year he once was, but his ability to defend bigger wings would come in handy on a roster devoted to Booker and Beal. Clarke isn't a traditional center, but he's about as versatile defensively as reserve big men come. Williams was an incredibly promising 3-and-D prospect a year ago, but injuries have ruined this season for him thus far."", 'Detroit is once again our dumping ground. The Pistons get two decent second-rounders to take on Kennard and Konchar. Again, not exactly a bad outcome for them to add another shooter as they attempt to push for a playoff spot. If the Pistons can find a better use for their cap space, there are other teams that could be looped in to eat some money. This deal saves the Suns roughly $14 million in salary and a small fortune in luxury taxes, so worst-case scenario, they have room to take in a bit more salary.', ""The question here is whether or not the Grizzlies would go all-in at this juncture. Their interest in Jimmy Butler suggests they are open to trading for an older star, but he would come at a much lower asset cost. Durant is better. He's also pricier. Giving up picks hurts the Grizzlies more than most teams. When you draft as well as they do, any lost pick is going to sting. They're giving up four first-rounders here. Phoenix would probably ask for standout rookie Jaylen Wells in a deal. Memphis would counter by correctly pointing out that they now need him to guard top opposing wings with Smart gone."", ""Finances matter for Memphis here too. Jackson will get a new deal after next season. That's part of why they're likely hesitant to extend Butler. Would Durant take a pay cut after the 2025-26 season? It's hard to say, but Memphis would have to go deep into the luxury tax to keep Durant, Morant, Jackson and Desmond Bane. Given their track record in the player development department, though, they might be able to handle that. Few teams are better at cultivating cheap supporting talent."", 'The Grizzlies aren\'t the Magic or the Rockets. They\'ve been through real playoff battles before. They know what to expect when the postseason arrives, and they have a better idea of how their team will react when the lights are brightest. Houston and Orlando has room to shrug and say ""eh, we\'ll trade for the next guy."" The time is now for Memphis. Yes, they\'re relatively young, but they have three great players hitting their primes right now, and given Morant\'s athleticism-based style, they don\'t know how long that prime is going to last. They\'re a team that should be open to an aggressive push before Thursday\'s deadline, and there isn\'t a better talent out there than Durant.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.
