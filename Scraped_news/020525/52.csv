What we know about the Myles Garrett trade demand — and what’s next for the Browns,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6113240/2025/02/05/myles-garrett-trade-demand-cleveland-browns/,"['NFL', 'Check out with card', '', '', '', '', 'The partial transcript below has been edited for clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts and , or watch on YouTube above.', 'Dianna: For the last few weeks, the Cleveland Browns have known that Myles Garrett has wanted out. But on Monday, he publicly put out, “I want out.” It was a surprise for a lot of people. I think Browns fans are not as surprised. I think they’ve been reading the tea leaves and they’ve heard a lot of rumblings, but also the fact that Andrew Berry came out just a week ago at the Senior Bowl and he told us, “I’m not trading Myles Garrett.” Just a week later, this entire thing has shifted. The No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft now wants out of Cleveland. You heard the news. What was your reaction?', '', 'Chase: We had to talk about it on our Fox show, and the first thought was, “About time.” I would want out of Cleveland, too. You see the news and you hear about all the backstory. Then he actually he actually writes a very nice letter, which you posted. You read it and you’re like, “All right.” The dude wants to win. Like you say all those things and you have one playoff win in eight seasons in Cleveland. You’re 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. Stats can only accumulate so much until you just are so sick and tired of losing, and that’s what Cleveland’s been doing.', 'Dianna: Well, the statement said, “While I’ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stage is won’t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton. It has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.” Of course, the “Cleveland to Canton” line draws attention because Andrew Berry said that about Garrett twice in January when discussing the team’s plans to keep him. All of this is very much orchestrated. Okay. So obviously drops the week of the Super Bowl where we’re all going to be talking.', 'Chase: Yeah, Monday the week of the Super Bowl. Like come on.', 'Dianna: Chase, when I tell you there is nothing going on outside of the coaching cycle, there is zero going on. So this was a bombshell. The Browns, as I mentioned, knew this was coming. They were informed this morning that Garrett was going to go public with it. I spoke to some people around the league about it and somebody, even in Cleveland, just in response to how they’re taking the seriousness of it. Their response was, essentially: If he’s going public like this, he is serious about this. This isn’t just a game to get another contract. This isn’t a wink, wink, little move, I’m unhappy. We saw in San Francisco. We saw Deebo Samuel want out publicly. He came out and said he wanted to trade, he stayed. Brandon Aiyuk came out and publicly said, “I want to trade.” They did some work, he stayed. Just because you go public doesn’t mean it’s definitely going to happen. At the same time, I think a player of this caliber being this disgruntled and this angry, I think the Cleveland Browns know that they’ve got a mess on their hands here.', '', 'Chase: It almost seems to me, when you go public and you’re this big of a star player — last year Defensive Player of the Year, one of the premier pass rushers at the premier position in all of the NFL besides quarterback — when you go public with this, you mean business. In my opinion, there’s no way that they’re going to end up back together, and quite honestly, he almost has all the power. Only a $19 million cap hit next year. He’s going to be in line for an extension. It’s almost like he could pick his own team. Look at those teams that need pass rush help that can fit them under the cap. They can sign him to an extension that can finagle the cap space in certain teams.', 'Dianna: You have to consider a couple of things. One, you’re right — he’s going to want a new contract. Not only is it going to be a new contract, it’s going to be a contract that’s going to pay him the most at that position, the highest of a non-quarterback. This isn’t going to be some friendly little deal he’s going to do with a new team. He wants to be the highest paid at his position, and rightfully so. You have to consider that when we’re trying to piece together who are the teams. Before we get into the teams, though I want to let you know that the Cleveland Browns are standing by what they said last week, which is, We are not trading Myles Garrett. In fact, I reached out to them this morning and it was the same thing of just this we are not moving on this. We’re not even going to entertain phone calls.', 'Chase: That’s ridiculous. Like, I get it, and I would have that stance too. But as soon as someone offers you two ones or a one and two twos, you’re going to move on from the player. In my opinion, this is a full-on rebuild in Cleveland. Deshaun Watson, probably not playing this year depending on how he recovers, that whole guaranteed money. I think this was sort of writing on the wall for Myles Garrett when they signed Deshaun Watson and Deshaun Watson never panned out. I bet Myles Garrett — and I can’t take words out of his mouth — but I’m thinking from a star player standpoint, probably what he’s saying is like, “Man, we got the Deshaun Watson from the Houston Texans in 2019, that was the only piece that was missing. We let go of Baker because he wasn’t the guy. We got some really good offensive pieces. We have a two-time Coach of the Year. We have a killer defense with Schwartz. This is our year!” They made the playoffs with Joe Flacco. you know what I mean? He sees the writing on the wall.', 'Dianna: Well, let’s say that there is a world where the Browns think they could keep him. What could an organization do?', 'Chase: Nothing. As soon as you go public in your star player, you were good as out. I was talking to Shady McCoy, a superstar who’s been traded in his prime from the Philadelphia Eagles to the Buffalo Bills. And he said, “I didn’t want to be traded, but I didn’t have a choice. It’s different, but it’s the same because they’re star players. Star players have so much more power over the locker room. He is the leader of that team. As soon as the leader, your stud player, your Hall of Fame player wants out, there’s no mending fences.', '', 'Dianna: So what would it look like if a team were able to get him? I reached out to a few GM’s around the league who are all paying close attention to this, and I’m sure a lot of them are probably already reaching out to Andrew Berry to see how serious they are about not moving on. Just trying to get a feel for what he could go for. One GM said a one and a two, a one and two threes, maybe throw a player in there. And that was the most common answer I did get today in terms of what it would cost. I do think that they could maybe squeeze another team for slightly more, for a team that is close to winning. Because that’s another factor in this: Myles wants to play for a contender, or at least somebody that is close to contending. It kind of killed my Raiders idea. Actually, it was the GM who said the Raiders should consider trading for Myles Garrett to pair him up with Maxx Crosby. What better way to take down Patrick Mahomes than that? There’s your answer, but I doubt that that’s going to happen.', 'Chase: So what you’re saying is a little less than Kahlil [Mack]? Because I was with Kahlil Mack when he got traded at 27 years old to the Chicago Bears. We gave up a ton. But what you’re saying — Myles at 29 is probably going to be a little bit less than what Khalil Mack garnered? I’m trying to draw comparisons this situation because they’re both really freaking good pass rushers. That makes sense to me. A one and a two, maybe a late round pick. I mean, that’s still really expensive for GMs.', 'Dianna: So there’s no permanent or definite timeline for stuff like this, but I can tell you that most teams want to get this type of trade done before the new league year. That’s about four weeks. I think we’re going to see some action here over over.', 'Chase: Let me ask you a question: Do you think, to the best of your knowledge, that if we knew at the time of all the hiring cycles and firing cycles of head coaches this year, that Deshaun Watson was not going to be the quarterback for the Cleveland Browns moving forward because of his injury, and that Myles Garrett was not going to be the premier player still on that team, do Andrew Berry and Kevin Stefanski survive? Are they still the coach and GM to lead this rebuild if both of those guys were gone?', 'Dianna: Yeah, I think I think that’s what ownership decided. They were going to stick with Andrew Berry and Kevin Stefanski because he has that belief. I understand what you’re saying, that Myles Garrett is such a big piece of this and the idea of losing him, they really have to start this thing over. But I think they’re already there in their minds, of “How we can fix some of these issues?” It’s why I think they’re going to probably go quarterback in the draft to try to fix that.', 'Chase: Really?! Hold on, hold on. You just blew my socks off. Quarterback at two in the draft?', 'Dianna: I don’t know if it’s definite.', '', 'Chase: You just said it so nonchalantly.', 'Dianna: I just think it makes sense. I think all the signs are pointing to that. Maybe not even one, maybe even two in this draft, knowing that that’s the position that they have to get right. The Deshaun Watson thing is not working out there. They’re sort of ripping the Band-Aid while also just letting Deshaun sit. I’m not really sure.', 'Chase: Give me two teams, where Garrett goes.', 'Dianna: Well, I think the things that you have to consider, as I mentioned before, is going to be a team that has the money to to give him a contract like that, a team that can be contending. And I do think a 4-3 [defense] would probably have to be something that they can consider. The scheme in front is going to be part of this. Why not the Chargers? Why not the Commanders? What about the Eagles? Just keep loading up.', 'Chase: Oh, Howie. Trade everyone on that O-line except Jalen Carter, and put Jalen Carter and Myles Garrett together.', 'Dianna: I still like the Commanders idea. We know they traded away Chase Young, Montez Sweat. Just adding Garrett would just accelerate that rebuild that they’re doing. We saw what their biggest problem was: defense. This is where they need to get better.', 'Chase: Good one. I like that one a lot.', '', '']"

Get Jared to agree to a semi-realistic deal that would land Garrett with our Green Bay Packers.', 'According to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, if the Browns do trade Garrett it will be for something closer to a first-round pick and some change than three first-round picks. That was a good starting point for Jared and me. Really, the biggest hurdle was to figure out what “and some change” means.', 'I floated defensive end Lukas Van Ness, receiver Christian Watson and cornerback Jaire Alexander, three players who very well could use a change of scenery, to start. They all have talent, but their future in Green Bay is uncertain. Jared didn’t bite on LVN or Alexander, but he did have an interest in Watson. The Browns need to add cheap rookie deals to fill out their roster in 2025 following a trade of Garrett, which would take a team-wide effort to absorb his dead cap.', 'Other players who interested Jared were backup quarterback Malik Willis, who is under contract for one more year, and 2024 draft pick MarShawn Lloyd, a running back who missed most of his rookie season due to injuries. With the Packers having Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks behind Josh Jacobs in the backfield, I’m not letting Lloyd stand between me and Myles Garrett. Willis is a quality backup quarterback, who might be able to push for playing time in Cleveland, but now that the Packers are out of cap hell, they can afford to buy a backup passer instead of having to turn to the draft — like they had the previous two Aprils.', 'The draft picks we ended up agreeing on for Garrett, on top of Watson, Willis and Lloyd, were the Packers’ 2026 first-round pick and the team’s 2025 second-round pick. I figured that Green Bay would like to hold onto their 2025 first-round pick, considering that they’re hosting the draft this season. A 2026 pick might even serve the Browns better than one in 2025, should they want to get into the Arch Manning sweepstakes next spring.', 'Did I give up too much to Jared?

He released a heartfelt statement focused on his love of the Browns and their fan base, but he concluded it with: “With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Brown.”', 'Let the rumor mill start grinding.', 'Of course, the Browns immediately responded that they have no intention of trading the 29-year-old Garrett who is one of the greatest players in franchise history, and we’re not just talking about the rebooted Browns of 2002, we’re talking all time.', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'In eight seasons, he has amassed 102.5 sacks including double digits in each of the last seven years, and he has earned six All-Pro selections (four on the first team), six Pro Bowl invites and he was the 2023 NFL defensive player of the year.', 'In terms of a difference maker for a defense, there may not be another player in the league who would rank ahead of Garrett, and every Super Bowl contending team should be interested in pursuing him.', 'Browns general manager Andrew Berry said at his end of season press conference in early January, “My anticipation, expectation is that he’ll have a direct ticket from Cleveland to Canton at the end of his years and expect him to be here and retire a Brown, quite frankly.” Last week at the Senior Bowl, Berry doubled down and basically reiterated the same stance.', 'Part of that reasoning is the onerous dead salary cap they would take on. According to sports contract website Spotrac.com, moving Garrett prior to June 1 would result in a $36.2 million hit in 2025, and doing it after June 1 spreads that over two years ($14.8 million in 2025 and $21.5 million in 2026).', 'However, waiting until after June 1 would mean the massive package in draft assets the Browns would certainly ask for would be for 2026 and not 2025, so that would not be ideal. That makes it a tricky situation for the Browns, so is it really worth trading Garrett?', 'If Cleveland does pursue a deal, the Bills need to be in the mix, and the loss of perhaps their 2025 and 2026 first-round draft picks, if that’s what it takes, should not impede them. It’s not like the Bills have made great use of their first-round picks the last few years.', 'As for the money, yeah, that could be a problem. The Bills would have to re-do his current contract, and Spotrac projects an extension could be in the neighborhood of four years and $137 million. Obviously, general manager Brandon Beane would need to do some major surgery on the cap to make it work, but he has been willing to do this in past.', '“You do need difference makers,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said last week. “You need two or three on each side of the ball that are difference makers. … That gets a team to the Super Bowl. Philosophically, for me, when you look at it and you study it, you’ve got (to have) two to three on each side of the ball that are top 1-3, 1-5 at their position. And that’s real.”', 'When Beane took the mighty swing and signed Miller to a six-year, $120 million free agent contract in 2022, nothing less than a Super Bowl championship was expected.', 'At the time, Miller’s arrival was thought to be the missing link to Buffalo’s inability to get past the Kansas City Chiefs who they had just lost to in back-to-back playoff games including the deplorable 13 seconds debacle two months earlier.', 'Already considered a Hall of Famer Miller was expected to take the middling Buffalo pass rush to new heights, the player who would rise up in the biggest moments when a defensive play needed to be made, something the Bills’ defense had always lacked in January. But then he blew out his knee midway through 2022 and was never the same player.', 'In retrospect, the Miller move fell far short of delivering on its original intention, and now the Bills need to cut their losses and move on from the now 35-year-old former star. That move would create a $15.4 million dead cap hit, but would open about $8.5 million in space for 2025 which would be helpful in procuring Garrett.', '“I don’t have anything I can give you clarity on today about him,” Beane said last week of Miller. “We’ve got a lot of things to look at, but I’m appreciative of Von. I know we didn’t get three or four years of healthy Von, but I do want to say … he brought things, a championship mentality. You always want guys around who know what it looks like, to tell guys what championship teams look like, felt like, and so beyond his production on the field, he does a lot of things in our locker room behind the scenes.”', 'And all that was fine, but the reality is that Miller was on the downside of his career even before he got hurt. Garrett is still in his prime and adding him to the defense would finally give the Bills the player they have lacked, really, since Bruce Smith left town after the 1999 season: A game-wrecking pass rusher, a player the other team has to game plan specifically for, and even then, the plan doesn’t work.', '“We always want to be strong up front,” Beane said when asked about the sub-standard Bills pass rush in the AFC Championship Game loss to the Chiefs. “We’ll look at that and if there’s areas that we can get better there, we will try to address that.”', 'Sal Maiorana has covered the Buffalo Bills for four decades including 35 years as the full-time beat writer for the D&C, and he has written numerous books about the history of the team.

On Monday, star pass rusher Myles Garrett made it known he requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns, the franchise he has spent his entire career with since he was the No. 1 overall pick at the 2017 NFL Draft out of Texas A&M. ', ""Naturally, given Garrett's standing in the league as one of the best defensive players it has to offer, this news set the NFL ablaze with various folks musing about where the 29-year-old could ultimately end up. What's just as interesting as where Garrett could go in the next chapter of his career, however, is how much he'll fetch on the trade market. "", 'Back at the Senior Bowl and prior to Garrett going public with his trade request, Browns general manager Andrew Berry emphasized that he would not trade his star edge rusher, not even if a franchise offered two first-round picks. Of course, a lot has changed between then and now, so it will be interesting to see if Berry will stick to his guns on the two first-rounder (and more) price tag, especially considering that every GM in the league now knows Garrett wants out. ', ""On top of that, Garrett, who has two years remaining on his contract, could be due for an extension, further muddying the water when it comes to compensation. Moreover, the Browns previously restructured Garrett's contract, so they'd be looking at a dead cap charge of over $36 million for 2025 if he was moved before June 1. "", ""All that said, let's dive in and try to cook up a trio of trade packages that could be appealing enough for the Browns to ship Garrett out of town."", 'Browns get: 2025 first-round pick (No. 28 overall), 2026 first-round pick\nLions get: Myles Garrett', ""The Detroit Lions have been meticulous and methodical when it comes to how they utilize their draft picks, and it's proven to be extremely successful. With that in mind, shipping out multiple first-rounders would be a break from that core belief by general manager Brad Holmes. But the ability to acquire a talent like Garrett could be enough to push those chips into the middle of the table to try and cash in on this Super Bowl window. If this deal were to come to fruition, the pairing of Garrett and Aidan Hutchinson would form the most-feared pass-rushing unit in the NFL and improve on a defense that already ranked fourth in the NFL in pressure rate in 2024. For Garrett, he'd get his wish to be on a Super Bowl contender, while Cleveland would gain two first-rounders with one sitting at No. 28 overall in 2025 and the other likely in a similar spot in 2026. "", 'Browns get: 2025 first-round pick (No. 29 overall), 2026 first-round pick, DT Daron Payne\nCommanders get: Myles Garrett', ""The Commanders are in a rare situation where they've secured a quarterback that was able to take them to the NFC Championship in Year 1. Having that level of quarterback play on a rookie contract is the ultimate cheat code in the NFL, and Washington would be wise to take advantage of it by surrounding Jayden Daniels with as much talent as humanly possible on all sides of the ball. Yes, bringing in Garrett would be costly but he'd also become the top figure on Dan Quinn's defense that was 14th in the NFL in pressure rate this season. By adding him to the unit, they'd likely vault into the top 10, possibly even top five. In a division where they need to keep up with the Philadelphia Eagles, the best way to combat them could be further bolstering the defense, so the price tag should be worth it even if it is high. "", 'Browns get: 2025 first-round pick (No. 4 overall), 2026 second-round pick\nPatriots get: Myles Garrett', ""This is one of the more interesting destinations that could be in the running for Garrett. On the surface, New England looks too far away to fit Garrett's desires of playing on a Super Bowl contender. However, the team did seem to establish its quarterback of the future in Drake Maye, and now has the most amount of cap space in the league to retool the roster, which could include Garrett. Meanwhile, there's already a preexisting relationship that could be a factor as Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel just spent the entire season in Cleveland as a coaching and personnel consultant, so he'd have firsthand knowledge of the type of player New England could be acquiring. "", ""As for the compensation, giving up a top-five pick in any draft is monumental, but it could make sense for the Patriots. If they believe the likes of Abdul Carter and Travis Hunter -- two of the few blue-chip prospects in this draft -- are going to be off the board by the time they are on the clock, it's possible they view Garrett as the better option than whoever they'd pluck at No. 4. Given how high that first-rounder is, it's not out of the realm of possibility Cleveland comes down on their two first-rounder asking price and settles for a second the following year.

The star pass rusher announced his request in a statement on Monday, acknowledging his admiration for Cleveland but emphasizing his desire to win a Super Bowl.', '""As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl -- and that goal fuels me today more than ever,"" Garrett said in a statement, via NFL.com. ""My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.', '""While I\'ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won\'t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.', '""With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.""', 'Garrett, 29, has been with the organization since the Browns drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft out of Texas A&M. Since his arrival into the league, Garrett has gone on to be one of the top defensive players in the entire league, which includes an NFL Defensive Player of the Year award during the 2023 season. ', 'The six-time All-Pro (two Second Team) has tallied seven consecutive seasons with double-digit sacks and has topped at least 14 sacks in each of the last four years. In 17 games played this season, Garrett totaled 14 sacks, 28 quarterback hits, three forced fumbles and a league-leading 22 tackles for loss. ', 'With this request now public, it will be fascinating to see how the Browns operate. A team source told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones: ""We\'re not entertaining offers for him.""', ""Just a few weeks ago, general manager Andrew Berry was asked directly about the possibility of trading Garrett, who is currently under contract through the 2026 season. To that speculation, Berry said that he wouldn't trade Garrett for two first-round picks, illustrating his lack of desire to move him. Now that the formal request is out there, however, it'll be interesting to see how that changes. "", ""As for where Garrett could end up, let's highlight a few potential landing spots."", ""Even with Aidan Hutchinson set to return in 2025 following a season-ending leg injury this past season, the Detroit Lions need some added game-breaking ability at pass rusher, ranking bottom third in the NFL in sacks in 2024. From a financial standpoint, Garrett's current contract is paying him a base salary of just $1.25 million and $1.3 million over the next two seasons and carries a cap hit of $19.7 million and $20.3 million, which should be relatively easy to absorb for clubs, including Detroit. The Lions have about $46.5 million in available space this offseason."", 'The club is also firmly within a Super Bowl window after earning the No. 1 seed in the NFC this season, which would give Garrett a strong opportunity to compete for a title and play in meaningful games late in the year. ', ""The Commanders have found their franchise quarterback in Jayden Daniels, who just led the club to an NFC Championship appearance. While Daniels is playing out his rookie contract, it'd be wise for Washington to capitalize on that QB discount by adding elite talent to other areas of the roster, which includes the defensive line. The Commanders have the third-most amount of cap space this offseason ($78.1 million), so they could easily afford to bring Garrett aboard and ink him to a new deal. He'd also seem to blend well with Dan Quinn's defense. This season, Washington ranked 14th in the league in pressure rate, so adding Garrett would vault that defense up inside the top 10 thus making the Commanders even more dangerous in Year 2 of the Daniels era. "", ""The pairing of Myles Garrett and Maxx Crosby would be the most lethal pass-rushing duo in the NFL. The Las Vegas Raiders are entering a new era after hiring Pete Carroll as head coach and have the second-highest amount of cap space ($92.5 million) in the league to reboot in a hurry. While playing alongside Crosby would be tantalizing, the main concern for Garrett would likely be Las Vegas' current quarterback situation, which is to say they don't have a clear answer at the position at the moment. If they can land a respectable signal-caller, that would certainly make them an even more desirable destination."", ""Would the Browns really trade Garrett inside the division? I have my doubts, but if you're the Bengals you absolutely make the phone call. They have the ninth-most cap space in the NFL, so they could afford to bring Garrett aboard. More importantly, Cincinnati needs a talent like Garrett to help get the franchise back on track. Despite explosive seasons from Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase offensively, the Bengals defense left little to be desired outside of Trey Hendrickson. They ranked 25th in total yards allowed per game (348.3) and points per game (25.5). Adding Garrett to combat quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen would do wonders in the Bengals possibly getting over the hump. Meanwhile, this would arguably be one of the top destinations for Garrett when factoring in his desire to win a Super Bowl. "", ""Some interesting connections between the Patriots and Browns could make New England a dark horse here. Of course, new Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel just spent the 2024 season with the Browns as a coaching and personnel consultant, so Garrett and the front office should have some familiarity with him. Meanwhile, New England's executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf was the Browns assistant GM back in 2018 when Berry was the vice president of player personnel, further establishing a relationship between the two franchises. "", ""The Patriots have by far the most amount of cap space in the NFL ($120 million) which would satisfy a potential Garrett extension, while also keeping the organization flexible enough to continue to add. Depending on how Garrett feels about rising second-year quarterback Drake Maye and the Patriots' ability to increase the talent across the depth chart, New England could be primed to bounce back rather quickly under this new coach-quarterback regime, giving him a shot to play more meaningful games late in the year.

Why it's unlikely the Bengals could trade for Myles Garrett,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2025/02/04/myles-garrett-trade-cincinnati-bengals-unlikely-cleveland-browns/78212222007/,"['Cleveland Browns All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns on Monday.', ""Garrett, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft, is widely viewed as the best defensive player in the NFL currently and will likely be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when he's done playing. He has 102.5 career sacks in his career and has recorded 13 sacks against the Bengals."", 'The Browns have maintained the stance they aren’t planning to deal their best player. It’s unclear what will happen over the next month as the NFL calendar turns quickly to the offseason after Super Bowl LIX on Sunday.', 'Typically, in these scenarios a team rarely admits they are open to shopping a player of Garrett’s caliber. That won’t stop teams from sending bids to the Browns as almost every team would be interested in having Garrett on their respective defense. Cleveland will certainly have some tough decisions moving forward regarding what they plan to do with Garrett based off the compensation they’ll receive.', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'If the Browns do in fact plan to trade Garrett, it’s highly unlikely they would ever let him join a team in their division, let alone the other team in the sate of Ohio. Cleveland won’t have any interest in helping one of their rivals get better.', 'The Bengals also wouldn’t be able to afford the contract extension Garrett will want from his next team or the Browns this offseason. Cincinnati’s main priority right now is to get contract extensions done for wide receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins and defensive end Trey Hendrickson. It’s not possible for the Bengals to have enough more to pay Hendrickson and Garrett while paying Joe Burrow and Chase.', 'There’s also the draft pick part of the discussion that makes Garrett to the Bengals not a deal that would make sense for the Bengals. Cleveland could get two first-round picks in exchange for Garrett and that’s something the Bengals would never be comfortable giving up.', 'Cincinnati’s front office values all of their draft picks – so much so they rarely move up in the draft because they don’t want to lose picks – and it’s almost impossible to think of a scenario in which they would give up two-first round picks. Especially now given the contracts for which they are on the hook. When an NFL team has one of the highest-paid quarterbacks and soon to be highest-paid wide receiver, it’s imperative to build the roster with cheaper contracts and those are acquired via the draft.', 'So, while it might be a fun fantasy for Bengals fans to imagine what a team with Garrett and Burrow could look like, it’s almost assuredly not going to happen.']"
"Teams Prepared To Trade First-Round Picks, More For Browns’ Myles Garrett",https://www.profootballrumors.com/2025/02/teams-prepared-to-trade-first-round-picks-more-for-browns-myles-garrett,"['Toward the end of the season, Myles Garrett raised the possibility of a trade sending him to a Super Bowl contender. The Browns remain insistent they will not consider doing so, but Monday saw the situation escalate with a formal trade request.', 'Cleveland’s stance on the situation has not changed in the wake of yesterday’s development, although that comes as no surprise since the team was aware of Garrett’s sentiment prior to his request going public. The Browns face a number of challenges this offseason, one in which a shift to a long-term rebuild is not the plan. Even if the team pursues upgrades in the near future (particularly at the quarterback position), though, the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year wants a fresh start.', 'As a result, attention has increasingly turned to the framework of any potential deal sending Garrett to a new team. General manager Andrew Berry‘s most recent comments on the situation made it clear a package including two first-round picks would not alter the team’s aversion to entertaining a trade. Early estimates on this front show a strong market will nevertheless be in place when suitors call about Garrett’s availability.', 'A poll of league executives and coaches from The Athletic’s Jeff Howe (subscription required) demonstrates the range of potential hauls the Browns could land in a Garrett deal. Three believe a package including two Day 1 selections could be in play, while there is a consensus that one first-rounder would be a feasible starting point. Pairing a first-round selection with at least one player or mid-round pick emerged as a realistic scenario for most of the respondents.', 'Two years remain on Garrett’s pact, with none of his outstanding base salary guaranteed. An extension would no doubt change that while tying him to the Browns, but it was reported Monday the former No. 1 pick’s request is not seen as a negotiating ploy. Even if Cleveland were to consider a trade, however, the cap implications would not make a deal easy to work out.', 'Garrett would account for more than $36MM in dead money if he were to be traded before June 1, adding further to the Browns’ unenviable financial situation. The team is currently over the projected 2025 ceiling, although moves like another Deshaun Watson restructure and releasing right tackle Jack Conklin should achieve cap compliance in the short term. The matter of Garrett’s option bonus money could complicate the timing of a trade, although Over the Cap’s Jason Fitzgerald writes an arrangement could be made for it to be removed from his existing pact to make a trade (and subsequent extension) feasible for an acquiring team.', 'A trade after June 1 would still create a notable dead money charge but it would produce nearly $5MM in cap saving for the Browns (barring adjustments to his pact in the near future, of course). Garrett’s next team could owe him as little as $14.8MM in cash in 2025 – if his option were to be removed or deferred – and $25MM in 2026. A blockbuster deal to acquire the four-time All-Pro would no doubt include a new contractual commitment, however, and a raise bringing him to or near the top of the edge rusher market would come as no surprise.', 'With that in mind (along with the fact he is entering his age-30 season), the number of genuine suitors for Garrett may become relatively limited. Waiting until after June 1 – and therefore receiving draft compensation for 2026 rather than this April’s event – could likewise dissuade the Browns from moving forward with a trade. Nevertheless, this situation could make for one of the league’s top offseason storylines if a strong market develops.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Myles Garrett, a six-time All-Pro and former NFL Defensive Player of the Year, has requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns.', 'Arguably the best defensive players in the league today, Garrett will likely be a popular target in case the Browns decide to honor his request. The New England Patriots, a team with vast resources both in terms of draft capital and salary cap space, could be among the teams pursuing the 29-year-old.', 'The Patriots, frankly, need of all the talent they can get their hands on after winning just eight combined games over the last two seasons. And talent is very much what Garrett has to offer.', 'So, should New England go after him? Let’s break down the arguments for and against such a move.', 'Generational talent: The Pro Bowl is more of a popularity contest than an accurate measurement for success in the NFL, but it still shows which players have managed to established themselves among the league’s best. Garrett has made the Pro Bowl six times in his career, the most for any first overall draft pick since Peyton Manning in 1998. This is not the only reason why he is a generational talent, but it serves as an illustration just how impactful he has been despite playing on some underwhelming Browns teams though the years. Players like that becoming available while still in their prime rarely happens.', 'Proven production: Garrett entered the league in 2017, and with the exception of his rookie year has managed to record double-digit sacks each season. He is leaving the 2024 campaign, and possibly his Browns tenure, with a total of 103.5 quarterback takedowns in a combined 120 regular season and playoff games. The volume of sacks alone is impressive, but so is the fact that he has managed to produce at a steady level year in and year out — something the Patriots have not seen from any of their defenders since Matthew Judon’s 38-game stint in New England (and even he was more up-and-down than Garrett).', 'Filling a major need: The Patriots’ outside linebacker position was a major concern last season, and remains so heading into 2025. Outside of Anfernee Jennings, who is a far better run defender than pass rusher, the team was unable to find consistent production on the edge — contributing to New England’s defense dropping from 19th to 29th in the league in pressure rate between 2023 and 2024. Adding Garrett would only be part of the solution, but a big one: he would fill the shoes previously worn by the since-traded Matthew Judon, and then some.', 'Leadership: The Patriots’ efforts to rebuild their defense cannot stop on the field; leadership, particularly under a new head coach, also will factor into any decisions being made this offseason. That also speaks for Garrett as a potential New England target: he has been voted a captain by his Browns teammates seven years in a row, and has been a tone-setter for the club in the locker room as well as on the gridiron itself.', 'Rising tide lifting all the boats: Garrett is one of the most disruptive players in football both as a run defender and a pass rusher, and somebody opposing offenses need to pay special attention to. This, in turn, would make life easier for New England’s other defenders across the board. Just look at it from this perspective: a defensive line headlined by Garrett, Christian Barmore and Keion White would have the potential to create some serious problems in the passing game, while also offering serious upside versus the run.', 'Mike Vrabel connection: Following his firing from the Tennessee Titans, new Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel joined the Browns as a consultant. While he may not have worked directly with Garrett as a result of that, he still worked in close proximity to the organization’s best player. Vrabel has shown that familiarity is important to him, as evidenced by his coaching hires so far this offseason, and if that extends to the players Garrett would be one of the first to come to mind.', 'Counterintuitive move: Ever since Eliot Wolf took over as the Patriots’ de facto general manager, the organization has tried to follow a “draft and develop” model of roster construction. Naturally, draft picks are key to that strategy — which is precisely why trading for Myles Garrett might be a tough sell internally. In order to acquire him, the fourth overall pick plus other assets would likely change hands. There is an argument that Garrett is one of the few players actually worth that price, but it still might be too steep for a New England team following a different team building plan.', 'Contractual outlook: From a contractual standpoint, acquiring Garrett via trade would be feasible: his cap hit in 2025 would be only $4.96 million, and there would be no remaining guarantees in a contract set to void in 2027. Obviously, though, the story is not that simple: Garrett would likely be looking for a new deal to be compensated among the top defensive linemen in football — a process that should be expected to result in him targeting Nick Bosa’s average of $34 million per season. With a quarterback on a rookie contract and the salary cap going up annually, that would be possible. The question is: would it make sense for New England given the state of its rebuild?', 'Age: Garrett has shown no signs of slowing down, and he should be expected to keep performing at a high level for the foreseeable future. However, the Patriots investing serious draft/player capital plus a top-of-the-market contract in a player set to turn 30 during the upcoming season would still come with a certain risk.', 'Three to tango: The Patriots may or may not have an interest in going after Garrett, but they are not the only ones making the call on the move. For it to work to everyone’s satisfaction, the team would also have to get both the Browns and Garrett’s camp on board. The former have not shown any signs that they are willing to move him, while the latter has indicated he wants to join a winner — something New England at this stage in its development is not. If the team senses that going after Garrett is a losing proposition, there would be no need to invest time and resources in trying to set something up.', 'As can be seen, there are more arguments in favor of a trade than not. However, the weight of those is not evenly distributed. The focus on drafting and developing, for example, might be a lot more important for the Patriots than acquiring a player who has a preexisting history with their new head coach.', 'At the end of the day, New England’s brain trust will have to filter through all the information to come to a conclusion.

In Roob's Eagles Observations: Can Howie Roseman pull off a Myles Garrett trade?,https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/roobs-eagles-observations-howie-roseman-myles-garrett-trade-saquon-barkley/646703/,"[""NEW ORLEANS – In our latest installment of Roob's 10 Daily Random Eagles Observations, we chat about Myles Garrett, a vastly underrated era of Eagles football and a play from the Eagles' last Super Bowl that I still can't believe really happened."", "" You want observations? We've got observations."", '1. I don’t know if Myles Garrett is a realistic target for the Eagles because of the financials, but I do know if there’s any way Howie Roseman can make it work it would be one hell of a move. Like most things, it comes down to money. Would the Browns even consider absorbing north of $35 million in dead money and giving up one of the best players in franchise history? Depends what they’d get back. And the Eagles won’t have the cap space this offseason that they usually have. Or a very good 1st-round pick. And Garrett’s production is still world-class and he’s shown no sign of slowing down, but he is 29. So there’s a lot to weigh. But three things come to mind. After joint Eagles-Browns joint practices in Berea, Ohio, two summers ago, we watched Garrett spend at least 15 minutes on the field talking football with Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata, and they all spoke later about the respect they have for each other. That doesn’t hurt. Second, like Saquon Barkley before he got here, Garrett has just never experienced what it’s like to be on an elite team, and that’s the only thing missing from his career and that’s all he wants at this point. The Browns are 53-78 since they drafted Garrett with the first pick in 2017 with one playoff win. The Eagles have been to three Super Bowls since he was drafted. So you know this is the type of team he wants to come to. And third, the Eagles’ edge position is really in flux. Josh Sweat has had an uneven season and is due to become a free agent. Brandon Graham turns 37 this spring and triceps injury or not his future is unclear. Jalyx Hunt has shown a lot of promise but his ceiling is unknown. And Bryce Huff is Bryce Huff. So it’s really Nolan Smith and a bunch of question marks. Garrett plays the position of greatest need on the roster. So mark this one down in the unlikely but intriguing category. And when Howie is involved, anything’s possible. You know he would love to pull this off.', '2. Travis Kelce isn’t a normal tight end, but it is notable that the Eagles were the No. 1 defense vs. tight ends in the NFL this year, allowing just 34.8 yards per game. Zach Ertz was really the only tight end to gash the Eagles with his 11-for-104 in the NFC Championship Game, and the Bengals’ Mike Gesicki had 73 yards, but those were both in blowout losses. But 13 of 20 tight ends who started vs. the Eagles this year had 37 or fewer yards. Now, a lot of that was with Nakobe Dean in the lineup, and he’s terrific in coverage. But Oren Burks has held his own as well since replacing Dean. The Eagles aren’t going to shut down Kelce, but the job they’ve done covering tight ends this year is reason to be somewhat optimistic.', '3. In four games before the bye, Jalen Hurts had six total touchdowns passing and rushing and seven turnovers. Since the bye week, he has 33 touchdowns and three turnovers.', ""4. This is an odd one, but the Eagles’ eight-longest Super Bowl running plays have all come in the first half. They’ve had eight Super Bowl runs longer than 10 yards – 21 and 36 yards by LeGarrette Blount, 11, 14 and 28 yards by Jalen Hurts, 26 yards by Jay Ajayi and 11 and 22 yards by Brian Westbrook. All before halftime. Their longest run from scrimmage after halftime has been a 10-yarder by Blount. Overall, they’ve averaged 4.5 yards per carry before halftime in their four Super Bowls (59 carries, 264 yards) but just 3.0 yards per carry after halftime (43-for-129). I have no clue what any of this means, but when you’re knocking out 10 random observations per day you’re going to get some weird ones. Anyway, I found it interesting. I also fully expect Saquon Barkley to wreck that particular trend in five days.\n\n5. Rodney Peete threw two touchdowns and eight interceptions in his last five regular-season starts in 1995. It’s the worst five-game stretch to finish a season in Eagles history. Then he threw three TDs and no INTs in the Eagles’ wild-card win over the Lions.\n\n6. The Eagles don’t get the credit they deserve for winning back-to-back NFL Championships in 1948 and 1949 by shutout. Since 1950, there have been only three championship game or Super Bowl shutouts – Packers 37, Giants 0 in 1961, Browns 27, Colts 0 in 1964, Bills 23, Chargers 0 in 1965. Five total since 1941, and two were courtesy of the Eagles in back-to-back seasons. No other team has won multiple championship shutouts at any point over the last 75 years. The Eagles did it twice in a row. Yet if you go to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the only recognition of this astounding achievement is a grainy team photo of the 1949 Eagles. But 7-0 over the Chicago Cardinals in 1948 at Shibe Park and 14-0 over the Rams in 1949 at L.A. Coliseum, holding the Cardinals to 135 yards and the Rams to 119? Are you kidding me? ΩThose 1947 and 1948 Eagles Championship teams should be revered in the NFL and worshipped in Philly and beyond.\n\n7. Jeff Lurie revealing Monday night that he’s not interested in buying the Celtics is tremendous news for Eagles fans. The last thing this franchise needs is for Lurie – one of the most successful owners in NFL history – to be less involved in the Eagles. It’s no coincidence that this franchise began winning soon after he bought it from Norman Braman in 1994 and other than a couple brief periods hasn’t stopped winning for 25 years. Lurie’s uncanny ability to hire the right people, to foster a culture of excellence throughout the NovaCare Complex and to provide the resources that his football people need to do their jobs the right away are huge reasons the Eagles have become regulars at the Super Bowl. If Lurie had bought the Celtics and either split his time between the two franchises or had his son Julian take over day-to-day operations of the Eagles, the dynamic that’s been so successful for a quarter of a century would have been forever altered. Lurie is 77 and one day in the not-too-distant future Julian probably will take over. But Lurie said Monday he’s as committed as ever to making sure the Eagles continue winning, and that’s a huge positive for the organization.'"", 'Find the latest Philadelphia Eagles news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Philadelphia.', '8. Saquon Barkley has as many touchdown runs of at least 60 yards this postseason as every other NFL running back has combined in the last 15 postseasons.', '9. With 27 points in the first half and 28 points in the second half in the NFC Championship Game, the Eagles became the first team in 35 years to score 27 or more points in each half of a postseason game. Last time it happened, the 49ers beat the Broncos 55-10 in Super Bowl XXIV at the Superdome, also with 27 points in the first half and 28 in the second. The only other teams to do this are the Bears in their 73-0 win over Washington in the 1940 NFL Championship Game (28, 45) and the Lions in their 59-14 win over the Browns in the 1957 NFL Championship Game (31, 28).', '10. The one play from Super Bowl LVII I still can’t believe is Kadarius Toney’s 65-yard punt return down to the Eagles’ 5-yard-line, which set up the touchdown that gave the Chiefs a 35-27 lead early in the fourth quarter. If you can handle watching the replay, you’ll see that after Toney catches the ball at the Chiefs’ 30-yard-line and begins sprinting toward the left sideline, he’s nearly engulfed by seven Eagles – T.J. Edwards, Zech McPhearson, Reed Blankenship, Zach Pascal, Patrick Johnson, Nakobe Dean and Jack Stoll. But they’re all either charging right at Toney or over-running him to Toney’s left. And there’s literally nobody to his right. So when he reverses field, there’s nobody there and he’s got a clear path down the right sideline. It was just an unbelievable breakdown in discipline and integrity at the worst possible moment, and Toney – whose next-longest career punt return is a 21-yarder – took full advantage.

Garrett's post effectively said he's tired of losing and wants to go to a team that has a better chance to compete for a Super Bowl than the Browns -- where he has spent the first eight years of his NFL career."", 'Garrett is 29 years old and one of the best players in the entire league, regardless of position. He finished second in sacks (14.5) and sixth in pass rush win rate (21.5%) this season. He also happens to play a premium position, though. Teams are often willing to spend big money and/or trade premium draft picks to land an edge rusher. The Browns have said publicly that they have no intention of trading Garrett, but if that were to change, they could expect to receive very attractive offers. That could mean multiple first-round picks, for example, or premium picks and a young star player on a rookie deal.', ""So while it remains possible that Garrett does not get traded, it's fun to imagine what it would look like if he did get moved -- and which teams would make the most sense for him.

In part, Garrett said, ""my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won\'t allow me to be complacent.""', ""Multiple team sources told ESPN in the aftermath of the trade request on Monday that the Browns have no plans to trade Garrett, the NFL's reigning Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the award again this season. Cleveland, which holds the second overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft, faces a busy offseason with a glaring quarterback question after Deshaun Watson's latest injury and needs across the roster."", 'While trading Garrett could in theory net the team the necessary assets to replenish the roster for the long term, there are hurdles to a deal, in addition to the on-field impact of jettisoning a franchise great who in December became the fourth-fastest player in NFL history to record 100 career sacks.', 'Twice in the past month, Browns general manager Andrew Berry publicly stated he had no intentions of trading Garrett. At the Senior Bowl last week, he told reporters that he would not entertain a hypothetical offer of two first-round picks for the franchise cornerstone. In addition, he said he was open to a new deal for Garrett, who has two years remaining on the five-year, $125 million extension that made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in 2020.', ""Garrett's trade request will test the limits of Berry's resolve."", ""However, the nature of Garrett's contract and the Browns' cap situation could make a trade unpalatable for Cleveland. In recent years, the organization has been aggressive in restructuring contracts to free short-term cap space and pushing cap hits into future years. The Browns have done that with Garrett's contract, so trading him before June 1 would bring a hefty dead cap charge of $36 million. A post-June 1 trade would come with a dead cap charge of $14.8 million and cap savings of almost $5 million. But any draft picks recouped by Cleveland would be in 2026 and future years, preventing the team from adding the young contributors it needs for a swift turnaround in 2025."", 'The Browns are already more than $60 million over the 2025 cap but the NFL permits teams to carry over unused cap space into the following league year.

The 2022 trade for Watson left Cleveland without a first-round pick for three straight seasons and the Browns relinquished additional draft capital to get the former Pro Bowler, in addition to giving him a fully-guaranteed $230 million deal. The move has left Cleveland with one of the oldest rosters in the league and a dearth of young talent on inexpensive, rookie deals.', ""Since making his debut in Cleveland, Watson has posted one of the lowest Total QBRs in the NFL and has sustained season-ending injuries in back-to-back years. He is likely to miss a significant portion of the 2025 season after retearing his right Achilles tendon, just three months removed from his initial surgery. Berry has said the team's quarterback room will look different in 2025 and the organization has been pondering additions both in free agency and the draft."", 'Despite the three-win season -- one that followed an 11-6 record in the 2023 season and a trip to the wild-card round -- Berry has been optimistic that the team could quickly reverse its fortunes, pointing to the success of the Washington Commanders, who like the Browns held the No. 2 pick last year.', 'The question now is if Garrett will be around to assist the Browns in those efforts.']"

San Francisco 49ers edge Nick Bosa tops the list at $34 million annually. "", ""Barry said the Browns are interested in extending Garrett's contract. But if the Texas native doesn't want to be in Cleveland for the long term, the Browns could be forced to make a move."", 'Garrett has 102.5 sacks in eight seasons for Cleveland, which made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft. But the Browns have a 53-78 record during his tenure, which includes an 0-16 campaign his rookie year.', 'If Garrett is looking to play for a winner, here are five destinations that make sense.', 'Detroit Lions ', ""Even though the Lions lost offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, their Super Bowl window remains open, and general manager Brad Holmes isn't afraid to take big swings to improve Detroit's roster. The team's best pass-rusher, Aidan Hutchinson, will return from an injury next season, but the Lions still need major help up front defensively. The addition of Garrett would give Detroit one of the best closers in the game to pair with one of the most explosive offenses in the league. According to Over the Cap, the Lions have more than $45 million in projected salary cap space, so they are in position to make a move. "", 'Washington Commanders ', ""Who doesn't want to play with one of the best young quarterbacks in the league? Jayden Daniels and head coach Dan Quinn had the Commanders one win away from the Super Bowl in their first season. To get there, Washington needs pass-rush help and could use a dynamic player like Garrett to improve the overall defense. Washington also can offer Garrett a new deal, with a projected $78.1 million in salary cap space, No. 3 in the NFL. "", 'Los Angeles Chargers ', 'The Chargers were limited in what they could do in free agency last offseason due to cap constraints, but they are projected to have more than $60 million available this offseason, which means they could afford a top-flight pass-rusher like Garrett. They could clear even more cap space by moving on from talented but oft-injured defensive end Joey Bosa. Khalil Mack, second on the team with 6 sacks this past season, is a pending unrestricted free agent. Defensive coordinator Jesse Minter created one of the top defenses in the NFL last season, and with someone like Garrett in the fold, the Chargers would be even more dangerous facing Patrick Mahomes twice a year. ', 'San Francisco 49ers', ""The 49ers will look to get back to a championship-caliber defense with Robert Saleh returning as the team's defensive coordinator. San Francisco already has one of the best defensive players in the game in Nick Bosa. Fellow edge rusher Leonard Floyd finished with 8.5 sacks in his first season with the team. However, the 49ers restructured defensive tackle Javon Hargrave's deal in December, which was seen as a precursor for his release this offseason. Hargrave's departure would create more cap space for a splashy move like bringing in Garrett, giving the 49ers a dangerous pass rush to once again make a Super Bowl run. San Francisco has a projected $48 million in cap space, which places them in the top 10 in the NFL."", 'New England Patriots ', 'New Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel served as an offensive consultant for the Browns last season and likely has a relationship with Garrett from his time there. Yes, New England is rebuilding, but the Patriots have a franchise quarterback in Drake Maye and a culture of winning built by Bill Belichick. Owner Robert Kraft is committed to putting together a championship-caliber team, and the AFC East is a winnable division with Vrabel now in the fold. The Patriots also have the most projected salary cap space heading into free agency at $120 million.', 'Eric D.

They've already lost Aaron Glenn this offseason, so giving new defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard a blue-chip piece up front might not be the worst idea ever hatched. The Lions could make it work, cost-wise, they appear entrenched as contenders for the foreseeable future, and GM Brad Holmes has never backed down from making risky, franchise-altering moves."", '', ""It's hard not to drool at the possibility of Aidan Hutchinson rushing from one side of the line and Garrett crashing in from the other. The NFC North is loaded with electric offenses. Garrett & Hutch would give the Lions the best edge duo in the NFL (not to mention, elite buddy-cop skit potential)."", ""General manager Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn deserve infinite praise for how they reconstructed and coached up Washington's roster in Year 1, leading to a 12-5 season that few saw coming. However, it ended with a thud in Philadelphia, as the Commanders allowed 55 points while underscoring the team's biggest weakness it could no longer hide."", '', ""Dante Fowler Jr. had 10.5 sacks in one of his best seasons, but he's a free agent who turns 31 in this coming summer, and there's a reason he's been a hired gun over the past few years. Garrett is a vastly better player all around, and he'd headline a heck of a front alongside DTs Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne. Watching the success Quinn had with Micah Parsons in Dallas opens up the possibilities of what the coach could do with a different but equally impactful defender in Garrett."", ""It's debatable whether the Cardinals are true contenders, although they were sitting at 6-4 and in first place heading out of their bye week before crumbling down the stretch this past season. Arizona forged its way to 41 sacks, scheming up pressure well, but no Cardinals defender had more than Zaven Collins' team-leading tally of five. The Cards also struggled to contain the run, an oft-overlooked element of Garrett's game. "", '', 'The Cardinals have the draft capital and funds to make such a move, even if they also need to add CB help and more weapons for Kyler Murray this offseason. But you know Jonathan Gannon would love to have the kind of firepower Garrett could supply, pairing him opposite 2024 first-rounder Darius Robinson on what would be a remade Arizona front.', ""The Bears' pass rush -- and defense as a whole -- was a disappointment this season. They had 40 sacks, which put them around the middle of the pack in the league, but their leading sacker (Montez Sweat) had just 5.5 of them. It's not hard to see how Garrett would provide an upgrade up front, especially given Chicago's issues against the run, too.  "", '', 'GM Ryan Poles has the assets (three picks in the top 41 overall in 2025) and the money to spend. Bears fans certainly would love to have Garrett after watching him notch a career-high 4.5 sacks (in just 37 snaps) in a game against Chicago in 2021. But new head coach Ben Johnson also needs to build around QB Caleb Williams this offseason, especially on the offensive line. Would a Garrett trade hinder those efforts?', ""Once upon a time, the Packers signed Reggie White to one of the most shocking free agency coups in franchise history, ultimately helping Green Bay win Super Bowl XXXI, as the pass rusher racked up three sacks on the game's biggest stage. Trading for Garrett this offseason could be equally as historic -- and it would be just as shocking."", '', ""Would GM Brian Gutekunst give up the draft capital necessary to make such a move? That's debatable. Then again, Gutekunst recently lamented his team's lack of pass rush, saying he ideally wanted to pressure more without having to blitz heavily. Adding Garrett would be an easy fix -- albeit an expensive one. He might be able to unlock some of the young pass-rush talent already on the roster, too."", ""You can never count out the Eagles and Trader Howie Roseman on a deal, especially when a name with the heft of MYLES GARRETT comes available.

Joey Bosa had an injury-plagued season and could be a cut candidate this offseason. Khalil Mack still played at a high level but is headed for free agency and will turn 34 this month.', '', ""Trading for Garrett would allow the Bolts to move on from both players if desired, giving coordinator Jesse Minter another weapon up front and making the defense younger in that area, too. Even if we assume Mack isn't back in this scenario, an edge combo of Garrett and Tuli Tuipulotu would work pretty well in the rough-and-tumble AFC West."", ""The Falcons make good sense as a potential Garrett destination. They reside in the wide-open NFC South. They're in a dome, playing in more favorable conditions than the harsh winters of Cleveland. Atlanta also has a defensive-minded head coach in Raheem Morris and remains -- for the past several seasons -- in need of pass-rush help."", '', ""We probably need to see what happens with Kirk Cousins and what the financial ramifications will be, as the Falcons are projected to be more than eight figures over the salary cap. They can cut salaries to help clear space, but they're lower on this list because it would take clearing some major hurdles just to get in position to potentially execute such a move."", ""This might be the longest-shot team on the list from one perspective, as Garrett has said he wants to play for a contender, and the 4-13 Patriots have a long way to go to get back to being that.

I should have found a belt.', 'I thought the cap hit would be crippling. It’s not. On closer examination of the breakdown posted by Spotrac.com, it looks like the cap charge for a trade before the fifth day of the new league year (March 16) would give the Browns a $32.95 million dead-money charge for 2025.', 'Garrett’s existing cap number for 2025 is $19.722. The Browns are currently projected to be $27.5 million over the cap, with dead money of $39.73 million. They’ll realize significant savings if/when they restructure Deshaun Watson’s deal (again). He currently has a cap charge in excess of $72 million.', 'Most of Garrett’s 2025 compensation comes in the form of an $18.54 million option bonus due on March 16. If he refuses to play, the Browns would be able to recover the money. (Based on the terms of payment — if, for example, it’s paid out in equal installments during the 18-week regular season — they could simply withhold it and not have to try to recover it.)', 'Regardless of how the Browns would work their salary-cap magic wand, trading Garrett would create a significant but not insurmountable cap complication.

And a lot of things to get to, both including, and aside from, the Chiefs and Eagles …', '• News of the day for Monday: Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett publicly requested a trade.', 'And the fact it wasn’t news to Cleveland tells you where this thing is.', 'Garrett’s decision to go public with a request that’s been in for days reflects a couple of things. First, it’s that the Browns had already communicated to him they aren’t going to deal him—if they hadn’t, Garrett would’ve let things play out more quietly. Second, given the fact that this was done via written statement, this was planned out—and done with a purpose.', 'That purpose, to me, is to push the Browns to the ledge. Now, whether GM Andrew Berry wants to or not, calls are going to come in. He’ll get a real idea on Garrett’s value without having to lift a finger. And rather than have that come via a targeted circle of teams the Browns prefer to deal with, it’ll come from everyone.', 'So what’s Garrett’s value? In calling around over the last day, it’s pretty clear that the baseline is two first-round picks. That, of course, could be affected by how high a team’s first-rounder is—obviously, dealing a top-10 pick would mean adding a lot less additional compensation than if the centerpiece of the deal was in the 20s—but history tells us the Browns should be able to get two ones, and additional considerations.', 'Taking quarterbacks out of the equation, the closest recent comps would probably be cornerback Jalen Ramsey, offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil, outside linebacker Khalil Mack and safety Jamal Adams. Mack was the earliest of these deals and the return included two first-rounders, but with givebacks that brought the net a little below that sort of value. The Adams and Tunsil trades included other players, muddying the math a little, but included two ones with sweeteners beyond that. The Ramsey trade (to the Los Angeles Rams in 2019) brought back two ones and a four to Jacksonville.', ""Garrett, at 29, is older than all those guys were. You could also argue he's a better player than any of them. So, again, two ones and then some is a reasonable starting point, and one that was pretty much unanimously agreed on by the guys I texted with on Monday."", 'Now, that doesn’t mean Berry is going to trade him.', 'But, at the very least, he will get a chance to see what the return would be. Which, Garrett would hope, might end up motivating a deal.', '• The Tom Brady influence has continued to wash over Las Vegas, and with a very clear theme as I see it—having the ex-Patriot and Buccaneer quarterback’s respect coming in is a factor.', 'New GM John Spytek, as we’ve detailed, ran Brady’s Tuesday personnel meetings for the three years Brady was in Tampa (along with Bucs director of player personnel Rob McCartney), and became an invaluable resource for him in readying for whichever opponent was in front of Tampa. Pete Carroll, of course, was on the other side of the seven-time champion quarterback in one of the greatest Super Bowls ever—falling with the Seahawks to Brady’s Patriots in the final minutes.', 'And at the coordinator level, holdover DC Pat Graham was with Brady in New England, and OC Chip Kelly, in a roundabout way, was responsible for Brady’s offense evolving. Just before Kelly went to the NFL, hired by the Eagles in 2013, he’d huddled with the Patriots staff to teach them his Oregon “blur” offense, that weaponized tempo and pace to obliterate Pac-12 (and Pac-10 before that) defenses.', 'New England adapted by simplifying its terminology, continuing to empower Brady to run the show from the line, and the Patriots rolled through the rest of the NFL, which struggled to keep up with the concepts of the college game. So the Raiders’ willingness to go the extra mile to land Kelly is, yes, in part Carroll’s admiration for his former rival. But it’s also Brady’s.', 'While we’re there, the Raiders also brought over Mark Thewes from the Broncos. Where Thewes did work with Spytek for three years in Denver, he also had a tie to Brady, in that Josh McDaniels, a high school buddy of his, brought him into the league in 2009. McDaniels and Brady remain very close.', 'So just months into his ownership, Brady’s fingerprints are all over the organization. He’ll still be living in Florida day-to-day and, as such, won’t be lording over the folks he helped put in place. In the words of one Vegas staffer, “He’s definitely involved, and he’s making an impact where he wants to be and feels like he needs to be.” In other words, he’ll be a powerful resource for the guys running it to have. In fact, he already has been one.', '• It was interesting to see a player, rather than his team, get the news out that he’s on the trade block as Cooper Kupp did Monday. And good for him—it’s fair for Kupp to want to make sure people have his side and to have the chance to protect his legacy in Los Angeles.', 'That said, this is another one that didn’t come out of nowhere.', 'Back before the trade deadline, the Rams fielded calls (though they didn’t make calls) on the availability of Kupp. Their response was that it’d take at least what the New York Jets gave Vegas for Davante Adams (a third-rounder that could become a second) to pull Kupp away from the team that drafted him in Sean McVay’s first spring in charge. Their stance, at the time, was they couldn’t give away a franchise icon in-season.', 'Instead, they’ll have the chance to do it in the offseason. And Kupp has leverage.', 'He’s due a $7.5 million roster bonus in March and $5 million of it is already fully guaranteed. Throw in his $12.5 million base for 2025, and he’s on the books for $20 million next year. Good as his career has been, no one is paying that for a 31-year-old receiver coming off a 700-yard season who’s missed a total of 18 games the past three years, and hasn’t missed fewer than five in any single season since winning the triple crown and the Super Bowl in 2021.', 'So the Rams have to thread the needle of trading him to a team that he’s willing to renegotiate his deal with, with $5 million already locked in, and another $2.5 million coming if he’s still on the roster in mid-March. That, of course, will take cooperation from Kupp, and means, in all likelihood, the Rams having to take less for him than they’d like.', 'Why move on then? Well, I think part of it’s all this water under the bridge, and also that Kupp and Puka Nacua, as good as they are individually, are a little redundant to one another in what they bring to the receiver group.', '• Andy Reid said at his press conference on Tuesday that he plans to coach in 2025, which is great news for both the Chiefs and the league.', '“I enjoy being around the guys,” Reid said. “I enjoy the football games. You can’t put in the hours that we do and not enjoy it. So, I really love the game.”', 'It also will give Reid a chance to keep chasing history. As it stands, he’s three games behind Bill Belichick for the all-time playoff wins record—he’s at 28—and with a win Sunday, he’d be positioned to pass Belichick next season. Playoffs included, he’s at 301 wins, which is fourth all-time behind Don Shula (347), Belichick (333) and George Halas (324), which gives him a shot to move into second as soon as 2026.', 'Another first that I think is remarkable is that he’s the first coach ever to spend a decade leading two different franchises, now being 12 seasons in with the Chiefs after 14 leading the Eagles. Which has set him up to be the only coach ever to win 100 games with multiple teams.', 'Of course, his focus is on Sunday. There’s an opportunity there, too, to pull into a tie for second all-time in Super Bowl wins with Pittsburgh’s Chuck Noll, behind only Belichick.', '• One element of Nick Caley’s hire as Houston Texans offensive coordinator that shouldn’t be overlooked—his ability to forge a trusting relationship with C.J. Stroud.', 'That’s long been one of Caley’s strengths. In New England, his first position-coach job was tight ends, making him Rob Gronkowski’s coach at a time when Gronkowski was already an all-time great—and at odds with Patriot management. He navigated that, and eventually moved on to Los Angeles where he was able to fit in with a completely new staff, and within a new system.', 'I think the “players, not plays” refrain applies to Caley’s coaching style. Because of that, and his ability to connect with people, I think Stroud will really like him.', '• An element of Klint Kubiak’s hire in Seattle that got my attention was how detailed he showed himself to be in the interview, as he took the Seahawks’ crew through his scheme, his philosophy on situational football and his approach to fundamentals.', 'At times, that detail was missing last season with Ryan Grubb moving from the college game to the pros, in particular in the run game.', '• New Patriots OC Josh McDaniels and Doug Marrone, hired last week to be the offensive line coach, are going to have a key relationship in making a reimagined New England scheme work. McDaniels has spent a lot of time over the past year with college programs, and some NFL teams, to try to work and make his system a little more user-friendly for young players. Now, he’ll meld that with some Marrone philosophy in the run game.', 'Marrone, by the way, is one of a number of hires on that side of the ball from outside the old Patriot family, with former coordinators Thomas Brown and Todd Downing in that category, too. The good news? The position coaches were motivated to take jobs with New England not just by their relationships with Mike Vrabel, but a desire to learn the McDaniels system.', '• Three days in, this is the best Super Bowl city. There’s no way the wait for the next one (it was last here after the 2012 season) should be nearly as long.', '', ""© 2025\nABG-SI LLC.\n- SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

The Athletic’s Zac Jackson and the rest of the NFL staff found ten potential suitors and what it might take to garner the six-time Pro-Bowler’s services.', 'One of the suitors just so happens to be the Atlanta Falcons, and Athletic beat writer Josh Kendall outlined a surprisingly realistic trade proposal for Atlanta and their current roster construction.', 'Browns get: 2025 first-round pick (No. 15) and 2026 first-round pick', 'Falcons get: Garrett', 'Making this move would be risky for the Falcons, but if an elite edge rusher is available, they have to at least get all the decision-makers in a room and have the discussion. The Falcons are famously bad at rushing the passer. They were 31st in the NFL in sacks this season (31) and last in the league over the past five (141) and 10 seasons (298).', 'Still, they can’t overpay. The Falcons’ roster has too many depth holes to fill to give away a lot of draft picks. Atlanta could afford to send out its 2025 and 2026 first-rounders, though, because its top-end offensive talent is in place and Garrett’s presence would raise the level of every defensive player on the roster. Anything beyond that is too much because this team is not one player away from being a contender, even if that player is Garrett.', 'Everything outlined by Kendall checks out: The Falcons have one of the more exciting offenses in place, especially with the young core of skill position talent to build around. Bijan Robinson, Drake London, Darnell Mooney, and Tyler Allgeier are all under 28 and have consistently contributed to Atlanta as they have rebuilt their offense post-Matt Ryan, and Michael Penix is now at the helm of the offense.', 'Garrett’s presence on a defense alone raises the floor and the ceiling, and if any defense needs a higher floor, it’s the Falcons, especially in the pass-rush department. Since Pro-Football-Reference started gathering pressures as a statistic (2018), Atlanta is dead last with 874. In that span, they are also fifth-worst in defensive yards per play allowed and EPA/play allowed and second-worst in defensive success rate.', 'Even with all of this, there’s one problem, and Kendall addresses this: The Falcons aren’t Super Bowl contenders as soon as Garrett enters the facility. The talent on the defensive side of the ball isn’t ready for any playoff run, let alone a deep one.', 'That doesn’t mean the Falcons can’t acquire some defensive talent, even with the Kirk Cousins debacle going awry. According to OverTheCap.com, Atlanta has the most maximum restructuring potential of any team, with over $146 million that could be manufactured.', 'So, is the Garrett dream completely out of the picture? Absolutely not. Fontenot has proven that he is willing to be aggressive in his approach to roster construction. Even if they did not pan out, the aggressiveness of Justin Simmons and Matthew Judon moves made it known that Terry was willing to shirk complacency and do what needed to be done to field a competitive team.', 'With Garrett’s no-trade clause in effect, Fontenot will have to prove that he can do more than field a competitive team (which is debatable in its own right), he has to prove that he can field a Super Bowl contender.', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

A Letter from the Editor: Myles Garrett requests a trade... Would Steelers edge T.J. Watt ever do the same?,https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2025/2/3/24357973/myles-garrett-trade-request-tj-watt-pittsburgh-steelers-playoffs,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Pittsburgh’s star edge rusher is still seeking his first playoff win', 'Despite finishing their 2024 campaign with yet another winning season under HC Mike Tomlin, the reigning theme for Pittsburgh Steelers fans this offseason has been one of frustration — frustration regarding another winless postseason and what appears to be another season without significant changes on the coaching front.', 'Pittsburgh fans aren’t the only ones frustrated in the AFC North, though.', 'Cleveland Browns DE Myles Garrett — reigning Defensive Player of the Year — is also frustrated. That frustration went on the record in a big way Monday, as ESPN’s Adam Schefter (among others) reported that Garrett had officially requested a trade.', 'In his official statement, Garrett said, “While I’ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won’t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete and win a Super Bowl.”', 'The contents of the statement are unsurprising. Of course, the ultimate goal of most every NFL player is to hoist a Lombardi Trophy, right? So, it would seem natural that those frustrations expressed by Garrett could foreshadow potential frustrations for Steelers star edge rusher T.J. Watt. Despite leading the NFL in sacks (108), tackles for loss (126) and forced fumbles (33), tacking on 49 passes defended and 7 INT — ridiculous coverage stats for a pass rusher — dating back to his drafting in 2017, Watt is still seeking his first NFL playoff win. Maddening, right? How could a player so talented and productive be stuck on a team so successful, yet so underwhelming?', 'It doesn’t take much imagination to imagine Watt approaching a similar level of frustration. How long can one reasonably be expected to trot out, giving his all, year after year, without a true lack of accountability on behalf of the front office and coaching staff for the team’s failures or any meaningful change within the organization?', 'Speculation regarding Watt’s state of frustration is all conjecture, of course. I do not claim to have any knowledge of personal frustrations from Watt or stirrings of a potential trade request now or at any time in the future. I do, however, have some experience with human emotions, the desire for greatness and the frustrations that arise when you’re not achieving it. Why would Watt, an ultimate competitor, former Defensive Player of the Year and the heartbeat of the Pittsburgh Steelers defense feel any differently?', 'The Steelers organization is one of loyalty — to a fault, in most cases. It’s been clear that Art Rooney II has no intention of turning his back on Tomlin and opting for a “fresh start” given the lack of recent playoff success or end-of-season collapses that feel like they’ve become the new “Standard.” At what point does that “loyalty” become “complacency”?', 'Watt will turn 31 years old in October; there’s no denying he’s very likely in the back half of his NFL career. Meanwhile, the Steelers’ late-season collapse and lack of a franchise quarterback indicate the Steelers may not be all that much closer to contention than the Cleveland Browns, despite Pittsburgh’s annual winning record.', 'It doesn’t seem all that likely that Watt would ever actually request a trade. But watching Cam Heyward loyally play his entire career in Pittsburgh without a Super Bowl to this point doesn’t exactly paint a picture of hope for Watt’s future, either.', 'Would you consider requesting a trade if you were T.J. Watt?', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here. GamblingHelpLineMA.org or call (800) 327-5050 for 24/7 support (MA). Visit www.mdgamblinghelp.org (MD).

Dolphins fans ought hope for it but perhaps not bet on it.', 'The complications are many when a high-priced, veteran star player wants out of his contact and demands a trade -- as the Miami Heat is presently experiencing with Jimmy Butler.', 'Butler has turned down overtures from Memphis and now Golden State, saying he would not sign an extension if traded there and still insisting on getting to Phoenix as the Heat scramble to get something for their suspended malcontent before Thursday’s NBA trade deadline.', 'The complications with Garrett wanting out include him being under contract for two more seasons and Cleveland understandably not wanting to trade him because he’s really good -- second in sacks only to Pittsburgh’s T.J. Watt since entering the league in 2017.', 'Said Browns general manager Andrew Berry after the 3-14 season: “My anticipation, expectation is that he’ll have a direct ticket from Cleveland to Canton at the end of his years and expect him to be here and retire a Brown, quite frankly.”', 'Further muddying any interest on Miami’s part would be the desire of Garrett, 29, to go from the dregs of Cleveland to a contender as he spends his late-prime still chasing a championship.', 'Said Garrett in requesting a trade: “While I’ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won’t allow me to be complacent.
