Enterprises, therefore, emphasize transparency and explainability to gauge the effectiveness of AI-generated response.”', 'Adobe’s AI-driven contract intelligence is positioned as a transformative tool for businesses looking to streamline workflows and mitigate legal risks. However, as AI’s role in contract management expands, organizations must balance automation with human oversight to ensure compliance, accuracy, and accountability.', 'With contract complexity increasing across industries, AI-powered solutions offer a potential path to efficiency — but experts warn that their effectiveness will depend on how well enterprises integrate AI with existing legal and compliance frameworks.', 'Gyana is a contributing writer.', 'Sponsored Links']"

Adobe listed a few potential uses for the feature and said you can use it to check apartment leases, to verify out-of-country charges for mobile plans and to compare perks or amenities of competing services. It could be even more useful if you regularly have to take a look at multiple contracts for your work or business."", ""Of course, you'd have to trust the AI assistant to actually be able to spot important information and catch both small and significant changes between different contracts. If it works properly, then it could be one of Acrobat AI's most useful features, seeing as users (according to Adobe itself) open billions of contracts each month on the Acrobat app. The Acrobat AI Assistant isn't free, however. It's an add-on that will cost you $5 a month whether or not you're already paying for Adobe's other services and products.""]"
Adobe debuts intelligent contract capabilities in Acrobat AI Assistant,https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/adobe-debuts-intelligent-contract-capabilities-in-acrobat-ai-assistant,"['Adobe (ADBE) announced new intelligent contract capabilities in Acrobat AI Assistant to simplify working with contracts. The new generative AI features can help customers grasp complex terms and spot differences between multiple agreements so they can better understand and verify the information in these important documents, faster and easier. From credit card and vendor agreements to loyalty programs and purchase orders, contracts are a fact of life for consumers and businesses. Most contracts are long and complicated, making it difficult and time-consuming to understand their contents. In fact, a new survey by Adobe Acrobat found that nearly 70% of consumers have signed contracts or agreements without knowing all the terms and 64% of SMB owners say they avoided signing a contract because they were not confident they understood the content. “Customers open billions of contracts in Adobe Acrobat each month and AI can be a game changer in helping simplify their experience,” said Abhigyan Modi, senior vice president of Adobe Document Cloud. “We are introducing new capabilities to deliver contract intelligence in Adobe AI Assistant, making it easier for customers to understand and compare these complex documents and providing citations to help them verify responses, all while keeping their data safe.” Other companies in a similar space include LegalZoom.com (LZ), CS Disco (LAW), Intapp (INTA) and DocuSign (DOCU).', '', '', 'Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.', '', '']"
