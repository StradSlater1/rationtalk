So you’ll definitely want to make sure you grab all four armor sets while the Premium Pass is available as you will secure them early for a steep discount before they enter the Shop.', 'Obviously, these are some significant changes to the format, and we are eager to continue listening to feedback from players as you get your hands on Operation: Frontlines and this updated experience. Let us know what you think!', 'Secure the Premium Pass for access to all 50 tiers and instantly unlock the BR75A2 Hammer weapon model for the BR75 Battle Rifle, Xenothreat weapon coating, Sequence Assembly weapon charm, and Pattern Seeker visor.', 'The Assault mode—a fan-favorite since Halo 2—is en route to Halo Infinite!', 'Each team defends their bomb site as they battle over a neutral bomb in the center of the map, aiming to escort the intrepid and heroic bomb carrier to the enemy base to arm and detonate it.', 'Of course, Assault is a mode that comes with multiple variants as well. When it arrives with the Spring Update, you’ll be able to play both Neutral Bomb and One Bomb.', 'The bombastic action will be available in both 4v4 and Squad Battle’s 8v8 modes. So, if you’ve been jonesing for some One Bomb on High Ground or Kusini Bay, the wait ends today.', 'For more information, be sure to check out the Assault Playlist Blog when it launches next Tuesday.', 'WEAPONS', 'Heatwave', 'Previously, the vertical fire on the Heatwave was set in a custom position providing a consistent close to long range damage output making this a deadly shotgun-like weapon from all ranges. To address player feedback about the Heatwave being too effective at longer ranges, we’ve made changes to how its projectiles behave while using its vertical shot.', 'In addition to a slightly slower rate of fire for the weapon all-up, the vertical fire projectiles will now slowly spread out as they travel further distances. This spread now matches the characteristics of the horizontal fire, helping to reduce its performance at range.', 'Stalker Rifle', 'The Stalker Rifle has been emerging as an extremely powerful weapon in Arena gameplay, especially after the Bandit’s rate-of-fire was decreased. To keep the Stalker Rifle’s power in check relative to the Bandit, it will also be getting a rate-of-fire decrease.', 'The Stalker Rifle should still be an important on-map pickup, but it shouldn’t feel like a one-sided fight when going up against it anymore.', 'Disruptor', ""The Disruptor, which is part of the Pistol class of weapons, has been overperforming outside of its intended range, much like previous iterations of the Mk50 Sidekick. The damage output at close range feels like it's in a good place, but its ability to deal that damage at mid-to-long range—specifically against enemy Spartans at those distances—was proving to be too much."", 'To minimize the effectiveness at long ranges against Spartans, the bloom properties are getting an update. It’s also important to note that while we wanted to reduce its impact on Spartans at range, it’s critical that the weapon retains its ability to EMP vehicles over long distances in larger battlefields.', 'When the update launches, the Disruptor will take longer to have its bloom reset and have increased error angles, resulting in less impact on smaller targets at range.', 'On Ranked maps, the Disruptor will also have its initial ammo reduced to ensure its total kill potential can remain in check.', '(Low) 0.125 >> 0.2\n(High) 0.125 >> 0.35', '(Low) 0.35 >> 0.35\n(High) 0.8 >> 1', 'CQS48 Bulldog', 'Similar to the Stalker Rifle, the Bulldog also had started to emerge as an extremely impactful weapon after the Bandit’s rate-of-fire reduction. To ensure players have a more balanced fight when going up against the Bulldog, its rate-of-fire will be slowing down slightly, and its headshot multiplier will be removed. These adjustments should help the Bulldog’s power better align with the rest of the sandbox.', 'Shock Rifle', 'The Shock Rifle has demonstrated greater effectiveness at longer ranges than anticipated when used in hip fire. To encourage zooming in for long-range engagements, the range at which aim magnetism kicks in will be brought in a bit. Since no-scoping was also proving to be a little too easy at high-skill levels, the auto-aim angles have been adjusted to make each shot more skillful when firing from the hip.', 'MA40 AR', 'In a previous update, the MA40 AR received a tuning pass that adjusted its bloom properties. While it increased the consistency of the weapon at full bloom, we heard the feedback that it bloomed out too quickly, with many stating that they missed its accuracy on the first few shots. In response to that feedback, we’ll be bringing those initial shots back to their previous state.', 'To help balance out the feel of this initial buff, the AR’s max bloom state when going fully-auto will be expanded more and its headshot multiplier will be removed.', 'Lower bound deceleration time: 0.3 >> 0.22\nDeceleration time: 0.24 >> 0.17', '(Low): 0.25 >> 0.25\n(High): 1.3 >> 2.1', 'GRENADES', 'Frag Grenade Physics', 'The “bounciness” of Frag Grenades has been increased, allowing players to make creative, skillful plays. This will bring the bounce physics a little more in line with previous titles, while also reducing instances of grenades feeling stuck to the ground or not having successful bounces.', 'Grenade Cast Time', 'Halo Infinite’s grenade cast time—aka the time it takes for a player to throw a grenade and reset—was the fastest in the franchise by a pretty large margin.', 'For example, here are some average rates (grenades per second) from previous games:', 'While grenades are a key element of Halo gameplay, we felt that the ability to throw multiple grenades at such a rapid rate or throw a grenade and then shoot quickly after was having a negative effect on the core combat loop.', ""To help improve the feel of the Halo combat dance, we'll be bringing the grenade throw rate more in line with previous titles. This should both reduce the feeling of “grenade spam” and increase the intentionality of each grenade thrown."", 'MOVEMENT', 'Strafe Acceleration', 'It’s happening!', 'Strafe acceleration values are being updated to improve the feel of gameplay engagements across the board. This adjustment will help address community feedback on topics such as jiggle-peeking behind cover and reduce instances of opponents changing directions at seemingly unnatural speeds when strafing.', 'The adjustment to these strafe scalars should bring the overall “feel” of Halo Infinite’s combat even more in line with previous Halo titles.', 'NEW RANKED MAP & RANKED MAP REFRESH', 'A new map has arrived in Ranked!', 'ORIGIN\nCredits: Karmaplex, DarkMaiming, HiImMike', 'A fan-favorite returns as Origin, a remake of Coliseum from Halo 5: Guardians makes its way into Halo Infinite’s Ranked playlists. Remade in Forge, you’ll get to see the map with Halo Infinite’s Forerunner aesthetics.', 'Origin will be playable in Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, and Ranked Doubles when Operation: Frontlines drops. It will also appear in regular matchmaking playlists as well.', 'NEW MODE', 'We’re excited to add a new mode to Ranked: Assault! The legacy game mode is just how you remember it—plant the bomb in the enemy team’s base to score a point. Ranked Arena will feature Assault:Neutral Bomb Ranked on both Aquarius and Fortress. The score to win is 3 points.', 'NEW RANKED ROTATIONAL PLAYLIST - RANKED SQUAD BATTLE', 'Feeling in the mood for some competitive action but with a larger number of players, more spacious maps, and wider sandbox variety? Ranked Squad Battle will be your next destination!', 'Get the squad ready, it’s gonna get sweaty—8v8, Bandit Evo starts, and a variety of modes to compete on, including our new mode Assault.', 'Assault will be available in Ranked Squad Battle in two forms: Neutral Bomb and One Bomb! Assault: One Bomb Ranked makes its debut on two iconic maps: Kusini Bay and Refuge, remakes of Halo 2’s Zanzibar and Headlong respectively.', 'RANKED MAP UPDATES', 'With a new Ranked season incoming, it’s time again for a sandbox refresh to our Ranked maps. Below, you will find the changes we’ve made to sandbox items and their locations on Ranked Arena maps.', 'Aquarius', 'Emyprean', 'Forbidden', 'Live Fire', 'Recharge', 'Solitude', 'Streets', 'Additionally, to keep the experience fresh and address points of feedback we’ve received from Ranked players, we are adding some new geometry to a few of the maps. Specifically, we’ve added new jumps to some of our core maps in Ranked to improve map flow and create new routes for players. These new jump routes will only be available on the “Ranked” versions of Aquarius, Forbidden, Recharge, and Streets. Stay tuned for more details on these.', 'MATCHMAKING RANK RESET', 'It’s that time again. All Ranked playlists will have ranks resetting with the release of Operation: Frontlines!', 'New playlists, new map, new modes, new sandbox balances, map pool changes and more. There are a lot of changes coming to Ranked and there is no better time to start fresh and jump in. We’ll see you out there. Good luck, Spartans!', 'The Fuel Rod SPNKr and Bomb object have been added to Forge as objects which should allow for some explosive opportunities to create new experiences.', 'In addition to these new sandbox objects, Forge will also be getting some improvements to better support mode creation. These additions should unlock more power—and add more polish—to modes across the board, all while helping to bridge the gap between Forge and our internal tools.', 'For a more detailed look at these Forge additions, be sure to read the Patch Notes on February 4!', 'That’s a wrap on our overview for the 2025 Spring Update in Halo Infinite.', 'We’re incredibly excited for you to get hands-on with all the new offerings, so keep sending your feedback our way. We’ll catch you on February 4 when Operation: Frontlines arrives!', '']"
