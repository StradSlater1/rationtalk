American Heart Month: Understanding Cardiovascular Disease,https://www.whsv.com/2025/02/05/american-heart-month-understanding-cardiovascular-disease/,"['FISHERSVILLE, Va. (WHSV) - February is American Heart Month, and WHSV is partnering with Augusta Health to highlight the importance of cardiovascular health.', 'According to Augusta Health, the heart is one of the most important organs/muscles in the body. The heart pumps blood throughout the body but can be susceptible to outside stressors. Cardiovascular disease develops in someone when risk factors are left untreated or unmanaged for too long and heart damage begins to take place.', 'Dr. Rodney Graber, cardiologist at Augusta Health, said there is no one-size-fits-all solution to heart disease. Each patient comes with their own needs and their own symptoms. Doctors help treat them by paying attention to what a patient’s body is telling them.', '“Classic heart patient would say, ‘I’ve got an elephant sitting on my chest’. That’s not the case. Some people say ‘It’s misery’. It’s hard to know what misery is,” Graber said. “You have to pay attention.”', 'He added people often think about heart attacks when thinking about cardiovascular disease. Heart attacks can be a symptom of heart disease, but not every person suffering from cardiovascular disease will suffer a heart attack.', 'Arrhythmia is a common cardiovascular disease symptom which causes the heart to beat in an irregular pattern. This pattern can throw someone off and cause extreme discomfort according to multiple cardiologist at Augusta Health.', 'Someone suffering from heart disease may not die from the condition immediately, but prolonged mistreatment of the disease can cause extreme discomfort.', '“From one day to the next, there can be some troubles with people feeling short of breath one day but not having any issues on the scale,” Tami Collins, nurse practitioner at Augusta Health, said. “Swelling of the legs- it can just vary day-to-day.”', 'Strokes are another common heart disease. A severe-case stroke can leave parts of the body paralyzed. Collins said quality of life can change suddenly and become a lifelong burden.', 'Dr. Dave Varma, medical director for cardiology at Augusta Health, said prevention and the education can help save lives before it is too late. He said it is never too early to start preventative actions, but it’s never too late either.', '“Prevention is the key in the beginning, even at a young age. It’s hard to do a test on everyone who thinks they have heart disease,” Varma said. “I think the thing to do is to try and modify risk factors you may have and be very attentive to any symptoms you have.”', 'Manageable risk factors include:', 'Varma said education is not limited to the person who has heart disease or is taking preventative steps. Family members who are worried about loved ones are able to inform themselves to help make their loved one make sound decisions about their health in the future.', 'Varma called high blood pressure, a common heart disease symptom, the “silent killer.”', 'Prolonged high blood pressure levels can cause irreversible damage to the body. Blood pressure typically cannot be felt by someone, therefore it can be a challenge to understand the symptom.', 'Varma said common home measurement tools can help folks monitor their levels and be more aware of what blood pressure looks like for them.', 'Heart disease and its symptoms can present differently between patients. Varma said women might have different indicators than men, and it’s always important to listen to the body when it’s warning of potential danger.', '“I think that it’s important to evaluate each fully and communicate the impact of heart disease. If someone is having symptoms of left arm pain and it’s not severe chest pain or they’re having shortness of breath, this could be heart. Let’s pay attention to it instead of ignoring it.”', 'Just like men, women can take similar, if not identical, risk factor mitigation steps to prevent heart disease from developing.', 'Copyright 2025 WHSV.

"Inequities in heart health found by race, gender",https://www.miamitimesonline.com/education/inequities-in-heart-health-found-by-race-gender/article_e05acaa4-e27c-11ef-95ca-776f4e6c3f8b.html,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'According to a study, social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and geographic location, exacerbate disparities in health care.', 'The American Heart Association’s 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update uncovers glaring racial and gender disparities in cardiovascular health, illustrating the profound toll heart disease takes on marginalized populations. According to the report, non-Hispanic Black adults experience an age-adjusted mortality rate of 379.7 per 100,000 due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), compared to just 104.9 per 100,000 among non-Hispanic Asian females. Researchers asserted that such inequities reflect the disproportionate burden underrepresented communities bear in accessing equitable healthcare and prevention.', ""Women also face significant challenges in cardiovascular health, particularly during and after pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy doubled from 2007 to 2019, with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension contributing to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Black women are disproportionately affected, experiencing higher rates of these conditions, which often lead to long-term cardiovascular complications. Additionally, gestational diabetes increased by 38% between 2016 and 2021, with older mothers facing nearly six times the risk compared to younger mothers. The study's authors also found that poor sleep quality further compounds the risks, particularly for women, who are up to 2.3 times more likely to report insomnia symptoms than men. According to the report, poor sleep is strongly linked to an increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events. "", 'According to the study, social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and geographic location, also exacerbate these disparities. Individuals in rural areas or neighborhoods with fewer healthcare resources face limited access to screenings, healthy food options, and consistent medical care. For instance, peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients living in zip codes with a median household income of less than $40,000 are at a significantly higher risk of undergoing amputations. The report also noted that racial inequities extend to emergency care. Black individuals experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are 27% less likely to receive bystander CPR at home and 37% less likely in public locations than White individuals. These disparities persist even when income levels are accounted for.', '“We have the tools to address these inequities, but they require a commitment to prioritizing the health of all communities,” stated Dr. Seth Martin, who chaired the report. Officials said the AHA’s “Life’s Essential 8” framework is a guideline for improving cardiovascular health. This model includes recommendations for healthier diets, consistent physical activity, and better cholesterol and glucose management. However, the report indicates that over 80% of U.S. adults fail to meet these criteria. Average diet quality scores are just 59 out of 100, and disparities are evident across race, income, and education levels. Researchers insisted that improving these metrics could reduce major cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes.', 'Community health initiatives play a critical role in addressing these disparities.', 'Expanding access to nutritious food, exercise facilities, and education can help reduce risk factors. For example, studies have shown that reallocating just seven minutes of sedentary behavior daily to moderate or vigorous physical activity can significantly improve cardiometabolic health, including reductions in body mass index (BMI) and blood sugar levels.', 'Another critical area of focus is maternal health. Programs that emphasize early intervention and monitoring for pregnant women — especially those at high risk — can reduce complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Lifestyle interventions, including weight management and exercise, have been shown to cut the risk of hypertensive pregnancy disorders nearly in half. Dr. Yvonne Commodore-Mensah, a contributor to the report, added that systemic solutions are essential to addressing these disparities. “When we examine cardiovascular health, it’s clear that social determinants and structural inequities remain significant barriers. Improving health equity means removing these barriers,"" she said.', 'Additionally, the report spelled out the economic burden of cardiovascular disease, which totaled $417.9 billion in 2021 alone. Prescription medications and office visits represent the largest cost drivers, but inequities in care access often lead to more severe and costly outcomes for marginalized groups. The report concluded that addressing the various issues would require a collective effort from policymakers, healthcare providers, and community leaders. Expanding Medicaid, funding local health initiatives, and ensuring equitable resource distribution are steps that can help bridge these gaps. “Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally,” said Dr. Mitchell Elkind, another key contributor to the report. “Progress is possible, but it demands both innovation in healthcare and a commitment to equity.”', 'January 29-February 4, 2025', '92, Miami Dade Transit Supervisor, died Ja… Read more\nWALTER L.

Lee Health: Heart disease and medication advances,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lee-health-heart-disease-medication-101036089.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'In America, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of men and women and the leading cause of death for people of most racial and ethnic groups. Heart disease is a bucket term that refers to several types of heart conditions. In the U.S., the most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease, which is caused by a buildup of fats and cholesterol (known as plaque) in the walls of the arteries. The narrowing of the arteries can lead to blocked blood flow.', 'In recognition of American Heart Month, our annual reminder to focus on heart disease awareness and prevention, I reached out to Lee Health Heart Institute Cardiologist Karla Quevedo, M.D., FACC, for more information about heart disease and medications, including those that can lower cholesterol.', '“When it comes to significant risk factors for heart disease, there are modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors,” Dr. Quevedo explains. “There are things you can change through your lifestyle like high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease. At the same time, there are some risk factors you can’t change, like your family history, gender or age.”', 'Dr. Quevedo encourages lifestyle changes, including exercising, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol and eating a healthy, low-salt and low-saturated fat diet. When lifestyle changes alone don’t work, some medications can help.', 'Statins are one example of a prescription medication that people take to lower their cholesterol, especially the low-density lipoprotein (the LDL, or bad cholesterol), as well as triglycerides. Statins have been available to patients since the 1980s. Though statins are some of the most common prescriptions in America, some patients may have an intolerance to them, or patients may not reach the target LDL with statins alone. Some high or very high-risk patients also may benefit from a combination of statins and other medications.', 'Talk to your doctor or healthcare provider about the medications that you should take, but there are additional medications available to treat and prevent heart disease.', 'Bempedoic acid, for example, is a newer medication approved for the treatment of lipid disorders (abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood). “When used alone, bempedoic acid was shown to lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 30%,” Dr. Quevedo says. “It also significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attacks and strokes without increasing the risk of new-onset diabetes.”', 'Approved for use in 2002, ezetimibe works by inhibiting the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by more than 50%, which contributes to a reduction of LDL cholesterol of approximately 20%. Another option that has been approved for use for nearly 25 years is colesevelam. “This is an option for LDL lowering, and lowers in the range of 15-20%, but requires six tablets daily, which can be a barrier to use,” Dr. Quevedo says.', 'PCSK9 inhibitors are another medication. “PCSK9 inhibitors are drugs that block the PCSK9 protein, which reduces LDL receptor breakdown and increases their recycling, helping lower LDL cholesterol levels,” Dr. Quevedo explains. “The approved drugs, alirocumab and evolocumab, reduce LDL cholesterol by about 60% alone and up to 85% when combined with high-intensity statins and ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitors are generally recommended for patients with a family history of high cholesterol.”', 'Dr. Quevedo adds that drugs like semaglutide can reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity. “These agents have proven to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack and hospitalization for heart failure, as well as improve lipid profile, reduce plaque formation and protect the kidneys,” she says. “The development of new weight loss medications is a rapidly moving field that can continue to prove benefits in patients with modifiable risk factors for heart disease.”', 'New advances and research in heart disease continue, and it is exciting to consider what may be on the horizon. It is also promising to see how the right mix of lifestyle changes and medication therapy can impact heart health, longevity and quality of life.

"AMERICAN HEART MONTH, 2025",https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/american-heart-month-2025/,"['Every day, untold numbers of our friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers are affected by the devastating affliction of heart disease.  As the Nation’s leading cause of death, cardiovascular disease has stolen infinite lives, crushed countless families, and imposed unimaginable heartbreak upon Americans of every walk of life.  This American Heart Month, we mourn and pray for those we have lost and recommit ourselves to ending the deadly plight of heart disease once and for all.\n\nThanks to advancements in medicine, science, and technology, our Nation has made tremendous strides in combatting heart disease — and the American people are now better equipped than ever before to receive lifesaving treatments, respond to medical complications, and modify behavior and habits to ensure they can lead long and healthy lives.  \n\nBut even one soul lost to heart disease is a tragedy beyond comprehension.  To that end, my Administration will work diligently to save lives, lower healthcare costs, and foster a stronger, safer, and healthier future for every citizen.  For as long as I am President, I will always be an unwavering advocate for improving the health of every American.\n\nThe first step in confronting the cardiac disease crisis is taking concrete action to lower the odds of diagnosis — and encouraging those in our lives to take all necessary measures to root out unhealthy habits.  Research has consistently shown that risk factors contributing to heart disease include obesity, high blood pressure and cholesterol, lack of exercise, excessive alcohol use, and smoking.  Making small adjustments to our health and routines can yield extraordinary and even life-saving results.  My Administration is also steadfastly committed to cracking down on Big Pharma and ending the chronic disease epidemic.  And we will fulfill our pledge to investigate what has caused the decades-long increase in health problems and childhood diseases — including obesity, autoimmune disorders, infertility, and autism.  As Americans, we owe it to ourselves and our families to take care of our bodies — and to cherish God’s gift of life for as long and as vigorously as we can.\n\nAs we enter into this American Heart Month, let us seek to improve our health, lengthen our lives, and nurture a culture, a government, and a Nation that upholds the dignity of life and protects the human heart.\n\nIn acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2025 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 7, 2025.  I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join my Administration in recognizing and restating our pledge to fighting heart disease in all its forms.\n\n     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\nthird day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n    February 3, 2025.']"
Lowcountry spikes in heart disease as doctors recognize American Heart Month,https://www.live5news.com/2025/02/05/doctors-trident-medical-center-urge-heart-disease-awareness-prevention/,"['NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States and one cardiovascular surgeon in the Lowcountry says that heart disease cases are rising significantly.', 'Dr. James Benner is a cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon at Trident Medical Center.', 'The month of February is recognized as American Heart Month, dedicated to spreading awareness about heart disease risk factors and prevention. After seeing more cases pop up in the last year, Benner is encouraging others to be mindful of their health and start taking preventative action as soon as possible.', 'When asked what trends Benner has seen in the past year in heart disease cases, his answer was very straightforward.', '“An explosion in volume, even more cases than we were doing the previous years. So, we’ve been very busy,” Benner said. “Where we were doing maybe 15 hearts a month, we’re now doing over 20 pretty much each month. So, it’s definitely expanded.”', 'Benner attributed this spike to a number of different factors. He said it could just be the nature of the disease or increased access to health care. He also believes for their hospital specifically, people may be seeking their care more than in the past because of the results their hospital has accomplished. Trident Medical Center was just ranked a top 50 cardiovascular hospital.', 'Not only have they seen such a spike in cases, but Benner noted another trend. He said that he has recently seen more and more patients coming in at a much younger age than he is used to seeing.', '“I was always operating on everybody older than me. Everybody was always 70, 80s. Now I’m seeing a lot of people that are 10 to 15 years younger than me, which is really surprising. A lot of younger patients are undergoing bypass, undergoing vascular procedures. So, it’s definitely a big pendulum swing. Some of that I think is related to the prevalence of diabetes, some of it is smoking, some of it is inactivity, some of it is kind of poor diet choices and genetics plays a role,” Benner said. “The pendulum has definitely swung to younger patients.”', 'Benner said he has been seeing patients come in as young as their early 40s. Because of this increase, he suggested taking preventative measures. He said people should watch their diet and try to limit their intake of red meat. He also said people should avoid or stop smoking and that he has seen some of the best results with increased exercise.', 'Benner said the sooner heart disease is caught, the easier it is to intervene. There are fortunately many treatments available for heart diseases such as medications, surgeries and stints, but Benner said everyone should pay attention to their health no matter their age.', 'He said specifically people with any present family history of heart disease or heart attack should get with their primary care provider as soon as possible to start checking for signs and staying on top of it. He also noted that women tend to present later than men, as chest pain is often associated with stress or anxiety, so that is something to keep in mind.', 'Copyright 2025 WCSC.

Most people think of chest pain when they think about a heart attack, but that isn't always the case.\n\nIncreased sweating, shortness of breath, back pain and nausea all begin to set in.\n\nThat's when 911 is called. Paramedics arrive, ask questions, take vitals and assess your symptoms. Through their assessment, they believe that Messel (in this simulation) is experiencing a heart attack."", 'Messel is then propped up on a stretcher, and the call is made to Methodist Hospital. On the trip to the hospital, an electrocardiogram is taken, which speeds up the treatment process for doctors and other health care professionals at the hospital and confirms to them before Messel’s arrival that he is indeed experiencing a heart attack.\n\n""I\'m glad you called the ambulance and had them bring you in here today. The EKG that they did shows that you are having a heart attack this morning,"" Dr. Joespeh McCaslin said.', '""Even at this age?” Messel asked.', '""Yes, it can happen at any age, so the great thing is that you got help right away, and you got here right away, so we\'re going to take good care of you and get you all taken care of,” McCaslin responded.\n\nMcCaslin then reiterates the importance of taking an ambulance and not driving yourself. After some medication to help with the pain, McCaslin runs through the next steps and the procedure that will take place to open the blocked artery.\n\n""The cardiologist is going to see you, and they are going to take you down to the heart catheterization lab here in the hospital, and they are going to take a catheter that they are going to place in through the artery in your wrist that goes up into your heart, and they will take some pictures to see is there a blockage in one of the arteries of your heart, and then try to get that artery open,” McCaslin said.\n\nThen it\'s off to the Cath Lab. Once in the Cath Lab, Messel is moved to another table where he will be administered medication to make him sleepy while they numb up the artery in his wrist before feeding the catheter through to find the blockage.\n\nAs he lay on the table, Messel asked, ""What\'s that process look like after you find out where the blockage is?""', 'McCaslin responded, ""We use a balloon to open the blockage up, and then sometimes we put a stent in there, which is a little metal cage to keep the artery open, so it doesn\'t reclose up again.""\n\nThe team at Methodist hopes to get patients experiencing a heart attack into the Cath Lab for the procedure in about an hour.\n\n""That\'s why everyone is working quickly so we can get this done, and get the artery open and get blood flow back to that part of your heart as fast as we can,"" McCaslin said.\n\nOnce sedated, the dye is released and you can see exactly where the blockage of blood flow is in the heart. After a successful procedure, Messel is checked out one last time. The goal is to have the pain level be a zero out of 10 with no shortness of breath.\n\nA few days later, it\'s now time for cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. Doctors want patients to start the rehab process as soon as possible. While rehabbing, they watch EKG levels and take vitals while exercising. During rehab from a heart attack, your heart rate postsurgery is important.\n\nUpon completing rehab, the process of going back to a normal, healthy life begins.', 'NAVIGATE: Home | Weather | Local News | National | Sports | Newscasts on demand |', 'Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.']"

', 'According to the Athletics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA), 80% of Americans are not exercising enough to get a health benefit. As a fitness professional, this discourages me but doesn’t surprise me. Let me explain the statistic to you. ', 'It doesn’t mean people are not exercising. Many people hit the gym with the intent of working out. Clubs are packed full of people every day, and all the cardio machines are in use. What these numbers do indicate, however, is that those who are working out aren’t doing so effectively. This translates into poor health, even though they “think” they are doing their bodies good. ', 'The heart is an incredible organ that constantly works to ensure we have oxygen. Breathing in and out is its primary function; however, this alone is not exercise but rather a normal part of life. To truly exercise, it must be challenged. This is where many people go wrong, and it frustrates me. I feel for those who invest time at the gym but fail to see benefits simply because they aren’t putting in enough effort. We don’t know what we don’t know. You can’t achieve what you don’t understand, so here’s the deal: Work at a higher intensity.', 'Many health and fitness clubs have heart rate charts to help you work at the “right zone” or “target heart rate.” I experience that the average person doesn’t know their resting heart rate, which must be taken over three days at the same time each morning and averaged. I personally am math-challenged! Besides, the heart-rate formula used by most facilities is based upon research of a 20-year-old male. Um, I’m neither!', 'I encourage people to monitor their own breathing and use the Intensity Chart, which is basically a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most difficult. Here is how it works: When you first walk into a class, gym or start hiking or biking, you are breathing normal, which is through your nose. This is level 1. This is easy because it requires no additional effort from the body. As you begin to warm up (you do warm up, don’t you?), you start to increase your intensity. Your breathing becomes fuller through your nose. Here is where some people will get stuck, especially if they are reading a good book, talking to a friend or watching television. ', 'If you genuinely want to reap the health benefits, you need to keep increasing your intensity beyond this point, about a three. You should push yourself hard enough to be breathing heavily and engage your mouth. Taking fuller breaths and using your mouth for additional oxygen indicates a level 5 to 6. You could still converse, but only between breaths. Breathing takes precedence over talking. I’ll be straightforward: If you can hold a conversation while exercising, reading or watching TV, you aren’t pushing yourself hard enough. I apologize for delivering this news, but it’s the truth. Why invest your time if you aren’t gaining health benefits?', 'This is a great place to start, but I still encourage people to go higher. The great thing about monitoring your own breathing is that it is for you at your age and stage and will also take into account how recharged you got overnight and what you might have eaten. It isn’t a formula based on a young man. What you want to do is actually push yourself to a level 8. Here, you are “comfortably uncomfortable.” Meaning, you know you are working, but you can go the distance. You are breathing through the mouth and talking is very difficult and limited, if at all. ', 'Note: You might ask yourself, “Then why can fitness instructors give us cues while teaching class?” ', 'Two possibilities:', '•', 'They aren’t working as hard as you think, or as in my case... ', '•', ' They are practicing techniques that allow them to speak through their breathlessness…and they are controlling their breathing, even though they normally wouldn’t be able to speak. Trust me, it takes practice and being in really good shape. ', 'To truly get the most out of your workout, you should stay at level 8 for 20 minutes of your 30 minutes per AFAA and up to an hour if you follow the AHA guidelines. You’ll have a little warm up and then a burst at a level 9 to really challenge your system, followed by a cool down. If you prescribe to this intensity scale, you will see results. ', 'Here’s another great way to monitor your heart during exercise. If you                can say “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” in one breath, you need to work harder! You should need to take a few breathes to say it. On the flip side, if you can barely get out a syllable, you may need to lower your intensity.', 'Don’t hesitate to challenge yourself in your age group. As we age, cardiovascular health becomes increasingly vital for longevity and a quality life.

In a 2025 American Heart Association report, the organization reveals that someone dies of cardiovascular disease every 34 seconds. With that in mind, when was the last time you had your heart checked?"", ""February is American Heart Month, just in time for Valentine's Day, meaning that it's a great time to schedule your annual physical to get your heart screened by your doctor. Knowing more about your heart can help you make lifestyle adjustments to prevent risk of heart disease, America's silent killer. "", 'Heart disease is a general term used to describe several conditions that affect the heart, including but not limited to arrhythmias, valve disease and congenital heart defects. The most common heart disease is coronary artery disease, which impairs the blood vessels, hinders blood flow to the heart and can increase your risk of a heart attack. ', 'Heart disease frequently goes undiagnosed until symptoms of a heart attack or heart failure present themselves. Regular heart disease screenings are essential to help you get ahead of many health scares. ', ""Heart disease can happen at any age. In the case of congenital heart disease, it can happen at birth. Other times, it develops throughout our lives, like coronary artery disease, slowly progressing as plaque builds up. The cause of heart disease will vary depending on the type of condition. Let's focus on coronary heart disease since it's the most common type people experience. "", 'The causes of coronary heart disease are genetics, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking. Essentially, your heart has to work harder because things are standing in the way, putting more strain on the organ than necessary. Your heart can only function for so long under excessive stress. ', ""The CDC says that almost half of Americans have at least one risk factor for heart disease. That's why you should get screenings regularly. Now let's dig into when you should."", ""Hint: it's before symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pressure or weakness present themselves. "", ""The American Heart Association recommends that routine screenings should start at age 20. That sounds early, but heart disease can affect younger people, too. By starting regular screenings at 20, your doctor can establish a baseline for your body and monitor changes as you age. At this stage, even if you are not considered at high risk (see below), it's important to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose and lifestyle factors through family history, physical exams and blood tests. Routine screenings for those at lower risk should be as follows:"", ""Regular screenings for all patients should begin at age 20 and proceed in intervals. However, if you're at high risk for cardiovascular disease, you're likely to be screened more frequently. Risk factors include high blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, a family history of heart disease, your age and your lifestyle. "", 'If you are more at risk, additional cardiovascular testing may be necessary, especially if you are experiencing symptoms associated with heart disease, such as an irregular heartbeat. ', 'Additional tests can include: ', ""Heart disease is serious, but it's also largely preventable and treatable, especially with regular screenings. You have more control over your heart health than you think. Try adding these daily habits to your life to lower your risk of heart disease. "", 'Don\'t just take a ""good enough"" approach to your health. The heart is one of the body\'s most vital organs, and sometimes it\'s hard to know when it\'s sick. That\'s why heart health screenings start so early. High blood pressure and high cholesterol are some of the most common conditions, and unfortunately, they significantly increase your risk of developing heart disease.
