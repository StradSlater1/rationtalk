He said that water and electricity are frequently cut off and Internet communication is almost non-existent.\nMigrant returns are a key element of burgeoning ties between Syria and NATO-member Turkiye, which is emerging as a power broker able to wield influence economically and diplomatically. Syria’s transitional President Ahmed Al-Sharaa visited Ankara on Tuesday, discussing an expected rapid expansion of economic ties.\nThe presence of nearly 3 million Syrians in Turkiye has become a sensitive political issue. Many have faced bouts of anti-migrant sentiment that made them feel like unwanted guests, and some rushed to the border after rebels forced Assad out.\n“Most of the refugees were initially excited about returning after the fall of the Assad regime, but this excitement faded over time,” said Kadri Gungorur, social welfare director of the Refugees Association in Turkiye, citing complaints such as the lack of education and health services.\n“Some families feel regret and want to return,” he said. “When they compare the living conditions in Turkiye with Syria, we can accept that Turkiye offers them more opportunities.”\n\nBID TO SUPPORT VOLUNTARY RETURNS\nSheikh was among those enthused by the rebels’ victory, dreaming of rebuilding his bombed Aleppo home. He vowed to go back as soon as Assad fell, despite friends’ efforts to dissuade him. Now he is dismayed by the comparatively poor living conditions and scarcity of job and education opportunities.\n“I started thinking about returning to Turkiye because my life was stable there, and my children were in school. My living conditions were stable,” he said. “But I can’t go back now because I signed a voluntary return document.”\nDue to such negative experiences, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya announced at the end of 2024 a scheme designed to enable migrants to better plan their return home.\nThe scheme entitles the heads of Syrian migrant families to visit Syria three times between January and June this year, according to an Interior Ministry document.\nBetween Assad’s fall and late January, 81,576 Syrians had entered Syria, indicating a slight fall in the daily rate of returns from December to some 1,600 a day, Yerlikaya said. It was unclear how many of those returning in January had signed the voluntary return document.\nDuring a visit to Turkiye last week, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi expressed support for Turkiye’s refugee response and voluntary returns.\nHe praised the policy of what he called “go-and-see visits,” saying they were “a best practice, as it allows refugees to assess conditions for themselves and can pave the way for sustainable returns to Syria.”\n’PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE’\nSome Syrians are more inclined to wait and see.\nSyrian chemist Jafer, 27, came to Turkiye 12 years ago and will not consider returning with his wife and three children until conditions improve.\n“My children are currently well-adjusted in Turkiye, which makes staying here more likely since they have adapted to life, language, and education in Turkiye,” he said.\n“Some people will return, but the lack of basic necessities prevents them from doing so. They think about returning, but not now, perhaps in the future.”\nIt is an option no longer open to Sheikh.\nHe was forced out of Aleppo in late 2016 when Assad forces, with the support of Russian air strikes, seized control of the eastern part of the city from rebels. He went on to build a stable life for his wife and four children in Turkiye.\nHe has opened a mobile phone repair shop in Aleppo, but his plan to fix his house there is on hold.\n“I don’t know if the project will succeed here in the country or if it will fail. If it fails, I will have lost everything I earned during my time in Turkiye.”', 'GAZA CITY: The Palestinian Hamas movement is ready to establish contact and hold talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump, Russia’s RIA state news agency cited a senior Hamas official as saying in remarks published early on Wednesday.\n“We are ready for contact and talks with the Trump administration,” RIA cited senior Hamas Politburo member Mousa Abu Marzouk as saying.\n“In the past, we did not object to contacts with the administration of (former US President Joe) Biden, Trump or any other US administration, and we are open to talks with all international parties.”\nIt was not clear when RIA interviewed Marzouk, who was visiting Moscow on Monday for talks with the Russian foreign ministry.\nTrump vowed on Tuesday that the US would take over the war-shattered Gaza Strip after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and develop it economically, a move that would shatter decades of US policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nMarzouk told RIA that talks with the US have become a kind of necessity for Hamas, considering that Washington is a key player in the Middle East.\n“That is why we welcomed the talks with the Americans and have no objection to this issue,” he added.', ' ', 'BAGHDAD: Iraq’s top court suspended implementation Tuesday of three controversial bills passed last month by the country’s parliament, including a measure that activists said undermines women’s rights.\nA number of members of parliament filed a complaint alleging that the voting process was illegal because all three bills — each supported by different blocs — were voted on last month together rather than each one being voted on separately. The Federal Supreme Court issued an order, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, to suspend their implementation until the case is adjudicated.\nThe measures include an amendment to the country’s personal status law to give Islamic courts increased authority over family matters, including marriage, divorce and inheritance.\nWomen’s rights advocates argue that the changes undermine previous reforms that created a unified family law and established safeguards for women. Proponents of the amendments, which were advocated by primarily conservative Shiite lawmakers, defend them as a means to align the law with Islamic principles and reduce Western influence on Iraqi culture.\nEarlier versions of the measure were seen as potentially opening the door to child marriage since some interpretations of Islamic law allow the marriage of girls in their early teens — or as young as 9. The final version passed by the parliament states that both parties must be “adults,” without specifying the age of adulthood.\nThe second bill was for a general amnesty law seen as benefiting Sunni detainees. Some fear it could allow the release of people involved in public corruption and embezzlement as well as militants who committed war crimes.\nThe third bill aimed to return lands confiscated from the Kurds under the rule of Saddam Hussein. It is opposed by some Arab groups, saying it could lead to the displacement of Arab residents.', ' ', 'UNITED NATIONS, United States: World leaders and people should respect Palestinians’ desire to remain in Gaza, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations said Tuesday, after US President Donald Trump said he believed people from the territory should be resettled elsewhere “permanently.”\n“Our homeland is our homeland, if part of it is destroyed, the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian people selected the choice to return to it,” said Riyad Mansour. “And I think that leaders and people should respect the wishes of the Palestinian people.”\nOn Tuesday, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, with the US leader saying he believed Palestinians should leave Gaza after an Israeli offensive that has devastated the territory and left most of it reduced to rubble.\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting, Trump said he wanted a solution that saw “a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes where they can be happy.”\nAt the United Nations, Mansour did not name Trump but appeared to reject the US president’s proposal.\n“Our country and our home is” the Gaza Strip, “it’s part of Palestine,” he said. “We have no home. For those who want to send them to a happy, nice place, let them go back to their original homes inside Israel, there are nice places there, and they will be happy to return to these places.”\nThe war in Gaza erupted after Palestinian armed group Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\nIsrael’s retaliatory response has killed at least 47,518 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. The UN considers these figures as reliable.\nThe UN says more than 1.9 million people — or 90 percent of Gaza’s population — have been displaced by Israel’s offensive, with the bombing campaign having leveled most structures in the territory, including schools, hospitals and basic civil infrastructure.\nThe start of a ceasefire deal, which included the release of hostages held by Hamas and prisoners held by Israel, on January 19 saw Palestinians rejoice, with many returning to homes that no longer stood.\n“In two days, in a span of a few hours, 400,000 Palestinians walking returned to the northern part of the Gaza Strip,” said UN envoy Mansour.\n“I think that we should be respecting the selections and the wishes of the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian people at the end will make the determination, their determination.”\n ', ' ', 'WASHINGTON: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Donald Trump as the “greatest friend Israel has ever had,” following a meeting between the two leaders at the White House.\n“I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again: you are the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House,” Netanyahu told reporters after the meeting in Washington. “And that’s why the people of Israel have such enormous respect for you.”\n ', ' ', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"
