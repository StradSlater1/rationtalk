"David Lynch, a filmmaker who opened up the world",https://www.theskinny.co.uk/film/opinion/david-lynch-tribute,"[""EDITOR'S CHOICE"", ""It's past midnight. The end credits of Eraserhead roll. Two of my best friends and I are tangled on the sofa, delirious and tired and buoyant about what we’ve just seen. We have spent the last 89 minutes in something akin to a trance, letting images of beauty, hilarity, sadness and oddity confound us. We're unsure of what's just happened, but sure we have found something new and thrilling: that very rare thing, an artist who has invited us into his world and made us feel. We look at each other and laugh; something great has just happened. "", 'David Lynch was a director I spent a long time avoiding – not because I thought I’d dislike him or that he wouldn’t interest me, but because of a latent fear of not getting it. I avoided many writers because of the same fear, too shy to face up to the works of Joyce and Beckett, say, lest I was cornered by someone I deemed more intellectual who would, for some reason, quiz me on their intricacies, leaving me blank-faced and babbling as I had to admit that it had all gone over my head. It wasn’t until I picked up my first Beckett and found myself laughing out loud that I realised I had nothing to fear. These were not artists I had to understand, these were artists I had, simply, to experience.', 'Jack Nance in Eraserhead.', 'Welcoming David Lynch into your life opens up a world: a world wherein the possibilities of art are seemingly endless, where irony lives among joyful earnestness, where love and beauty are reflected in the odd and disjointed. Discovering his films was like opening a toy chest full of broken dolls, limbs bent backwards, one eye closed and drooping, but so clearly and honestly loved. He brought to my attention the works of others in his sphere too: the paintings of Francis Bacon, the photographs of Diane Arbus and Francesca Woodman, all of whom created work that leaves me questioning and uncertain, but alive and singing with feelings. He does what all good artists do: he broadens your mind.', 'On the day Lynch passed, social media was awash with tributes and stories, everyone clambering to tell each other the exact moment they had found a friend in him, the moment they had realised there was someone out there just like them, someone weird and unapologetic about it, someone who viewed life the way we all wanted to: as a playground, a place to explore and marvel at. Lynch put it perfectly himself in his 2006 book Catching the Big Fish: “It’s supposed to be great living. It’s supposed to be fantastic.” In the drudgery of our every day, it can be so easy to lose sight of this fact, that our being here in the first place is a matter of extraordinary chance. It seemed, at times, that Lynch was one of the only people who knew this. And so it is with this in mind we should approach him, not as an opaque aesthete whose thinking is so beyond our own, but as the artist and person he was: someone who cared, deeply, about humanity, about our world and our place in it, and who loved, sincerely, those who were cast out of the mainstream.', 'David Lynch. Photo: @iotae via Wikimedia Commons', 'What does it mean, anyway, to understand a film? To understand any piece of art? Who are the great arbiters of opinion that get to decide what is meant by Lynch, or anyone’s work? Surely not the YouTube creators making their MULHOLLAND DRIVE ENDING EXPLAINED videos, surely not even the creators themselves. Surely it is only ourselves, our minds and hearts, standing in front of a work and letting it pass through us, letting us feel it.', 'A Rothko painting is many things to many people, not because of the colours on the canvas but because of the pair of eyes looking at it. Yves Klein and his blue matter to us because blue matters to us. We love Lynch because we love this world and all its myriad complications, alive and contradicting. I have not always agreed with Lynch but that is part of what I love about him. He has made me interrogate myself, made it so I look a little deeper at that around me, look, as he said himself, for the red ants crawling underneath this beautiful life.', 'The paintings of Francis Bacon, the words of Samuel Beckett, the films of David Lynch. I look at them, hold them in my vision and in my heart, and let them wash over me, taking me with their tidal pull. Do I understand any of it? No. And thank god for that.', ""David Lynch's 1986 masterpiece Blue Velvet screens at Dundee Contemporary Arts on 27 Feb, 8pm, and his 1989 road movie Wild at Heart screens in Edinburgh at Cameo, 15 Feb, 9.30pm and Banshee Labyrinth, 20 Feb, 7.30pm""]"

"DAVID LYNCH: THE MAN, THE ARTIST",https://www.thephoenixnews.com/posts/david-lynch-the-man-the-artist,"[' - ', '\u200d', 'There is a name you will hear in artist’s circles that sticks in your head. It’s punchy and it creates an image before you even know who it belongs to. ', '\u200d', 'The name is David Lynch. It’s a name that is tossed around often for mentions of the ‘auteur’ and the ‘abstract’ film. It’s a name that will perk up the ears of many a devoted fan. But what has Lynch done? Why does his name hold such weight?', '\u200d', 'Well, first we should look at some examples of his work over his long and prosperous career. ', '\u200d', 'Lynch began as a painter, but had a lingering question: could paintings move? He began experimenting directly with moving paintings with the short film Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times), but the logical next step was to make films in the more traditional sense (as traditional as Lynch can get). He created multiple short films such as The Grandmother and The Amputee before releasing what would be his break into the film world and his first hit.', '\u200d', 'Eraserhead is the fan-favourite Lynch film. It showcases all the eccentricities that became typical in his later work, but to an unhinged degree. Lynch made this film with very little money and no guarantee that it would ever be shown in a theater. Luckily, the film found a home in the midst of the ‘midnight movie’ craze, where theaters would show more experimental films in the evening. Eraserhead showcased what made Lynch a groundbreaking director, which was his work as an artistic translator. He effectively appropriated the surrealism of his paintings and translated it into a new medium: film. By doing this, he showed movie-goers a new way of making and looking at the moving image, making space for all the artists who would follow his footsteps. ', '\u200d', 'My first introduction to Lynch – similar to many others – was through the show Twin Peaks. Twin Peaks was a show that ran from 1990 to 2017. It spanned three seasons, the first two coming out in 1990 and 1991 (with a film in 1992), and the third and final coming out in 2017. My dad had watched this show as a young adult and thought I would like it too. Well, boy I did. ', '\u200d', 'The show follows FBI agent Dale Cooper trying to uncover the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer. Its atmosphere is so original and it has inspired countless songs, video games, and every other kind of media you can think of. Think of a piece of media you like, and it probably has taken some inspiration from Twin Peaks. Notable examples include The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Silent Hill, The Sopranos, Gravity Falls (on which he was originally cast as Bill Cipher), the band Surf Curse, and an entire David Bowie album, Outside. ', '\u200d', 'There have also been numerous references to the show, like a wonderfully hilarious sesame street segment.', '\u200d', 'With the commercial success of Twin Peaks, Lynch was catapulted into fame. ', 'He used this fame to make more experimental films which continued to be incredibly popular for their bizarre content. Lynch was almost like the black sheep of Hollywood, working with popular actors like Naomi Watts and Anthony Hopkins, but still maintaining his typical artistic style. He never conceded, never stopped being entirely himself. Lynch did as he pleased, as is seen by his numerous stunts, such as renting a cow and planting it on the sidewalk in order to campaign for Laura Dern (the actress who starred in his film, Inland Empire), or making a Netflix original short featuring Lynch interrogating a monkey named Jack (in What did Jack do?). ', '\u200d', 'This is the sort of spirit that resonates with many modern artists. Lynch made the art he wanted to make, bottom line. Each film he made was uniquely Lynch-flavoured and the artists he worked with and inspired throughout his career respected such an attitude.', '\u200d', 'On January 15th, Lynch unfortunately passed away. As this news circulated online, every media outlet I was plugged into was filled with the artists I loved, mourning his loss and celebrating his art. Lynch’s impact on art as a whole is clear in the artists he has inspired. Lynch and his work will be talked about for decades, and I guarantee that the next artist who creates something that inspires you, has in some way been touched by his world. ', '\u200d', 'So rest in peace to a damn fine man. ', '\u200d', 'Now go watch Twin Peaks.   ', '\u200d', '1 Mulderrig, M., “Feature: The Midnight Movie and Nocturnal Participation”.

David Lynch's musical collaborations built worlds out of what was heard as much as what was seen,https://www.salon.com/2025/01/29/david-lynchs-musical-collaborations-built-worlds-out-of-what-was-heard-as-much-as-what-was-seen/,"['Today, Trent Reznor is an Oscar-winning artist who’s composed some of the most evocative movie scores in recent memory, including the pulse-pounding electronic soundscapes for “Challengers,” “The Social Network” and the tranquil, Eno-esque “Soul.” ', 'But the Nine Inch Nails founder didn’t have experience in Hollywood when David Lynch called and said he wanted Reznor to work on music for 1997’s “Lost Highway.” Lynch trusted him implicitly, though—and had a clear vision for what he wanted to hear.', '“He’d describe a scene and say, ‘Here’s what I want. Now, there’s a police car chasing Fred down the highway, and I want you to picture this: There’s a box, OK? And in this box, there’s snakes coming out; snakes whizzing past your face. So, what I want is the sound of that – the snakes whizzing out of the box – but it’s got to be like impending doom,’” Reznor told Rolling Stone in 1997. ', 'Related', 'The kicker? “He hadn’t brought any footage with him,” Reznor continued. “He says, ‘OK, OK, go ahead. Give me that sound.’” The resulting music is suitably creepy, encompassing decaying jazz, abrasive industrial and the occasional section of ambient unease.', 'It should be no surprise that Lynch, who died January 15 at the age of 78, heard music in such a vivid way. After all, his movies and TV shows were visually stunning. But as his conversation with Reznor demonstrates, Lynch was committed to ensuring that any music he used enhanced the emotional impact of these visuals. No note was extraneous or wasted—and he understood more than most the mutually beneficial relationship between sound and vision.', '“I used to say picture dictates sound, but sometimes it’s the other way around,” Lynch once told The Paris Review. “Sounds will conjure an image . . . to get it to marry to the picture is the trick. It’s not just a sound effect for a sound effect; it’s in that world, it marries to it, and you work and work and work until you get that.”', 'Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.', 'This is certainly true for one of Lynch’s most famous soundtracks, for his 1977 cult favorite “Eraserhead.” The songs he composed with Alan R. Splet create a proto-industrial soundscape with haunting effects, unsettling dialogue and vocals, and roaring synthesized white noise — like Eno descending into hell. You didn’t even have to see the movie to glean the gist of its plot; the music started filling in the blanks. ', 'Unsurprisingly, Lynch viewed the “Eraserhead” music as especially immersive, less like a discrete soundtrack and more like the noise of a daily existence. “I didn’t think of [these experiments] as music,” Lynch said in 2024, “but I thought of them as building a world. It’s more like room tones, tones of an industrial city, tones of a room in a certain kind of apartment building. Tones that paint a picture of how it is there in that factory area.”', 'Yet Lynch always had more than a touch of surrealism within these everyday sounds, something demonstrated by the way he wasn’t afraid of using space within his compositions. Lynch knew this approach amplified any unease, like the aural equivalent of weathering an uncomfortable silence in a real-life conversation. ', 'Singer Julee Cruise performs during the sixth annual Twin Peaks UK Festival at Genesis Cinema on October 3, 2015 in London, England. (Amy T. Zielinski/Redferns/Getty Images)\nYou hear this phenomenon especially in his work with frequent collaborator Angelo Badalamenti for “Twin Peaks” and elsewhere, notably “Mysteries Of Love” from the 1986 film “Blue Velvet.” Julee Cruise’s siren vocals intertwine with imperceptible grooves that swell like gentle ocean waves. Lynch’s own solo work also demonstrated more than a touch of shapeshifting temporal vibes. On the 2010 compilation “Dark Night of the Soul,” a collaboration with Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse, Lynch contributes vocals to two songs. The title track sounded like a crackling victrola, while “Star Eyes (I Can’t Catch It)” resembles out-there psychedelic pop. ', 'Lynch wasn’t just writing about women; his collaborations with women represented some of his most compelling musical works.', 'The specificity of Lynch’s music and imagery was also singular. On the collection “Twin Peaks Music: Season Two Music and More,” the songs named for the women in the TV show are rich and full of depth. “Shelly” begins like a drowsy jazz number before segueing into a lullaby-like song reminiscent of “Blue Moon”; “Audrey” is shapeshifting jazz with restless rhythms; and “Laura’s Dark Boogie” is aptly named, a skin-crawling, spidery lament full of shivering tension. ', 'But Lynch wasn’t just writing about women; his collaborations with women represented some of his most compelling musical works. Perhaps most notable are two albums with Julee Cruise, 1989’s “Floating into the Night” and 1993’s “The Voice Of Love,” both of which featured Lynch lyrics and production and music from Angelo Badalamenti. The full-lengths reside at the intersection of haunted dream-pop, gothic rock, and burned-out western twang, but always center Cruise and her evocative vocals. ', 'Elsewhere, “Pinky’s Dream,” a throttling western blues number from Lynch’s 2011 solo debut album “Crazy Clown Time,” features Yeah Yeah Yeahs vocalist Karen O. She coos, whispers, and wails the song, interpreting the tragic story of the enigmatic, erratic Pinky with empathy. ', 'Singer Chrystabell, presented by David Lynch, performs at The Hollywood Forever Cemetery on May 12, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\nOn his 2013 solo album “The Big Dream,” Lykke Li initially oozes gilded angelic sadness with “I’m Waiting Here.” But as the song progresses, her voice firms up and incorporates a knowing (if wistful) tone, matching lyrics that describe a narrator warning an ex-lover he’ll regret not being with her.', 'On that same solo album, Lynch covers “The Ballad of Hollis Brown,” using distorted vocals, diffracted keyboards and plodding beats to create a disorienting effect. And while Dylan often feels like an apt comparison for Lynch’s solo work—particularly how the electronic music experiments cloak his askew worldview and unorthodox vocals—he had a different intention with the cover. ', '“It’s not really a cover of Bob Dylan as much as it is a cover of a Nina Simone cover of Bob Dylan,” Lynch told Billboard. “It was Nina Simone’s version that was sort of the driver of the boat.” It fit perfectly on the album, he added; the album didn’t feel right without it being in the sequence. ', 'More recently, he collaborated with the artist Chrystabell, led by the 2024 effort “Cellophane Dreams,” a searing (and solemn) album reminiscent of PJ Harvey. “Before I was introduced to David by someone who suggested we collaborate musically, I had no idea that he was a composer or musician,” she once said. “Indeed he approaches creating music from a different angle than most. From my perspective, David sees the music as a path to the feeling. The feeling emerges during recorded improvisational sessions in his recording studio he calls ‘experiments.’”', 'Chrystabell hits on the essential qualities of Lynch’s music. More than anything, he had an uncanny ability to tap into the instinctual and ephemeral—and an uncanny ability to make the personal resonate in universal ways.', 'Read more', 'about David Lynch', 'Annie Zaleski is a Cleveland-based journalist who writes regularly for The A.V.

Take One Take Two: Lynch had a thought-provoking career,https://www.sent-trib.com/2025/01/31/take-one-take-two-lynch-had-a-thought-provoking-career/,"['On Jan. 15th, a singular filmmaker in cinema history was lost with the passing of David Lynch. He was a man who traveled the United States throughout his life, drawn to all of its allures: the seedy underbelly of suburbia, the dense mysteries of the Pacific Northwest, the harsh decay of the Rust Belt, and the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.', 'His films have been imitated yet his aesthetic has always been inimitable. Today, we look back at a thought-provoking career that spans black-and-white period pieces, primetime television, dreamlike melodramas, and his last acting role as the legendary John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical film “The Fabelmans” (2022).', 'Take One', 'One of Lynch’s earliest and most overlooked films was 1980’s “The Elephant Man,” a biopic about Joseph Merrick, a man with severe physical deformities in late 19th-century London. Merrick (played by Oscar-nominated John Hurt) is soft-spoken and agreeable, which seems to amplify the hostility of an upper-class civilized society which cowers in fear of the unknown and unrecognizable. Anthony Hopkins plays a doctor who believes he can help him through patience and understanding. All of Lynch’s trademark characteristics are absent in this film: there are no music-driven montages, no non-sequiturs, none of the typical dead-end dream logic. The film is straightforward, austere and brilliant. What remains is Lynch’s well-honed acuity for the human condition in all of its tragic contradictions. The black-and-white photography is lush, and the film’s music score (also Oscar-nominated) is equally florid. Despite the accolades and eight total Oscar nominations (including Best Picture and Director), few cinephiles associate it with Lynch’s oeuvre.', 'More in line with Lynch’s typically surreal sensibilities, is the oft-maligned 1997 neo-noir thriller “Lost Highway.” Initially a strange curiosity upon release, the film sank into oblivion after the success of 2001’s “Mulholland Drive,” often considered Lynch’s masterpiece. But “Lost Highway” is the indisputable blueprint for that larger work and holds ample rewards in its own right. Focusing on twin narratives, one with Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette being clandestinely filmed in their own home leading to a grisly murder, and another of a young mechanic who is seemingly unrelated but ultimately seduced by a familiar face. You’d be hard pressed to make any argument about the film’s coherence, but if you surrender to the sweeping visuals, the abstract performances (including a bone-chilling cameo by Robert Blake in his last film role), and the carefully curated soundtrack, you’ll find yourself in for a rapturous cinematic event.', 'Finally, no one can summarize Lynch’s career without looking at his towering achievements in “Twin Peaks” (1990-91). Spanning two primetime TV seasons, a dark prequel film called “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me” (1992), and finally an 18-episode third season on Showtime in 2017. “Twin Peaks” is an entire universe to fans desperate to solve its many perplexities. It’s hard not to view the recent third season as Lynch’s final gift to his loyal fan base. Officially called “Twin Peaks: The Return,” the show plays like an 18-part film which follows its characters 25 years after the events of the first series. But instead of trying to wrap up loose ends, Lynch instead plunges the viewer deeper into the uncertainties that have always driven the show’s mythology, eliciting knockout performances from Kyle Machlachlan, Laura Dern, and the majority of the original cast reprising their earlier roles. It was shown as a single work over one weekend at The Museum of Modern Art in New York City upon its release, and the show’s producers confirmed that this was Lynch’s intent.', 'Take Two', 'I don’t think it’s possible to discuss David Lynch’s career without writing a few lines about his most controversial film, 1986’s “Blue Velvet.” This neo-noir thriller stars Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, and Dennis Hopper, in a career-resurrection performance, as one of the most reviled villains in cinema history. Audiences were subjected to shocking violence and considerable nudity as only Lynch dared to spring upon his viewing public. Some may argue that given the copious amounts of blood and brutality found in today’s slasher films (see any “Saw” film) that “Blue Velvet” pales in comparison. But there is no question Lynch opened the door for unimaginable savagery. Screening critics wailed at Lynch’s disturbing images and audiences stayed away. But over the years “Blue Velvet” has become a cult classic, and criticisms have turned to praise for Lynch’s signature style.', 'As described earlier in this column, the singular masterpiece in the David Lynch filmography would be 2001” s “Mullholland Drive” that resulted in his Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival and an Oscar nomination that same year. The film can best be described as a surrealist neo-noir mystery about a fresh-faced aspiring actress, played by a captivating Naomi Watts, who encounters a disturbed amnesiac woman, portrayed by an alluring Laura Harring, and the ominous events that transpire while trying to determine Harring’s character’s identity. Why are sinister men following them? Why does the plot feel so disjointed? Could it be because this rejected television pilot has transformed into compelling cinema? All of this is told in an open-ended dream-like style with violence and sex throughout the story. Most viewers (and critics) are left scratching their heads throughout the journey, but the ride is a unique experience for each audience member. The circular storyline provides few exits as it unfolds in a typical Lynchian enigma.', '(This column is written jointly by a baby boomer, Denny Parish, and a millennial, Carson Parish, who also happen to be father and son.)']"

Lavishly thick, swooping skyward in a cartoon volute, Lynch’s coiffure, a virile cockscomb, was like Alfred Hitchcock’s profile or John Ford’s eye patch – inherently caricatural and so distinctive that it all but merited a zip code.', 'The hair, though, was just one aspect of a sharply etched visual persona all the more potent because it was composed of basic elements. And cigarettes.', 'Intrinsic to Lynch’s persona were the smokes he took up in childhood (in some interviews, he claimed to have picked up the habit at age eight), which may have contributed to his death on Jan 15 at 78.

Remembering David Lynch and his legacy ,https://www.highlandernews.org/92554/remembering-david-lynch-and-his-legacy/,"['An introduction to his work and where to start. ', 'On Jan. 15, 2025,  David Lynch, the visionary director, died from an ongoing struggle with lung cancer. He was a lifelong smoker, which led him to being homebound and dependent on an oxygen tank for his last couple of months of life. ', 'On Facebook, his family released a statement on his passing: “It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.’ It’s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.”', 'Lynch originally developed his skills as an artist at Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, The School of Museum of Fine Arts and The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He preferred social life to academics. He believed real learning happens outside of school. Lynch had a long film career from the 1970s to 2017, but he was most famous for directing and writing the TV show “Twin Peaks” with co-writer Robert Frost. His work has a cult following because he managed to move audiences with his unique films. ', 'Lynch’s popularity is evident in his frequent visits to Bob’s Big Boy in Burbank, CA; he ate there almost everyday in the 1970s. When learning of the surreal storyteller’s passing on Jan. 16, fans began to flock to Bob’s Big Boy. They not only wanted to enjoy “a damn fine cup of coffee” in honor of the director but also to see the framed picture of Lynch. ', 'In his book, “Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity,” Lynch devoted page 39 to Bob’s Big Boy: “I used to go to Bob’s Big Boy restaurant just about every day from the mid-seventies until the early eighties. I’d have a milkshake and sit and think. There’s a safety in thinking in a diner. You can have your coffee or your milkshake, and you can go off into strange dark areas, and always come back to the safety of the diner.” Lynch fans in the Los Angeles (LA) area have gathered around the diner to create a shrine in remembrance of Lynch’s legacy. Fans left cigarettes, Heineken beers, candles, flowers, coffee cups, money and other Lynch inspired items. ', 'Lynch’s films are known for their surrealism. Surrealism is “a movement in art and literature seeking to express the subconscious mind by any of a number of different techniques, including the irrational juxtaposition of realistic images [or] the creation of mysterious symbols.” Lynch used surrealism to help craft a story with the use of visual elements, such as color, composition, bizarre editing techniques and camera angles. His approach would leave readers confused. This makes the quality of his films special – so much so that a term was created for them – Lynchian films', '“Lynchian” films are described as “characteristic, reminiscent, or imitative of the films or television work of David Lynch.” Lynch is noted for juxtaposing surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments and for using compelling visual images to emphasize a dreamlike quality of mystery or menace.', 'Lynchian films are filled with absurd imagery and content, which forces the audience to think for themselves. This was his main philosophy: independent interpretation. Lynch didn’t like explaining his films to his viewers. Instead he urged them to close read for themselves. Lynchian films require careful attention to detail to all visual and narrative elements. ', 'What makes David Lynch’s work so unforgetable is the way he’s able to tell a story and push the limits through a visual medium. He was not afraid to be experimental. When you watch a Lynch film, you don’t forget the red curtains on top of the black and white zigzag floors from “Twin Peaks” (1990) or the red flowers against the bright blue skies from “Blue Velvet” (1986). From strange bunnies on the television in “Inland Empire” (2006), to mysterious characters and possible possessions in “Twin Peaks,”  this imagery drives viewers to be more engaged with the media they consume. ', 'For newcomers to the Lynch archive, the cult classic “Twin Peaks” is a good place to start. At its core, it’s a “whodunit” detective show about solving the murder of Laura Palmer, a local prom queen in a small Washington town. The show employs added elements of sci-fi and mystery. The series begins when Pete Martell from the Sawmill finds the prom queen wrapped in plastic on the beach. This prompts the FBI to get involved, which is where Agent Dale Cooper comes in. Cooper is a coffee and pie-obsessed, lovable character, who is played by Kyle MacLachlan. The viewer learns more about the town through his lens, through which the town’s darker secrets end up being revealed. ', 'The loss of David Lynch is not only felt by his family and friends, but also by his fans and the film industry. David Lynch was the filmmaker of his generation. The type of films he made are one of a kind. Lynchian films explore darker elements that feel like a fever dream.', '', '']"

"David Lynch: ‘Just a guy from Missoula, Montana’",https://www.montanakaimin.com/arts_and_culture/david-lynch-just-a-guy-from-missoula-montana/article_577cd77e-de74-11ef-a97a-d7bea3acd749.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'The late David Lynch was an avant-garde artist, a proud advocate of transcendental meditation and a gifted filmmaker whose tastes bordered on the surreal. At first look, none of those things seem particularly Montanan. ', 'So it may surprise some to learn that Lynch, the man behind cultural touchstones like “Twin Peaks” and “Mulholland Drive,” was born right here in Missoula. Or maybe you’re one of the many who’ve heard the rumor that he was born in the Wilma Theater. Sorry to disappoint, Lynch was born in a hospital, like most babies, but it’s easy to see how an iconic creative force could inspire such lore.  ', 'Lynch was born in Missoula in 1946, but he wouldn’t stay for long. His father, Don Lynch, studied forestry at the University of Montana, and his government job necessitated the family to move around frequently. As a result, David Lynch spent all of two months in the area and would never really return, but still proudly referred to himself as, “just a guy from Missoula, Montana.”  ', 'Lynch’s relationship with Missoula might be somewhat tentative, but it’s clear our community has a deep love and appreciation that’s come out in the wake of his death on Jan. 15. Coincidentally, his 2001 film “Mulholland Drive” was already set to screen at the Roxy Theater in 35mm the day after his death. Those screenings sold out, and when the Roxy added more, those quickly sold out, too. Their marquee was also changed in tribute to Lynch, reading, “Filmmaker, born Missoula Montana, Eagle Scout.”  ', 'According to University of Montana journalism professor Jule Banville, “The marquee at the Roxy said Eagle Scout, born in Missoula, because that’s how he’d describe himself, to give himself some sort of roots.”', 'Locally or otherwise, Lynch’s work has always tended to grab the attention of those who witness it. As Missoula-based podcast producer Jesse Brenneman recalled from his first experience with Lynch’s work, “I wasn’t able to sleep the first time I saw ‘Mulholland Drive.’ I was pissed off. I hated it. I was really angry at it for feeling like it was just confusing and weird.” But he still couldn’t stop thinking about it. “I went from hating it, to loving it, to being obsessed with Lynch and his work,” Brennemen said. ', 'Everyone finds their own meaning in their favorite pieces of art and Lynch’s work is no exception. Brenneman credits “Twin Peaks: The Return” for helping to shape him as a person. “It sort of integrated my experience with death and life and loss and the unknowability of the world, the mystical, the unexplainable, all that kind of stuff,” Brenneman said.  ', 'Lynch’s work dealt heavily with the esoteric and unknowable, and that extended to his interpretation of the Pacific Northwest. It has long been rumored that his 1986 hit film “Blue Velvet” was inspired by Missoula, and in particular, the Wilma Theater. Lynch dispelled that myth himself, but one can’t deny that this part of Western Montana feels kind of Lynchian. Slap a “directed by David Lynch” sticker on any window in town, and suddenly you’re in “Twin Peaks.”  ', 'David Lynch may not have seemed like a traditional Montana guy, but his father was, and it’s clear some of that influence was passed on. Take, for example, his 2006 book “Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity,” where he compares the concept of idea generation to fishing. It’s taking the out-there concept of transcendental meditation and framing it more iconically, and there is nothing more recognizably Montanan than a fishing metaphor. Lynch’s transitory childhood created both a sense of fantastical lore and a lack of a tangible origin. Being “a guy from Missoula, Montana” gave Lynch a sense of a hometown that he otherwise lacked.   ', 'David Lynch and his work meant a lot of things to a lot of people in Missoula’s community. The Roxy, a coincidental harbinger of Lynch’s passing, will host a five-film career retrospective throughout the month of February. Media outlets across the state will no doubt continue to run articles about Lynch for the next month or so, and a new generation of local fans and detractors alike will find his work for the first time.  ', '“I think for people who find David Lynch, it helps define them in some weird way,” Banville said.

Remember the Lighter Side of David Lynch with His Slapstick Short ‘The Cowboy and the Frenchman’,https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/david-lynch-short-film-1988-the-cowboy-and-the-frenchman-1235086300/,"['', 'On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark takes a feature-length beat to honor fringe cinema in the streaming age.', 'First, read the BAIT: a weird and wonderful pick from any time in film. Then, try the BITE: a breakdown of the movie’s ending, impact, and any other spoilers you’d want.', 'To steal from a popular meme this week, January has been the longest year of the month.', 'With Los Angeles still burning in the background, David Lynch died a few weeks ago — from complications of emphysema at 78 — and Hollywood went into sudden and deep mourning. Even against a steady stream of more bad news (politics, plane crashes, “Emilia Pérez” Oscar nominations), tributes to the late filmmaker are still going strong.  ', '', 'From “Eraserhead” to “Inland Empire,” the beloved director was a quintessential and divisive voice of midnight movie culture, one whose surreal embrace of genre and arthouse became a film category unto itself. We’re returning to our regularly scheduled themed programming next month, but before we fall into what we can only hope will be a better February, After Dark is doubling back for a little Lynch with a niche treasure oddly fitting for this moment. Tonight, we’re watching “The Cowboy and the Frenchman” from 1988.', 'A prolific artist with intoxicating dreams, Lynch made a slew of short films throughout his career. At first glance, this bite-sized farce is notable for introducing him to the late Harry Dean Stanton, who stars as the deaf cowboy Slim. Commissioned by the French magazine Le Figaro for a series about how foreign artists view the French (Werner Herzog and Jean-Luc Godard also participated), it endures as a pure injection of Lynchian Americana. It satirizes western stereotypes while its auteur experiments with his lightest inclinations as a humorist, playing with slapstick and silly redundant dialogue to confuse as well as charm.', 'When Pierre (Frederic Golchan) stumbles down a hillside into Slim’s homestead, he’s intercepted by ranch hands Pete (Jack Nance) and Dusty (Tracey Walter). It’ll take several minutes of Abbott and Costello-like exchanges for the cowboys to put together that Pierre only speaks French — and has been running away from an “Indian” named Broken Feather (Michael Horse AKA Hawk from “Twin Peaks”). But once the cowboys are done rifling through Pierre’s luggage, packed to the brim with wine, bread, cheese, and French fries, Slim decides to crack out the Budweiser and let the Parisian stay.', '', 'Leaning into your nightmares when facing times of uncertainty or grief works a lot of the time. That’s why horror movies have been doing so well. But after a difficult January — steeped in American exceptionalism among other horse shit — anyone still on a Lynch kick should consider watching this hidden gem as a palette cleanser. Although imperfect, “The Cowboy and the Frenchman” sees its filmmaker taking a break from his own dark fantasies to shaggily explore the idea of cultural exchanges using his favorite motifs and tropes. It’s a welcome reprieve and a warm reminder of Lynch’s wisdom.', '“The Cowboy and the Frenchman” is now streaming on MUBI.', '“The Cowboy and the Frenchman” is surprisingly quotable, with lines like “Flapjacks as big as a saddle-blanc-quette!” and “I told you we can’t eat that cheese!”  sticking in your brain after just one viewing. As the night wears on — and Slim, Pierre, Broken Feather, Dusty, and Pete are met by a group of singing girls out in the pitch-black pastures — the visuals fail to transcend, but the paradoxical party still feels like one that could only be put on by Lynch.', 'There are two common interpretations of this short. You can take the cowboys’ rough handling of the Parisian as an indictment of Americans’ reputation as international boneheads, or you can see the story overall as a snide remark on how the French think they are seen by the vast and varied United States. It takes a certain amount of self-obsession to recruit creatives to confess their feelings for your culture, and Lynch’s decision to turn down Le Figaro’s offer before eventually accepting supports that second theory.', '', 'With snails in his pockets and an inexplicable photo of Puerto Rican actor/director José Ferrer in his bag, Pierre spends the first half of the short waxing poetic about the beauty of Manhattan. He’s as fixated on the Statue of Liberty as “The Brutalist” — and recounts late-night affairs with rich conversation and “colorful pills” as upside-down symbols for urban elitism.', '“I saw a very tiny zebra in a Ford automobile,” Pierre coos in a moment away from the callous cowboys, delivered straight to the camera. He quakes in the presence of Broken Feather but conveys an almost spiritual sense of curiosity through his descriptions of the East Coast city. Later, as slow-motion scenes of a horse overlay cancan dancers and the men bond through a haze of booze and fresh air, Pierre reminisces on the prairies and the stars.', 'As cynical or gentle as you choose it to be, “The Cowboy and the Frenchman” culminates in a dark-haired French woman romancing Slim (“It’s a do-si-do, or it’s a do-si-dee…” she purrs) before Pierre starts kissing two American chicks (“Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?” one asks clumsily — with a twang.) A gun is shot in the air, and a mini-Lady Liberty appears. “Vive le France!” they all say. It’s a joyous moment, assuming free-wheeling sex and patriotism is your thing, and a crucial artifact from a filmmaker who could comment on commenting without ever sacrificing his own recursive perspective.', '', 'IndieWire After Dark publishes midnight movie recommendations every Friday night.

Mourning David Lynch in a City on Fire,https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-los-angeles/mourning-david-lynch-in-a-city-on-fire,"['One night in January, 2002, during the initial theatrical run of David Lynch’s “Mulholland Drive,” a friend and I, students at the University of Southern California, drove up toward the Hollywood Hills to seek out the road itself. Mulholland Drive runs a curvy twenty-one miles from end to end, and we didn’t drive nearly the whole way. We entered off the 101 Freeway, just north of the Hollywood Bowl, and headed slowly west, relying heavily on our headlights to find our way through the darkness. From time to time, we pulled over to search for a good view, but mainly just to sit there in the dark, soak up the silence, and talk a bit more about the most fascinating film we’d seen in ages—a beautiful and confounding thriller about a car accident, a bubbly blond actress, a dark-eyed amnesiac, a sulky director, a shitty espresso, a po-faced cowboy, a hobo behind a dumpster, Roy Orbison, Rita Hayworth, “Persona,” “Vertigo,” and more besides.', 'For weeks, Lynch’s film had haunted me like nothing else. It was dark and funny and sexy and intoxicating—a dream that followed me out of the theatre and into my waking reality, and a picture that obliterated, and then thrillingly restored, my understanding of what movies could do. For a nineteen-year-old burgeoning cinephile whose idea of nonlinear storytelling had been shaped by Quentin Tarantino, it was astonishing to see a filmmaker so fluent in the poetry of the irrational. I was least prepared of all for just how shattered “Mulholland Drive” would leave me: how could a movie so arrestingly strange, with so many layers of deadpan absurdity and film-noir pastiche, also be tender and moving beyond words?', 'I couldn’t answer that question, any more than I could puzzle out what was in the little blue box at the center of the story. But for a few delirious months, “Mulholland Drive” became an obsession, the dream movie of my dreams, even a precocious early declaration of critical identity. I urged friends to see the movie and screened it for many of them with a cinevangelist’s zeal. “I’ve Told Ev’ry Little Star,” a 1961 Linda Scott golden oldie that appears in the film, wound up greeting callers on my answering machine. At U.S.C., where seemingly every film student had a “Shawshank Redemption” poster on his dorm-room wall, taping up a gorgeous Italian one-sheet of “Mulholland Drive” felt like a peculiarly rebellious point of pride. I became convinced—and then remain convinced—that Naomi Watts, the film’s incandescent star, had given one of the greatest performances of the still young twenty-first century.', 'And so, perhaps channelling the spirit of Betty (Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring), the movie’s amateur-sleuth protagonists, my friend and I embarked on our nocturnal pilgrimage. Visiting during the day might have made more sense, but making sense felt antithetical to the spirit of “Mulholland Drive,” and I had no interest in shattering its spell. I just wanted to linger in its atmosphere a while longer, to clutch at Peter Deming’s seedily lustrous images and Angelo Badalamenti’s mournful caress of a score. I wondered what we might see: a black limousine, winding its way toward a roadside conflagration? A woman tottering downhill in a daze, the glittering magic-carpet expanse of Hollywood sloping off into the distance? We saw nothing of the sort, of course; the real Mulholland Drive seemed as reluctant to surrender its secrets as Lynch’s film was. All I remember seeing, by the light of the car’s high beams, was a grocery-store shopping cart abandoned on the side of the road. I decided—with a little overreach, admittedly—that this was an exquisitely Lynchian oddity: something banal that, by popping up where it didn’t belong, became ineluctably sinister.', 'In the years that followed, I ventured out in search of more “Mulholland Drive” hot spots. The farthest-flung of these was in Paris, where, in 2013, some friends and I half-heartedly tried to get into Club Silencio, a night club modelled on one of the film’s most electrifying sequences. Most of my excursions were closer to home. A year or so after that Mulholland drive, I wound up outside a Silver Lake apartment complex, charming in mock-Tudor brown and beige, that had somehow led Lynch to think, Ah, yes, what a perfect place to discover a corpse. If I had ventured about fifteen miles south, to Gardena, I could have enjoyed a cup of coffee at Caesar’s Restaurant—a now shuttered diner that, thanks to “Mulholland Drive,” will live forever as Winkie’s on Sunset Boulevard. Here, Lynch reminded us that the most chilling nightmares unfold in broad daylight.', 'Lynch’s movies are often described as surreal and unnerving, an entirely accurate assessment that doesn’t fully capture the violent havoc they can wreak on a newcomer’s expectations. I can only imagine the initial impact of “Eraserhead,” Lynch’s hallucinatory début feature, when it first emerged, in 1977, and became a midnight-movie sensation. But I still remember seeing it for the first time and thinking that nothing I’d read about it, in squeamish preparation, could have possibly blunted the pustular glory of its images, the otherworldly drone of its sound design, or its air of lysergic rot. “Eraserhead” was a movie that made you feel as though you’d truly seen everything, but Lynch had far more to show us. His flair for the grotesque found an affecting, unexpectedly classical framework in “The Elephant Man” (1980), which earned him the first of three richly deserved, unsurprisingly fruitless Oscar nominations for Best Director. Next came the critical and commercial disaster of “Dune” (1984), a rare foray into studio filmmaking that Lynch ultimately disavowed; even now, though, the unfettered intricacy and imagination of his visual design could hardly be ascribed to any other filmmaker.', 'An astonishing resurgence followed with “Blue Velvet” (1986), a masterwork of psychosexual terror that outraged as many as it captivated. Lynch dared us to watch, through our fingers, as a disturbingly off-kilter comedy of small-town mores became increasingly subsumed in an erotic miasma of fairy-tale dread. The movie is built around an Oedipal triangle whose transgressive power hasn’t dissipated in the slightest, resting, as it does, on the unshakable foundations of its actors: a boyishly corruptible Kyle MacLachlan, a bewitchingly vulnerable Isabella Rossellini, and a primally terrifying Dennis Hopper. But what lingers just as persistently is a certain slipperiness of intent—a sense that Lynch himself, so aware of the complex, symbiotic play of light and darkness in human nature, was content to flit eternally, and with a mosquito’s fickle curiosity, between two moral poles. Did “Blue Velvet” offer a straight-faced spoof, an enraged evisceration, or a half-hearted affirmation of Reagan’s America and its discontents? The question can still divide people, and I suspect that great puritanical swaths of today’s audience—those who demand clear thematic signposts, abhor frank treatments of sexuality, and find moral ambiguity repellent—are less equipped to grapple intelligently with “Blue Velvet” than even their fuming 1986 counterparts were.', 'Even among Lynch’s more thoughtful admirers, the need to decisively pin him down continues apace. Arguments still rage about the precise ratio of sincerity to irony in the director’s work—a debate that, for me, ultimately says less about Lynch than it does about the limitations of critical language, especially when such language is applied to an artist whose work is this unfiltered and instinctual. Even so, I’d venture that there is both sincerity and irony aplenty in Lynch, and the two aren’t necessarily in tension; each one illuminates and nourishes the other. Think of them as sweatily companionable bedfellows—or, if you prefer, transmigratory souls.', 'In the days and weeks since Lynch’s death, at the age of seventy-eight, I’ve found myself thinking a lot about the Los Angeles that he left behind. He was, to be sure, a pan-American artist, with a sensibility steeped in many a regional cauldron. Missoula, Montana, where he was born, bequeathed him a folksy Eagle Scout congeniality, all nasal delivery and gee-whiz enthusiasm. He spent much of his childhood in Spokane, Washington, a period that would be enshrined in the lushly menacing Pacific Northwest landscapes of “Twin Peaks.” He studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, in Philadelphia, a city that he later described, in interviews, as a place of unrivalled foulness: “I saw horrible things, horrible, horrible things while I lived there,” he told the Philadelphia Inquirer, in 1986. “It was truly inspiring.”', 'Lynch moved to Los Angeles in the early nineteen-seventies to study at the American Film Institute; there, he began working on “Eraserhead,” much of which was shot on A.F.I.-owned locations. His later films, such as “Lost Highway” (1997) and “Mulholland Drive,” would reveal more of the city’s seamy beauty, finding menace in the sunshine and wandering down perilous roads to nowhere. His films delighted in collapsing the city’s past and its present together, in discovering cultural and architectural vestiges of an older Los Angeles tucked in among the city’s newer façades. It’s significant, I think, that all three of Lynch’s L.A.-set movies are so rooted in convulsive games of identity: think of Fred the saxophonist (Bill Pullman) morphing inexplicably into Pete the auto mechanic (Balthazar Getty) in “Lost Highway,” or Laura Dern shape-shifting at will in every other scene of “Inland Empire” (2006). It’s as if Lynch were remarking on not just the inherent plasticity of the motion-picture medium but also on a city known for its endless self-reinvention—and often derided, wrongly, as a cesspool of inauthenticity.', 'Lynch’s love for Los Angeles, and the inimitable, unfakeable reality of his presence around the city, gave the lie to that charge. In December, 2006, Lynch exposed the gussied-up absurdity of Oscar season with his own wonderfully absurd gesture, by launching a memorable one-man awards campaign for Dern in “Inland Empire.” He parked himself at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, sitting next to an enormous “for your consideration” poster with Dern’s face, a live cow, and a sign that read “without cheese there wouldn’t be an inland empire.” (It was one of the few times that he came even close to providing a rationale for his work.)', 'Elsewhere, Lynch was an insistent creature of habit, and his habits—always wearing top-buttoned white shirts, forever espousing the virtues of Transcendental Meditation—often became the stuff of local legend. For years, he could be found eating lunch at Bob’s Big Boy in Burbank, an establishment whose nineteen-fifties stylings fit right in with his love of diners, jukeboxes, and other scraps of vintage Americana. Later in his career, Lynch captivated his fans—and doubtless made some new ones—with a series of daily weather reports, delivered from his perch in the Hollywood Hills. If you didn’t know better, you might have suspected that his oddball geniality was some sort of cultivated affectation—a knowingly bold counterpoint to his attraction to the outrageous and the grotesque. But it never would have occurred to Lynch that there was any contradiction to begin with. He drew no tidy, self-flattering distinctions between normalcy and perversity, humor and seriousness. His unawareness that he was doing anything particularly subversive may have been the most subversive thing about him.', 'Lynch stopped doing weather reports in 2022. A lifelong smoker, he announced in August that he was suffering from emphysema so severe that he had been effectively housebound since the covid-19 pandemic. I can’t help but wonder what meteorological forecasts he might have delivered this January, in light of the disastrous wildfires that have devastated Los Angeles. A Deadline report quoted anonymous sources claiming that one of the fires, the Sunset Fire, forced Lynch to relocate from his home, and that, after the evacuation, the director’s precarious health had taken a turn for the worse. (No cause of death was given.)', 'Before his death, it was possible to declare, or at least hope, that every generation would get the Lynch masterwork it deserves. For his earliest admirers, it was surely “Blue Velvet”; for a more recent wave of converts, it may have been “Twin Peaks: The Return” (2017), the magnificently uncompromised third season of his landmark 1990-91 TV series, “Twin Peaks.” Still others would make the case—and I wouldn’t disagree—for “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me” (1992), a devastating feature-length spinoff that, received at the time with scorn and bewilderment, has since been reclaimed as one of Lynch’s supreme achievements.', 'For me, it was “Mulholland Drive,” a movie that may have been too much for television (it was famously salvaged from the ruins of a rejected ABC pilot), but proved to be the best kind of too much for cinema. This was the film that finally made a four-star believer out of Roger Ebert, until then a longtime critical holdout on Lynch’s work. (“There is something inside of me that resists the films of David Lynch,” began Ebert’s pan of the director’s 1990 film, “Wild at Heart.”) In the years since, “Mulholland Drive” has become Lynch’s consensus masterpiece; it landed at No. 8 in the 2022 Sight & Sound critics’ poll of the greatest films of all time. I’m sympathetic to the idea, as some have grumbled, that all this canonization is a bit premature, and that the sheer seductiveness of “Mulholland Drive” has made it a little too hip and easy to love: the most basic bitch of Surrealist classics. But I’ve never come close to falling out of love with it. To do so would feel a little like falling out of love with Los Angeles itself.', '“Mulholland Drive” was the second film in Lynch’s unofficial L.A. trilogy; the other two left their own marks on the landscape. Even now, I can’t walk down Hollywood Boulevard without briefly reflecting back on “Inland Empire,” in which a tormented film actress, Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), is gutted with a screwdriver and pukes blood all over the Walk of Fame: “You dyin’, lady,” a homeless onlooker mutters. Another Lynch landmark was his three-house compound in the Hollywood Hills, part of which became a set in “Lost Highway”—transformed, in what felt like an act of almost confessional intimacy, into a distended labyrinth of domestic horror, where even a darkened corridor can open up a portal to the unknown. To speculate about what that unknown might be part of the fun; it may also be beside the point in a movie that never once departs the maelstrom of Lynch’s subconscious.', 'The weekend after Lynch died, “Inland Empire” happened to be showing in an American Cinematheque retrospective, and the event became a kind of impromptu memorial. The screening was at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, mere steps away from the spot where Dern’s Nikki staggered, fell, and vomited all that blood, and the place was packed with Lynch buffs. Before the main feature, the Cinematheque screened a short excerpt from a video interview, in which the director talked about his specific love for Los Angeles:', 'I love the light there. I live there. And I love the feel of it. And I’m always saying, when you’re there in L.A., on some nights in summer, maybe the spring, this night jasmine smell comes, and sometimes there’s a wind, and you can feel the golden age of Hollywood in the air, and it’s pretty magical. And there’s big studios, big sound stages. I love these big sound stages, factories for making cinema. So there’s—and then there’s the star system, and all this going on. It’s all kind of part of this dream. There’s a lot wrong with it, but that part is a big lure to people.', '“Inland Empire” was, among other things, a furiously detailed exploration of that “a lot wrong with it.” When the movie was first released, it was rightly greeted as a darker, uglier, even more violently destabilizing companion piece to “Mulholland Drive”—another dreamlike dismantling of the dream factory, only this time, the dream had been entirely shorn of its seductive verve. For three hours, Nikki, played by Dern with an often terrifying magnificence, navigated a shifting labyrinth of chambers and antechambers, run-down homes and cavernous sound stages, shedding and accruing identities at every turn. She was stalked and menaced, drowned in identities but robbed of selfhood, and—just to underscore the movie’s view of Hollywood as a pimp’s game—thrust into a roomful of leering, dancing sex workers. “Inland Empire” was a tragedy and a prophecy: it was Lynch’s first (and last) feature film shot on digital video, a medium that, in its thrift and ease of use, encouraged his will to experiment. It also seemed to capture, in the grubbiness of its textures, the vibe of a Hollywood swiftly fading and degrading beyond recognition. The movie made no sense; it made all the sense in the world.', 'And if it makes no sense now that David Lynch is gone, there is consolation in knowing that his presence among us was, to begin with, the most irrational and undeserved of gifts. Certainly, there was solace in the gathering that Saturday night, where the reverence of diehard Lynch obsessives seemed to commingle, excitingly, with a newbie’s sense of bafflement and discovery. Exiting through the lobby, you couldn’t miss a familiar, heartening post-screening buzz: sounds of laughter and exasperation; hesitant, hazardous attempts at analysis; confused variations on “What was that all about?” We could have just seen “Eraserhead” or “Blue Velvet,” or stumbled out of “Mulholland Drive,” as some friends and I did, not too far away, more than two decades earlier. And then we did what we did back then—wandered out, lost in thought and in cinema, into the dark shimmer of another L.A. night. ♦', 'Has an old Soviet mystery finally been solved?', 'Why the rules of mustard and spaghetti sauce don’t apply to ketchup.', 'How the Unabomber avoided the death penalty.', 'The actress who magnified her celebrity by suddenly renouncing it.', 'The shareable feast of Jeremy Allen White’s Calvin Klein ad.', 'Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: “Girl”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

A longtime devotee of Transcendental Meditation and a dedicated liver of “the art life,” Lynch would likely point out that he had merely shed his physical body. “It’s a continuum,” he once said, “and we’re all going to be fine at the end of the story.”', 'He was a filmmaker of singular vision, whose work often combined elements of Surrealism, horror, and melodrama with a seemingly naive—even parodic—brand of “aw shucks” innocence. Applied to Lynch’s films, the word “weird” often feels insufficient, so a new adjective, “Lynchian,” was coined. That word also falls short of encapsulating his work.', 'Below, four MoMA staff members reflect on Lynch’s work.', 'David Lynch at the 42nd Emmy Awards - Governor’s Ball, September 1990', 'In Testament of Orpheus (1960), Jean Cocteau says, “The privilege of the cinematograph is that it allows a large number of people to dream the same dream together and show the fantasies of unreality with the rigor of realism.” Cocteau described what the Surrealists (and he himself) had been doing in cinema: to create surrealism, one doesn’t necessarily need to use special effects or show parallel universes. Instead, the artist must focus on the disturbing details of reality and see where they take us. Honoring this notion, David Lynch dove deep into the human mind, blurring the lines between love and violence, pleasure and chaos, innocence and perversion. In doing so, he reaffirmed that cinema is the most transparent of all mediums.', 'I was 18—close to the age of Kyle MacLachlan’s character—when I first saw Blue Velvet (1986) in a theater, and I still remember how it revealed things about myself that I was unaware of. The film showed that there was something scary and disturbing behind life’s pristine facades and blue suburban skies; I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. Five years later, I was lucky to meet the director for an interview. The smoke of his cigarette and the strange twirl in his hair brought to mind his characters’ seductive, vertiginous curiosity as he patiently listened to me offering interpretations of his work. He rejected them, adding they were nothing but ideas born in the strange world we all live in. Once the interview ended, he invited me to talk about meditation.', '“It’s like I’m having the most beautiful dream…and the most terrible nightmare, all at once.” Those words still echo from when I heard them in Twin Peaks (1990–91), which haunted millions of TV viewers after they turned off their sets and went to bed. (The show’s third season, released in 2017, dared to go even further into the unexplainable realms of our psyches.) I first saw the pilot episode on a flight troubled by thunder and incessant turbulence—possibly due to my choice of inflight entertainment. David Lynch made no concessions in revealing the stuff that our dreams are made of, and knew that light and darkness go hand in hand, like coffee and cherry pie. I often think of their taste when giving myself to the film screen without resistance, like someone going into the night.\n—Francisco Valente, Curatorial Assistant, Department of Film', 'Twin Peaks. 2017. USA. Directed by David Lynch', 'I am often asked what a producer does at MoMA, and usually I respond with something like, “Whatever is needed” or “I make stuff happen.” There is no better example of making stuff happen than when we had the distinct honor of presenting David Lynch’s Twin Peaks (aka Season Three, aka Twin Peaks: The Return) on the big screen as a part of our series The Contenders in January 2018. I can’t recall whose idea it was to make a run at Twin Peaks, but we have many Lynch fans on staff, and it could have been any one of us. The Department of Film has a long history with Lynch, including working with him to restore his debut feature, Eraserhead, and screening his under-seen concert documentary Duran Duran: Unstaged in the 2013 installment of The Contenders. Having worked on these collaborations, I was able to email Lynch’s longtime producer Sabrina Sutherland with our pitch; thankfully, she was enthusiastic.', 'The biggest hurdle was creating a digital file of the show that we could screen in our theater, which involved a rush order from our friends at the Fotokem film lab, who delivered the drive the day before the first screening. We broke the series down into three installments, with Parts 1–4 on Friday evening, Parts 5–11 on Saturday, and Parts 12–18 on Sunday. The screenings were free and open to the public, and each installment averaged over 250 attendees, with a handful of true believers who watched every minute of the series. During a break in between screenings on the last day, we treated everyone to cherry pie and a “damn fine cup of coffee” in our lounge, just as Agent Cooper would have wanted us to. To my knowledge, that was the only theatrical screening of Twin Peaks.\n—Sean Egan, Senior Producer, Department of Film', 'The Straight Story. 1999. USA. Directed by David Lynch', 'David Lynch was a master of the dreamlike and macabre, yet what you see in his films is often exactly what you get. It’s not hard to understand why Mel Brooks nicknamed Lynch “Jimmy Stewart from Mars”; his public persona was far out while weirdly down to earth, all too appropriate for a Surrealist who was also a shrewd businessman and canny self-promoter. It’s true he famously refused to reveal how he fabricated the Eraserhead baby, but by and large, Lynch did not make his filmmaking sound like rocket science. Instead, even before he took to formally promoting Transcendental Meditation as a side hustle, Lynch pushed the idea that if he could make art, so could you. For me, that’s Lynch: an avant-garde filmmaker who managed to eke out an uncompromising career in a more adventurous period of Hollywood history, gifted with the ability to discuss his wackiest choices the same way you or I might talk about changing a lightbulb.', 'Rated G and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, Lynch’s eighth feature, The Straight Story, is something of an outlier in his filmography, maybe because it lacks the attention-grabbing trademarks that, in the hands of lesser filmmakers, become “Lynchian” clichés. The movie has no enigmatic blondes in captivity, no main characters haunted by psychotic doppelgängers, no elliptical dream montages or extended sequences in which somebody’s head gets smashed through a car window. Instead, Lynch and his screenwriter Mary Sweeney mine plenty of drama from the real-life story of Alvin Straight, a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War, who drove a John Deere lawnmower 240 miles (averaging five miles per hour) in order to reconcile with his estranged brother. If you’ve seen Lynch’s other films, you might spend this one anticipating something going horribly wrong along the journey of its 70-something protagonist, played with unfakeable grace by the actor Richard Farnsworth while he was dying of prostate cancer. (Alvin’s brother Lyle is played by Lynch regular Harry Dean Stanton.)', 'Lynch shows how Straight’s passing acknowledgment of past troubles—with drinking, with his brother Lyle, or in the trenches in WWII—can do more to shake the viewer than an elaborate flashback scene, a showstopping monologue, or a perfectly timed musical cue. (The score, by Lynch’s collaborator Angelo Badalamenti, does mix operatic and ambient registers, but it tends to thrum as background during scenes that refuse easy dramatic resolution.) Lynch gives us clues about the life of this stubborn old man before refracting them back onto the landscape, like a dream of better days remembered, possibly inspired by his lifelong obsession with Edward Hopper. By leaving the fireworks to the viewer’s imagination, The Straight Story offers a radical—and sublime—minimalist vision of a bygone America. It also serves (alongside The Elephant Man) as proof that, if he had wanted to, Lynch could have built a fine career as a more conventional dramatist.\n—Steve Macfarlane, Department Assistant, Department of Film', 'Dune is David Lynch’s worst film. The critics despised it. Audiences avoided it. Lynch disavowed it.', 'Eleven-year-old me fell in love with it.', 'This love of Dune—the real Dune—has survived from that first time in the theater through VHS, DVD, and streaming versions, and I still watch it as often as my wife will tolerate. I cannot defend it as a coherent cinematic achievement, but it does contain glimmers of genius—and in a way it gave us the David Lynch we celebrate today.', 'When Roger Ebert proclaimed that Dune’s “portentious lines of pop profundity are allowed to hang in the air unanswered, while additional characters arrive or leave on unexplained errands,” he could easily have been describing Twin Peaks. In light of the unexplained weirdness that attracts so many to Lynch’s work, it’s tempting to argue that one man’s “incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time” is another man’s enigmatic, dreamlike, anti-commercial classic. But here’s the thing: David Lynch didn’t end up liking it either. Google can provide the details of its troubled production; suffice it to say the story was too big and the studio was too involved. “It was too much to tell in that amount of time,” Lynch later explained. “So it was like a fantastic Porsche car kind of compacted down into…it’s still a Porsche, but it’s hard to drive it and it doesn’t look so good anymore.”', 'The film Lynch described as a “nightmare” is no secret masterpiece, but it still contains sublime moments of bewilderment, abjection, and ravishing beauty that have become his hallmarks. It’s a broken window, and David Lynch comes peeking through the cracks. For Lynch it was a hard-learned lesson: “Don’t make a film if it can’t be the film you want to make. It’s a joke…and a sick joke. And it’ll kill you.” That lesson gave us Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart—unadulterated Lynch, the straight stuff. Dune also gave Lynch collaborators he would return to again and again: Dean Stockwell, Brad Dourif, Everett McGill, and the film’s star, a complete unknown named Kyle MacLachlan.', 'Lynch eschewed bitterness, picked the carcass clean, and got back to work. “Dune is a huge, gigantic sadness in my life,” he admitted. “But I’m still happy that you like it. I like many, many parts of Dune myself.”\n—Jason Persse, Assistant Director, Content', 'For a brief time during World War\nII, truth was more surreal than\nfiction in MoMA’s film department.', 'Steve Macfarlane', 'Feb 2, 2024', 'Magazine Podcast', 'Two admirers discuss Agnès\nVarda’s gift for human connection.', 'Rajendra Roy, Natasha Giliberti', 'Jul 3, 2019', '', '', '', '', 'Art and the Senses', 'Go behind the scenes of a\nmonumental installation that explores\nhow the invisible can be the most\nevocative element of an artwork.', 'Sarah Cowan', 'Oct 7, 2024', '', '', '', '', '']"
David Lynch’s death shocks smokers into quitting: ‘It’s just not good for us’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/04/david-lynch-smoking-quitters,"['Smoking was having a comeback – until the director’s death after an emphysema diagnosis complicated its allure', 'David Lynch was a smoker. With an American Spirit perpetually locked between his teeth, he figured fire and smoke as magical textures in his films. To Lynch, cigarettes weren’t merely delicious, but sacred: they gave him the impression of breathing in the world, then blowing it back out again with fabulous grace.', 'Born in 1946 – 20 years before the US surgeon general pronounced for the first time that cigarettes could cause cancer – Lynch came up in a time when American glamor was buttressed by cigarettes and cinema. Actors like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis danced a beautiful and foolish waltz with death, smoke in hand, while cigarettes were considered the sine qua non of the artist’s life, an ashtray piled up with butts evidence of a good day’s work. “I always associated smoking and drinking coffee with the art life. They go hand in hand,” Lynch told the Independent in 2013.', 'Eleven years later, in his final interview, Lynch revealed to People magazine that a 2020 diagnosis of emphysema, a chronic lung condition, had forced him to quit one of the great romances of his life.', 'To Lydia Kiesling, a Portland-based writer and smoker, Lynch’s smoking exit interview was “more catalyzing for me than anything ever has been”. After taking up smoking at 15, Kielsing had been seesawing off and on again ever since, unable to quit a habit she’d fallen in love with (nearly 70% of smokers say they want to quit; the cessation rate is much lower, at 8.8% of smokers in 2022). Now 40, and conscious that the damage done to her lungs may be irreversible, Kiesling said that she found Lynch’s interview sobering: “To me he was a genius of living, and that included smoking, and it mattered a lot to me to see him stop.”', 'It’s been nearly 50 days since Kiesling’s last cigarette, a number she intends to push higher following Lynch’s death at age 78, 20 days ago. When the cravings feel particularly intense, Kiesling thinks of how smoking ruined Lynch’s health, and his stubborn love for cigarettes regardless. While Lynch always held those kinds of contradictions in his films with generosity and curiosity, he offered one unequivocal statement towards the end of his life: “You can quit these things that are going to end up killing you,” he said. Smoking is, after all, the number one preventable cause of death in the US. All of this helps Kiesling stave off cigarettes for at least one more day.', 'Tom Bardem, a 27-year-old British expat in Melbourne, Australia – also a Lynch fan and smoker – says he has witnessed a flurry of people online and in his personal life quit since Lynch’s death. “It felt like an urge to his fans to quit alongside him,” he said.', 'While statistically, smoking is at an all-time low – less than 12% of Americans smoke today; it was about 41% when Lynch was born – cigarettes re-entered our cultural imagination after the pandemic. According to research by Smoke Free Media, depictions of smoking on screen are very much in vogue. Photos of contemporary smoking icons like Chloë Sevigny and Kate Moss regularly make the rounds on popular Instagram pages @ciginfluencers and @indiesleaze. Enfant terrible popstars like Charli xcx and Addison Rae have made cigarettes a core part of their brand imagery. Models walk the runway cigarette in hand, championing the kind of luxury fatalism and art-fueled hedonism that led someone like Lynch to smoke in the first place. Smoking has become a rebuke to an era of puritanism, and of relentless self-improvement and self-surveillance. But Lynch’s death complicates this conveniently rebellious attitude.', '“There aren’t as many celebrities dying of smoking-related illnesses as there once were, so Lynch’s death has had a profound impact on me,” said Bardem. While he has “cut back a lot”, he’s still finding it difficult to resist the Saturday night beer and smoke. “But I do think when I eventually pack smoking in fully, I’ll look back at Lynch’s death as one of the big catalysts for me,” he said.', 'The great smokers of Lynch’s youth – Bette Davis, Clark Gable, Betty Grable – all died terrible deaths of conditions related to smoking, and inspired smoking to be reconceived as the most wretched of societal diseases. That Lynch died still in love with his vice and in acknowledgment of how bad it was, is helping a number of smokers to put down the stick for good.', '“When you start you only notice what smoking gives you (social connection, focus, a reason to dip out from work). Paying attention to what it was taking away, before it got as unignorable as what Lynch is talking about, helped me quit for good,” wrote a fan on X.', 'Others have found the strength to admit how heartbreaking their quitting is. “It’s just not good for us, and it’s OK to be really sad about that,” said Kiesling. “Maybe in the afterlife what we love is good for us.”']"

I could barely leave the house my anxiety was so bad.', 'If “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me” had been a slap in the face, season three hit like the atomic bomb that exploded in episode eight. It was a 16-hour art film that contained all of Lynch’s tropes from stilted soap opera-style dialogue to good music to violence, absurd humor and all that weirdness.', 'Lynch reminded me to be weird. To believe in myself, my ideas and stay the course. To dream.', 'Given the nightmares Lynch unleashed in his artwork, it is humorous to see his folksy artistic side that subsisted on coffee, sugar and cigarettes, spoke loudly and always tried to be generous to everyone, even those who asked what his work meant.

"Mark Kermode on… David Lynch, a one-off visionary who was also incredibly funny",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/01/mark-kermode-on-david-lynch-a-one-off-visionary-who-was-also-incredibly-funny,"['The US film-maker, who died last month, took surrealism mainstream with Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and more. He was also a champion of meditation and excelled at delivering a well-timed gag', 'I\nn January 1997, I went to Paris to interview the great American surrealist film-maker David Lynch, who died at the end of last month aged 78. Lynch was in an upbeat mood because the European reviews for his new feature, Lost Highway, had been glowing – even in Spain, where the film had been screened to critics with the reels in the wrong order. “I heard about that!” he laughed. “It gives you an indication of how the human mind can work with pieces even when they’re out of order. How it seeks to make sense of something, and makes it work somehow. It’s a beautiful thing.” And then he laughed some more.', 'Over the years, I had the privilege of interviewing Lynch many times, talking about his movies, music, paintings and his passion for transcendental meditation. As he told me when I spoke to him on stage for the Guardian in 2007 after a screening of his latest (and, as it turned out, last) feature, Inland Empire: “It allows any human being to dive within and transcend and experience the unbounded, infinite ocean of pure vibrant consciousness – bliss, intelligence, creativity, love, power, energy, all there within.”', 'Lynch’s interest in TM dated back to the days of his nightmarish first feature, Eraserhead (1977; not available to stream), a midnight-movie classic in which Jack Nance tends to an alien-looking baby, its body swaddled in bandages from which only a monstrous head and neck emerge. Lynch described Eraserhead as “a dream of dark and troubling things”. I noted that, if TM created such positivity, people might wonder about all the darkness in Lynch’s films. “Exactly!” he replied. “I thought when I started meditation that I was going to get real calm and peaceful and it’s going to be over. It’s not that way, it’s so energetic. It’s tremendous creativity. The artist doesn’t have to suffer to show suffering. You gotta understand it. You don’t have to die to do a death scene. You just have to understand it in your own way. But understanding is the thing, understand this suffering, this anger, this character.”', 'The ominous soundtrack of Eraserhead – a symphony of industrial noises and otherworldly windscapes – was created in partnership with Alan Splet, the sound designer and sound editor whose collaborations with Lynch ran from early shorts such as The Grandmother (1970) to features such as Dune (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986). It was Splet who helped Lynch conjure the steam-and-smoke-filled sounds of Victorian England in The Elephant Man (1980) – a film exec-produced by Mel Brooks, who described Lynch as “Jimmy Stewart from Mars”. When I visited Lynch at his recording studio in Los Angeles several years after Splet’s death in 1994, he showed me the plaque marking the spot in the floor of his mixing console where some of Splet’s ashes were placed, his spirit continuing to guide Lynch in his audio endeavours.', 'Lynch’s other great sonic collaborator was composer Angelo Badalamenti, who cameos as a nightclub pianist in Blue Velvet, and plays the coffee-spitting Luigi Castigliane in Mulholland Drive (2001), which began life as a rejected TV pilot and went on to be voted film of the decade by everyone from Cahiers du Cinéma to the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. The master of the suspended chord, Badalamenti’s scores for Lynch’s films ranged from the violent Palme d’Or winner Wild at Heart (1990) to sentimental oddity The Straight Story (1999) via the TV series Twin Peaks (1990-1, 2017) and its spin-off feature Fire Walk With Me (1992). One of the proudest moments of my career was being asked by Lynch and Badalamenti to provide the liner notes for a vinyl reissue of the Fire Walk With Me soundtrack – a film I had loved and championed on its first release, but which had been derided by critics and rejected by audiences, only to be reassessed years later as a lost masterpiece.', 'As for Lynch, anyone who saw his turn as John Ford in Spielberg’s The Fabelmans (2022) will know just how funny he could be. My own favourite memory of Lynch comes from a hilarious moment in that Inland Empire interview when I asked a very long and involved question about whether the recurrent image of electricity arcing in his films somehow “relates to what you think about the synaptic arcs in our brains”. If you watch the video, you can see Lynch silently luring me in – because he knew (as did I) that we’d addressed this exact same question just a few months earlier in LA, and he’d given me a fulsome answer. But this time he just let me tie myself up in knots before leaning in to microphone, pausing for a moment, and then saying with a smile: “No.”', 'The audience burst into riotous laughter, and well they might. It was one of the best-timed gags I have ever seen, and I remain hugely proud to have been the punchline.', 'All titles in bold are available to stream', 'The Brutalist\n(In cinemas)\nBrady Corbet’s tale of a Hungarian emigre trying to make his way in post-second world war America won a Silver Lion at Venice last year and is now up for 10 Oscars, including best picture. It’s a timely film, all the more relevant in the wake of the border-closing mania currently gripping the US and elsewhere.', 'Yachts: Missing in Action – The Lost Tapes 1980-81\n(4BE)\nFrom the vaults of one of my favourite bands of all time, who bridged the gap between post-punk powerpop and lyrical balladry, comes this barnstorming collection of 17 unreleased recordings, originally planned for Yachts’s unrealised third album.

,https://www.cbr.com/eraserhead-1978-david-lynch-child-prop-mystery/,"['The late David Lynch was a masterful storyteller, and his works will likely remain cinematic staples for generations to come. His unique sensibilities and love for creative freedom are central pillars of his many works. Like many filmmaking legends, Lynch was a stickler for detail and an adept visual illusionist capable of turning ordinary scenery into eye-popping art.', 'Of course, a magician never reveals his secrets. Lynch’s work yielded countless innovations, but he still held some secrets. As a lover of deep thought, he rarely offered concreted explanations for his surrealist masterpieces. And one of the greatest Lynchian conundrums is buried in his first film, Eraserhead.', 'It’s hard to explain Lynch’s filmmaking debut. Upon its debut, the film’s abstract narrative and dogged dedication to surrealism relegated it to small midnight screenings. It attracted plenty of critical praise, but it never gained much widespread commercial purchase. In many ways, Eraserhead can be considered Lynch’s strangest film — an unabashedly unique dance through a landscape of interlocking dreams and nightmares.', 'Eraserhead tells its story through a mix of strategic dialog, hypnotic visuals, and unnerving sound design. The stark black-and-white scenery recalls the captivating allure of its German Impressionist forerunners. At the same time, its audio tricks allude to Lynch’s future endeavors.', ""Universal could potentially capitalize on the success of Dune: Part Two by giving fans what they really want -- David Lynch's official Director's Cut."", 'Narratively, the story is surprisingly simple. Young Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is in a relationship with Mary (Charlotte Stewart). He is set to meet his girlfriend’s parents, and he’s understandably nervous. He is, after all, the protagonist of a Lynchian tale. His fears are only confirmed when Mary gives birth during dinner, although the offspring’s humanity is intentionally ambiguous.', 'The reluctant couple moves into Henry’s one-room apartment. There, they struggle to care for their child, although the infant is usually shown as a swaddled bundle. Rare glimpses of its face reveal that the “baby” has a severely deformed face. As time passes, the infant’s condition worsens; it develops sores and struggles to breathe.', 'This decline marks the film’s rapid descent into madness. Henry begins experiencing visions. He has an affair with the girl across the hall (Judith Anna Roberts) and suffers from disturbing dreams. Eventually, he slices into his infant’s swaddling, and the film ends in a cavalcade of surrealistic horror.', 'Already, the film has countless mysteries. Lynch’s cinematic debut is dedicated to its surrealist roots. Its seemingly straightforward plot is marked by countless instances of the director’s characteristic mind-bending horror. Even its official credits are filled with head-scratching abstractions. Mary’s parents are succinctly listed as Mister and Missus X. Henry’s neighbor is credited as the “Beautiful Girl Across the Hall.”', 'As is to be expected, Lynch rarely explains unnecessary details. Audiences don’t really need to know Mary’s last name. It’s irrelevant to the overarching plot, after all. Likewise, there’s no need for viewers to know the names of “The Lady in the Radiator” (Laurel Near) or “The Man in the Planet” (Jack Fisk). In many ways, explicitly stating their titles would strip away a good chunk of the film’s mystique.', 'Dune is a masterpiece of sci-fi; however, David disowned his 1984 adaptation for several reasons.', 'However, the film’s greatest mystery isn’t its abstract plot. Critics and cinephiles have debated these points for decades, but Eraserhead’s biggest unsolved mystery is something more physical. More precisely, audiences are left to wonder where and how Lynch acquired the film’s disturbing inhuman “infant.”', 'Though often swaddled in thick cloth, Henry’s mutated baby is a blatant affront to normal sensibilities. Its origins and construction are and were subject to espionage-level secrecy. Lynch never allowed crew members to see him setting up the prop. When asked for details, Lynch only stated that it was “born nearby,” although he sometimes cryptically said it may have been “found.” Regardless, the puppet-like prop could move its neck, eyes, and mouth.', 'Despite its grotesque appearance, Eraserhead’s crew grew fond of Lynch’s infantile monstrosity. Lead actor Jack Nance even dubbed the prop “Spike.” However, nobody has ever come forward with in-depth information on the prop’s origins.', 'Still, some possibilities can be quickly ruled off the list. It’s not human, so Spike couldn’t have been a pickled punk. It also had to be relatively cheap, as Eraserhead had a paltry $10,000 budget. Thus, it can be assumed that Spike was not acquired as a high-end custom prop, although it could certainly be a pre-built or second-hand piece.', 'Truly, the only widespread consensus is that Spike is some sort of fetus. And that’s about where all agreements end. Some assert that Lynch used a cow fetus, while others claim Spike was the leftover remnants of a skinned rabbit.', 'A sinister — albeit debunked — theory points to a “Marvin Greenwood, M.D.” mentioned in the film’s credits. Some viewers suggested that Mr. Greenwood helped Lynch “find” the baby. After all, doctors can acquire research specimens, and it’s not too far-fetched to think a kind doc might lend his pal some macabre anatomical pieces for a film. However, the truth is surprisingly boring: Greenwood examined and diagnosed Nance with liver damage during Eraserhead’s extended production.', ""Though not appreciated upon release by critics and audiences, Lost Highway is David Lynch's true cult classic horror."", 'Another theory suggests that Lynch used an actual animal, a fetus. In some ways, the idea makes sense. Local farmers may have had some unfortunate stillbirths and given them to the director. After some cleaning, the prop would still maintain a slimy sheen. However, this idea has a few snags. An all-natural prop would likely pose some health concerns, and it would have required constant maintenance. Even a preserved animal fetus is unfit for constant handling, and it would’ve required extensive work to convert into the puppeteered prop seen in the film.', 'Thus, that leaves one final possibility. The most likely explanation for Spike is that the abnormal infant was a fancy puppet. Puppets have been used in films since the medium’s inception, and they’ve only grown more complex with time. A healthy coating of jelly would give the prop its disgusting sheen, too. This explanation also explains some of the strange framing choices when showcasing the prop; the crew had to work around the puppeteer.', 'Yet this still leaves some unanswered questions. Practical effects puppets aren’t exactly cheap, and many struggle to reconcile Spike’s realism and the film’s meager financial resources. The multiple articulating parts would only add to the prop’s cost. So, where did Lynch find Spike? Assuming the infant is a puppet, there are only two possibilities.', 'The first is that Lynch purchased the model from a prop maker or artist. This would’ve taken a massive chunk of out the film’s already limited budget, but it’s easy to argue the baby’s narrative importance is worth the associated costs. Lynch may have also found someone who — for some unknown reason — had a rubber or latex puppet of an animal fetus lying around.', 'The second possibility is that Lynch made Spike himself. He was, after all, a multimedia artist. Creating a puppet like Spike may have been difficult and time-consuming, but it wouldn’t have been entirely impossible. Alternatively, Lynch may have found a rubber model and hollowed it out to add the puppet’s interior rigging.', 'Either way, there’s no way to learn the truth. Lynch has taken Eraserhead’s greatest mystery with him, leaving audiences with a fittingly frustrating mystery. The film’s enduring enigma is the perfect way to summarize Lynch’s prolific career. It’s an embodiment of his commitment to artistic freedom and narrative ambiguity. Spike’s origins may never be revealed, but the speculation surrounding it is another brilliant part of Lynch’s enduring legacy.', '', '', 'We want to hear from you!

8 Artists to Follow If You Like David Lynch,https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-8-artists-follow-david-lynch,"['David Lynch, still from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, 1992. © New Line Cinema. Courtesy of New Line Cinema/Photofest.', 'Since the death of David Lynch on January 15th, the internet has been flooded with an outpouring of remembrances for the artist and filmmaker. These confirmed what fans already knew: Lynch was an American original whose quirky characters, distinct visual style, and strong sense of place led viewers to see their own worlds anew. He took on the most conventional of storylines—the police procedural (Twin Peaks), the actress trying to make it in Hollywood (Mulholland Drive), lovers on the run (Wild at Heart)—and made them strange and novel once again. Altogether, his works form a world of their own, full of themes, faces, visual motifs that cycle from one project to the next.', 'Lynch began his career as a painter and continued to paint and sculpt throughout his life. This body of work, too, was full of darkness, humor, and stories that never quite resolved. In 2022, the artist mounted his final exhibitions at Sperone Westwater (watercolors with a refined palette of blacks, grays, and reds) and Pace Gallery (mixed-media paintings and lamps).', 'It’s an enormous loss to know that we’ll never get a new Lynch project again. But his legacy will live on in the myriad artists he’s influenced. Below are a few who cultivate their own sense of Lynchian weirdness across various media.', '', 'Alexandre Singh and Natalie Musteata, still from Deux personnes échangeant de la salive, 2024. Courtesy of the artists.', 'Narrative is at the heart of Alexandre Singh’s multidisciplinary practice. The artist’s output has ranged from a play featuring the sculptor Charles Ray as an Apollonian ideal to an installation of various household objects that “talk” to each other from atop plinths. Singh generates dramas between humans, gods, and things, imbuing his presentations with an air of the carnivalesque.', 'In 2019, the artist mounted his solo exhibition “A Gothic Tale” at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. The installation featured a black-and-white checkered floor and draping red curtains—evocative of the “Red Room” in Twin Peaks, a highly stylized limbo in which the living and dead can meet. Singh’s work can suggest relics of the future. Like Lynch, the artist considers where humanity might be headed.', 'In a newer film, Deux personnes échangeant de la salive (Two People Exchanging Saliva) (2024), Singh and his partner Natalie Musteata created a black-and-white world in which kissing is banned. The film takes inspiration from the aesthetics of film noir, which also influenced Lynch. The genre allows for simultaneous darkness and deadpan humor: a winning combination for anyone interested in exploring contemporary life.', '', 'Tony Oursler’s fantastical films and installations straddle psychedelia and camp. The artist gained renown for his video dolls: sculptures with projections showing the visages of actors and musicians who blink, emote, and perform. Oursler’s interests range from psychology to myth, and his work is both otherworldly and deeply grounded in contemporary thought and dysfunction. Surveillance, mermaids, and multiple personality disorder are all of concern to the artist.', 'Lynch became associated with a group of actors he worked with again and again, including Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, and Jack Nance; Oursler, similarly, is linked with a close creative network. His collaborators have included visual artists Tony Conrad and Dan Graham as well as musicians Kim Gordon and David Bowie (also a Lynch collaborator), for whom he designed video sets. Oursler has explicitly cited Lynch’s 1977 film Eraserhead as an influence, and both use deformed figures and an aesthetic that evokes the distortions and emotionality of German Expressionism. The two artists’ spiritual link is evident in their work across video and sculpture and shared ability to transcend the boundaries of their media.', '', 'Mary Reid Kelley and Patrick Kelley, still from You Make Me Iliad, 2010. Courtesy of the artists and Pilar Corrias, London.', 'Mary Reid Kelley’s videos are defined by their erudite dialogue and a distinct visual style: Performers wear bulging eyes, and their bodies are painted in thick black outlines that make them look like animations or cartoons. Often working with her partner, Patrick Kelley, the artist films in black and white, alluding to the past and paring down her time-based medium as though attempting to reduce its dimensionality.', 'Kelley’s films include You Make Me Iliad (2010), The Syphilis of Sisyphus (2011), and Blood Moon (2021). Women’s roles are a frequent theme, though the artist’s sources range from Greek mythology and French philosophy to histories of World War I and John Steinbeck’s 1937 novel Of Mice and Men. Kelley also makes prints and watercolors that riff on her films’ characters and ideas.', 'Like Lynch’s work, Kelley’s films embrace a kind of dream logic. Their characters use off-kilter, antiquated language, often speaking in verse and rhyme. These speech patterns suggest an otherworldliness, though the sentiments expressed remain very much of our world.', '', 'Twins appear across Nicola Tyson’s newest body of paintings, echoing the uncanny doubling that recurs in Lynch’s filmography. Currently on view at Petzel Gallery in New York, Tyson’s acrylic compositions feature bodies that merge or are mirrored by another form—a tree, for example, or a teapot. Figures’ hollowed eyes and a saturated palette further lend the works a sense of unreality, while the artist’s dry brush technique amplifies their flatness. Apertures abound in Tyson’s paintings, where assholes and eyes look more or less the same. All these entry points into the figures suggest a liberated attitude towards sexuality.', 'Tyson has worked in film, photography, and performance, as well as writing. In 1978, she documented London’s underground club scene in a series of photos of the “Bowie Nights” at Billy’s Club in Soho. If David Bowie didn’t himself appear, he was the patron saint of these events: an emblem of creative freedom and unfettered approaches to gender and sexuality. Tyson (and Lynch, and Oursler) have all infused that spirit into their own work.', '', 'Kaari Upson, installation view of “Kaari Upson: Good Thing You Are Not Alone” at the New Museum, New York, 2017. Photo by Maris Hutchinson / EPW Studio. Courtesy of the New Museum.', 'Kaari Upson’s sculptures, videos, and installations conjure the mundane and macabre elements of American domestic life. The artist cast household furniture and accoutrements, like sofas and paper towel rolls, placing them around her exhibitions like actors in a play. The sculptures’ surfaces are often dingy, their worn appearances suggesting economic constraint and overuse. For her 2017 retrospective at the New Museum, the artist installed giant shelves filled with the distinctive orange books from the “Idiot’s Guide” series and dozens of life-sized dolls made to look like her mother. The arrangement resembled a very unusual big-box store, simultaneously dehumanizing and focused on self-improvement.', 'Two empty homes inspired much of Upson’s work: an abandoned house in her childhood neighborhood in San Bernardino, and a tract house in Las Vegas. The former inspired a large body of work in which Upson invented—in drawings, paintings, and performances—the life of Larry, the house’s former inhabitant. The latter was the source of the furniture which Upson cast.', 'Like Lynch, Upson had plenty to say about the particular strangeness of California and the weird goings-on inside its homes. Upson herself passed away in 2021, from metastatic breast cancer. Her sweeping aesthetic vision is very missed.', '', 'At the center of Shana Moulton’s video and performance art is her alter ego Cynthia, who navigates a world more bizarre than ours, yet wracked with the same anxieties. Cynthia wears dresses embedded with medical devices, seeks solace in a mobile sauna, and performs wellness rituals from exercise to bathing. Through this character, Moulton pokes fun at self-care practices, consumer culture, and her own association with both.', 'Lo-fi beats, fantastical film sequences, and digital animations further the surreality and New Age sensibility of Moulton’s films. In the artist’s 10-part series “Whispering Pines” (2002–present)—which she has said takes inspiration from Twin Peaks—Cynthia is often caught in dreams or reverie. The moon rises behind her, or she appears in the middle of a forest with a floating head. In this work, Moulton articulates an uneasy relationship between the body and the natural world.', '', 'Dim, eerie interiors and structures fill the canvases of Argentine artist Guillermo Kuitca. Throughout his paintings and sculptures, maps and floor plans overlay abstract expanses, suggesting larger networks. In smaller-scale works on paper, iconic landmarks such as the Hollywood Bowl, Covent Garden, and the Metropolitan Opera House are fractured and abstracted. Like Lynch, Kuitca appears to be searching for the underlying patterns that govern our world.', 'In 2015, the artist presented a solo exhibition,“Les Habitants,” at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, which paid homage to Lynch’s 2007 show at the same venue, titled“The Air is on Fire.” Kuitca designed a blood-red interior with walls featuring his signature Cubist patterning. Lynch’s paintings were displayed, along with video documentation of a 2011 concert performance by Lynch and Patti Smith. Kuitca, deploying a Lynchian sensibility, considers the relationship between dreaming and logic. At the Fondation Cartier, he created a pseudo-domestic space where his works and Lynch’s could engage in surreal dialogue.', '', 'Jeremy Olson conjures a new universe in creature-like lamps and paintings of science-fictional interiors populated by invented species. The artist’s futuristic scenes can evoke the sets of Lynch’s Dune, with its gargantuan spaceships and beings that are humanoid yet alien. The artist’s newer resin sculptures resemble claws adorned with miniature theme park rides or playground structures. Across multiple dimensions, Olson considers the unique textures and lives of his organisms.', 'As Olson hops from one medium to the next, he invents a cohesive, surrealistic world without being bound by a single, linear narrative. It’s up to the viewers to create their own stories, informed by their unique ideas about what novelties the next centuries or millennia may hold.']"

We love to inhabit it, to return to it, to test it time and time again. And it is no coincidence that the sudden news of the American filmmaker’s death elicited one of the most sincere and unanimous waves of affection we can remember for an artist: evidently that pleasure in the face of his distorted and brilliant tales was always dictated by artistic integrity and creative transparency. Lynch, in practice, always told us the truth, confessed himself with unique candor, stripped himself of his visions and shared them unfiltered, like the most generous man he was and stubbornly devoted to his cinema and his images.

So, without further ado, here are some of the finest films you will ever have the honor and privilege of viewing.', '“Dune” (1984)', 'Lynch’s cult classic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic science fiction novel of the same name is undeniably ambitious but ultimately a bloated, often incoherent mess. Plagued by a slew of issues behind the scenes and later disowned by Lynch himself, the best thing to come from the disastrous production was the long-time creative partnership between Lynch and leading man Kyle MacLachlan.', '“Eraserhead”', 'Often cited as one of the greatest directorial debuts in all of cinema, Lynch’s surrealist horror film is far from the most viewer friendly option in his prolific filmography but is essential viewing nonetheless. Gorgeous cinematography and a haunting soundscape that is sure to live on in your restless dreams.', '“Lost Highway”', 'From the now iconic opening shot accompanied by David Bowie’s haunting song, “I’m Deranged,” you know you’re in for a real treat. The nightmarish, hellish atmosphere Lynch is able to conjure is unmatched and even if you don’t fall head over heels in love with the deranged odyssey, you’re bound to find some newfound appreciation for industrial metal.', '“The Elephant Man”', 'The less said about “The Elephant Man,” the better. Easily one of the most gut-wrenching, harrowing final scenes in any motion picture.', '“Inland Empire”', 'A three–hour experimental mind-wreck featuring an incredibly complex, multi-layered performance from the one and only Laura Dern. A hard one to recommend, but if you enjoy the surrealist aspects of Lynch, I’d give this one a shot. It also features one of my favorite end-credits sequences. ', '“Wild at Heart”', 'Nicolas Cage. Laura Dern. Willem Dafoe. Murder, mayhem and “The Wizard of Oz.” Will I elaborate? No. ', '“The Straight Story”', 'Believe it or not, Lynch made a Disney film. While far from the norm, Lynch’s directorial flourishes still shine in this beautiful character piece that features a career-best performance from Richard Farnsworth and one of the finest one-scene performances from the late great Harry Dean Stanton.', '“Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me”', 'The complete antithesis to the first two seasons of “Twin Peaks;” chock-full of prostitution, cocaine, incest and Bowie. It’s brimming in unrelenting wretchedness and evil. I love it.', '“Blue Velvet”', 'The film that made Lynch a household name, a mesmerizing noir thriller that explores the underlying evil beneath everyday Americana. Just remember kids: Always drink Pabst Blue Ribbon, never Heineken.', '“Mulholland Drive”', 'Lynch at arguably his most provocative, dreamlike wonder. There’s a reason many consider this to be his masterpiece and why it has withstood the test of time.', '“Twin Peaks: The Return”', 'The single greatest cinematic achievement of the 21st Century. ', 'And that’s that, my dear readers. Please pay your respects to Lynch and view some of—if not all—he had to offer. If you’re going in for the first time, I envy you. There’s nothing quite like the transformative experience of being whisked away into one of his fantastical worlds for the first time. Rest in peace, David Lynch.', 'The views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of The Torch.', 'Log In', '', '']"

It's also the only film on the list with a family-friendly 'G' rating certificate."", 'Meanwhile Lost Highway (1997), with its confusing narrative structure and unexplained mysteries, was described by Lynch as a ""psychogenic fugue"" of a story - which is about as much as he would say on the matter.', ""Some of Lost Highway was filmed at Lynch's own home in the Hollywood Hills - from which he was forced to evacuate as a result of the LA fires in January.
