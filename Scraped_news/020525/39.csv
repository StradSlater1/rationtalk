The Naked Truth About Bianca Censori’s Grammys Look,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-naked-truth-about-bianca-censoris-grammys-look-2025,"['Where do we start with Bianca Censori, the Australian model, “head of architecture” at Yeezy, wife of Kanye West, and near-naked woman on the Grammys red carpet? On Sunday, Bianca stepped out in a black fur coat—so far, so fashion—which she soon dropped to reveal a slip so sheer, so without undergarments, that it exposed her uncensored nudity beneath. Kanye, on the other hand, wore a black T-shirt and trousers.', 'Days later, the questions we’re all asking in the wake of the look circle around Bianca’s sense of autonomy, her sense of liberation, her feminism, our feminism, and her level of complicity in the way she’s showing up on the world stage.', 'Though she’s apparently brimming with body confidence—see Bianca in a nude bodysuit, clutching a hotel pillow over her chest in Florence; see Bianca wearing a transparent Blade Runner-ish raincoat with nothing underneath—her relationship with Ye, both romantic and image-architectural, has been criticized online as perhaps overly-influential, potentially verging on controlling. There are concerns about this particular woman’s silence: We’ve heard very little from Bianca during her Kanye tenure, a remarkably different situation from his relationships with the endlessly quotable uncut gem Julia Fox and his reality powerhouse ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.', 'Most of the women at the Grammys—in a year that felt overwhelmingly celebratory of female excellence—were there for their talent, for their loud-and-clear achievements over the past year. That said, the entire red-carpet mechanism sits on the surface level: We observe the looks—a carousel of perfect snapshots—and make our assessment about whether the dresses work. (Differences of opinion are part of the fun.) Deep-rooted, deeply old-fashioned standards for how women should act in order to appear “decent,” and in turn desirable (to men, to other women), have cast a long shadow on this practice. We’re all drawing our own lines in the sand as to what constitutes too much for a woman to show: what’s cheap, what’s tarty, what’s slutty.', 'At its best, fashion, for me, has always celebrated a body’s sensuality rather than the unimaginative, base-level provocation of a woman’s nakedness. But I have this sinking feeling that Bianca’s dress wasn’t meant to continue a fashion dialogue with other women—that it was purely meant to provoke.', 'Though I’m not convinced our judgements on the opaquer, less-naked dresses on red carpets reflect our best selves, they do consider our understanding of the woman in the dress, or at least her media image. It just feels icky to know so little about Bianca. While she appears to have a sense of humour (I found the hotel pillows quite funny), all I really know about her is that she has a penchant for revealing garments.', 'While I’m not necessarily advocating for snatch on the red carpet, it could also be argued that it’s Bianca’s body, and therefore Bianca’s choice. I hate to state the obvious, but a woman can wear whatever she wants. A woman can wear as many sheer bodysuits and thongs as she likes. A woman can court the male gaze. A woman can make a zillion choices we wouldn’t personally make ourselves and still not have that mean she’s being coerced, that she’s a victim of an overbearing force, that something predatory has happened. I don’t think we should assume that because Bianca’s pretty much naked, she’s not fully in control of herself, or that she’s not thoroughly enjoying her exhibitionism. We can’t jump to a conclusion just because seeing her virtually in the nude doesn’t feel good. Because Bianca isn’t speaking up, because we’re bereft of any deeper motivations (or personality), the silence has us scrabbling for answers of our own. But maybe that’s exactly what Bianca wanted.', 'See Every Look from the 2025 Grammys Red Carpet', 'See the Full List of 2025 Grammy Award Winners', 'The Best Dressed Stars at the 2025 Grammys', 'Taylor!

The artist, who now goes by Ye, walked the carpet with his wife, Bianca Censori, who wore a revealing stocking dress. Rumors have swirled since the carpet closed that West and Censori were escorted off the premises, having not been invited to the telecast. Speaking to a source close to the Grammys, Variety has refuted those claims. Instead, they write, West “walked the carpet, got in his car and left.”', 'His attendance at the ceremony followed two days of feverish activity on social media. It included a now-deleted X post sexualizing former vice president Kamala Harris and a post of his private texts with Elon Musk. Prior to the event, he also unfollowed everyone on Instagram, with the exception of Taylor Swift. He has years of issues with Swift, dating all the way back to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.', 'The appearance was brief. West and Censori left the red carpet after displaying her dress, which was reportedly the rapper’s plan from the beginning. An inside source told The Sun that “Ye always planned to do the red carpet and leave—he’d never sit through the Grammys because it’s so dull and boring.” The source also claimed, “People have called this a stunt, but to Ye this is his art.”', 'After the show, West launched a new clothing line on his Yeezy Supply website. Among the collection is a see-through leotard, which West called his “first women’s piece.” He also posted several behind-the-scenes photos of Censori in her red-carpet look to his Twitter. “For clarity, my wife is the most Googled person on the planet called Earth,” he wrote on Instagram. “WE BEAT THE GRAMMIES.”', 'West was nominated by the Recording Academy for Best Rap Song for “Carnival” alongside Ty Dolla $ign, Rick the Kid, and Playboi Carti. The track, which released via his latest album, Vultures 2, lost to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” during the preshow awards presentation.', 'West mentioned Swift’s name recently on another song from Vultures 2, titled “Lifestyle (Demo).” He rapped, “I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce.” Neither Swift nor her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, has responded publicly to the line. The singer was nominated for six Grammy Awards including Album of the Year and Song of the Year, but she went home unconventionally empty-handed.', 'West famously interrupted Swift during her victory speech for Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. That night, Swift’s “You Belong with Me” won the trophy over Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.” West didn’t agree with the choice. He marched onto the stage at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and snatched the microphone out of Swift’s hands. “Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’mma let you finish,” he said, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”', 'The feud between the two artists resurfaced again on West’s “Famous” in 2016. The rapper spoke about Swift on the track, stating that he “made that b***h famous.” He later claimed that Swift gave him permission to say the line, which the pop singer vehemently denied.', 'Since then, West has come under fire time and time again for controversial statements evoking anti-Semitism, sexism, and other hateful remarks.

"In a world of naked dresses, did one take it too far?",https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/style/bianca-censori-nude-dress-grammys-hnk-intl/index.html,"['It was arguably the biggest red carpet trend of 2024, dominating the Academy Awards, the Met Gala and everything else in between. The naked dress — embraced by celebrities ranging from Elle Fanning to Kim Kardashian, Doja Cat to Charlize Theron — has become an eyebrow-raising red carpet fixture. At last year’s Vanity Fair Oscars after party, we saw how nudity could be both angelic (as demonstrated by Jennifer Lawerence’s sheer, Fall-Winter 1996 Givenchy empire-waist dress hand-embroidered with clovers) and risqué (such as Charli XCX’s gauzy yellow nipple-baring gown, also made by Givenchy.)', 'But at Sunday’s Grammys, only one naked dress was turning heads. While most guests opted for muted palettes and pared-back styling amid tributes to victims of Los Angeles’ devastating wildfires, Bianca Censori took a different approach.', 'Censori arrived at the event alongside husband Kanye West — who now goes by Ye. If the Australian model’s long feather coat seemed uncharacteristically demure, given her risqué approach to dressing in public, it was because she didn’t plan on wearing it for long.', 'Within seconds of stopping for photos, the 30-year-old turned her back to the cameras and dropped her coat to reveal a barely-there sleeveless mini-dress made of transparent mesh that left nothing to the imagination.', 'Naked dresses come in all shapes, sizes and varying levels of exposure. This genre of frock centers about the power of suggestion — sometimes, the wearer is not revealing anything at all. In the late 1990s, Jean-Paul Gaultier made waves with his trompe-l’oeil patterns, images of the bare human form, which he printed onto blazers and dresses. It’s a print that has since been revived by designers such as Glenn Martens, whose acid-colored, heatmap-style pieces have been worn by Bella Hadid and A$AP Rocky.', 'Even some of the earliest examples of naked frocks — Mae West in the 1936 film “Go West, Young Man” or Carroll Baker’s Balmain dress worn while promoting “The Carpetbaggers” in 1964 — relied on expertly placed embroidery to give the impression of bare skin while avoiding any actual displays of nudity. Naked dresses, for all the fervent discussion, can be surprisingly modest.', 'But what is the logical conclusion of a culture that revels in the suggestion of disrobing? To some — particularly those like Censori, who has frequently appeared in public in revealing outfits, whether heading into a music studio almost naked beneath a see-through rain jacket or going to dinner in LA wearing little more than a bra and a pair of sheer tights — the leap from naked dress to plain naked might feel small.', 'On the Grammys red carpet, West, meanwhile, stood beside Censori in a black T-shirt and pants, expressionless behind a pair of sunglasses. Reports soon swirled that the couple were escorted out of the awards show. However, a source familiar with the sequence of events told CNN that was untrue. “He was not escorted out,” they said. “He’s a nominee. He walked the carpet and got in his car and left.” CNN has reached out to a representative for West for comment.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nElle Fanning’s naked dress has a long history', 'Soon after the appearance, the couple shared Polaroid photos of Censori modeling the look in posts on their respective social media accounts. In a since-deleted Instagram post, West described his wife’s outfit as “custom couture,” yet there was no artistry or clever draping to be admired, no titillating embroidery techniques like those worn by West and Baker. The blankness of Censori’s nudity begs the question: is it fashion, or just a body?', 'West has not confirmed whether he personally designed — or was involved in designing — Censori’s outfit, though social media users questioned the rapper’s role in his wife’s wardrobe choices. Others speculated that the model may have fallen afoul of California’s indecent exposure laws, which prohibit people from exposing their “naked body or genitals in front of anyone who could be annoyed or offended by it.”', 'When asked if Censori had breached California’s indecent exposure laws, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department told CNN via email that it had “not been made aware of any incident at the Grammys.” The Recording Academy and CBS did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.', 'While Censori has certainly contributed a notable moment in the history of the naked dress trend, she has transformed what is typically a suggestive whisper into a deafening shout.', 'CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Grammys executive producer Raj Kapoor told People that the guests who are invited to the show must adhere to an “artistic black-tie” dress code, also adding, ""but in the music industry, I guess that’s up for interpretation.”', '“Obviously there is a dress code for anybody actually performing on the show that we have to adhere to standards and practices. But as far as people attending and nominees attending, that would be something the [Recording] Academy [presents the Grammys] would have to answer,” he was quoted by the site.', ""Kanye went on to defend Bianca's nude outfit and said in a since-deleted Instagram post, “FOR CLARITY. MY WIFE IS THE MOST GOOGLED PERSON ON THE PLANET CALLED EARTH.” He also shared Google analytics screenshots showing how the interest grew on Bianca grew after the appearance. Since then, Kanye has deleted all his Instagram posts except one from a year ago."", 'There were also reports that added how both Kanye and Bianca were escorted out of the ceremony shortly after the red carpet appearance. E! News stated that the duo opted to get in their car and skip the ceremony right after their red carpet stunt. Kanye was nominated in the Best Rap Song category for Carnival.

Here’s how it works.', 'Bianca Censori went completely nude on the red carpet at last night’s Grammys. There’s been a quiet chorus of concern for Censori for a while now, but it’s about to reach a fever pitch.', 'Red-carpet naked dressing is hardly a new phenomenon. Rose McGowan dared to bare back in 1998 and Cher had been doing it long before that. Rose later described her VMAs’ look as “A silent protest”—it was her first public outing since being sexually assaulted—and while fashion doesn’t always telegraph a social statement when someone turns up completely naked, save for a mesh slip, a message will be sent whether the wearer intends to or not.', 'The message Censori signalled was unease. It’s a feeling shared by onlookers, too.', 'Bianca Censori wasn’t the only attendee at last night’s Grammys to don a see-through body stocking—Julia Fox wore one over a thong and a tiny bandeau (with a pair of marigolds, naturally). And while Censori’s outfit was the most controversial, I don’t think it was a lack of rubber gloves that made the whole thing so uncomfortable and grotesquely sexual.', 'Perhaps it was because Censori seemed so reluctant to shed her oversized fur coat that made the whole thing so uneasy. Maybe it was the fact she appeared to undress at the prompting of her husband Kanye ‘Ye’ West (the internet is abuzz with calls for a lip reader to decipher the pair’s seemingly tense exchange), or the fact that she kept tugging at the flimsy mesh hemline, an act so redundant it was painful to watch. I suspect my discomfort—and the collective unease of the internet at large—was an amalgam of all these things.', '', 'Bianca Censori and Kanye ‘Ye’ West on the red carpet at the 2025 Grammys', 'Censori might very well be a willing and enthusiastic participant in these naked stunts—if you Google her name, ‘outfits’ and ‘before Kanye’ are among the top searches—but we’ll likely never know given her bid of silence. What we do know is that Ye is a provocateur and a man who seems to get off on degrading women.', ""Long before deep-faking had become part of the public lexicon, West’s 2016 ‘Famous’ video featured a naked Taylor Swift waxwork in bed with him and then-wife Kim Kardashian, and, admittedly a nude lifelike George Bush, amongst others. A legal battle over the song's lyrics—“I made that bitch famous”, in reference to Swift—ensued."", 'Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox!', 'More recently, while Pamela Anderson is being lauded for her role in Gia Coppola’s The Last Showgirl, West posted a now-deleted video of a naked Anderson circa 2008 to ‘tease’ his new album “Bully”. The naked video was overlaid with West rapping the lyric “Hide yo bitch” over and over. These are just two examples in a long list of public controversies.', 'West also makes a habit of parading around his paramours and taking full creative control over their wardrobes, something campaigners have called out as a sign of coercive control. Both Kim Kardashian and Julia Fox have claimed that West instructed them on what to wear and how to act while wearing it. In an episode of The Kardashians, Kourtney remembers West saying her career was over and likening her to Marge Simpson because he disagreed with her outfit choice at the Wall Street Journal Magazine’s Innovator Awards. In the same episode, Kim spoke of being “so nervous” about wearing an outfit that wasn’t “pre-vetted first”.', 'West’s sartorial contributions to Censori have mainly involved her going out wearing very little and facing potential jail time because of it. She could also face legal repercussions for last night’s indecent exposure under the California Penal Code 314(1) and the pair was rumoured to have been escorted out. Perhaps this is the pair’s kink, but the visual juxtaposition of a fully dressed West and an exposed Censori is too stark to ignore. What began as quiet concern is reaching a crescendo.', '', 'Bianca Censori and Kanye ‘Ye’ West attend the 2025 Grammys', 'West, for his part, has defended posting his wife in various states of undress on social media. To ‘celebrate’ Censori’s 30th birthday last month, he shared a naked video of her in the bath with the caption “Happy birthday to the most beautiful super bad iconic muse inspirational talented artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ loving by my side everyday [sic] when half the world turned their backs on me…”', 'It would be easy to chalk this all down to artist-muse syndrome, as many have. The relationship between artist and inspiration has long been a complicated subject. And perhaps, Censori is one half of a performance duo; a twisted Gilbert and George if you will. She’d join a long line of female artists using their bodies as a medium. Marina Abramović, who West has compared himself to and collaborated with, has long used herself in performance pieces, notably 1974’s Rhythm 0 performance, in which she invited the public to use 69 objects, including chains, a hairbrush and knives, on her body. And yet, even if this theory—which ardent West fans swear by—is true, what exactly is the pair trying to say? And why is Ye the only one doing the talking while his muse stays mute?', '', 'Bianca Censori wearing a naked mesh body stocking at the 2025 Grammys', 'At the Grammys, every crevice of Censori was on display, even her sandals were crafted from Perspex with see-through thonged straps. If this is a means of personal expression or an attempt to challenge societal norms around modesty, sexuality, or public boundaries, the message is being lost in the medium.', 'Sure, it’s statement-making and it’ll spark plenty of online chatter but without a clear artistic or social purpose, it’s little more than that and it diminishes the seriousness of the conversation around body autonomy.', 'The line between meaningful expression and exploiting shock value for fame has always been thin with West. Now that there’s nothing left of Censori to show, perhaps it’s time they speak up. The fact that everyone else is speaking for them does little to convince concerned parties that we shouldn’t be worried about a young woman who is increasingly known only in relation to her nude body and relationship with an older, famous man.', 'Questioning the motives of a woman’s fashion choices feels contradictory in a post-feminism era but until Censori says otherwise, all we can go on is what the pair show us—Censori is all we see, yet Ye is all we can hear.', 'Mischa Anouk Smith is the News and Features Editor of Marie Claire UK.', 'From personal essays to purpose-driven stories, reported studies, and interviews with celebrities like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and designers including Dries Van Noten, Mischa has been featured in publications such as Refinery29, Stylist and Dazed.

It’s Emperor Kanye and his ‘chief architect’ – guess which one wasn’t wearing any clothes?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/04/kanye-west-bianca-censori-grammys-clothes,"['Outside the Grammys, Bianca Censori dropped her coat to reveal a barely-there dress to the waiting cameras. Was it art? Was it fashion? Were they even invited?', 'W\nhat precisely is the deal with Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori, whose latest very surprising red-carpet outing very unsurprisingly featured her being next-to-naked? Bianca’s husband, who dresses like a Minecraft security guard, seemed to be giving her the signal to shed her fur coat and reveal herself outside Sunday night’s Grammys, to which they don’t appear to have been invited. Certainly a hot new twist on the old 13th fairy act.', 'Given that Bianca is rarely photographed in anything heavier than a 5-denier sex poncho, half the internet seems to have settled definitively on the conviction that she is being coercively controlled. The other half has decided the pair enjoy the attention their “art project” is receiving. I’m not sure it’s entirely clear which is the case, or indeed whether it’s a bit of both for now, and in any case she may reevaluate her opinions about the situation in retrospect as time goes by.', 'By way of a recap for Guardian readers not obsessed with the byzantine court politics of Yeezy (guys, please: this stuff is important): Kanye and Bianca married in 2023, following the sundering of his union with reality-industrial-complex mogul Kim Kardashian. Bianca and Kanye seem to have met via the latter’s previously mentioned fashion brand, where she was hired as the chief architect. Stay with this, because the sneakers Kanye produces are so hideously absurd that they may well have featured mock-Tudor heel gables and Juliet balconies. Even so, being the chief architect of a fashion company does feel a little like being the chief veterinary officer of a teapot factory.', 'Then again maybe all virulent antisemites need a chief architect. I’m not saying Bianca was the Albert Speer of Yeezy, planning ever more triumphalist colonnaded sneakers, only for these dreams to end in rubble when the boss overreached himself. But the fact remained that Kanye’s collaboration with Adidas did end up imploding, shortly after he fired out a barrage of Jew-hate across pretty much every possible platform, appended by the explainer: “I can literally say antisemitic shit, and they can’t drop me.” Not so, as it turned out. (Maybe he read some second world war history books and wrongly assumed the old rules of the firm still applied.)', 'These days, the Wests stage regular silent happenings for the paparazzi, which are parsed by everyone from lip-readers to armchair hostage video experts to determine if Bianca is having fun or not. She certainly seemed to be, in an enthusiastic karaoke performance at a Grammys afterparty – but appearances can be deceptive. There’s rather more to run on this one before the world can know for sure.', 'For now, perhaps we have to take the word of Bianca’s tirelessly curated personal website, which is a strong pusher of the notion that she and Kanye are a mutually supportive pair of performance artists. “While many were initially fascinated by her private life,” it acknowledges of her rise to fame, “her role at Yeezy – West’s fashion brand – quickly became the focus.” Did it though?', 'Perhaps more luck will be had on that front now, thanks to Bianca’s announcement that she is releasing a documentary about herself this year. “The documentary will also highlight her collaborative relationship with Kanye West, focusing on how their creative partnership drives innovation across various fields. While both have kept much of their work under wraps,” it goes on, suggesting a metaphorical fur coat is about to be dropped by both Wests, “this series will offer unprecedented access to their joint creative processes, revealing how Bianca’s architectural sensibility influences Kanye’s futuristic fashion designs.” Righto. The network/streamer on which you’ll be able to view this remains tantalisingly unconfirmed. But I think I’d be more interested in it than Meghan’s upcoming tablescaping debut on Netflix, if that means anything.', 'In the end, though, the Kanye and Bianca show seems not a lot more than a bi-weekly occasion for drawing attention to staggering creative decline. For someone whose music was once layered and groundbreaking – and look, for someone whose architecture might well have also been layered and groundbreaking – the message of this now fairly long-running exercise in minimal dressing seems embarrassingly pedestrian, based on a somewhat teenage belief that sex is oo-er-rude and transgressive. As an art project, what is its point supposed to be? No offence, but it has about as much depth and nuance as a Banksy or late-stage Damien Hirst – in fact, it makes the actor Sydney Sweeney’s funny snap of herself in a grey sweatshirt reading “Sorry for having great tits and correct opinions” look like a Renoir.', 'As for where the show goes next, I have suspected for a while now that one future staging post on this provocative artistic journey will be for Bianca to appear on some red carpet or other wearing a full-body veil, while Kanye remains nice and comfy in his customary T-shirt and trousers. Should this development be realised, it’s hard to know whether people will find it offensively shocking, finally sufficiently modest, or coercive in a different manner. It’ll definitely be a lot harder for them to talk about in the “right” way than nudity is, though. In fact, judging by the full chatterati meltdown over Bianca and Kanye’s Grammys outing, the choice or otherwise of nudity remains much more acceptable to discuss than the choice or otherwise of being fully covered. Perhaps Mr and Mrs West have accidentally made an interesting point after all.', 'Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When she turned to face the photographers, she was wearing a fully transparent mini dress, and no underwear. The effect was that she appeared completely nude. According to Page Six, the pair were “escorted out” following the incident, though others claim that the couple left of their own accord. West, after all, was only nominally a contender for a Grammy this year: he was nominated in just one category, best rap song, for Carnival, his collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign. He ultimately lost, but he didn’t come to the Grammy awards expecting to win. What he wanted out of his attendance was what he got when Censori dropped her coat.', 'The clothing, or rather lack thereof, is typical of Censori in her appearances with West. Since the pair married in early 2023 – shortly after West finalized his divorce from reality star Kim Kardashian – Censori has rarely been seen without West, and rarely wearing clothes. On a 2024 trip to a restaurant in Los Angeles, she wore a sheer flesh-colored bodysuit with long sleeves but no coverage over her breasts; that same summer, at the Chateau Marmont, she wore thong underwear without any pants; on a trip to the movies, she wore a sheer crop top with no bra, and a pair of shorts so short, they tipped into the genre of briefs. The effect of her nudity and near-nudity is heightened by the proximity of Kanye West, her husband, who is usually wearing too much clothing beside Censori’s too little: long pants, long sleeves, high necks, and layers of jackers, sweatshirts, and ponchos, often combined with a beard and dark sunglasses that conceal his face.', 'Risque fashion is a tradition of its own, and the bodies of celebrity women are offered up for exposure and visual consumption in a kind of conventional ritual that often carried its own critique. In terms of sheer exposure, Censori’s “outfit”, as it were, at the 2025 Grammys is not so different from Rihanna’s famous sparkly-sheer flapper-inspired number from the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America awards. And yet Censori’s habit of nudity is darker, less playful, and not just because it declines to partake of the coquettish ritual of faux-concealment that is typical of so much other revealing fashion – and, indeed, of celebrity itself.', 'There is a clear desire to shock in her appearances with West, but there is no playfulness. In vain one scans the photos of Censori in search of a smile, a twinkle in her eye, a sign of conspiratorial pleasure, or of being in on the joke, or even of mere willingness. One sees only the blankness of her expression, vacant and somewhat sad. Writing in the New Yorker, Naomi Fry called her a “pure, mute spectacle of flesh”.', 'The exposure of Censori’s body is contrasted with the enigma of her mind. Officially speaking, no one knows what she thinks of her own public nudity, or of her relationship with West – or of anything at all, for that matter, since she never talks. West, however, is somewhat less of a mystery. Around the time of his messy divorce from Kardashian, with whom he shares four children, West’s behavior became erratic. He launched a half-hearted run for president before endorsing Donald Trump; he praised Hitler and tweeted that he would “go death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE”.', 'This public behavior was allegedly paired with increasingly disturbing private actions, especially concerning sex and women. Back before he lost his partnership with Adidas, he showed executives there pornographic videos on his phone during a meeting. He is being sued by at least two women for sexual assault. One, a model for a music video that West worked on, says that he strangled her and shoved his fingers in her mouth during a music video shoot at New York City’s Chelsea hotel in 2010, allegedly yelling “This is art, this is fucking art,” during the attack. Another, his former assistant, accuses West of sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions, including one incident in which she claims that West drugged her in the presence of the rapper and accused sex trafficker Sean “Diddy” Combs. West has called the allegations “baseless”.', 'As for Censori, her mother came to California from Australia not long after the marriage, reportedly because she was concerned about her daughter. On one of the visits, according to West’s former assistant, West told Censori that he wanted to have sex with Censori’s mother and to make Censori watch.', 'It would be generous – and easier on our consciences – to imagine Censori and West partaking, together, in a critique of gender and celebrity. In this version of events, what West is doing when he stands behind Censori and watches her undress for paparazzi photographers is not using her degradation and vulnerability as proof of his status, but indicting us, the viewer.', 'His vampiric consumption of her body becomes ours: the brutal depiction of heterosexuality as a practice of domination and value extraction is shown to be the same as the practice of celebrity and its consumption. But if that critique is contained in West and Censori’s spectacle, it may be we, not them, who puts it there. Censori’s consent and knowingness is not, actually, in evidence here; and even if it was, consent exists, often, even in situations of asymmetry and violence, even in situations where great harm is being done. Critiquing Censori as an artist allows us to see her differently, as something more hopeful and complicated than a victim of brutality. But sometimes things are what they look like.', 'Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist']"
