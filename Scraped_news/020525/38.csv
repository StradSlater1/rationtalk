It wasn’t long after that historic step that we saw the first app store to take advantage of this access emerge, with AltStore PAL rising to new heights of legitimacy. Now it’s time for third-party iOS app stores to cross another critical threshold: the first Apple-reviewed porn app.', 'When Apple agreed to support alternate app stores, it shared a process called Notarization, wherein the company would review apps for security and privacy concerns, but wouldn’t subject them to the same sort of content oversight as it does with the company’s own App Store.

Beyond the risk of children being able to easily access porn, there is a wider safety risk posed by apps that aren't subject to the same level of rigorous scrutiny Apple uses to determine which apps should be allowed on its own App Store. This opens it up to the risk of malware finding its way onto iPhones -- a threat that Apple has long been able to minimize by maintaining control over the iOS app ecosystem."", 'People whose iPhones end up riddled with malware are unlikely to know or even care whose fault it is, and point the finger at Apple, says Jeronimo. The company\'s challenge, and its stated priority, is to try to keep users as safe as possible while implementing the changes demanded by European regulators. It\'s a tricky tightrope for the company to walk. ""What we are seeing, and what we will see is that at the end of the day, that regulation will put consumers at risk,"" said Jeronimo.', ""The European Commission has long talked a big game about its motivation for cracking down on big US tech companies primarily being to improve the experience for European consumers. The benefit of third-party app stores is that they'll supposedly increase consumer choice, but many, including Apple, believe the associated safety risks aren't worth the trade-off."", '""There\'s absolutely no benefit, apart from a few companies that will distribute their apps and gain some business,"" said Jeronimo.', ""The arrival of Hot Tub on the AltStore is just the tip of the iceberg. It's inevitable that more such apps, which may pose a variety of problems and risks, will follow.""]"

Apple’s anger is largely justified.', 'For the first time in the 17 years of being consumer technology’s most iconic product, the Apple iPhone has verged beyond its maker’s control.', 'This isn’t due to a sentient AI gone awry, akin to sci-fi lore, it’s due to some old-fashioned human intervention. And, a year after a shift change in the EU law, the effects are now being felt.', 'Due to a Digital Markets Act mandating third-party app stores must be allowed on iOS, Hot Tub, the first “first Apple-approved porn app” is now available to be downloaded on iPhone.', 'Get a discounted PS5 Slim while you can', '', 'Now’s your chance to sell your PS4 and upgrade to a PS5 Slim with a disc drive included, all for a reduced cost.', '', 'Except it’s not Apple-approved. It’s very much Apple-disapproved. And Apple can do nothing about it, except to check it was clear for malware and to ensure it hit “baseline platform integrity standards” such is the limited control it has over what goes on third-party app stores. Hence the ability for AltStore to tenuously cite Apple approval.', 'HotTub is described as “adult content browser” that enables users to search and play videos from various popular websites. You can probably guess which ones.', 'This app wouldn’t have had a sniff of passing through the App Store guidelines under the old system that is still in effect in the UK and the United States.', '“Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store. The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.”', '“We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids,” the company said in a statement first reported by Bloomberg. “This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world.”', 'It’s hard to find fault in Apple’s statement. Sure, it’s easy enough to watch porn via an iPhone. Apple’s own Safari web browser doesn’t limit it, for example. But the world wide web was designed to be open long prior to the advent of the iPhone.', 'When Apple set up its own pioneering App Store, it made decisions about whether to offer certain products within the store it owned, for use on the products it built and sold. Some could call it moralising, but that’s the right of any company. That remains the case. You can’t buy hardcore porn DVDs in HMV for example, even though other stores choose to sell them.', 'Apple have long argued its essential for user privacy, user security and user safety, as well as upholding its own standards to maintain full control over its marketplace.', 'Critics have argued it just allows Apple to monopolise the digital market place, stifle competition and claim a significant share of the spoils from each app purchase in ‘tribute’.', 'The problem is both arguments had merit. The sweeping EU mandate ensured fairer competition without compensating for the other part of the equation. Politicians ‘fixing’ one thing only to break another in the process? Who’d have possibly thunk it?', 'The direction of traffic here is concerning. Apple has stated before it believes pornographic iPhone apps are just one possible result the new EU laws. Apple has previously stated concerns over the sale of illegal drugs and weapons via third-party App Stores, as well as the presence of apps encouraging hate speech.', 'For its part, the AltStore is linking the launch of this app to charitable donations via its Mastodon page. I’m no prude, but there’s a slight disconnect to go from crowing about pioneering a pornography app while expressing deep concern about the plight of people working in the deeply exploitative sex industry.', '“Because it’s the season of love, we’ll also be donating ALL our Patreon earnings for the month of February to organizations supporting sex workers and the LGBTQ+ community,” the store owners said. “We feel this is necessary to fight back against recent harmful policies by politicians, Meta, and others, and we encourage everyone to help however you can.”', 'In a deeply uncertain digital world – where the billionaire owners of our social media apps are falling in line with a damaging US government agenda, and where Elon Musk is reportedly pilfering government departments Americans trusted to keep their data safe – there was something comforting about having a watchful guard dog like Apple casting an overly-stringent eye over what was safe and welcome on the App Store and what wasn’t.', 'From a user safety and privacy point of view, I cannot see what good can come of the advent of third-party app stores making their way on to iPhones.

"Why Apple, a porn app, and Trump's possible tariff war are connected",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-app-store-porn-tariff-europe-trump-regulation-2025-2,"['Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology', 'How do Apple, porn, and Donald Trump end up in the same story?', ""Glad you asked. It's a tiny bit complicated, but I'm here to serve."", ""Big picture: Apple is complaining about a porn app that's now available on iPhones, against its wishes, because of European regulations it hates."", ""Those regulations are among the many complaints Big Tech companies have about the way Europe treats them. And they're hoping that Trump, their newfound ally, will fight back against them — maybe using the same tariff/threat strategy he has been employing against Canada, Mexico, and China."", 'The details: Apple is grousing about Hot Tub, a new app available to iPhone users in the European Union. You can\'t get it from Apple\'s own app store, but it\'s available from AltStore, an alternative app store that lets users ""sideload"" apps to their phones. AltStore works because of new EU regulations — bitterly opposed by Apple — that allow for third-party app stores.', ""On the porn part: I haven't used Hot Tub myself, but from what I understand, it lets you … look at porn. Just like anyone with an iPhone can already do using Apple's Safari browser."", 'But Apple thinks there\'s a big distinction since Apple (like Google) has long banned porn apps from the app store it runs. And it\'s particularly upset that Hot Tub and AltStore have suggested that the new app is ""Apple-approved."" (The distinction: Though Apple hates the new third-party app stores it has to work with, it still gets to conduct basic supervision of the apps that show up in app stores like AltStore. In Apple\'s eyes, signing off on an app for someone else\'s app store is very different from approving it for its own app store.)', ""All of this comes as a result of a drawn-out fight involving Apple and a handful of developers, including Epic Games, that have complained about Apple's app store rules and EU regulators. I've written about this — and the importance of the App Store to Apple's overall business — a bunch. I'd also suggest reading Shira Ovide's excellent plain-English explainer in The Washington Post."", 'And the reason Trump comes into play is that rules about the way Apple works with app developers are one of many things Big Tech companies hate about European regulations. (US lawmakers, meanwhile, spent years promising to regulate Big Tech themselves but have largely left it alone: Almost all attempts at Big Tech regulation have instead come from lawsuits filed or threatened by Trump\'s and Joe Biden\'s administrations.) They\'ve been making it clear to Trump that they\'d like him to do something about it. It\'s certainly not a coincidence that Mark Zuckerberg, who made a dramatic and vocal pivot into Trumpdom last month, now calls European tech rules ""almost like a tariff.""', ""Message received. Last month, Trump used a Davos speech to complain about European fines and regulations aimed at Big Tech. This week, in the middle of tariff threats/negotiations with Mexico and Canada, he suggested that he'd be turning his attention to Europe shortly."", ""That doesn't necessarily mean American tech companies will get what they want. Trump will have a long list of concessions he'll want out of Europe, and it's entirely unclear what he'll prioritize and what, if anything, he'll get."", 'But you should still connect the dots between porn apps and potential EU tariffs — because Big Tech companies certainly are.', '']"

Beyond the risk of children being able to easily access porn, there is a wider safety risk posed by apps that aren't subject to the same level of rigorous scrutiny Apple uses to determine which apps should be allowed on its own App Store. This opens it up to the risk of malware finding its way onto iPhones -- a threat that Apple has long been able to minimize by maintaining control over the iOS app ecosystem."", 'People whose iPhones end up riddled with malware are unlikely to know or even care whose fault it is, and point the finger at Apple, says Jeronimo.

Fortnite publisher Epic Games also invested in the AltStore, which now seems on track to become Europe’s place for iOS porn. ', 'What an achievement.', 'It’s all thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). ', 'The app (Hot Tub) is now available on the AltStore in Europe. The AltStore is one of the handful of independent stores to have appeared in the EU since implementation of the DMA. ', 'Originally a subscription-based service, the store became freely available once it received major funding from Epic Games, which has been a noisy critic of Apple’s App Store model. One thing the company hasn’t done with that funding is build an age-verification process, which means the porn app it provides is now easily available to young people in the region. ', 'Apple has no way to prevent this because the DMA both forces Apple to open up its app store ecosystem to third-party developers and removed its power to curate apps sold outside its store. And while the porn app is the first manifestation of the kind of content you’ll have to avoid when using third-party stores, or the kind of content you’ll want your kids to avoid, it won’t be the last such threat. ', 'Apple has warned for years that enabling app side-loading on iOS will open the gates to dangerous, deceptive, and dubious apps. Despite these warnings, the European Commission made this threat a reality. You should see this as a sign of what’s to come, thanks to the actions of former European competition chief Margrethe Vestager, who seems pleased to have forced Apple to open up. ', 'Features of the app include a “teen” channel and content from PornHub, which recently admitted to unlawful monetary transactions involving sex trafficking proceeds. Shortly after the app appeared, Alt Store also said it would donate its February Patreon earnings to organizations supporting sex workers and the LGBTQ community, which seems incongruous, given PornHub’s recent admission', 'Europe seems to think that forcing Apple’s platforms to become worse will in some way promote competition and enable innovative European businesses to thrive. But it seems to do so at the cost of platform security and the acceleration of what author Cory Doctorow describes as “enshittification.” In other words, it’s regulation-forced platform decay. ', 'In a statement provided to Computerworld, Apple said: “We are deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids. This app and others like it will undermine consumer trust and confidence in our ecosystem that we have worked for more than a decade to make the best in the world.”', 'Apple has always argued that the DMA damages the company in preventing such content being published on its platforms. While there’s an app notarization process, that’s about tech verification and security rather than content. An app being notarized does not mean Apple has approved it, as is explicitly stated in the App Store guidelines. ', 'What makes matters worse is that the AltStore claims the app has been approved by Apple.', '“Contrary to the false statements made by the marketplace developer, we certainly do not approve of this app and would never offer it in our App Store,” Apple said. “The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.”', 'Apple was concerned about the app before it hit the store and approached the European Commission in December to express its concerns. The Commission expressed no opposition to the app, I’m told. In other words, the people behind the app would be more truthful if they said their app was approved by Vestager, rather than Apple. I’m not convinced that would be how she sees it, but actions speak louder than words, and by not taking any action the Commission she leads gives tacit approval.', 'While perhaps some European millionaires will make a couple of bucks off this platform decay, it is doubtful the participants in the adult videos now easily available to European schoolchildren will see much of that largesse.', 'Despite the EU’s efforts, parents do have some choice. Apple has built Parental Controls to forbid access to third-party stores.  First you must set up Parental Controls on your child’s device, after which you should follow these steps:', 'While this is likely to lead to your children protesting that they can no longer access Fortnite in order to spend your money on digital game items (for the benefit of Epic Games), this does at least mean you can restrict your children to a curated and trusted marketplace.

It lets users search through and watch all manner of porn from sites like PornHub and XHamster while offering a streamlined browsing experience with no ads or pop-ups.', 'This easily navigable porn app is made possible by the DMA, Europe’s Digital Markets Act, a fairly recent piece of EU regulation that aims to create a fairer digital economy. One of the ways it does that is by forcing closed ecosystems like Apple’s iOS devices to offer a wider range of digital storefronts from which users can find apps rather than just leaving them to choose from what’s available in Apple’s App Store.', 'Apps like Hot Tub will go through the same Notarization process on iOS as any other app, but all that does is ensure that the app meets “baseline platform integrity standards.” Essentially, all they do is prove that the app works and that the simple act of installing it doesn’t ruin your phone. Apple says that alternative app stores can shovel out unrated apps that can be filled with porn, weapons, and hate speech.
