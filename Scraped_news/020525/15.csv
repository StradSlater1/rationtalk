Suspending it now would mean cutting funding for the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in Lebanon, to which USAID has allocated about $45 million. Thus, 170,000 Lebanese and 570,000 Syrian “refugees” will be cut off from aid provided by the WFP.', 'According to the US embassy in Beirut, USAID spent about $293 million in Lebanon, during 2024.  USAID also participated in financing the Rapid Response Fund (RRF) with an amount of $128 million, representing 40.1% of the total amount paid to international organizations operating in Lebanon. ', 'Trump decided to suspend most US foreign aid under the pretext of implementing a 3-month review to assess the extent to which this “aid” is consistent with the “America First” policy based on reducing foreign spending and spending it domestically.', 'Trump believes that it is possible to achieve the imperialist goals sought by these institutions without paying these amounts.', 'As a businessman, Trump believes that a single tweet can threaten a country like Colombia with raising customs tariffs and sanctions without the need to spend millions to exploit local NGOs to influence its official policy.', 'It is noteworthy that Trump excluded Egypt and the Israeli occupation entity. Between 1946 and 2022, the latter received about $317.9 billion in aid, while Egypt received about $182 billion. ', 'To deal with the expected financial shortage, these Lebanese NGOs have rushed to lay off a large number of employees, noting that Trump’s decision will also have obvious repercussions on various projects funded by Washington in Lebanon.', 'As mentioned earlier, Trump’s decision will lead to the cessation of the activities of the WFP in Lebanon, which USAID allocated about 62.2% of the amount it needs, while 8 international agencies were to receive the remaining amount of $27 million.', 'Among these international agencies are: the International Organization for Migration (which was to receive $12 million); the World Health Organization (which was to receive $3.5 million).', 'Annually, the Asian continent tops the list of USAID funding with $20 billion, followed by Africa with $14 billion, which exposes the extent of Washington’s interest in its areas of imperial expansion.', 'Besides, the “global governance” sector receives about $16.8 billion annually from USAID, as “governance” is one of the tools that Washington uses to direct global economies towards neoliberalism.', 'The term “global governance” refers to the rules through which formal structures such as governments are directed, as well as informal structures such as NGOs.', 'During his first term (2017-2021), Trump sought to cut foreign aid budgets less radically than he has in his current term.', 'At the time, observers believed he was convinced that “imposing maximum sanctions on Iran” and toppling anti-American governments were of high priority.

What Trump's aid freeze means for the Middle East and US policy,https://www.newarab.com/analysis/what-trumps-aid-freeze-means-middle-east-and-us-policy,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Breadcrumb', 'There is a frenzy among recipients of US foreign aid, most notably in the Middle East, after the Trump administration decided to pause all assistance programs spearheaded by the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for 90 days.', 'President Donald Trump’s unpredictability is disconcerting for non-government and multilateral organisations in the region, as well as for other actors, but what does this decision include, what impact it will have, and what should we expect moving forward?', 'Trump announced the foreign aid freeze in an executive order on 20 January followed by a State Department memo on 24 January to elaborate on the details of the order. The reason for the confusion is that the executive order pausing aid does not specify the assistance programs covered in the decision, with recipients of US aid expecting the worst.', ""How Trump's team of loyalists could remake the White House"", ""Over the weekend, the White House announced it was moving to shut down USAID as the major vehicle for foreign aid and integrate it into the State Department. The Trump administration removed two top security officials after they tried to stop representatives from billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to restricted parts of the building."", 'Trump said on Sunday that USAID is “run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we’re getting them out”. On 27 January, at least 56 senior career USAID staffers (mostly lawyers) were abruptly placed on administrative leave reportedly for circumventing Trump’s executive order by helping aid organisations file for waivers to continue receiving aid for life-saving projects.', 'However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio backtracked on the decision for a total aid freeze on 28 January, signalling in a memo that humanitarian assistance defined as “core lifesaving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance” would be exempted, adding to the bureaucratic confusion. ', 'The State Department said that “President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people”. US foreign aid was around $72 billion in 2023 targeting more than 170 countries, primarily focusing on economic assistance. US foreign aid is only 1 percent of federal spending, hence beyond the brouhaha, this is no real attempt to curb the federal debt that now has exceeded $36 trillion.', 'In the FY 2024 budget, the Biden administration requested around $7.6 billion for the Middle East, of which $2 billion was for USAID, about 11% of the State Department’s International Affairs budget request.', 'The aid freeze does not include the Pentagon-run Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which includes military assistance to Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon. The major recipient of FMF remains Israel, which receives $3.3 billion per year. The White House therefore excluded around $5.28 billion in FMF programs, or 70% of US aid to the Middle East, from this decision.', 'At stake now is the remaining 30% of paused assistance - around $2.5 billion. The State Department said it has excluded non-military aid to Israel and Egypt, which is not a significant amount as the bulk of US aid to both countries is military.', 'The most significant impact is on Jordanian, Lebanese, Iraqi, and Palestinian recipients of aid as well as multilateral and non-profit organisations that benefit from specific programs, most notably the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).', 'The US has already decreased non-military aid to Tunisia and Egypt due to democratic backsliding, but the Trump administration reportedly assured Middle East governments that aid would be resumed after the review.', 'Moreover, there are specific regional aid programs aimed to counter terrorism and Iranian influence as well as promoting Arab-Israeli peace. In FY 2024, the US government allocated $65 million to support human rights in Iran, $27 million for civil society in the Middle East, $8 million for reform and economic development, and $5.5 million to support Arab-Israeli technical cooperation.', 'Moreover, the Middle East region also receives annual humanitarian assistance not included in the region-specific budget, following the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel, and aid for humanitarian crises in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon; most notably the crucial assistance for Al-Hol displacement camp in northeast Syria which hosts 40,000 people, mostly women and children, displaced from areas previously controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group.', 'The aid freeze can only be understood through the prism of domestic US politics, as it is part of a wider approach by Trump driven by his agenda. The White House simultaneously issued an executive order pausing all federal financial assistance to ensure they are consistent with Trump’s views on banning federal diversity, cutting clean energy spending, and banning abortions, among other objectives.', 'The White House had to rescind this executive order because of legal and policy obstacles, and there is bureaucratic and legislative pressure on the executive branch to mitigate the impact of the foreign aid freeze. The transition witnessed a bureaucratic war between the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration, with the former making sure to secure as much funding as possible for foreign allies in anticipation of any decisions by Trump.', 'The State Department memo has an important milestone of 30 days to review the guidelines for all foreign aid, hence we should have a clear idea by 26 February of what to expect from the new rules under Trump. This review is led by Michael Anton, the State Department’s director of the office of policy planning, who wrote in a 2016 essay that conservatives should proactively start reshaping America away from the failures of liberals.', 'The State Department noted in its statement that “reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral imperative”.', 'Indeed, this is an extension of the ongoing culture war between liberals and conservatives. Traditionally, there has generally been bipartisan support for foreign aid, and under two previous Republican Presidents, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, there have been large increases. However, Trump brings a set of new philosophies and values that completely erode the tradition of US assistance, which requires an adaptation by both the US bureaucracy and aid recipients, at least for the next four years.', 'Secretary Rubio clearly stated in his 28 January memo that the waivers would not include “abortions, family planning conferences” and “transgender surgeries, or other nonlife saving assistance”. The White House aims to redefine US values at home and abroad regarding gender identification, abortion, and clean energy, among other issues.', ""What to expect from Trump 2.0's Middle East policy"", 'Trump’s decision has triggered a debate about the impact of reducing US aid. In Washington, both liberals and conservatives see foreign aid as an instrument of power, but they have different interpretations of how it is defined.', 'For liberals, the power of aid is promoting US interests by reflecting American values, while for conservatives, and Trump specifically, it looks set to be used as a tool to reshape American values abroad and ensure that no recipient benefits if critical of, or not complying with, US interests.', 'Globally, and specifically in the Middle East, there is on one hand panic, as most of these entities increasingly have a narrower pool of aid providers and will have instead to explore aid from Europe and private US donors, especially liberals. Arab governments are not an ideal source of donations for non-profit organisations because they do not prioritise issues of reforms, equality, and freedom of expression, and might have their own preconditions for aid.', 'On the other hand, there is an argument that this is an opportunity for recipients to become more independent, to look for creative local alternatives, and diversify how they run their budget instead of relying on foreign aid. It is worth noting that beyond the issue of foreign aid, and whether one agrees with it or not, there is an acceptance and endorsement of how Trump’s conservatism is redefining American values on social issues.', 'Foreign aid is a matter of US leverage, a major instrument of power for US diplomatic missions, and a magnet for recipients who look for the US as a major donor. If Trump fully relinquishes this instrument, he will abdicate US leverage globally and recipients will flock to governments that have larger aid budgets such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Germany.', 'Indeed, this move by Trump is sending a loud and clear message that US aid is no longer a synonym for liberal values and that the new administration will not accept what it sees as ‘free riding’. However, there is no reason to panic just yet. After the initial shock, a key factor that distinguishes Trump’s style, common sense might prevail within the US bureaucracy, even if there could be inevitable casualties for programs that do not reflect conservative values.', ""Trump is an isolationist 'America First' president and this expected pause in foreign aid is a notice that the world must adapt to him, not the other way around."", 'Joe Macaron is a researcher and analyst on US and Middle East affairs, he holds a PhD in Politics and International Studies from the University of Bath', 'Follow him on Twitter: @macaronjoe ']"

US Foreign Aid Pause Has Already Done “Irreparable Harm” ,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/the-us-foreign-aid-pause-has-already-done-irreparable-harm/,"['Employees and supporters of the United States Agency for International Development protest outside its Washington headquarters Monday.Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Cal/Getty', '', 'Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders that signaled his intent to remake the federal government—including one that paused all US foreign assistance for 90 days. The order was the first in a series of extraordinary moves that have upended the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and halted crucial, lifesaving work around the world. Today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is on a trip to El Salvador, told reporters that he is now the acting director of USAID and that some of its functions would continue within the State Department—after a review to ensure that these programs are aligned with the Trump administration’s foreign policy priorities. ', 'Foreign assistance has long been a hallmark of America’s role in the world, regardless of which party occupies the White House or controls Congress. The underlying principle is that while feeding the hungry and treating the sick are worthy efforts, doing so is also beneficial to long-term American interests in national security and trade. When USAID shipments of medical supplies arrived in Liberia during the 2014 Ebola epidemic, the boxes read, “From the American people.” ', 'The United States is the world’s single largest provider of foreign assistance, though this accounts for only about 1 percent of the more than $6 trillion federal budget. In fiscal year 2023, Congress allocated $66 billion for foreign aid, which is administered through the State Department and USAID. Through bipartisan negotiations, Congress determines how foreign aid is spent on everything from disaster relief to public health, foreign military assistance, and democracy promotion. Humanitarian assistance is primarily distributed by USAID, which funds partner agencies on the ground.  ', 'In the two short weeks since Trump took office, his administration has enacted an unprecedented stoppage of foreign aid and a dramatic overhaul of staff at USAID. On January 24, the State Department issued a “stop work” order for existing and new programs, with exceptions for emergency food assistance and military aid to Israel and Egypt. Although Rubio later issued an additional waiver for “life-saving humanitarian assistance,” aid workers said the exemptions are unclear and vital programs already had been disrupted. There were reports that soup kitchens had shut down in famine-stricken Sudan. In Thailand, hospitals treating refugees fleeing conflict in Myanmar had suspended care. In South Africa, HIV patients were turned away from US-funded clinics. ', 'Last week, more than 50 career civil servants and foreign service officers at USAID were placed on administrative leave, followed by layoffs of nearly 400 contract employees. ', 'To Jeremy Konyndyk, who served as a high-level political appointee at USAID during the Biden and second Obama administrations, this was a sign that the Trump administration did not intend to perform a good-faith review of the efficacy of foreign aid programs. “This is a ‘destroy the village in order to save it’ approach,” Konyndyk, now president of Refugees International, told me Friday when we spoke about the foreign aid pause and the havoc inside USAID. ', 'The future of USAID remains murky, though the Trump administration’s plans are beginning to erratically take shape. Over the weekend, Elon Musk, who is leading the government efficiency task force DOGE, described USAID as a “criminal organization” on X and suggested it was “time for it to die.” Early Monday, Musk added that Trump had given him approval to “shut it down.” After some employees were prevented from entering USAID headquarters, a group of Senate and House Democrats held a press conference condemning the administration’s actions. “Musk and his band of unelected acolytes at DOGE have…thrown the agency into chaos through a concerted campaign of harassment and intimidation of its employees,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) told reporters. ', 'The conversation with Konyndyk below has been edited for length and clarity.', 'How has aid and assistance traditionally fit into American foreign policy? Is it typically a priority across party lines?', 'Leaders of both parties have, at least for the last 20 years, understood that doing good in the world is, in and of itself, an important US national interest. We operate very distinctly from, say, the way China approaches its partnerships with low-income countries. We are not doing this on a transactional basis, though we do derive benefits. But we’re not saying, “We will give you foreign aid only if you do X.” ', 'For example, during Covid-19, which I was directly involved with, the vaccine diplomacy models of the US and China were wildly different. China’s model was they would go and they would charge extremely high prices for vaccines while demanding policy concessions. So a number of countries had to agree to remove recognition of Taiwan in order to get Chinese vaccines. Some did agree, because at that time, during the tail end of the first Trump administration, the US was not sharing any vaccines. But once the US started donating our vaccines, they vastly preferred working with us. We provided them free of cost, on a humanitarian basis. It demonstrated that the partnership between those countries and the United States was one based on shared values.', 'The Trump administration has talked about US foreign aid as a transactional tool, that we will give it to countries who do what we want and not to countries who don’t. That removes a huge strategic comparative advantage that we have vis-a-vis China. When it is so baldly extractive, it almost feels like extortion.', 'To come to the executive order that Trump signed on his first day in office, which temporarily suspended foreign assistance programs for 90 days, can you contextualize that? Has this ever happened before? ', 'There’s no precedent for that. It’s not uncommon for a new administration to come in and do a review, but it’s not appropriate to stop everything while you’re doing that. It’s akin to deciding that you don’t like the destination of the plane, so you’re just going to turn the engine off and crash it into the ground. ', 'It is going to irreparably harm our foreign assistance capacity and waste enormous amounts of taxpayer resources. The administration has said they don’t like the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and other so-called “woke” programs. Frankly, I’m not even sure what that means in the context of foreign aid. But those can be rooted out in a much more surgical way if that’s truly the goal. ', 'The executive order described the foreign aid industry and bureaucracy as “not aligned with American interests, and in many cases, antithetical to American values.” Is there a sense that the administration thinks of the practice of foreign aid at large as something that has become politicized? ', 'They clearly do. One of the things that was very interesting to me, having served at USAID twice as a political appointee, was that to the career staff, their day-to- day ability to have an impact was often pretty unrelated to which party was in control. There were some who were able to do great things during the Trump administration and then ran into challenges during the Biden administration. ', '“Frankly, it won’t be possible to reopen many of these programs in three months’ time. Already, many of the organizations that work with the US government, both domestically and internationally, are laying off staff.”', 'But fundamentally, as career government servants, you are going with the flow of whichever party is in charge. That is an ethos that’s deeply embedded in the career government service, particularly in the foreign affairs agencies, and it’s an ethos that I think the Trump administration has never understood. They could advance their agenda much more effectively if they treated those in the building as professionals rather than as adversaries.', 'On January 24, the State Department put out a “stop work” order for both existing and future aid, with some exceptions for emergency food programs and foreign military aid. What did that look like in the agency and in the countries where aid is being performed?', 'It prompted mass confusion within the US government about how this should be implemented, because the guidance was unclear, and there was really no template or precedent for how you do something like that. There was mass confusion amongst the partners providing aid on the ground in terms of what this meant for them. It meant pulling critical, lifesaving relief out of refugee camps. It meant shutting down clinics—a lot of people will needlessly die from lack of health services.  ', 'Frankly, it won’t be possible to reopen many of these programs in three months’ time. Already, many of the organizations that work with the US government, both domestically and internationally, are laying off staff. They cannot keep the lights on. ', 'There has been a dramatic overhaul of staffing at USAID, with some senior staff being placed on leave and hundreds of contract employees being laid off. What is the potential impact of this? ', 'Nothing like this has happened before, and it is debilitating to the US government’s ability to meaningfully oversee and account for foreign assistance. I care deeply about the morale and the wellbeing of the staff who’ve been let go. But even if you don’t care about that, I would hope you care about the effective oversight of taxpayer money. Contract employers are doing the day-to-day legwork that makes that place run—from grant administration to data analytics. ', 'What I take away from these layoffs, apart from the obvious cruelty and capriciousness of it, is that this is not how you would approach a genuine review of foreign aid. I worked very closely with the Global Health Bureau when I was at USAID, and around 50 percent of their employees are contractors. You would not suddenly halve the workforce if you expected any of this to continue.  ', 'On January 27, most of the agency’s senior leadership was put on involuntary administrative leave, including much of the general counsel’s office. That included two ethics attorneys, whose job is to advise political appointees on what they can and can’t legally do. This is exactly what you would do if you were seeking to remove any constraints to the destruction of the agency and any constraints to unlawful behavior. You get rid of all the career officials who are able to stand in your way and all the lawyers who can tell you that what you’re doing is unlawful. ', 'What do these early moves from the administration around foreign aid herald for the future role of the US in the world?', 'It becomes a United States that is much diminished. This shows, in practice, what an “America First” approach to foreign policy and national security looks like: pulling back from the world, pulling back from helping people who have long relied on their partnerships with the US government. It is an America that, on the world stage, is smaller, stingier, meaner, and, ultimately, much less respected and much less influential.', '', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

View from the Himalayas: US freeze on foreign aid leaves Nepal sectors in limbo,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/view-from-the-himalaya-us-freeze-on-foreign-aid-leaves-nepal-sectors-in-limbo-101738588019055.html,"['', 'A raft of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump in his early days in office has put several programmes across sectors in Nepal in a state of limbo. As of January 29, Trump had signed 44 executive orders.', '', 'America partners with the Nepal government and local organisations on a wide range of programmes—from boosting food security and economic growth, managing natural resources, improving health care and education and bolstering democratic governance and responding to natural disasters. Nepal has been a major recipient of aid from the US, the largest donor globally. In fiscal year 2023, it disbursed $72 billion worldwide.', 'Nepal is understandably concerned over the abrupt suspension of American aid and is awaiting elucidation from US authorities regarding the duration and scope of the funding freeze. Efforts are underway to assess the potential impact on ongoing and planned projects, reported The Kathmandu Post.', 'Already, some organisations have been forced to lay off their staff while many others are bracing for a protracted suspension. The worst-hit are those which are fully funded by American assistance. But all — regardless of whether they are fully or partially\u202ffunded — now seem pressured to diversify their resources. A senior member of a civil society organisation working on climate change said his office has laid off some of their Kathmandu-based staff, and the remaining members of the team have agreed to take a 20% pay cut to stay afloat. Efforts were now afoot to diversify aid sources.', 'But tweaking staffing, managing office logistics and handling ongoing programmes could be formidably tough for some as they wait out the 90-day funding pause. The uncertainty over whether their programmes would be continued after the review, along with the concurrent financial distress and dilemma, is discernible.', 'The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has already rung an alarm bell as programmes focusing on climate resilience and biodiversity conservation, including in the Himalayan region, face new risks. In a relatively small area, Nepal possesses a diverse climatic system, which combines heavy monsoons, steep terrain, and remoteness, rendering it vulnerable to natural disasters. Nepal is at a high risk of floods, including Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), landslides, and droughts. Extreme weather events are likely to make natural disasters more frequent and calamitous. Between September 26 to 28 last year, in 72 hours, Kathmandu received more than 350 millimetres of rain, one-fourth of what it gets in a whole year.', 'History of US assistance dates back to Cold War', 'Nepal and America have a long history of development cooperation and, significantly, it all started during the Cold War. In 1951, after signing the Point Four Development Programs, the US became the first bilateral donor to Nepal. The late 1940s and 1950s were a remarkable period for Nepal, as its neighbours went through significant changes. In 1947, India, the southern neighbour, gained ndependence. In 1949, Mao Zedong took control of China and began the long march towards consolidating political and military hold on Tibet, which borders Nepal to the north. It was also a period when India and China were beginning to get at loggerheads in the disputed Himalayan region, which eventually led to the 1962 border war.', 'However, America was still a new player in South Asia, even as World War II had catapulted it onto the world stage, as historian Thomas Robertson notes in his essay (“Frontline of the Cold War”: The US and Point Four Development Programs in Cold War Nepal) in a newly published book Nepal in the Long 1950s. “Squeezed between India and Chinese-controlled Tibet, Nepal possessed growing strategic value.”', 'America had a great influence in shaping the postwar world order. Named after the fourth point of President Harry Truman’s 1949 inaugural address, the Point Four Programs provided technical assistance and economic aid to underdeveloped countries.\u202fPresident John F Kennedy in November 1961 brought the foreign development assistance under a single agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the American government’s lead provider of non-military aid.', 'Fast forward to 2022, USAID signed a five-year “strategic plan” with the Nepal government, committing $659 million. The agreement outlines the broad development areas of cooperation and collaboration and supports Nepal’s goal of graduating to a middle-income country, working in partnership with the government, civil society and the private sector. The emphasis is on strengthening democratic governance, enterprise-driven economic growth and increased resilience for communities most at-risk to natural disasters and climate change. But questions have arisen about whether Trump 2.0 has any appetite for these programmes, including the idea of inclusion, a cardinal political pillar of Nepal’s new constitution and polity post-2006.', 'With the current aid suspension, news reports and experts in Nepal variously claim some two dozen INGOs and hundreds of NGOs are being impacted. Many of the projects are run by the Nepal government, and the budgetary impact could be as high as $200 million.', 'Largest US grant to continue', 'By all accounts, however, the 90-day hiatus will not impact the US-assisted Millenium Challenge Corporation’s (“MCC”) Nepal Compact — the single largest grant Nepal has ever received. The aid is being used for building transmission lines and improving roads. Nepal contributes $197 million to the MCC Compact. If the recent statements from the U.S. government is anything to go by, MCC projects are not in danger. According to a January 26 statement by the State Department, Trump’s executive order “on Reevaluating and Realigning” the foreign assistance only covers those areas “funded by or through the State Department and USAID.”', 'Nepali officials also believe the MCC Compact will not be affected since it is outside the purview of the ongoing revision, and, additionally, it is jointly funded by the US government and Nepal. One component of the MCC investment aims at enhancing regional energy trade between Nepal and India. Valued at $12.36 million, a transmission line in Nepal’s western Terai will connect it with the Indian power grid.', 'No end to dilemma', 'For now, however, the suspension of US aid has sparked significant discussion on Nepal’s social media and in the press, reflecting public concern over the potential negative impact on essential services and development projects. Significantly, the recent shifts in American foreign policy have resulted in new small-state anxieties in Nepal, just as in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, that far outweigh the development budget Trump’s move has put on hold. To many in Nepal, the possibility of the aid withdrawal', 'by America, or ‘Third Neighbour,” could lead to even greater reliance on two immediate ones — India and China in the long term. America’s great-power rival, China might even relish this prospect in the South Asian theatre.', 'Akhilesh Upadhyay is former Editor-in-Chief of The Kathmandu Post and a Senior Fellow at Center for Strategic Affairs at IIDS, a Kathmandu-based think tank.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio said “life-saving humanitarian assistance” could continue, offering a respite for what he called “core” efforts to provide food, medicine, shelter and other emergency needs.', 'But he stressed that the reprieve was “temporary in nature”, with limited exceptions. Beyond that, hundreds of senior officials and workers who help distribute US aid had already been fired or put on leave, and many aid efforts remain paralysed around the world.', 'Most of the soup kitchens in Khartoum, the battle-torn capital of Sudan, have shut down. Until days ago, the US was the largest source of money for the volunteer-run kitchens that fed 816,000 people there.', '“For most people, it’s the only meal they get,” said Hajooj Kuka, a spokesman for the Emergency Response Rooms, describing Khartoum as a city “on the edge of starvation.”', 'After the US money was frozen late last month, some of the aid groups that channel those funds to the food kitchens said they were unsure if they were allowed to continue. Others cut off the money completely. Now, 434 of the 634 volunteer kitchens in the capital have shut down, Kuka said.', '“And more are going out of service every day,” he added.', 'Many of the aid workers, doctors and people in need who rely on US aid are now reckoning with their relationship with the United States and the message the Trump administration is sending: The United States is focusing on itself.', '“It feels like one easy decision by the US president is quietly killing so many lives,” said Nah Pha, a tuberculosis patient who said he was told to leave a US-funded hospital in the Mae La refugee camp, the largest refugee camp on the Myanmar-Thailand border.', 'Nah Pha, who fled Myanmar in 2007 to escape the fighting there, said the staff gave him a week’s supply of medicine and told him that was all they could provide. “Once my medicine runs out, I have nowhere else to get it,” he said.', 'The public health implications of the aid freeze are broad, health workers say. In Cambodia, which had been on the cusp of eradicating malaria with the help of the United States, officials now worry that a halt in funding will set them back. In Nepal, a $72 million (€69 million) programme to reduce malnutrition has been suspended. In South Africa and Haiti, officials and aid workers worry that hundreds of thousands of people could die if the Trump administration withdraws support for a signature US programme to fight HIV and Aids.', 'Some programmes that don’t fit the category of life-saving aid remain frozen, while others are explicitly barred because they fall outside of the administration’s ideological bounds, including any help with abortions, gender or diversity issues.', 'The UN Population Fund, a sexual and reproductive health agency, said that because of the funding freeze, maternal and mental health services to millions of women in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Gaza Strip, Ukraine and other places had been disrupted or eliminated. In Afghanistan, where the Taliban has banned women from working, 1,700 Afghan women who worked for the agency would no longer be employed.', 'At stake is not just the goodwill that the United States has built internationally, but also its work to promote US security interests.

The Status of President Trump’s Pause of Foreign Aid and Implications for PEPFAR and other Global Health Programs,https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-status-of-president-trumps-pause-of-foreign-aid-and-implications-for-pepfar-and-other-global-health-programs/,"['', 'The independent source for health policy research, polling, and news.', 'Jennifer Kates\nPublished: Feb 03, 2025', 'Starting on day one of his second term, President Trump began to issue several executive orders and other actions that affect global health. One was “Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid” which calls for a 90-day pause in new foreign assistance obligations and disbursements pending review of all foreign aid programs. A notice sent to all diplomatic and consular officials on January 24 implementing the order went further, requiring stop-work orders to be issued for all existing foreign assistance awards, effectively halting implementation of U.S. global health efforts, including PEPFAR, in low and middle-income countries around the world. While PEPFAR was issued a limited waiver a week later, allowing it to restart some services, the situation remains fluid and fast-moving, intersects with several other executive orders and an apparent effort to dissolve USAID (the U.S. international development agency which implements most U.S. global health programs) as an independent agency. In addition, no waivers for other global health programs have been announced. This policy watch provides an overview of what has happened to date, as of February 3, 2025.', 'What does the Executive Order (EO) pausing foreign aid do? The order, issued on January 20, 2025, was one of the first to be issued by the President. It states that “It is the policy of United States that no further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States” and calls for two main actions:', 'Determinations are to be made within 90 days about whether to continue, modify, or cease programs based on the review, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. New obligations and disbursements may resume prior to the end of the 90-day period if a review and a determination are made to do so. The EO also allows the Secretary of State to waive the pause for specific programs but does not provide criteria for waivers.', 'Why was the executive order issued? The rationale for the order appears to be based on both economic efficiency and ideological grounds. According to its preamble, the U.S. “foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values. They serve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.” A media note issued by the State Department states that the EO is “rooting out waste” and “blocking woke programs.” It also states that “Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous”, a statement made Secretary Rubio during his confirmation hearing and one that underpins the current department’s mission and priorities in Trump’s second term. These ideas also echo several that were included in Project 2025’s Mandate for Leadership, a set of recommendations for the next Republican president released in 2023 by a coalition of conservative organizations. For example, Project 2025 called for freezing foreign aid pending a review by political appointees (p. 174), refocusing “attention away from the special interests and social experiments that are used in some quarters to capture U.S. foreign policy” (p. 196), realigning U.S. foreign assistance “with American national interests and the principles of good governance” and undoing “the gross misuse of foreign aid by the current Administration to promote a radical ideology that is politically divisive at home and harms our global standing” (p. 279).', 'What is the “stop-work”order and is that different than the pause of new funds? While the EO calls for a pause on new foreign assistance obligations and disbursements (funds that have already been appropriated by Congress usually for specific programs or activities but have not yet gone to programs), a notice sent to all diplomatic and consular officials on January 24 went further. It requires all grant and contract officers to immediately issue stop-work orders for all existing foreign assistance awards (not just new obligations and disbursements) until a review is conducted. This means that work already underway with funding provided to organizations must be immediately stopped, such as clinics providing services, health care workers being funded, and other activities. The notice indicates that waivers had been granted for foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance (as well as some salaries and administrative costs).', 'Have any waivers been granted? While the EO notice indicates that waivers for foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance have been granted, it does not provide any further detail or indicate what the process is for requesting a waiver. Separately, on January 28, Secretary Rubio announced that he had issued an additional emergency humanitarian waiver, which allows implementers of “existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs” to continue or resume work. The waiver is temporary and does not apply to new contracts (unless a separate waiver is granted). Life-saving humanitarian assistance is defined as “core life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.”', 'While additional waivers could be requested through the Director of Foreign Assistance at the Department of State, several activities are not eligible for waivers at all, including those that involve: abortions (which are not paid for using U.S. government funds anyway), family planning, conferences, administrative costs other than those covered by the humanitarian assistance waiver, gender or DEI ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance. Some of these services are also the subject of other executive orders and actions issued by the President include (including “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing” and “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth to The Federal Government”).', 'Despite the emergency humanitarian waiver specifying life-saving medicine and medical services, it was still unclear what programs it actually applied to and whether it included services provided by PEPFAR, the President’s Malaria Initiative, and other health programs, since under the State Department’s framework for foreign aid, health programs and humanitarian assistance efforts are categorized separately. As a result, the PEPFAR program applied for a specific waiver, which was granted on February 1, for certain activities. No other waivers have been announced for any other U.S. global health program, such as for the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), TB, maternal and child health, and nutrition activities.', 'What does PEPFAR’s limited waiver allow for? PEPFAR’s limited waiver, granted on February 1, allows for some PEPFAR services to resume during the 90-day period (unless other guidance is issued). Specifically, the waiver was granted to “implement urgent life-saving HIV treatment services in alignment with the Secretary of State’s January 28 memo “Emergency Humanitarian Waiver to Foreign Assistance Pause.” Life-saving HIV treatment is defined by the waiver as follows:', 'Activities covered by the waiver may be resumed, including new disbursements and limited obligations (only where pre-planned obligations already existed for the activities or where they otherwise could not be restarted without new obligations). No other activities can be resumed. The waiver indicates that the PEPFAR program will create an interagency team to provide ongoing guidance to programs. ', 'What are the implications of stopping U.S. global health programs? The stop-work orders on existing awards and pause on new obligations and disbursements have, for the time being, halted current U.S. global health (and other foreign assistance) programs, other than activities permitted under PEPFAR’s limited waiver. This is because health care workers have been told to stop work, clinics are having to close, and commodities and other supplies cannot be provided to clients, affecting access for millions of individuals around the world, many of whom are women and children. Some of the interventions at risk of interruption and discontinuation are:', 'Beyond these direct impacts on access to services for people, hundreds of health care and aid workers have lost their jobs and it is expected that many more will as well, and there are widespread reports of confusion as criteria are not often specified, changes are rapid, and high level health officials at the agency which has historically overseen implementation of many of these programs, have been placed on leave.', 'What happens next? The implications of the pause in global health efforts will likely increase over the 90-day period, as additional programs and activities — those without waivers — are forced to shut down and lay off staff, and more people are unable to get services. The review of foreign aid programs is also underway. Depending on the results of the review, some programs may be recommended for continuation, modification, or may be discontinued. For those that are allowed to continue, it is not clear whether they will still have the capacity (staff, clinic infrastructure, systems) to be able to do so. There is also some confusion regarding the legal status of the foreign aid EO, given that a separate administrative action requiring all federal agencies to temporarily pause all new obligations and disbursements of all Federal financial assistance to ensure compliance with EOs has been successfully challenged in court and temporary restraining orders are in effect, preventing any pause.

It covers the areas for which the USAID offers funding, how to start and write your grant application, understanding the USAID terminology, best practices and budget writing.', 'The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) releases a wide range of federal grant opportunities for the developing nations with the aim of furthering its objectives of saving lives, reducing poverty, strengthening democratic governance and progress; by means of humanitarian assistance and international development efforts. USAID works in over 100 countries in the areas of – Promoting Global Health, Supporting Global Stability, Providing Humanitarian Assistance, Catalyzing Innovation and Partnerships, and Empowering Women and Girls.', 'Non-profit organizations in and outside of the US and even local and state governments in the US can apply for the funding. The grant awards are given in a highly competitive manner and understanding the eligibility and capacity of your organization must be the first step towards preparing yourself in pursuit of a USAID funding opportunity.', 'You may choose to apply for any of the several types of funding that USAID offers: You may respond to a Request for Proposal (RFP), apply for the New Partnerships Initiative (NPI), or submit a proposal for various theme/ project based grant and partnership opportunities, or even submit an unsolicited proposal to the USAID.', 'These funding opportunities are posted daily on Grants.gov and beta.SAM.gov.

You might also like to use USAID’s Business Forecast to have a glimpse of the latest opportunities, and from here you can download information about these opportunities and can even use filters and sort features to shortlist the ones of your interest.', 'Ideally, you must begin the preparation even before the opportunity is released by USAID. To have a good shot at getting shortlisted, the proposal must be of very high quality and stands out from the competition. This can only be ensured by spending time and effort in comprehensively researching, understanding the complete process, onboarding the right staff/ consultants and so on.', 'Many of the organizations vying for USAID grants and partnership opportunities start working at least 8-12 months in advance in order to put the relevant teams together by finding and recruiting the personnel, gather all the needed documentation for the application, find the right partners (if needed) and build local partnerships, hire grant proposal writer consultants (individual or agency- if needed) and so on.', 'It would help to keep a regular watch on USAID Business Forecast to understand which opportunities are upcoming in thematic areas, countries, regions or locations. You must also network with the key stakeholders and existing partners in your country or region to gather information around USAID’s goals and strategy for the country in a particular thematic area.', 'You should also go through the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) of USAID in your country. This document is a 3-5-year plan that each USAID country mission develops with the U.S. Department of State, and it contains the outlined objectives of the US Government and the strategic framework within the national development plan of that particular country.', 'USAID’s funding priorities primarily come from this CDCS document and therefore this can be certainly helpful for organizations in predicting the U.S. government funding in upcoming funding cycles.

Some of the criteria may include technical expertise, staffing, experience and capabilities, and past projects and successes.', 'Solicitations will include a point/s of contact at USAID and timelines for submitting your enquiries, if any. If any aspect is not clear, ask your questions well in time, in writing, and in a concise and clear manner.', 'It is important to make sure your application stands out from those of the competitors. For this, demonstrating your strengths as an organization that is expert in the domain and well equipped in terms of programmatic, financial and overall transparency, accountability and responsibility.', 'Some other obvious things to keep in mind are:', 'Note: There are many resources available online with comprehensive information about working with the USAID. The best resource and the most authentic one would be: USAID itself. Here is the link where you can find the complete training and capacity building material by USAID related to its funding processes. You must also explore Funds for NGOs website for detailed resources and sample proposals as well.', 'Some of the prerequisites for applying to USAID for assistance grants are:', 'We understand that programmatic aspects are directly linked with the budgetary items/ cost implications. Therefore, when you prepare your proposal or application that will outline your programmatic approach, you need to ask yourself certain basic cost related questions. For example:', 'All of these questions are important for you to ask yourself as you determine your program’s costs.

What the US government funding pause means for wildlife and conservation,https://www.ifaw.org/international/journal/us-government-funding-pause-wildlife-conservation,"['What the US government funding pause means for wildlife and conservation', 'The recent pause on federal foreign assistance threatens to stall or even dismantle vital conservation and wildlife rescue efforts around the world, ultimately resulting in a direct impact on animals. These investments not only protect critical wildlife and habitats, but they also serve to bolster local economies at the same time, ensuring that people and animals are able to prosper and thrive. Without this essential funding support, the impact will be felt not just by organisations like IFAW, but by communities, front line responders, rangers, conservation partners, and the countless species that depend on these initiatives to survive. The pause in funding is even more alarming in the context of a recent survey of US voters which underscored the firm commitment of the American people to protecting wildlife and broader conservation efforts, with 80% confirming they would support funding for global conservation programs at or above current levels.', 'At IFAW, we’ve always taken pride in being exceptional stewards of taxpayer dollars, ensuring that every federal investment leads to measurable impact. These funds enable conservationists, rescue teams, partner organizations, and local communities to work together in safeguarding the world’s most vulnerable wildlife. This pause, as well as the uncertainty and interruptions at this scale, will risk dismantling years of progress for the very communities and ecosystems these programs were designed to protect.  ', 'Take for example, Kenya’s Tsavo and Amboseli landscapes, home to more than 10,000 African savannah elephants. This area is one of the critical landscapes of IFAW’s Room to Roam initiative that establishes transnational habitat connectivity allowing elephants and wildlife to move safely between protected areas. By literally providing safe access, conflict with local communities is minimized, and wildlife populations can thrive alongside ecotourism and human industry. As a regular visitor to these landscapes myself, I am all too familiar with what’s at stake—for both elephants and people. Without continued funding, these efforts—and the livelihoods of the rangers and community members who protect these landscapes—will be in real jeopardy.', 'Here is another example. The poaching and illegal trade and trafficking of live animals—one of the most urgent crises in wildlife conservation today and one that literally spans much of the globe. IFAW’s CARE project empowers frontline officers in countries like Indonesia, Guyana, and the Republic of the Congo, to disrupt and end criminal trade networks.', 'So far, the program has trained over 200 officers, equipped them with specialized kits for handling confiscated wildlife, and developed humane protocols to ensure that rescued animals are treated with care, enabling many to return to the wild. However, without sustained funding, these critical efforts will face immense setbacks, leaving animals like pangolins and parrots, to name just a few—exceptionally vulnerable to increased levels of trafficking given the absence of protections. ', 'IFAW has continued to diligently map trade routes to identify key players and disrupt trafficking networks while working with communities to understand the social drivers behind this demand. Funding for all these efforts is essential. Without it, biodiverse species, critical habitats and the people who rely on them will sadly face consequences that cannot be undone.', 'These projects are just a few of the many critical pillars of a holistic approach which not only protects wildlife, but which also safeguards community livelihoods, sustains local economies, and serves to advance global biodiversity goals. Time and action are of the essence—and in the absence of funding, there will be little room for progress.', 'As careful stewards of US taxpayer money, IFAW has consistently delivered measurable, impactful outcomes for animals that are supported by an overwhelming majority of the American people. Our projects prove that every federal dollar spent on conservation and wildlife rescue yields remarkable results for wildlife, communities, and economies worldwide. Conservation cannot be put on hold. Law enforcement and customs teams cannot put their operations on hold. There is simply too much at stake.', 'We urge the administration to allow funding to flow during this review period. In doing so, they will ensure that lifesaving work continues uninterrupted, protecting the future of our planet’s most vulnerable wildlife species as well as the people and communities dedicated to saving them.', '', 'Azzedine Downes', 'President & CEO', 'I have never been satisfied with just fighting the good fight.

The pause was intended to give the White House time to review development assistance for efficiency and whether it “aligned” with his “America First” foreign policy. That was troubling enough, but, on Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio took the directive much further, issuing an immediate order to cease not only development aid but nearly all current foreign aid programs around the globe.', '', 'The “stop-work” order in the directive has carveouts for emergency food aid, as well as military assistance to Israel and Egypt. But everything else has been put on ice. Work to prevent current outbreaks of mpox and Marburg virus from spreading beyond Africa, for example.

Combatting the spread of fentanyl across the western hemisphere. Work to support allies and partners in Asia to build resilience in the face of coercive economic practices by China. And military assistance to allies such as Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Poland, and Ukraine.', 'The United States funds all of this, and far more, for just 1 cent of every dollar that Americans pay in taxes each year. Halting it, even just temporarily, will have obvious, predictable results: Children will die. Our national security will erode. America’s alliances will suffer. U.S. partners will be at risk. And America’s enemies will rejoice.', 'In halting foreign assistance spending, the Trump administration has just put America last, while handing a gift to our biggest adversaries, notably China. In fact, Trump may just have conceded great power competition with China before his first week in office was even over – though it is not too late to reverse this spiral.', 'To be clear, every administration has a right and an obligation to review the money America spends around the world. And, having occupied senior positions in overseeing foreign assistance, I can attest that there are better and more efficient ways to manage and distribute it. A serious review of how the United States conducts foreign assistance and how its institutions are aligned to integrate diplomacy, development, and defense is well in order.', '', '', '', 'But there are smart ways to conduct reviews and pursue reform — ways that preserve America’s influence and interests — and then there is the catastrophic path that the Trump administration appears to be pursuing now. The relevant section of the State Department directive, states:', 'Effective immediately, Assistant Secretaries and Senior Bureau Officials shall ensure that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, no new obligations shall be made for foreign assistance until such time as the Secretary shall determine, following a review. For existing foreign assistance awards, contracting officers and grant officers shall immediately issue stop-work orders, consistent with the terms of the relevant award, until such time as the Secretary shall determine, following a review. Decisions whether to continue, modify, or terminate programs will be made following this review.', 'To be clear, there is no such thing as a temporary pause. When an NGO, a small business, or an American company that receives U.S. government funding to implement U.S. foreign assistance is told to stop work, even for 90 days, that means people are fired, expertise is lost, and programs are shut down with no guarantee they’ll start back up, even if they survive the review. It is difficult to exaggerate the reverberating effects of a stop-work order on the ability of such organizations and their programs to continue to function. We know that already, many development assistance partners and international organizations have begun layoffs — including jobs here in the United States — though at least some have reportedly been told by the Trump administration not to publicly talk about those impacts.', 'Nor will the suspension itself save U.S. taxpayers money. The U.S. government knows from prior experience that the cost of suspending and restarting programs like these far exceeds the cost of simply pivoting resources to new priorities.', 'Unless it is reversed, this shocking halt, especially with the ramifications of the stop-work order, may represent an extraordinary setback for the United States.', 'Why? Because foreign assistance, though charitable, isn’t charity. It’s a strategic investment that safeguards America’s most important interests while reflecting its highest values. It protects the United States from threats abroad before they reach America’s shores, from diseases to fentanyl to terrorism. It helps to combat human trafficking, supports democratic elections, and stems the flow of migration, attacking the root causes that force people to flee. It helps secure critical supply chains and builds markets for U.S. exports while creating jobs at home. And in an era of strategic competition, foreign aid wins influence and allies.', 'That’s why foreign assistance has long been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, seen by both parties as crucial to securing America’s national interests. Programs like the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II demonstrated how aid could secure alliances, rebuild shattered countries, and foster free societies and free markets. And prosperity in post-war Europe helped drive America’s own prosperity at home. As Senator Lindsey Graham recently said, when it comes to competing with China in Africa and elsewhere with U.S. foreign aid, “soft power is a critical component of defending America and our values.”', 'Few understand this better than the PRC. Since its inception in 2013, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has poured more than $1 trillion into infrastructure projects across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, bolstering its global influence. For instance, China has financed massive infrastructure projects in Africa, including the construction of railways in Kenya and ports in Djibouti, giving Beijing significant sway over governments there while creating footholds in a region of strategic importance to the United States. The U.S. suspension of foreign aid now threatens to effectively leave the field wide open for China to expand its influence – and, ironically, to paint Beijing as a better and more reliable partner than Washington. ', 'Russia, too, may seek to exploit the vacuum created by the U.S. retreat from foreign assistance. In Central and Latin America, Russia has funded multi-pronged information-manipulation campaigns meant to sow division and spread anti-U.S. sentiment. In Africa, Russia is shipping arms and wreaking havoc in countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, and the Central African Republic, and has targeted U.S. health initiatives.', 'And of course, this State Department pause imperils Ukraine. Not only is military assistance threatened, but so too is incredible work the United States has led to safeguard and rebuild Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and agricultural sector after years of Russian attacks.', 'No matter how the review ends, this suspension of foreign assistance and its stop-work order has already caused lasting damage. And with a decision this reckless, it’s difficult to know whether it was made out of ignorance or intent. But it is not too late for the Trump administration to reverse course — to conduct their review but to lift the stop-work order. Otherwise, the damage of these actions will have generational consequences, both for the communities abroad that the United States is abandoning and for the values and interests of the American people.', 'Editor’s note: This piece is part of the Collection: Just Security’s Coverage of the Trump Administration’s Executive Actions', '', 'DeepSeek: Making Sense of the Reaction—and Overreaction', 'by Michael Froman\nJanuary 31, 2025', '', 'Who Controls the Panama Canal?', 'by Diana Roy\nJanuary 29, 2025', '', 'Securing Ukraine’s Future: What Should the United States Do?', 'by Heidi Crebo-Rediker, Liana Fix, Thomas Graham, Michael O’Hanlon and Paul B.

This swift decision has effectively left many government contractors and global aid providers — including groups that supply HIV/AIDS care, provide child health services, set up education programs, fight food insecurity and counter disinformation in developing nations — struggling to operate or pay their workers.', 'Eight U.S.-based individuals who work in the foreign aid sector, all granted anonymity due to concerns about retaliation from the administration, told POLITICO that the foreign aid freeze had undermined their ability to carry out global aid efforts. Some predict that thousands of foreign aid professionals across the industry may soon be out of work.', '“I can’t even begin to describe how cataclysmic it is, everyone is furloughing or laying off staff,” said one person. “It’s almost 5,000 people, and it’s just starting.”', 'The U.S. is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance globally, deploying billions of dollars through multiple agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. The majority of USAID’s funds are awarded competitively through contracts, grants or cooperative agreements with international development groups and private federal contractors.', 'These organizations often pay out of pocket to support their missions abroad and are reimbursed by the federal government. But a break in federal funding for these critical programs has left many organizations in crisis mode.', 'It may take months or years for some of these federal contractors and NGOs to recover, while others do not have enough funding to survive the 90-day freeze.', '“We’re currently looking at the possibility of many hundreds of seasoned professionals in the humanitarian and development and human rights field going completely out of business,” said a senior executive for an aid group.', 'One person who spoke to POLITICO said their group had not received federal funding for more than a month. Another individual said they expected multiple non-governmental organizations to declare bankruptcy this week. A third blamed what they said was the “30-day world” of development, where the organizations are paid out by the federal government month to month. If that lapses, funds run out fast, making the situation urgent.', '“Every company has lost so much now as a result of offering these furloughs,” one person who works in the industry said. “Even if they start back up say two months from now, there’s likely going to be very few implementations … they will have no more staff.”', 'Another person who works for a USAID contractor said that looking at their projects and budgets, there was no way to sustain themselves for “even a fraction” of the 90-day pause period. “It’s not a pause if there are no pieces to be picked up when you want to resume. It would be like pausing feeding your dog for 90 days.”', 'Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver allowing “life-saving humanitarian assistance” to continue, though the definition of that assistance remains vague. One person who spoke with POLITICO said the funds from that waiver program had not yet begun to flow, and the stop work order was still in place.', 'A State Department spokesperson said via email that some salaries and administrative expenses, including travel for U.S. direct-hire staff conducting ongoing programs, will be allowed to continue under waivers. “Staff have been given a template for waiver requests,” the spokesperson said.', 'The spokesperson underlined the purpose of the aid freeze was to ensure it’s aligned with the America First foreign policy agenda. “For far too long, the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy have not been aligned with American interests, and in many cases, antithetical to American values,” the spokesperson wrote. “They serve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.”', 'USAID did not respond to a request for comment.', 'A State Department official clarified in a memo Saturday which parts of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — which delivers HIV treatment for millions of people, mostly in Africa — were covered. But Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, wrote Monday on the social platform X that he was told “drugs are still being held at clinics in Africa.” Cassidy asked for that to be reversed.', 'This crisis is likely to intensify as the Trump administration makes moves to fold USAID into the State Department, which could further complicate how funding for these groups is decided and distributed.', 'Some influential Republicans support the idea of folding USAID into the State Department and welcome a mass restructuring across the industry. Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that he wasn’t concerned about the layoffs “because of the grift that has been working on to the American taxpayer, the American worker.”', 'Mast said only between 10 to 30 percent of the money USAID handled was ultimately going to aid and that he’s working with Rubio “to make sure there’s the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies.” Researchers dispute the claim that such a low percentage of USAID funding reaches its intended beneficiaries.', 'Some of these anticipated layoffs have already begun. According to an email obtained by POLITICO, early last week development group Credence Management Solutions sent formal emails to contractors in its global health bureau laying off around 400 employees.', 'The CEO of DT Global, one of the world’s leading development contractors, reportedly told employees last week that 2,000 to 3,000 positions would likely be eliminated in the sector the first week of February. Both Credence Management Solutions and DT Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'A director at a leading USAID contractor who spoke with POLITICO said that more than two-thirds of their company would be furloughed by the end of the week, describing the future of the sector as “bleak at best.”', '“This is starting to look like an industry crash,” a different person in the aid sector said.', 'In addition to companies facing crisis, individuals who work in foreign aid in Washington say the job market is about to be oversaturated with thousands of newly unemployed people with no clear path forward. One person who spoke with POLITICO had been due to begin a job in the foreign aid space but had their offer rescinded because the job no longer exists.', '“We’re all flooding the next-door neighbor sectors, which cannot possibly absorb all of us,” the person said. “Even though we know we’re each other’s competitors, there is still a community that I hope we’ll maintain.”', 'In an interview for “The Megyn Kelly Show” last week, Rubio said that the aid pause was meant to provide the federal government with time to review existing contracts. He noted that the funds should “be a tool that we use to advance the national interest,” and asserted that the U.S. government “is not a charity.”', 'One individual who had worked in the foreign aid space through multiple administrations stressed that while it was typical for there to be a review of contracts at the start of a new administration, the blunt approach the Trump administration is taking goes well beyond what has been done in previous years.', '“Each administration has their own priorities, they take a pause, they reflect, they review, they adjust,” the person said. “What is damaging is the fact that it was so abrupt and unequivocal.”', '“It’s very challenging to have a reform conversation when you’re in the middle of shutting everything down,” another person added.', 'The groups affected are those across the spectrum, including the International Republican Institute, which counts Republican senators on its board and carries out pro-democracy work abroad. IRI President Daniel Twining said in a statement to POLITICO that he believes a review of foreign aid funding is “quite in order,” but that “we can only hope that the review happens expeditiously, because our adversaries aren’t pausing, and they would relish in seeing [foreign assistance] go away.”', 'As the U.S. waffles on foreign assistance, other nations may be waiting to fill the voids created. Specifically, the Chinese government has pursued its “Belt and Road Initiative” for the past decade to build infrastructure in developing nations around the world — particularly in Latin America and Africa — and exert political influence.', 'Some lawmakers are also particularly worried about this prospect. The top Democrats on the House and Senate committees with oversight of the State Department and of USAID on Friday sent a letter to the agency making clear their strong concerns around the funding pause.', '“Not only will lives be lost, but we are also ceding ground to China, damaging our standing in the world at a time of heightened geopolitical competition,” the lawmakers wrote.', 'Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tweeted Saturday that “China will fill the void” in developing nations, which will “ONLY be able to rely on China for help.”', 'Beyond giving Beijing and other adversarial nations an opening, the funding freeze also risks undermining the U.S.’ standing around the world as a reliable development partner. The withdrawal of U.S. funding, often a key way that the nation builds trust and relationships abroad, could knock the nation’s public diplomacy efforts.', 'In some cases, this involves direct assistance to other governments, helping to secure the U.S. by maintaining allies in times of peace. That method looks set to disappear.', '“We have spent more than 50 years building up goodwill around the world, because it’s the right thing to do, and it protects our national security,” a person in the foreign aid sector said. “It costs a whole lot less to feed someone than it does to kill someone.”', 'Holly Otterbein contributed to this report.', '', '© 2025 POLITICO LLC']"

The worst thing Trump has done so far,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/397992/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-pepfar-musk-doge,"['When news breaks, you need to understand what matters — and what to do about it. At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can’t do it on our own.', 'We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Tens of thousands of people will die if Trump’s war on USAID continues.', 'by Dylan Matthews', 'About two and a half months ago, I wrote a piece about what foreign aid might look like in the second Trump term. Reading that piece now feels bizarre.', 'I thought that Trump’s second term would look much like his first: lots of proposals to cut foreign aid funding, pushed back on by Republicans in Congress who support foreign aid programs (often for geostrategic or religious reasons), resulting in not much change from the Biden years.', 'At the end I included this nugget:', 'If Trump fully usurps the power of the purse from Congress, then any hope for foreign aid premised on the bipartisan congressional coalition behind foreign aid spending becomes hollow. Trump could simply overrule the Lindsey Grahams and Mario Diaz-Balarts of the world. Then we’d be in an incredibly dark reality indeed.', 'We are now in that incredibly dark reality. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) became one of the first targets of the Trump administration, starting with an Inauguration Day executive order freezing aid programs for 90 days. This was impoundment in action, the usurpation of the power of the purse from Congress. Pushback from congressional champions of foreign aid like Graham and Diaz-Balart became formally irrelevant.', 'Then senior career staff at the agency were purged, and contractors (responsible for a huge share of the agency’s funding) pushed out en masse. Multiple USAID sources have told me that contractors abroad have lost access to Scry Panic, a piece of agency software used to broadcast that a contractor or staffer is in extreme danger. Without it, they could be kidnapped or attacked with no way of seeking USAID help.', 'Now, Elon Musk and his DOGE team appear to be preparing for the agency to dissolve entirely, subsumed by the State Department and shrunk to a fraction of its size. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk told followers on X, adding on a late-night X Spaces discussion that he and Trump agreed it had to go.', 'To be clear, very little if any of this is legal. The president cannot legally refuse to spend money that Congress has directed the government to spend. USAID has been authorized by congressional statutes that the president is obliged to uphold. He cannot legally dissolve it or subsume it into the State Department on his own. This is all one massive, brazen lawbreaking act after another, probably undertaken as a trial run before bringing the hatchet down on other federal agencies.', 'But as lawbreaking goes, it may be a canny example. Foreign aid has never been popular, and while some of that is perhaps due to misunderstandings of what “foreign aid” means, most Americans just generally don’t like helping people in other countries. (It doesn’t help that past surveys have shown that the average American thinks the US spends a quarter or more of its total budget on foreign aid — the real figure is less than 1 percent.)', 'A poll last year found that by a 51 to 33 percent margin, Americans thought the US should provide less economic aid to countries abroad. If Musk and Trump wanted to move fast and break stuff without a lot of opposition, they picked the right set of stuff to break first.', 'But amid a spree of groundless and deranged insinuations from Musk that the agency is little more than a pit of corruption, it’s important to remember the extremely important work the agency does (or did).', 'Doing it full justice would require more time than we have, but here are a few small examples of how USAID has saved millions of lives to date, which will hopefully serve as a warning of the millions who will die unnecessarily if Trump and Musk succeed in dismembering the agency.', 'One of the most shocking details to date about the USAID purge is the revelation that two-thirds of the staff of the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) had been let go as part of the mass firings of contractors taking place.', 'PMI, created by former President George W. Bush and administered by USAID, is the single biggest donor to anti-malaria efforts worldwide, and one of the cornerstones of American diplomacy in Africa, where the disease is most brutal.', 'How many lives does this save? The program’s most recent report states that in 2023, PMI (with a total budget of $777 million) provided 36.8 million insecticidal bednets and 48 million doses of seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), a pill-based method for preventing malaria.', 'The group I trust most for evaluating the effects of these interventions is GiveWell. Its most recent analysis finds that, while impacts vary across countries, a child’s life is saved for roughly every 1,400 bednets distributed. That implies that the 36.8 million bednets distributed by PMI saved over 26,200 children’s lives. Not bad for a program that amounts to a rounding error in the federal budget as a whole.', 'What about SMC pills? Here, it seems to take about 2,000 doses of SMC to save a life. That implies that the 48 million doses funded by PMI saved about 24,000 lives.', 'PMI is just a small part of the global health bureau at USAID, which is itself only one part of the agency’s work — but even this small part is likely saving 50,000 lives or more every single year. Is this really where we want to cut?', 'PEPFAR, the Bush-created program combating HIV/AIDS abroad, is perhaps America’s single most famous foreign aid program, and one to which the Trump team has been forced to offer grudging concessions during its assault on USAID.', 'Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed a waiver exempting the program from the 90-day pause on foreign aid, but it’s unclear how this can be implemented, given how much Rubio and company have gutted the USAID staff who are required to actually execute such a waiver and make funds available. As of last Friday, a prior attempt at a waiver for life-saving aid wasn’t actually resulting in any aid becoming available.', 'In any case, let’s talk about how effective PEPFAR has been. The main study here is, ironically, co-authored by Jay Bhattacharya, Trump’s appointee to lead the National Institutes of Health. The paper, which has been replicated, finds that PEPFAR reduced all-cause mortality among adults in partner countries between 2004 and 2008, preventing 740,914 total deaths over those five years. That implies, conservatively, well over a million lives saved over the whole life of the program, which is now over 20 years old.', 'The Trump team mercifully seems to realize that they went too far in going after PEPFAR. The problem is that much of USAID funds programs that cost-effectively save lives, programs that have yet to be spared from cuts.', 'One of USAID’s crown jewels is Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) a small unit founded in 2010 that lets nonprofits and others pilot new programs, or scale up ones that have already proven effective. It responds to applications in weeks, compared to months in conventional USAID programs, and has had an astounding track record of success.', 'A 2021 paper by Nobel-winning economist Michael Kremer (who co-founded DIV), DIV’s now-leader Sasha Gallant, and economists Olga Rostapshova and Milan Thomas estimated that the $19.2 million in investments DIV made in its first three years generated at least $281 million in social benefits, like lives saved by an intervention, for an annual social rate of return above 143 percent.', 'That figure is not just high; it’s basically unheard of. And while some of the authors are hardly independent of the agency they’re evaluating, they use fairly conservative methods throughout, which gives me some confidence that the returns really are substantial.', 'One of its biggest successes was the program Dispensers for Clean Water, which provides chlorinated water dispensers. Chlorine is an incredibly cost-effective way to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites that are fairly common in other water sources in poor countries, and which contribute to the deaths of an estimated 1.4 million people a year. The program, a randomized trial found, was so effective that after four years, child mortality in treated villages fell by 63 percent.', 'That is the kind of program that USAID funds.', 'Are there USAID programs that are relatively less effective, or wasteful? Almost certainly. That’s why the agency has an inspector general and the Government Accountability Office to audit it and point out where it’s falling short.', 'What Musk and Trump are doing to USAID isn’t a reasonable audit. They’re doing a slash-and-burn attack that is certain to destroy programs that have saved millions of lives. It’s a horrific crime.', 'YOU’VE READ 2 ARTICLES IN THE LAST MONTH', ""Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country."", 'Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.
