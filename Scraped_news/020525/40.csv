Hear Me Out: I Think Fantastic Four's First Trailer Has A Sneaky Captain America Reference (Even If Reed Richards Might Call It A Stretch),https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/hear-think-fantastic-fours-first-153304305.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.', 'The slate of upcoming Marvel movies looks so much more…well…fantastic now that The Fantastic Four: The First Steps is just a two short seasons away from hitting theaters. The excitement hit fever-pitch heights with the release of the blockbuster’s first trailer and that Galactus sneak peek. There’s a lot to pay attention to, from the alternate 1960s timeline to Ebon Moss-Bacharach’s stellar CGI look as The Thing, and it wouldn’t be a Marvel movie without at least one easter egg to mull over.', 'In the case of the Fantastic Four’s latest (first) outing, I believe there’s a low-key reference to Steve Rogers’ fate in the decades after the events of the earliest film in the MCU timeline, Captain America: The First Avenger. But tell me, am I making too much of a leap here with this assumption?', ""In the middle of the trailer, Vanessa Kirby's Sue Storm is shown mid-brawl while standing down a battle-torn street. There's something truly horrifying about seeing a giant concrete support split apart like a tree, and I would not want to be standing under it during timber time."", 'In any case, it\'s not Sue so much as the theater marquee behind her that caught my eye, as it\'s advertising a film called ""Subzero Intel"", which is not an actual movie that was ever produced within real-world Hollywood. And as far as I can tell, it also isn\'t a direct reference to anything aleady existing within the MCU. So unless this is a sequel to a Mortal Kombat spinoff about its iciest fighter, I\'m refocusing my sights on Chris Evans\' debut as an Avenger.', 'Because as everyone reading this no doubt remembers, Captain America saving the day in The First Avenger resulted in him flying the HYDRA bomber Valkyrie into icy waters near Greenland, where he was believed to be dead as he remained frozen and undiscovered for decades. (At least everyone but in-universe filmmaker ""Aiden Power."") So if it isn\'t already clear as hell, I think that the Subzero Intel of the title is talking about Cap and the HYDRA plane.', 'Though Aiden Power isn\'t a specific reference to any other Marvel characters, I have zero issues with believing that name is a mini-reference to the Super Soldier Serum, because it\'s an ""aid in power,"" or ""aiding power."" Either way, it\'s a pun I want to put my faith in.', 'The title could technically also be a sub-reference to the fact that Chris Evans\' first big superhero role was as Johnny ""Human Torch"" Storm in the first two Fantastic Four films that were produced years before the MCU came into existence. Fire and ice, yeah?', ""Considering this Sue Storm moment appears to be taking place still within the throwback 1960s setting (or even the '70s), this whole idea almost has to fall back on someone in-universe making a movie about Steve Rogers, presumably holding him up as an American hero. Which kind of taps into The Boys' own MCU-parodying multiverse of films. The fact that other MCU movies don't address Avengers-worship in other forms of media, perhaps Subzero Intel was just a one-off."", 'Check out the full Fantastic Four: First Steps trailer below to see everything else that director Matt Shakman & Co. are bringing to fans this summer.', ""The Fantastic Four: The First Steps will hit theaters on July 25, 2025. Whether or not it will be part of a double feature alongside new Phase 6 feature Subzero Intel is anyone's guess.

They let cousin cook in The Fantastic Four teaser trailer,https://www.avclub.com/the-fantastic-four-teaser-trailer-marvel,"['Ebon Moss-Bachrach? Hanging out in a fictional, on-screen kitchen? That’s a likely place for him to be—except this time he’s not doing it as everyone’s favorite cousin, The Bear‘s Richie, he’s doing it as Ben Grimm. Maybe The Fantastic Four teaser introduced him in “yes chef” mode so fans could recognize him under the guise of The Thing. Or maybe it’s just a comical image, to see this big, otherworldly sort of being delicately tasting a sauce on the tip of his finger. Either way, it’s our first introduction to this new iteration of the character ahead of the official entry of The Fantastic Four: First Steps into the Marvel Cinematic Universe on July 25. ', 'Much like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, which skipped Spidey’s origin story, The Fantastic Four teaser wisely begins in medias res when the team (sorry, the family) has already gotten their powers. This is a different MCU than we’ve ever seen before—one that appears to be set not only in a different time but also a different universe. Instead of the Avengers Tower, this version of New York has the Baxter Building. And instead of a world that looks quite similar to our own, this one has a distinctly Jetsons-esque flavor to it. In addition to our first look at The Thing, the teaser also introduces us to the new Reed Richards, a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm, a.k.a. Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby), and Johnny Storm, a.k.a. Human Torch (Joseph Quinn).

Sure, it would have been awesome to catch a full glimpse of our new team of heroes going head-to-massive-head with the Devourer of Worlds, or maybe even a snippet of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Joseph Quinn) getting blown away by Ineson\'s world-rattling rasp. However, let\'s never forget that it could have been a whole lot worse. We might have been met with yet another giant Thanos-colored fart pretending to be one of the most terrifying entities in the universe.', 'Thankfully, fans can rest easy knowing we won\'t see a repeat of Galactus being presented as giant smog like in ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.""

We just hope he avoids the mistakes that the last iteration of Galactus faced back in 2007 in what remains one of the best but frustrating ""Fantastic Four"" movies to date.', '', 'It\'s hard enough being the largest person in the room, so imagine the struggle of being the biggest one in a solar system. That\'s the challenge the creative forces behind ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" faced when they dared to introduce Galactus into a franchise that swiftly ended. While there was no doubt that the combined effort of Doug Jones\' physical presence and Laurence Fishburne\'s voice as the Silver Surfer worked wonderfully in the film (that chase scene between him and Chris Evans\' Human Torch still hits), it\'s following the arrival of Norrin Radd\'s big boss that things fall apart.', 'In an interview with ComicBook, the director of the 2007 sequel, Tim Story, admitted that anxious studio heads were responsible for Galactus\' gassiness instead of the original character design. ""The ones in charge were afraid of what that could be because, you have to remember, even Marvel has gone through quite cleverly and successfully introduced us to superheroes being in space, and at the time that was never dealt with,"" Story recalled. ""So ... [the character] being from space, there were those in charge who weren\'t ready for what that could be."" Mistakes were made, and massive entities were anything but world-ending. But while it certainly seems like Galactus in the new ""Fantastic Four"" movie might be on a course correction, there are still elements from the MCU that need to be considered.', '', 'While Galactus might be the new big guy in the galaxy, we can\'t forget that the MCU has already had a close encounter with some pretty huge characters in ""Eternals"" when the Celestials visited Earth. With no noticeable facial features, these god-like beings were present but simply not threatening enough, and in the MCU, one of them has been sticking out of the planet for the last four years. With that in mind, along with the interstellar fog from the previous take on the Fantastic Four, a lot is riding on this Galactus being a memorable big bad guy worth fearing. The good news is they\'ve found the perfect talent to bring a voice to that terror.', 'Ralph Ineson might not have been heard in the all-new trailer, but you\'ve probably had a good listen to his unmistakable tone over the past few years. Appearing in ""Nosferatu,"" ""The First Omen,"" and heard grumbling his way through ""The Green Knight,"" Ineson has a pitch so low it could attract large schools of marine life. This almost ethereal rumble will make Galactus the terrifying presence he so desperately needs to be and a character that is rightfully larger than life as we know it.

The four friends begin as regular astronauts exploring space, but return to Earth with super powers and form one of the most iconic teams in Marvel history.', 'Ralph Ineson plays the colossal villain Galactus, who has the power devour worlds. He appears at the end of the trailer and towers over Manhattan, which will likely become the first major test for the Fantastic Four. John Malkovich also plays a mystery character who shows up briefly; it’s unknown who he is playing, but fans already have some theories.

We don’t get a good look at his elastic powers, but we get an idea of his genius as he writes equations furiously on a chalkboard.', 'Vanessa Kirby’s Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman, can turn invisible and use her powers to create powerful force fields. She and Reed are the heart of the team, and they share a passionate kiss in the trailer.', 'Joseph Quinn is Johnny Storm, Sue’s hotheaded brother and the flying, fiery Human Torch. He can burst into flames and take flight instantly, which is usually accompanied by his catchphrase “Flame on!” In the trailer, he flies quickly around Manhattan and soars so high that he can look down at Earth.', 'Ebon Moss-Bachrach is Ben Grimm, aka the rocky monstrosity The Thing. Ben is one of Reed’s oldest friends and a talented pilot who flies the group into space when they get their powers. He has super strength, but it comes at a cost as he frightens most onlookers due to his appearance. Ben keeps his sense of humor, though, and is known for his catchphrase “It’s clobberin’ time!”', 'Ralph Ineson voices Galactus, a gigantic, world-devouring being from space that is one of the primary villains for the Fantastic Four and the entire Marvel universe. He looms large over the Statue of Liberty in the trailer and could spell disaster for the superheroes. Galactus is always joined by the flying Silver Surfer, his celestial, surfboard-riding herald who is played by Julia Garner in the movie.', 'A bearded John Malkovich appears briefly in the trailer, but it’s unknown who he’s playing. Fans have speculated he may be playing Ivan Kragoff, a villain known as the Red Ghost who fights the Fantastic Four in the comics. Red Ghost is a Soviet scientist who replicates the team’s space accident and gains the ability to turn intangible. He also creates a team of Super Apes who have similar powers to the Fantastic Four. Malkovich certainly looks the part, but he could be playing another mystery character.', 'Reed creates the adorable robot H.E.R.B.I.E., which stands for Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-Type, Integrated Electronics. It functions as an assistant and apparently a decent cook in the Baxter Building.', 'Due to his appearance, Ben, aka The Thing, puts on a trench coat and hat so he doesn’t scare anyone who looks his way. In the comics, Ben struggles the most with his newfound powers and finds it hard to connect with people. He does, however, find love with a blind sculptor named Alicia Masters, who many fans have speculated will be played by Natasha Lyonne in the movie.', 'The Fantastic Four reside in the Baxter Building, a skyscraper that towers over Manhattan and serves as the headquarters for the team. It’s another iconic, tall building in the Marvel universe, alongside Avengers Tower.', 'While it’s not confirmed that the retro, blue car seen in the trailer is actually the Fantasticar, the color alone lends some credibility to the theory — plus there’s a 4 logo on the front of it. In the comics, the Fantasticar is a hovering, four-seated vehicle that the team travels around in, and it made a brief cameo in last year’s “Deadpool & Wolverine.”', 'Before they got their powers, Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny were regular astronauts who traveled to space to explore the far reaches of the galaxy.

Its first trailer is now finally with us, and we gotta say it's a corker."", ""With a distinct marketing campaign dripping in Space Race nostalgia, the new take on Marvel's First Family started on the right foot. Another plus was the recruitment of the director behind WandaVision, Matt Shakman, to captain the ship after Jon Watts left the project to focus on Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. While we've yet to see how the script and final edit turn out, this first look at the blockbuster is filling us with a lot of confidence."", ""This 'official teaser' is a short but exciting one that jumps right into the action and the gist of these characters. Family drama and the aftermath of the changes each member went through during a trip to outer space take priority in this iteration, and the massive retrofuturist sets and costume design are simply dashing. Of course, the preview is light on actual plot at this stage, but it does a great job of selling us on the key characters (especially Ben Grimm aka The Thing), their dynamics, and more importantly, their origins and powers without overdoing the story that almost everyone knows by now. Reed Richards' weird stretchy abilities are being kept in the dark for now, however."", '', ""Fans are expecting the film to tie into Avengers: Doomsday, which will be spearheaded by Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom, for obvious reasons, but it remains to be seen how that will play out. As a reminder, the Earth we'll see in this movie isn't part of the 616 continuity that's been the MCU's 'Sacred Timeline' so far, so the First Family will have to hop between universes to meet up with the bulk of the Marvel heroes we know and love."", ""The packed main cast should also attract lots of casual moviegoers, as Disney and Marvel have clearly gone all out with the project. It includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm aka The Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm aka The Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm aka The Thing. They're joined by Julia Garner as one Silver Surfer and Ralph Ineson as Galactus, among others.

It's brief, doesn't tell you much of anything plot wise and gives you a good peek at some general vibes of the movie. Way too many trailers nowadays are these four minute long sagas that essentially summarize the entire movie to the point of spoiling it and it pisses me off. On top of that, I like what I saw here! The effects look good, which is a relief, I like the pre-war Fallout type setting and the powers that we did see looked cool. Could this be the return to glory that the MCU has been seeking? "", ""On the backend, there is a lot to be excited for (At least on paper). The cast is loaded with really talented stars from top-to-bottom  (despite me still not agreeing with the casting of Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm) but what really interests me is the team around them. Matt Shakman is a damn good director. In addition to making 'Wandavision', this is the guy responsible for directing 43 episodes in the heights of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'. The score was composed by one of the best in the game, Michael Giacchino (The Incredibles). Lastly, it has a solid writing crew including Josh Friedman (Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Avatar 2). This is a good group! "", ""All this praise aside, I'll say what the voice in the back of my head is telling me: Marvel has fooled us with trailers before. Not just once, by the way. So, instead of being blindly optimistic like I might have been a few years ago, I'm hesitant. Coins aren't the only place you can get rug pulled. I'm just hoping this can help right the ship and get the franchise back on track, espeically since there aren't many with high hopes for 'Captain America: Brave New World' or 'Thunderbolts'.

Located in Manhattan in New York City, the office building was first introduced back in the third issue of Fantastic Four in the '60s and its five upper floors house the Fantastic Four's headquarters. It's where the team have dinner together every week, Storm explains."", '', ""The big fella has arrived! We have our first glimpse at what Galactus will look like in the MCU, and he's huge. Ralph Ineson's cosmic entity consumes planets to sustain himself, so it's probably predictable that he was going to be pretty big, but in the final moments of the trailer, we see the full scale of the character.

If you look just over his left shoulder, you can see a diagram that appears to show a wormhole that takes its user from one place to an 'exit'. Although it's hard to make out, the words 'Another universe?' can be glimpsed under the drawing."", ""It's still early days yet, but there are a couple of possibilities stemming from this detail: One, Reed might already be aware of the existence of the multiverse (Fantastic Four is set in the 1960s in a universe outside of the Sacred Timeline, so that matches up) or two, the impending threat of the world-eating Galactus has Reed searching for any way out of his universe – a cataclysmic worst-case scenario."", ""In either case, that should neatly answer how the Fantastic Four find themselves in the MCU before the next Avengers movies, which they've already been confirmed to appear in."", '', ""Although we've known for some time that H.E.R.B.I.E. would be a part of the team, this is the first time we've seen him in live-action proper.

The New New Fantastic Four,https://www.laineygossip.com/kitschy-midcentury-style-teaser-for-marvel-fantastic-four-first-steps-is-cute-but-what-is-the-hook/80597,"['I was expecting it during the Super Bowl, but Marvel just dropped the first teaser for Fantastic Four: First Steps, the film more than any other they hope will get the good ship SS Total Box Office Dominance back on track. ', 'They did a whole ass live launch event with the cast this morning, giving us our first look at the new new Fantastic Four. The teaser, with its kitschy midcentury style and borderline cheesy emphasis on family is…cute.', 'Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center to present â€˜THE FANTASTIC FOUR: FIRST STEPSâ€™ trailer pic.twitter.com/13ZQ24g2tm', 'I do genuinely love the aesthetic. Setting this film in the 1960s was the right call, it immediately doesn’t look like any other superhero movie in recent memory, let alone Marvel movie. And the cast looks strong, led by Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm. I especially like how tactile Ben Grimm looks as The Thing. He actually looks like a talking pile of rocks, it’s immediately the best The Thing has ever looked on film (they used a practical suit at least part of the time). ', 'But I’m not like…bowled over. Mainly because I have no sense of the stakes. Oh, New York is in trouble? When isn’t it? I think the Superman trailer did a better job telling me up front what is at stake, from Clark’s actual, physical health, to his budding love for Lois Lane, and THEN showing me imperiled people for Superman to save. And that is slightly a problem for Fantastic Four, because these two films open two weeks apart in July. Maybe it will turn into a Barbenheimer situation, and they’ll both feed the other’s box office, but comic book movie fans are not usually that, er, cooperative. ', 'Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate this teaser. The Thing looks great, Johnny Storm’s “flame on” looks great, Sue Storm’s invisibility looks the best. That’s another power set that has never really looked good on film, used for cheap, body-ogling jokes in the 2000s films, and just plain badly realized in the disastrous 2015 Fant4stic Four. Here, Sue’s invisibility power actually looks quite beautiful, the little we get to see of it. There is obviously a lot of care and thought put into this film, how everything should look and feel, and I do like the emphasis on family, because the Fantastic Four are the “first family of Marvel”, and that’s never really translated on screen, either.', 'Which is why, maybe, this teaser doesn’t have to push so hard. Fans WANT this to work, they have always wanted a viable cinematic Fantastic Four. The bar is so low, if the movie just doesn’t suck, it’s a win. (Superman is more or less in the same boat.) And it doesn’t look sucky, I’m just not sure what the hook is besides “finally, we may have gotten this right”. That’s no small thing given how bad Fantastic Four movies have been in the past, but it’s also not enough. Not in the long run. It works for a teaser, to show us how good this movie looks, how good the cast looks, and gives a sense that maybe this time it’s right. ', 'But eventually, I’m going to want a little bit more than just power displays and fire raining down on Manhattan (when doesn’t it?). I do think, though, if Marvel can deliver a decent film, it will go a long way to restoring their reputation with audiences. People just want to see good movies, if you give them a good Fantastic Four movie, they’ll go nuts. And I’m hopeful that beyond the production and character design, there’s a good story here, good enough to not only give the Fantastic Four their cinematic due, but to anchor Marvel into their next phase and beyond the OG Avengers. When it comes to the Fantastic Four, the hunger for good movies has been there all along, but we’ve never been served a full meal.

The 1-minute and 37-second clip shares a glimpse of the titular heroes and has captivated fans with its retro aesthetic. While fans seemed impressed with the teaser trailer overall, many conveyed their disappointment with the Thing’s voice.', 'Popular scooper My Time To Shine Hello shared snaps of Bachrach’s The Thing from the teaser on X (formerly Twitter) and asked, “What do you think about The Thing’s design?” In reply, a user replied that they liked the design but “the animation is weird tho,” and added, “also wished the voice was deeper.”', 'https://twitter.com/Nephil_Him/status/1886769036882591835', 'Another user named SyncereX8 replied to the original post and shared similar sentiments about the Thing’s voice and wrote, “Design is great, kinda wanted a little deeper on the voice.

What Universe Does The Fantastic Four: First Steps Take Place In?,https://www.ign.com/articles/what-universe-does-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-take-place-in,"['After some San Diego Comic-Con early preview footage, fun teaser imagery, and other sneak peeks, the first actual teaser trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps has arrived.', '', 'Fantastic Four is the 37th (!) MCU movie, which is a bit ironic, considering the FF are often called “Marvel’s First Family” because 1961’s Fantastic Four #1 marked the official launch of Marvel Comics – a re-naming of a company that had been around since 1939 – and the kick-off of a massive run of successful superhero debuts. But with the Fantastic Four movie rights finally back with Marvel Studios, following multiple FF films from 20th Century Fox, we at last have the gang that started it all in the MCU! …Except that sure doesn’t look like the MCU?', 'As teased by those earlier images, the First Steps teaser fully reveals the 1960s-inspired, retro- futuristic world the film is set in. Clearly this isn’t the prime MCU (or “Sacred Timeline,” to use TVA terminology) we’ve been following for 17 years now, since that universe pretty much looks like our own, just with a lot more superhero battles. As with last year’s Deadpool & Wolverine, we’ve got a new MCU film not really set within the MCU - this one introducing an entirely new universe. We’re not sure what year it is for the First Steps gang, but it’s very likely it’s simply 2025 or thereabouts, just in a reality where the visual style has stayed firmly rooted in what we’d consider the past.', 'In the teaser we see Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby) showing a guest around their kitchen, which boasts a midcentury modern look that would have been right at home in the era when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced the Fantastic Four. Despite the 1960s also introducing Marvel mainstays like Spider-Man, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Daredevil and the X-Men, there’s always been something more innately throwback about the FF, thanks to many elements from the original comics. This included going so big (often literally) on Reed’s incredible inventions, the wholesome family element of this team, and the idea that they were local celebrities, much of which is referenced in the teaser.', 'This is probably why the idea of a period piece Fantastic Four movie has always sounded appealing - and indeed was the approach director Peyton Reed, eventual director of Ant-Man, and screenwriter Mark Frost (co-creator of Twin Peaks) were going to take with the FF when Reed was going to direct the film back in the early 2000s. At this point, the history of the MCU is way too established to say the Fantastic Four were running around New York as celebrity superheroes in the 1960s, but the multiverse approach allows the film to still maintain this feeling.', 'First Steps’ director, Matt Shakman, already has some great experience doing this kind of throwback style within the MCU, having directed every episode of the TV-era-jumping WandaVision.', 'Of course, as optimistic and cheerful as the Fantastic Four can be, that doesn’t mean it’s devoid of any angst, which the teaser hints at via the moment where Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) sadly looks at footage of himself before he was transformed, silently lamenting his inability to change back to human - a core aspect of the character’s plight in the source material.', 'While the primary aesthetic of The Fantastic Four: First Steps is inspired by the 1960s, a couple of elements in the teaser come from later eras in the team’s history.', 'Among a small group that includes the likes of Harley Quinn and Firestar, the helpful robot H.E.R.B.I.E. stands out as a comic book character originally created not for the comics themselves, but for a previous adaptation - specifically the late 1970s animated series, The New Fantastic Four. But while there was probably some R2-D2 influence at work when H.E.R.B.I.E. debuted in the wake of Star Wars, the idea of a cute robot buddy certainly works for the 1960s as well.', 'And then there’s the Fantastic Four costumes in the film. The FF have almost always worn some variation of a blue team uniform, though there have been many redesigns over the years. The classic 1960s suits were dark blue with black trim, before John Byrne gave the team their biggest overhaul to date in the 1980s, with larger white trim replacing the black.', 'It’s clearly the Byrne uniforms the First Steps costumes are most inspired by, albeit with some tweaks, including the white stripes going down the arms of the costumes for The Thing and Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn), while the Invisible Woman uniform is closest to the exact Byrne look. Here though, the entire team is wearing a much brighter blue than in the comics, reflecting the film’s cheerful, upbeat vibe.', 'The teaser indicates that the Fantastic Four are already very well known during the film, rather than this being a straightforward origin story, as we see not just their fame but also hear Reed say “Before we went up the first time” when mentioning the mission to space that gave them their powers - clearly indicating they have been back to space since. This very much matches the FF’s comic book adventures, which frequently have them traveling to other worlds, whether they be via spaceships or dimension-hopping.', 'And of course we know they’ll be facing a decidedly big threat from the space in First Steps via Galactus (played by Ralph Ineson), a giant cosmic entity who literally consumes worlds. The one previous live-action depiction of Galactus, in 2007’s Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, infamously turned Galactus into a cloud rather than a giant human-like alien, so seeing that distinct helmet of the character here is a great way to let comic book fans know we’re going to get a more classic Galactus this time.', 'We don’t see the Silver Surfer in the teaser, though we know Julia Garner is playing this universe’s version, who is an alien woman known as Shalla-Bal. However, we do get one shot of John Malkovich, who’s playing a mystery character. There are a couple of possibilities that leap to mind though, including the Red Ghost, a supervillain who has a similar look with long white hair in the comics, albeit with no beard. And then there’s Philip Masters, AKA Puppet Master, the father to the blind Alicia Masters, the longtime love interest to Ben Grimm, the Thing. With both Malkovich and Natasha Lyonne in First Steps in unspecified roles, it feels like they could be playing Philip and Alicia.', 'Though it feels doubtful Robert Downey Jr.’s Doctor Doom will have a large role in the FF movie, it also feels like a rather safe bet that the actor will at least appear in a concluding scene or credits scene to introduce the character before we see him play a huge role in the next two Avengers movies - which are also going to feature the Fantastic Four.', 'The comic book Secret Wars storyline involves different universes colliding, with Doom playing a central role, so it always made sense he’d be a part of that story in the MCU. Presuming we meet him in First Steps, it’s easy enough to establish him as Reed’s rival in brilliance, who for some reason sets out on a path that will take him – and his enemies – across the multiverse.', 'Because obviously the Fantastic Four retro universe is going to somehow cross over eventually with the regular “Sacred Timeline” of the MCU that we all know. If the films follow the comics version of Secret Wars, that may be more of a “crash into” than a “cross over”...', 'And though it’s understandably not getting any of the attention, it is amusing to note that Robert Downey Jr. isn’t the only actor who played a well-established role in the MCU who will now be playing someone else entirely too, as Ebon Moss-Bachrach, playing the Thing here, also played Micro in Season 1 of The Punisher. So while we’re all assuming characters like Peter Parker and the Avengers will gasp seeing Victor Von Doom’s face, how about we get a scene where Frank Castle gasps seeing The Thing change into Ben Grimm?', 'Okay, that’s probably not a priority…', '']"

The 'Fantastic Four' Trailer Is Comic Accurate As Hell (Look at That Thing),https://www.pajiba.com/news/the-fantastic-four-trailer-is-comic-accurate-as-heck.php,"['By Mike Redmond | News | February 4, 2025 |', 'After years of seeming like this thing would go the way of Blade, Marvel has finally launched the first teaser for The Fantastic Four: First Steps, and they’re really spiking the ball on this puppy.', 'Starting at 7 AM, the studio kicked things off with a mock space launch that culminated in the cast appearing in a hangar with some light banter with Angelique Roche, who twice made it a point to say that the film kicks off a “new phase” for Marvel. In other words, we’ve got an MCU that’s looking to shake itself out of a slump.', 'As for the trailer, it plays. Much like Captain America: The First Avenger, the film takes the Fantastic Four back to their roots: The ’60s. The pastiche works, and a crazy comic accurate Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) does a lot of heavy lifting. The second you see him interacting with H.E.R.B.I.E., the vibes kick in. It’s contagious. Not entirely sold on Pedro Pascal yet. Joe Quinn is not bad, but Vanessa Kirby is definitely stellar casting as Sue Storm. She was other-worldly in the launch event, and that didn’t even have special effects!', 'Granted, it’s early and I’m only on my first cup of coffee, but I did not see any signs of Julia Garner’s Silver Surfer. However, the trailer did make it a point to show that fans are going to get an actual Galactus, who isn’t a fart cloud in space. Most importantly, First Steps feels like a full-fledged, self-contained movie, and not just another piece of infinite puzzle even though that’s what it ultimately will be.', 'Anyway, that’s enough dorky jabbering, dive in:', '', '']"

Marvel fans are divided over our first look at The Thing in the Fantastic Four: First Steps trailer,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/marvel-fans-divided-over-first-134741360.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.', 'The first trailer for Fantastic Four: First Steps has finally debuted, after a short teaser dropped for the footage.', ""While the movie looks like a retro-futuristic romp featuring Marvel's First Family, one point in particular has fans debating: the CGI on The Thing. Ebon Moss-Bachrach plays the character, whose real name is Ben Grimm, and we got our first look at him post-transformation in the trailer."", '""Looks amazing for me,"" says one fan, while another is even more excited: ""This is the best The Thing has ever looked and sounded. I actually can\'t believe it. I\'m lost for words on how amazing this all looks.""', 'Others, though, are less convinced: ""Don\'t get me wrong I\'m excited as hell for this movie but the CGI for The Thing doesn\'t look good he looks so animated into the screen to me and not like a person? I can\'t explain it.""', '""The concept feels great but holy shit do they need to work on the animation for The Thing it is so stiff, unnatural and doesn’t match Ebon\'s performance at all,"" says someone else.', 'Then there are some who aren\'t sure yet, but have faith they\'ll be won over when the movie comes out. ""A little uncanny valley but I think it\'ll be tighter by launch. And the uncanny valley is he looks like a statue so when he moves it\'s mind boggling,"" says one person.', '""It\'s very solid. They still have time when the final version will look much better, but he still looks great and very comic book accurate!"" thinks another fan.', ""We won't have long until The Thing appears on the big screen. Fantastic Four: First Steps releases this July 25."", 'Until then, check out our guide to all the upcoming Marvel movies and shows for everything else the MCU has in store, or see our roundup of how to watch the Marvel movies in order to plan a marathon.']"

'Fantastic Four' Trailer Reveals Classic Marvel Villain's Surprising Comeback,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fantastic-four-trailer-reveals-classic-133404110.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Marvel\'s first superhero team-up is back, and this time, the keyword is ""family."" No, it\'s not a Fast & Furious movie, but the emotional theme of the first trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps is all about how the four titular superheroes see themselves as a family unit.', 'The just-released trailer from Marvel Studios firmly establishes that this film will take place in a retro-futuristic version of the 1960s, in which Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) are grappling with their superheroic transformations, following a fateful spaceflight.', ""But, most surprisingly, the slick, nostalgic trailer also reveals who the villain will be for this movie, and it's someone comic book fans have been waiting a long time to see realized on the big screen. As Sue comforts Reed, assuring him that the Fantastic Four can handle whatever is thrown at them, we see the looming shadow of a massive head and very specific helmet."", ""It's Galactus! This Marvel supervillain is a cosmic being who basically consumes entire worlds for sustenance. First introduced in Fantastic Four #48 in 1966, Galactus was a game-changer for comic book baddies. He's bigger than Thanos, and much more powerful than anything the MCU has revealed yet. In the film, Galactus will be played by Ralph Ineson, but the fact that Marvel stuck him in the first trailer is something of a shock."", 'Marvel Studios', ""The introduction of Galactus to this sprawling film franchise could also help reconcile how The Fantastic Four: First Steps fits into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. We know this timeline doesn't quite match up with what we're used to in the world that contains Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. But, if Galactus can consume entire worlds, then maybe, he also can change aspects of the multiverse. Or, even worse, what if the Fantastic Four end up in the regular MCU because their world is destroyed?""]"

Arguably since the Avengers themselves first assembled.', 'The initial spot is a minute and a half long, and while yes, this is an MCU project, this movie is (at least at the start) taking place in an entirely separate universe akin to the Jetsons with ‘50s era aesthetics and seemingly no other superheroes around.', 'However the Fantastic Four end up meeting Thor and Hulk and all the rest remains to be seen, no doubt in Avengers: Doomsday, but there’s something refreshing about something totally divorced from everything else like this. And of course, we get our first look at its stellar cast, some of the most popular names in Hollywood right now, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch and The Thing. Unless I missed a moment here, we see the last three members use their powers, but we don’t see Reed Richards doing any stretching. Interesting choice.', 'We get an extended look at Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s Thing, which is motion capture and something pretty tough to pull off. He, and the special effects, appear to be doing so. I really love the sound of rocks smacking together when he was clapping.

That includes Galactus looming over the city. No Silver Surfer yet though. Also no real fight scenes at all, which is fine for a first spot like this. It all comes together in a great package that is already being received very well by fans, despite supposed “MCU fatigue,” which is often proven not to be a real thing, as Deadpool and Wolverine just demonstrated last year.', 'It seems extremely likely that Fantastic Four will be a big hit for Marvel, likely bigger than either Captain America: Brave New World or Thunderbolts. Not necessarily because it will be better, but because it is a genuinely big deal that this group is hitting the MCU, and if all the trailers are this good, you can bet that everyone is definitely going to show up. The film is out July 25, 2025, so it’s less than six months until we see how it plays out.
