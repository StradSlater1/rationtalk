Trump is weighing big cuts to the U.S. Education Department,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5282233/trump-to-make-big-cuts-to-education-department,"['Cory Turner', 'President Trump has said repeatedly that he will try to close the U.S. Department of Education, seen here in Washington, D.C.', 'The Trump administration is exploring dramatic cuts to programs and staff at the U.S. Department of Education, including executive action shuttering department programs that are not protected by law and calling on Congress to close the department entirely.', 'On Tuesday, the White House confirmed to NPR the broad contours of its plan, and that the executive action would be issued by the end of the month.', ""News of the Trump administration's plans was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."", ""This looming executive action comes after the Trump administration, in recent days, placed dozens of Education Department staff members on paid administrative leave with little explanation, saying only that the moves were the result of President Trump's executive action targeting federal diversity programs."", ""Taken together, the news has unsettled department staff and is sure to come up in the Senate confirmation hearing for Trump's nominee to be education secretary, Linda McMahon. That hearing has not yet been scheduled."", ""The department, with roughly 4,400 employees and an annual budget of $79 billion, has broad responsibility over three major areas: managing approximately $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt, overseeing implementation and enforcement of the nation's special education law, and administering Title I, the main federal program aimed at improving outcomes for lower-income students."", 'While the executive action is expected to outline significant cuts to the Education Department and even call for its closure, the department cannot be closed through executive action alone.', 'The department was created by an act of Congress in 1979 and, as such, can be closed only by an act of Congress.', 'Whether there are enough votes in Congress to close the Education Department is another question entirely. House Republicans have tried before and failed, and Republicans enjoy only narrow majorities in the House and Senate.', ""What's more, public surveys show a majority of Republicans believe the U.S. government should be spending more, not less, on education."", 'This is a little murkier, but, yes, it seems within the discretion of the president and his education secretary to make some cuts to the department — specifically focusing on programs that were not created by Congress and therefore are not protected by statute.', 'But much of what the Education Department does — certainly its signature programs — are protected by statute, including the most important federal funding streams to public schools:', 'Both of these funding streams were, like the department itself, created by separate acts of Congress — Title I in 1965 and IDEA in 1975 — and, as such, cannot be unwound except by Congress. Large changes to either are unlikely, as the programs enjoy broad bipartisan support.', 'Project 2025, a conservative government blueprint drafted by several Trump loyalists, recommends closing the department and turning both funding streams into no-strings-attached grants, ultimately phasing out the Title I, low-income support dollars within a decade. But, again, that would require an act of Congress — something that seems unlikely.', ""It's worth noting that during Trump's first term, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recommended steep cuts to the department through the administration's annual budget proposals, including shifting Title I money into a Project 2025-like block grant, but Congress holds the power of the purse and instead passed modest funding increases."", '""These are all programs that Congress established and knowingly housed inside the Department of Education,"" says Dan Zibel, a former top lawyer in the department and now chief counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, ""and any changes to those programs would not only be shortsighted but require a new vote of Congress.""', ""It may be possible to move one or more of the department's signature responsibilities to a different government agency — something that would not close the Education Department but would strip it of much of its power. Still, Zibel says, any large-scale movements, like shifting the office of Federal Student Aid and its massive student loan portfolio to the Treasury Department, as Project 2025 recommends, would certainly require Congress' say-so."", '""A lot of what the administration is doing is testing boundaries,"" says Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, ""so we\'ll see how this works and what might happen in court. I imagine there will be some thinning of the workforce, but it\'s hard to predict how aggressively they\'ll move.""', 'While the Trump administration fine-tunes its broader strategy to shrink — or potentially try to close — the Education Department, it has already begun removing staff on a smaller scale.', 'According to Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, a union that represents some 2,800 nonmanagement Education Department employees, at least 74 nonmanagement staff members have been put on paid administrative leave in recent days.', 'NPR has spoken with several staff members who have been placed on leave, who shared their stories on the condition that we not share their names, for fear they would lose their jobs entirely.', 'They described receiving an email, obtained by NPR, informing them that ""you will be placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits pursuant to the President\'s executive order on DEIA and further guidance from OPM. This administrative leave is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.""', 'None of the staff members whom NPR spoke with said they worked on diversity, equity, inclusion or accessibility issues. All of them described being shocked and confused when they received the email.', '""It looks very suspicious,"" says Smith. ""Nothing we\'ve seen gives any rhyme or reason as to why these employees were chosen.""', 'News of the staffing changes was first reported by The New York Times.', 'One common denominator that connects many of these department staff members is a diversity and inclusion-focused workshop, known as Diversity Change Agents, that they attended at some point. The workshop was not only offered by the department over many years, but, staff say, attendance was encouraged and rewarded by their managers.', ""What's more, NPR spoke with several staff members who say they attended the Diversity Change Agents workshop during Trump's first administration and were encouraged to do so by Trump's own political appointees."", 'In response to a request to clarify why these employees have been placed on leave and whether their attendance at a diversity workshop is the reason they have been singled out, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the department, responded with this statement:', '""President Trump was elected to bring about unprecedented reform to the federal civil service to ensure it is merit-based and efficient at serving the interests of the American people. At the Department of Education, we are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests.""', ""One employee with the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) who was placed on leave served on his office's Employee Engagement, Diversity & Inclusion Council (EEDIC), a group created during the first Trump administration."", 'In an email dated June 5, 2020, obtained by NPR, Trump political appointee Kimberly Richey wrote to several dozen staffers selected to serve on the council: ""As we work together to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in OCR, I want to urge you to keep EEDIC\'s Mission Statement at the Center of our work … to promote an OCR environment where all employees, whatever their identities, are fully included, engaged, connected, respected, safe, satisfied, and fulfilled as well as a workplace in which barriers to diversity and equal opportunity are removed.""', 'Richey did not respond to a request for comment.', 'The department staffer, who is also an Army veteran, served on this diversity council but said, through his attorney, that he otherwise had no involvement in DEIA programming.', '""There is absolutely no conceivable reason he should ever be placed on administrative leave,"" says Subodh Chandra, a civil rights attorney based in Cleveland who is representing at least two Education Department staffers who have been placed on paid leave.', 'Chandra says he believes this execution of Trump\'s order, rooting out DEIA programs, violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Likewise, The Washington Post reported that the order wouldn’t directly abolish the agency but instead “directs the agency to begin to diminish itself,” citing three people who were briefed on the order.', 'Other sources familiar with talks about the order told Inside Higher Ed as early as Friday that the order would at least direct the education Secretary to come up with a plan to break up the department. No executive order has officially been signed, but a White House official told the Post that one is in the works for later this month and “will fulfill Trump’s campaign pledge to defund the department.”', 'Sources told the Journal and the Post that the White House should hold off on the executive order until Linda McMahon, Trump’s nominee to lead the Education Department, has been confirmed.

In a typical year, the Department publishes hundreds of publications and millions of copies to meet the public's demand for information."", ""The Department makes recommendations for education reform. The secretary advises the president in this regard and leads the Department in implementing the president's education policies in many arenas—from the preparation of legislative proposals for Congress to decisions about education research priorities. Of vital importance in formulating and implementing policies is the Department's close work with a variety of advisory groups and organizations composed of citizens from all walks of life who have an interest and expertise in education and who provide significant ideas on key policies and programs."", 'In addition, the secretary brings national attention to education issues by giving speeches, writing articles for publication, addressing the media and making personal appearances in schools and other education settings. The Department further highlights education issues by sponsoring and participating in national conferences and other similar activities, such as the Blue Ribbon Schools and Presidential Scholars award programs, the Teaching Ambassador Fellows Program, the Student Art Exhibit Program, and special events and ceremonies to honor teachers or students.', 'The Department enforces five civil rights statutes to ensure equal educational opportunity for all students, regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, disability or age. These laws extend to all state education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems, colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries and museums, and other entities that receive U.S. Department of Education funds.

The website came back online Tuesday night, with the notice of recall or termination for global staffers its sole post.\n\nThe move had been rumored for several days and was the most extreme of several proposals considered for consolidating the agency into the state department. Other options had included closures of smaller USAid missions and partial closures of larger ones.\n\nThe decision to withdraw direct-hire staff and their families earlier than their planned departures will probably cost the government tens of millions of dollars in travel and relocation costs.\n\nStaff being placed on leave include both foreign and civil service officers who have legal protection against arbitrary dismissal and being placed on leave without reason.\n\nThe American Foreign Service Association, the union which represents US diplomats, sent a notice to its members denouncing the decision and saying it was preparing legal action to counter or halt it.\n\nLocally employed USAid staff do not have much recourse and were excluded from the federal government’s voluntary buyout offer.\n\nThe notice says those who will exempted from leave include staffers responsible for “mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs” and would be informed by Thursday afternoon.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” the notice concluded.', 'Donald Trump has vowed that US would “take over” war ravaged Gaza and “own it”, effectively endorsing the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, in an announcement shocking even by the standards of his norm-shattering presidency.', 'Trump, who has previously threatened Greenland and Panama and suggested that Canada should become the 51st state, added Gaza to his expansionist agenda, claiming that it could become the “Riviera of the Middle East” and declined to rule out sending US troops to make it happen.', '“The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative,” the president told a joint press conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday evening. “It’s right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down.”', 'Staffers with Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) reportedly entered the headquarters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the Department of Commerce in Washington DC today, inciting concerns of downsizing at the agency.', '“They apparently just sort of walked past security and said: ‘Get out of my way,’ and they’re looking for access for the IT systems, as they have in other agencies,” said Andrew Rosenberg, a former Noaa official who is now a fellow at the University of New Hampshire. “They will have access to the entire computer system, a lot of which is confidential information.”', 'Project 2025, written by several former Trump staffers, has called for the agency to be “broken up and downsized”, claiming the agency is “harmful to US prosperity” for its role in climate science.', 'Donald Trump and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, addressed reporters at the White House, where the US president announced his intention to take over the Gaza Strip, move Palestinians to neighbouring countries and redevelop the territory for occupation by “the world’s people”. Here are the main takeaways from their joint press conference on Tuesday evening:', 'In a shock announcement, Trump said the US will “take over” and “own” the Gaza Strip. The US president said he envisioned a “long-term” US ownership of the territory after all Palestinians were moved elsewhere. He did not explain how and under what authority the US can take over the land of Gaza. “We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site,” he said. He said the US would “level” destroyed buildings and “create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.”', 'The US president called Gaza a “symbol of death and destruction” and that the only reason people want to go back there is because they have nowhere else to go. The 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza should move to neighbouring countries with “humanitarian hearts” and “great wealth”, Trump said. Earlier he had called for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Palestinians. He said they could be split up across a number of separate sites. Forced displacement of the population would probably be a violation of international law and would be fiercely opposed not only in the region but also by Washington’s western allies. Some human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing.', 'He went on to say that Gaza could become “the Riviera of the Middle East” where “the world’s people” could live there, echoing the previous sentiments of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who said Gaza had very valuable “waterfront property”.', 'Trump gave a vague answer when asked a question on whether he supported a two-state solution. Asked if his view that Palestinians should be relocated from Gaza was a sign that he was against the two-state policy that has been the foreign policy approach of the United States for decades, Trump said no. “It doesn’t mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life,” he said. “They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It’s been horrible.”', 'Trump claimed high-level support among unnamed leaders he had spoken to. “This is not a decision made lightly,” he said, adding that “everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.” He said the move would bring “great stability to that part of the Middle East”.', 'Trump did not rule out sending US troops to secure Gaza. “As far as Gaza is concerned, we’ll do what is necessary. If it’s necessary, we’ll do that,” he said. On Trump’s idea of taking over Gaza, Netanyahu said the US president “sees a different future for Gaza”, adding: “I think it’s something that could change history.”', 'Trump said he would probably announce a position on Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank in the next month. “We haven’t been taking the position on it yet,” he said. Trump added that he planned to visit the Gaza Strip, Israel and Saudi Arabia.', 'Netanyahu described Trump as “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House”. The Israeli leader said “we have to finish the job in Gaza”, and said “Israel will end the war by winning the war.” Netanyahu praised Trump for “thinking outside the box with fresh ideas” and “showing willingness to puncture conventional thinking”.', 'The Saudi government, in a statement, stressed its rejection of any attempt to displace Palestinians from their land and said it would not establish relations with Israel without establishment of a Palestinian state. Meanwhile Hamas condemned Trump’s calls for Palestinians in Gaza to leave as “expulsion from their land”. The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations said that world leaders and people should respect Palestinians’ desire to remain in Gaza.', 'While the White House sold Trump’s shocking announcement that “the US will take over the Gaza Strip” and take “a long-term ownership position” in the Palestinian territory” as proof of his “unwavering pursuit for peace”, current and former members of Congress expressed shock and outrage.', '“He’s totally lost it. A US invasion of Gaza would lead to the slaughter of thousands of US troops and decades of war in the Middle East” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy wrote on X. It’s like a bad, sick joke.”', '“I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza”, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Jewish Insider. “It might be problematic.”', '“That’s insane”, Democratic Senator Chris Coons told NBC News. “ I can’t think of a place on earth that would welcome American troops less and where any positive outcome is less likely.”', 'Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat who has been a staunch supporter of Israel’s war in Gaza, was more open to the idea. “It’s a provocative part of the conversation, but it’s part of the conversation, and that’s where we are” Fetterman told Jewish Insider. “The Palestinians have refused, or they’ve been unwilling to deliver a government that provided security and economic development for themselves”.', 'Justin Amash, a former Republican member of Congress whose father was expelled from his home by Israeli forces in 1948, was appalled. “If the United States deploys troops to forcibly remove Muslims and Christians – like my cousins – from Gaza, then not only will the US be mired in another reckless occupation but it will also be guilty of the crime of ethnic cleansing” Amash wrote on X. “No American of good conscience should stand for this.”', 'The US International Trade Commission on Tuesday said it had canceled an ongoing multi-year investigation into the impact of trade policy on under-served communities and workers at the request of the Trump administration.\n\nThe ITC, an independent, nonpartisan federal agency told witnesses that it was canceling a hearing on the racial and diversity impacts of trade on Wednesday after the US Trade Representative’s office withdrew its request for the broader study. A copy of the email was seen by Reuters.\n\nThe agency had planned a total of six virtual hearings on the issue, including separate sessions on persistent poverty in rural areas and urban areas, and had planned in-person conversations in five US cities from March to May.', 'A US judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from moving transgender women to men’s prisons and ending their gender-affirming care, Reuters reports.\n\nIn a broad ruling temporarily halting an executive order that Trump, a Republican, signed on his first day back in office on 20 January, US District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington found that three transgender inmates who sued would probably succeed in arguing the policy was unconstitutional.\n\nThe decision marked the second time that a federal judge had sided with LGBTQ legal rights groups who sued to prevent the U.S. Bureau of Prisons from implementing the order.\n\nLamberth’s order applies to all 16 transgender women currently housed in federal women’s prisons. It goes further than a 27 January decision by a federal judge in Boston blocking prison officials from transferring an individual transgender woman to a men’s facility.\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department, which defended the Trump administration in court, declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'Near the tail-end of the demonstration, news broke that the treasury said Musk’s team had been granted “read-only” access to “coded data” of the government’s payments system, according to Bloomberg.', 'In a letter to Senator Ron Wyden, Jonathan Blum, the treasury’s principal deputy assistant secretary for legislative affairs, wrote that the system remains “robust and effective” and that no valid payment requests from government agencies had been rejected.', 'But that did little to quell protesters’ concerns about Musk’s involvement with systems in the first place, including many who were former federal contractors, such as Alexa Fraser, who worked in public health research.', '“What protections did he turn off to get in there?

What does Elon Musk do with everything he touches? He makes money!”', 'Hundreds of protesters and a contingent of Democratic lawmakers rallied outside the Department of the Treasury in Washington on Tuesday, denouncing what they called Elon Musk’s “hostile takeover” of federal financial systems, as demonstrations spilled on to, and took over, the street outside the building.', 'The protests targeted reports of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) team’s reported access to sensitive government financial data, including information related to social security payments, Medicare reimbursements, and tax refunds – systems that process trillions of dollars in annual transactions.', '“He has access to all our information, our social security numbers, the federal payment system,” Representative Maxwell Frost told the crowd. “What’s going to stop him from stealing taxpayer money?”', 'About a dozen members of Congress, including Maxine Waters, Al Green, Ayanna Pressley, and senators Jeff Merkley and Richard Blumenthal, joined the condemnations.

Expected Trump Order to Shutter Education Dept.

Sign up for The 74 Newsletter', 'Despite the fiery rhetoric, President Donald Trump’s push to eliminate a Department of Education he accuses of abusing “taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s youth” comes down, appropriately, to civics and math.', 'First, the president cannot legally abolish a department with statutory responsibilities embedded in the law. Only Congress can do that.', 'Most of the public money that flows to the department goes to programs codified in federal legislation. They include Title I ($18 billion annually), special education ($15 billion) and the Office for Civil Rights ($140 million).', 'To eliminate any of those programs — let alone, to shutter the department outright — or even to move them to another agency, requires a supermajority in Congress. That means six Democrats and every Republican in the Senate would need to be on board. The political calculus is daunting.', 'That leaves a motley assemblage of much smaller programs that are not bound up in Congress’s authority. Michael Petrilli, president of the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute, described those offerings as relative “pocket change” compared to the department’s overall budget.', '“I think it’s going to be pretty slim pickings,” he said. ', 'One notable exception would be the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development, which had almost 130 employees as of the end of December. Congress did not authorize the office, “so it could get axed before 5 today if they wanted,” said David Cleary, a principal with The Group, a Washington lobbying firm and a former Republican education staffer for the Senate. Even this program has functions, like safeguarding student privacy, that only Congress can eliminate.', 'Trump’s inner circle appears to have reckoned with its legal limitations in an executive order the president is expected to sign before the end of the month. Cleary is among those who was briefed on a draft that would call on lawmakers to eliminate the agency while Trump’s yet-to-be-confirmed education secretary does her part to push out staff and offload functions to other agencies.', '“The executive can’t just reorganize or change the authorities on its own,” Cleary said. Laws like the Education Sciences Reform Act and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act “empower and constrain the department in various ways.”', 'Two other sources, who either saw early drafts or an outline of the proposal and asked not to be named because of ongoing work with the department, agreed the order will take a two-part approach. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the deliberations Monday.', 'Some members of Congress are eager to help. A bill from South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds would shutter the agency over a six-month timeline. And Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky reintroduced a one-sentence bill on Friday that aims to close the department by the end of 2026. ', 'But with those proposals unlikely to get the required votes, experts say there’s little Linda McMahon, Trump’s nominee to lead the department, can do on her own. In addition to legislation establishing the department in 1979, other laws, like the Higher Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, authorize what the department does and how much it spends. ', 'Petrilli recalled that the first Trump administration eliminated the Office of Innovation and Improvement, which he helped create when he was a department official during President George W. Bush’s administration. The Blue Ribbon Schools program, which recognizes exemplary schools and costs about $100,000 a year to run, could be targeted this time. In keeping with Trump’s executive order against diversity, equity and inclusion, any grants highlighted in a recent report from Parents Defending Education, a conservative advocacy group, would also likely be cut. Those total about $1 billion. Staff connected to DEI efforts have been among the first to be dismissed.', 'Trump’s team is unafraid to push the envelope, as it has shown with the move to shut down USAID, but Petrilli doesn’t expect Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency to find much else to eliminate without Congress’s OK. ', '“This is the big action,” he said of DOGE staff digging into department databases over the weekend. “Then it’s going to be over and they’re going to be on to other things.”', 'The administration doesn’t have the same level of hostility for the education department as it does for foreign aid programs, added Jim Blew, who served under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos during Trump’s first term and co-founded the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute.', '“USAID sends money overseas, and people don’t understand how that’s in the U.S.’ interest. “I think the White House is reading those tea leaves,” he said. “It’s different for the department. I don’t think the dynamics are the same.”', 'But he hasn’t written off the idea that Trump could convince enough members of Congress to wind down the department and shift major programs to other agencies. While a recent poll showed a majority of Americans don’t want the department eliminated, there are limits to that support. ', '“Congress is very frustrated with the amount of money spent and the lack of results,” he said. “That always creates this inflammatory environment.”', 'The question is whether moving special education to the Department of Health and Human Services, for example, or shifting career and technical programs to the Department of Labor would result in less spending and bureaucracy, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs with The Bruman Group, a Washington law firm. ', 'Proponents of closing the department, like Sen. Rounds, haven’t provided those details. His bill would send K-12 funding to the states as a block grant, but offered no specifics on how to do it.', 'If Rounds gets his way, she added, states and districts might not receive the same attention they do now. ', '“Despite our occasional frustrations, [the Education Department] has … historically been a user-friendly and responsive agency,” she said. “Having a new agency that is inexperienced and understaffed increases the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse, and decreases responsiveness.”', 'Some observers speculate that Trump is delaying his executive order so McMahon won’t have to face pointed questions from the Senate education committee over how to implement it.

The USDOE establishes policies that ensure eligible applicants serving early childhood, elementary, secondary & post secondary programs, individuals with disabilities, those living in poverty, migrants, and those with limited English proficiency adhere to practices that best serve these populations.""', 'President Donald Trump has pushed for years to eliminate the department, which he says is supporting ""indoctrination"" of youth through supporting liberal-leaning education curriculum.', 'Eliminating the federal education department would require an act of Congress. On top of that, it could happen in any number of ways that would have widely varying impacts on North Carolina schools.', ""The U.S. Department of Education carries out or oversees numerous federal programs that were enacted by separate acts of Congress. Those include the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), which started special education programming, and the Education and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which includes Title I funding for schools with higher concentrations of lower-income students, magnet school funding and other things. In other words, eliminating the federal education department wouldn't get rid of special education programs, Title I or many other programs; the laws that created them would still exist."", 'The department oversees the implementation of some of these laws. For example, it conducts investigations into compliance with civil rights laws, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which created Title IX.', ""It's unclear whether Trump or other Republican lawmakers who also support eliminating the department would also pursue overturning or modifying those federal laws. Project 2025, proposed by thinktank the Heritage Foundation but disavowed in part by Trump, proposes cutting the department and moving the administration of many of the federal education laws to other federal agencies. The group, however, also supports the gradual reduction of Title I funding by moving funding responsibility over to states, instead."", 'After Tuesday\'s meeting, Heagarty said he\'s not sure what to make of the Trump administration\'s plan without seeing details but fears ""tremendous negative impacts.""', '""Right now, there are so many important federal programs that come through the United States Department of Education,"" he said.

Does it mean restructuring it and just putting those employees and those programs into different federal agencies? I don\'t know. So based on what I\'ve seen and what I\'ve heard, I\'m going to assume it\'s dismantling the agency and dismantling the programs.""', 'The school system has more than 20,000 students enrolled in special education and more than 40 schools that receive Title I funding for things like extra teachers or other services.

While Trump accused the department of overreach, the federal curriculums for schools have always been set at state and local levels.', '“We’re ranked number one in cost per pupil, so we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we’re ranked at the bottom of the list,” Trump said. “We’re ranked very badly. And what I want to do is let the states run schools.”', 'Previously, some programs now run by the Education Department were housed under other government agencies. It’s possible they could be returned to those or eliminated entirely.', 'Because the department was established by Congress, it would also require an act of Congress to shut it down. It isn’t clear how Trump plans to clear that legal hurdle if he attempts to close the department using an executive order.', 'If programs run by the Department of Education are eliminated, it could impact a significant number of Americans.', 'The Department of Education administers funding for K-12 schools that is appropriated by Congress. The largest are the Title 1 program, which helps educate children from low-income families, and the IDEA program, which helps students with disabilities.', 'Funding for both of those programs accounts for around $28 billion a year. While it’s a significant dollar amount, it only amounts to roughly 10% of funding. It’s not clear how schools would be expected to make up for the loss in funds if those funds were to be eliminated.', 'There are challenges to eliminating those funds, however. Title 1, for example, is established as a federal program and couldn’t easily be cut.', 'It is possible the funding could simply be moved to another agency. Both programs have had strong bipartisan support, with Congress resisting calls from presidents to cut funding for them, which could help preserve them.', 'The Education Department also provides oversight for schools, notably through the Office of Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination complaints filed against colleges and K-12 schools.', 'It can also create federal rules, which have been used to protect minority populations, with the Biden administration strengthening protections for transgender students and the Obama administration working to protect minority students from unfair discipline.', 'Trump already rolled back the Obama-era rules during his first administration.', 'If the department is dismantled, it’s unclear how anti-discrimination policies would be made or enforced, or if such policies would continue to exist. Because those policies are often enforced through conditions attached to federal funding administered by the department, there would also be no way to track whether discriminatory rules or actions were happening on a nationwide scale.', 'If programs like IDEA are defunded, it could also make it more difficult for parents whose children rely on individual education plans (IEPs) or who have other special needs to get the resources they are required to receive. It could also make it more difficult for parents to pursue complaints against schools that do not provide adequate resources for disabled students.', 'Student loans and grants for higher education are a big part of the department’s work and one that touches the lives of many Americans.', 'The biggest grant program for low-income students, the Pell Grant program, is run by the department but eligibility is set by Congress. That means Trump shouldn’t be able to eliminate it on his own.', 'While those grants may be okay, other aid programs could be eliminated. Currently, federal student loans are provided and serviced by the department.', 'If the government decides to reduce or eliminate its role in lending for education, students who need help to afford college would have to rely on private lenders. That could mean higher interest rates, no income-based repayment and no option for programs that forgive student loans if students work in particular fields.', 'Those who already have student loans would likely see a disruption in servicing as the loans would have to be transferred elsewhere, potentially to the Treasury Department. That would include payments for students who are currently enrolled.', 'For those with student loan debt, that debt wouldn’t disappear. It could potentially be transferred to another agency or possibly sold to a private loan servicer. Debt sold to a private loan servicer would still be subject to the conditions of the original loan but it could complicate efforts to institute student loan forgiveness in the future.', 'The Department of Education also provides oversight when it comes to for-profit colleges. That could enable for-profit schools to operate with less stringent standards, which could leave students with amounts of loan debt despite receiving an inadequate education.', 'The department also provides oversight for independent organizations that provide accreditation for colleges. Without that oversight, there could be changes to what those groups require for a college to be recognized and accredited.', 'Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Forty percent of students received Pell Grants.', 'Even a brief delay could deter students worried about paying for college from attending, Daniel Collier, a professor of higher and adult education at the University of Memphis, told McClatchy News in a phone interview.', '“That puts a lot of uncertainty in the system, and then that will help crater potential future enrollments as well,” he said.', 'Beyond attendance, uncertainty in the federal aid system could change students’ plans, Baker said.', '“We can see that in a lot of ways,” she said. “We could imagine a world where low-income students choose that instead of attending … the regional public university that’s near them, they potentially instead go to the community college that’s nearby so we can imagine that they make different decisions about where they enroll, or students choosing to opt entirely of higher education because of their concerns about the finances.”', 'Scott-Clayton notes that a disruption like this could lead “some students to forgo college or to default on their loans,” she told McClatchy News in an email.', 'Even if there are disruptions in the Department of Education if Trump carries out executive orders to dissolve portions of it, experts say borrowers will still be on the hook for their federal student loans.', 'Any interference could upset the income-based repayment programs or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.', 'Federal student loan repayment is regulated by the Department of Education under the Higher Education Act, student financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz told McClatchy News in an email. The act, he said, would prohibit another federal department from taking over the responsibility without Congress allowing them to do so.', '“The biggest concern that I would have is that people in public service loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment may not get the forgiveness that they’re legally entitled to, because it’s possible that the Department of Education just decides not to confirm anything,” Collier said.', 'Portions of income-based repayment are already stalled due to a lawsuit against the SAVE repayment plan, but an internal disruption could further affect those on income-based repayment plans, Baker said.', '“(Borrowers) certify their income and get it approved, and that’s what adjusts their monthly payments,” Baker said. “The Department of Education is responsible for that certification. They often work with contractors, but the contractors have to report to the Department of Education.”', 'There is nothing borrowers or soon-to-be-borrowers can do now to prepare for any disruptions in the Department of Education, according to experts that spoke with McClatchy News.', 'However, they say that there is a chance of disruption in the near future.', '“I think the chances of a legal dissolution of the Department are slim to none, but the chances of disruptive interference appear to be increasing by the day,” Scott-Clayton said.', '', 'Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.', 'Part of the McClatchy Media Network']"
How Student Loans Will Be Impacted if Department of Education Closes Down,https://www.newsweek.com/student-loans-department-education-close-2025939,"['', '', '', '', '', 'With the U.S. Department of Education in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, the way millions of young Americans interact with the higher-education system could be about to change.', 'Newsweek spoke with multiple experts who explained what the changes could mean for students and student loans.', 'During his 2024 campaign, President Donald Trump frequently vowed to dismantle the Department of Education, claiming it has been taken over by ""radical zealots and Marxists."" He argued that its authority should be handed over to the states.', 'The Department of Education, which according to its website employs more than 4,000 people, managed $1.5 trillion in federal loans for nearly 43 million borrowers as of January 2024.', 'The Department of Education currently manages the federal student loan system through its Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), which handles loan disbursement, servicing and borrower assistance.', 'If the department were abolished, these functions might need to be transferred elsewhere, such as the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as Betsy Mayotte, president and founder of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, which provides free student loan advice, suggested to Newsweek.', 'But some experts, such Mark Kantrowitz, who writes extensively about financial aid policy, warned that there had been past attempts to have the Treasury Department directly manage student loans, and they were ""not as effective"" as private contractors.', 'Another concern is the fate of federal financial aid programs such Pell Grants, work-study programs and subsidized loans.', 'The department says it awards more than $120 billion a year in grants, work-study funds, and low-interest loans to approximately 13 million students.', '""The Federal Pell Grant will be fine, with colleges continuing to draw down funds directly based on the student\'s FAFSA-calculated eligibility,"" Kantrowitz said.', '""But, if the grants were eliminated, which would require an act of Congress, low-income students would no longer be able to afford to pay for college.""', 'If the federal government reduces its role in student lending, private lenders could step in to fill the gap, which experts warn would potentially make college less affordable.', '""\u200aWe have seen significant alignment between the administration\'s actions and what was in Project 2025. That document says the federal government should get out of the student loan business entirely. That would send student loans to the private market, which would be terrible for students from low-income families,"" Peter Granville, a fellow at The Century Foundation where he analyzes federal and state policy efforts to improve college access and affordability, told Newsweek.', '""The incentive structure of student loans would drive lenders towards maximizing profit, not promoting education access. Moving the department\'s offices to other federal agencies is one thing, but the administration\'s leaders have signaled that they want to privatize the loan program, which would be an even greater mistake.""', 'One key argument for dismantling the Department of Education is to give states more control over education policy and funding. Under this model, student aid programs might be shifted to state governments, creating a patchwork system where eligibility and funding levels vary widely.', '""The states lack the capacity to fully take over servicing of federal loans. They want a piece of the pie, but not the entire pie,"" Kantrowitz said. ""The larger loan servicers are more effective and efficient than the states.""', 'Even if the Republican administration pursues abolishing the Department of Education, it would face significant legal and political hurdles. The department was established in 1979 during the Carter administration and dismantling it would require new legislation. However, reports suggest an executive order is in the works to cut the department.', 'Granville also anticipated a period of confusion and upheaval.', '""\u200aI wouldn\'t bet that that transition will go smoothly without significant confusion for families, colleges and student loan borrowers. Higher education is a massive part of American life,"" Granville said.', '""\u200aThere are thousands of colleges who turn to the department not only for student aid programs but also for guidance about things such as enforcing civil rights and programs for veterans.""', 'Oversight of colleges could also be affected, Kantrowitz said, since the Department of Education runs program reviews and audits. Funding delays are also a possibility.', '""Any major changes would likely cause some chaos and disruption,"" said Kantrowitz, who said we could also expect an increase in default rates, since default prevention would be affected.', 'President Donald Trump said last October: ""We want federal education dollars to follow the student rather than propping up a bloated and radical bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.""', 'Elon Musk wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday night: ""Reagan campaigned on ending the federal Dept of Education, which was created by Carter in 1979, but it was bigger when Reagan left office than when he started! Not this time. President @realDonaldTrump will succeed.""', 'Mark Kantrowitz told Newsweek: ""The U.S. Department of Education is a very complicated enterprise, with the federal student loan portfolio the equivalent to the world\'s largest bank. Shutting it down would be very complicated.', '""The idea of moving fast and breaking things might work for a startup, but not for a service that people depend on. Some things would be permanently broken and even a temporary disruption can be harmful.""', 'According to reports, the Trump administration is considering using an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education.', 'Do you have a story we should be covering?

While he can’t close the agency without Congressional approval, it doesn’t mean his acts can’t have a big impact.', 'Trump and members of his administration, notably Elon Musk the head of the Department of Government Efficiency that has chipped away at other agencies, have reportedly drafted an executive order that acknowledges only Congress can shut down the DoE but still instructs it to begin diminishing itself, according to the Washington Post.', 'The department’s key functions, such as providing grants for low-income students, providing guidance to serving students with disabilities, enforcing civil-rights law and the federal student-loan program are codified in the law that establishes the DOE.', 'Two of the most important functions of the DOE - providing $15.6 billion to lower-income communities and $15 billion to help districts provide for students with disabilities - are protected by statute.', 'While the DOE provides funding for public schools, it accounts for less than 10 percent of the nation’s public school funding.', 'Here are some ways Trump could significantly change the DOE:', 'One proposed way Trump could revoke power from the DOE is by moving some of its functions to other departments. That move would keep certain programs that were established by Congress.', 'Project 2025 - the think-tank right-wing outline that has seemingly become the Trump blueprint - suggests moving federal aid programs such as Pell Grants to the Treasury Department and civil rights enforcement to the Department of Justice. However, it is unclear if that would require congressional action.', 'Under Trump’s anti-DEI executive order, the federal government is prohibited from funding programs or policies that promote diversity, equity, accessibility and inclusion which could leave some scholarships vulnerable.', 'Already, dozens of DOE staff have been placed on paid administrative leave because of Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI programs. At least 55 employees received an email pursuant to the executive order, according to The Associated Press.', 'But to leave the department with little power, Trump and his administration could slash the DOE workforce even further in the same vein as it did with the U.S. Agency for International Development and deactivate emails or tell employees not to come into work.', 'Millions of federal employees have been offered buyouts as well. Staffers in the DOE could be incentivized to take the deals.', 'The DOE has a relatively small number of employees with slightly more than 4,200 workers.', '“Effectively shutting down the Department of Education through Executive Order or mass firings is a recipe for chaos that will disrupt the lives of students across the country,” Aaron Ament, a former Obama administration official, told the Post.', '“Trying to do so without Congress is not only shortsighted but illegal and unconstitutional,” Ament said.', 'At least some DOGE staffers have gained access to DOE internal systems, including some related to federal student aid programs, according to the Post. This could allow the organization to make suggestions to Trump that could lead him to issue more executive orders that cut back spending.', 'Executive orders aimed at reducing DEI and expanding school choice also call for a reallocation of federal spending which could mean the government provides less funding to DOE.', 'Any action Trump takes to significantly reduce the DOE will likely be met with legal challenges, much like his previous executive orders that offered sweeping policy changes.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"
