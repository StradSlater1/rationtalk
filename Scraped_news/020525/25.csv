His ultimate investing goal is to build a personal brand and stand-alone family office that provides flexibility on when and how he works going forward. Over the years his investing strategy has matured but he has now landed on a dual investing strategy. Focus on long term capital appreciation with index funds (like the S&P500) with a sprinkle of smaller speculative small cap stocks that may lead to outsized returns. Matt supplements his returns through writing far out of the money covered calls. Matt is a petroleum engineer by education and has worked in the energy industry for a decade. In his free time he enjoys discussing investment opportunities, medium-full bodied cigars and single malt scotches.

At the time of grant, the achievement of the market condition of the Market-Vesting SARs was difficult to predict and dependent on future events that were uncertain and were not within our control.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future, such as stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.', 'Available Information', 'Palantir uses its Investor Relations website at https://investors.palantir.com as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

Palantir Investors Just Got Spectacular News from CEO Alex Karp,https://www.aol.com/palantir-investors-just-got-spectacular-120500751.html,"['', '', 'One of the most intriguing players to emerge in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) is Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR). The company had already made a name for itself in the defense and intelligence spaces and has been working diligently to prove its mettle for enterprise-level businesses. Those aspirations have come into focus over the past couple of years, as Palantir has gained more than 900%. The commensurate increase in its valuation has raised the alarm and been the subject of much debate in Wall Street circles.', ""Palantir reported results after the market close on Monday, and to say it crushed expectations might be an understatement. Not only did the company easily surpass estimates, but management's guidance suggests its growth will continue to accelerate."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks »', ""Let's take a look at what drove Palantir's robust results and what the future might hold."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""For the fourth quarter, Palantir generated revenue of $828 million, up 36% year over year and 14% quarter over quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.14, which climbed 75%. To put the results in the context of expectations, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $782 million and EPS of $0.11, so Palantir easily cleared Wall Street's already high bar."", ""The results were fueled by U.S. commercial revenue that jumped 64% year over year and 20% sequentially -- well ahead of management's guidance for growth of at least 50%. The U.S. government segment also answered the call, with revenue climbing 45%."", ""Customer metrics underpinned the company's robust results. Palantir's customer count grew 43% year over year, driven by a 73% increase in U.S. commercial customers. The underlying deals that fueled the results were also eye-opening, as Palantir inked 129 deals worth at least $1 million. Of those, 58 were worth at least $5 million, and 32 were worth at least $10 million."", ""It's worth noting that many of these contracts are also helping to lay the foundation for future profits. The company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or sales not yet booked as revenue -- climbed 40% year over year to $1.73 billion. When RPO is outpacing current revenue growth, it provides insight into future potential, suggesting its growth spurt has further to run."", 'The spark that ignited Palantir\'s blockbuster growth is the company\'s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is revolutionizing the way businesses profit from AI. The company employed a novel approach, hosting boot camps that marry users with Palantir engineers to help them apply AI to mission-critical operations, ""going from zero to use case in five days or less."" That strategy has been wildly successful.', ""Palantir provided full-year revenue guidance for 2025 of $3.75 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 31% at the midpoint of its guidance. The biggest contributor to its rosy outlook is the U.S. commercial segment -- which includes AIP -- as management is now forecasting growth of 54%, up from management's forecast for 50% growth just last quarter."", 'In Palantir\'s letter to shareholders, CEO Alex Karp said of AI, ""We are still in the earliest stages, the beginning of the first act, of a revolution that will play out over years and decades.""', ""The data clearly shows that Palantir is firing on all cylinders. However, some investors are concerned that the stock has gotten away from itself and Wall Street has joined the chorus. Of the 22 analysts that offered an opinion in February, only three rate it a buy or strong buy, 13 rate it a hold, and the remaining six rate hold underperform or sell ratings. Palantir's biggest doubters are nearly universal in citing the stock's valuation as the reason for their bearish calls."", ""A quick look at the numbers helps illustrate why. The stock is currently selling for 412 times earnings and 75 times sales (as of this writing) -- which is astounding by any stretch of the imagination. However, the most widely used valuation metrics tend to fall short when assessing high-growth stocks. Applying the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which considers Palantir's accelerating growth -- clocks in at 0.38, when any number less than 1 suggests an undervalued stock."", ""That said, given its lofty valuation, Palantir will continue to be volatile, and failure on the company's part -- real or perceived -- to live up to investors' elevated expectations could bring the stock crashing down. Recall that between early 2021 and late 2022, Palantir stock shed as much as 83% of its value."", 'The generative AI market is expected to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. If Palantir can successfully navigate the stormy seas of AI adoption and continue to carve out a profitable niche for itself, the stock price could be much higher a decade from now -- but there will likely be numerous pitfalls along the way.', ""Given the company's reliable execution, significant opportunity, and expanding profits, I believe Palantir Technologies is worth owning for the long term. However, given its frothy valuation, it may be safer to buy on weakness, or by dollar-cost averaging into the stock."", 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Palantir secured 32 deals worth $10 million or more. Its customer base grew 43% year-over-year and 13% sequentially to 711 clients. Additionally, revenue from its top 20 customers increased 18% year-over-year to an impressive $65 million per customer. These factors provide a solid foundation for future growth.', ""Palantir’s U.S. commercial business continues to be a key contributor to its growth. In Q4, the U.S. commercial business’s top line jumped 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. The demand for AI production use cases has surged, driving Palantir's commercial customer count up by 73% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Palantir booked its highest-ever U.S. commercial TCV of $803 million, representing 134% year-over-year growth."", 'Looking ahead, the U.S. commercial revenue will likely deliver solid growth. Management projects revenue over $1.079 billion in 2025, representing a growth rate of at least 54%.', 'Government contracts have also been a crucial growth driver. Palantir’s U.S. government revenue rose 45% year-over-year to $343 million in Q4, fueled by the strong execution of existing programs and new awards. The continued adoption of AI solutions within government operations highlights Palantir’s expanding market for offerings.', 'Overall, Palantir forecasts 2025 revenue in the range of $3.741 billion to $3.757 billion, representing a 31% year-over-year growth rate at the midpoint. Strong revenue growth is expected to support margin expansion and boost adjusted free cash flow.', 'Despite its impressive growth narrative, Palantir’s valuation is a growing concern. The stock currently trades at exceptionally high multiples, with a price-sales ratio of 76.12x and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 271.95x, far exceeding industry averages. These lofty valuations raise questions about whether the company’s future growth potential justifies its current stock price.', 'Another risk factor is Palantir’s reliance on government contracts, which are inherently unpredictable and prone to fluctuations. Such dependencies introduce a level of revenue uncertainty that could pose challenges for the company moving forward.', 'While Palantir’s growth prospects remain compelling, its elevated valuation presents a significant risk for investors. Given the company’s high valuation, Wall Street analysts currently maintain a “Hold” consensus rating on the stock, with an average price target of $47.29, indicating significant downside potential from recent levels.', 'In conclusion, Palantir’s AI solutions and impressive financial performance are positives. However, analysts’ cautious stance highlights concerns about whether Palantir’s current valuation is sustainable, particularly if its growth trajectory begins to decelerate. Investors with a long-term outlook may consider holding onto their Palantir shares to benefit from the company’s promising future. However, a gradual approach to profit-taking could be wise for investors seeking to lock in gains. Incremental sales allow you to secure profits while keeping some exposure to future growth.', 'Stocks: 15 minute delay (Cboe BZX is real-time), ET. Volume reflects consolidated markets.

Here's Why.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/05/prediction-palantir-will-beat-the-market-heres-why/,"['', '', '', 'KEY POINTS', ""Palantir Technologies (PLTR 23.99%) already delivered explosive earnings and stock price performances to investors last year. The company's quarterly revenue soared in the double digits, profit reached records, and the stock jumped 340% for the best performance in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.72%)."", 'The company reached key milestones too, such as joining that major benchmark, as well as winning a spot in the Nasdaq-100.', ""All of this is thanks to a solid software business built up over 20 years, and in recent times, the company's harnessing of the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to supercharge growth. AI demand may very well be in its early stages -- signaling a lot more growth for Palantir ahead -- but the stock's meteoric rise prompted some analysts and investors to wonder if it was ripe for a pause. Wall Street has been cautious, with the average 12-month price forecast calling for a 29% decline in the stock from the closing price on Feb. 3."", ""But I think this top stock, even after last year's gain, may just be getting started. My prediction is that Palantir will beat the market. Here's why."", 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', ""First, here's a quick summary of the Palantir path so far. As mentioned, the company has been around for a number of years -- but growth strongly accelerated in recent times thanks to all the work Palantir accomplished throughout its history, as well as key technology developments like AI that have driven a whole new wave of demand for its systems."", ""Palantir makes software that helps customers aggregate their data and make better use of it. While this may sound mundane, it actually is just the opposite. Palantir's software can play a crucial role in a government or a company's operations -- resulting in game-changing decisions, new strategies, and more."", ""For example, Palantir is working with a multinational bank to automate back office tasks -- and what took five days now takes only a few minutes. Another example: Rio Tinto, which recently extended its contract with Palantir, said Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is helping the metals and mining giant leverage its unstructured data -- as a result, Rio Tinto now can handle problems that before seemed too complicated."", ""In its early days, Palantir was most associated with government contracts, but in recent years and thanks to the AI boom, commercial players have rushed to the company -- especially for AIP, a product released in 2023. AIP, an AI-driven approach applying large language models directly to a specific company's data and needs, has helped customers go from zero to an important use case in just a few hours. Palantir holds AIP boot camps so that potential customers can test the system out, which has fueled contract growth."", ""Now, let's return to my prediction. All of this sounds great -- but why do I think that now, moving forward, Palantir will continue to beat the market?"", 'Many factors may boost Palantir in the months to come, but I see the commercial customer as the biggest growth driver. Palantir allows these customers to almost effortlessly apply AI to their businesses and see enormous results that could be transformative in the near and long term.', 'So, thanks to Palantir, companies and organizations can quickly apply AI to their needs -- and win. And here, Palantir is seeing tremendous momentum, with U.S. commercial revenue soaring 64% to $214 million in the fourth quarter of last year, and U.S. commercial remaining deal value surging 99% to $1.79 billion. Palantir reported the figures early this week. U.S. commercial customer count also demonstrates this momentum, with 73% growth in the quarter year over year.', 'Importantly, Palantir clearly is in the early days of this growth story. U.S. commercial customers today total 382, leaving plenty of room for growth -- and Palantir says it sees ""significant expansion opportunities"" within the current commercial customer base.', ""On top of this, today's $200 billion AI market is forecast to reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade -- in this environment, it's likely demand from commercial customers, who don't want to be left behind in this AI revolution, will remain high."", 'All this makes me confident about my prediction that Palantir will beat the market, potentially in the coming months and over the long term, as its commercial customer growth story unfolds.', 'Adria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The company had already made a name for itself in the defense and intelligence spaces and has been working diligently to prove its mettle for enterprise-level businesses. Those aspirations have come into focus over the past couple of years, as Palantir has gained more than 900%. The commensurate increase in its valuation has raised the alarm and been the subject of much debate in Wall Street circles.', ""Palantir reported results after the market close on Monday, and to say it crushed expectations might be an understatement. Not only did the company easily surpass estimates, but management's guidance suggests its growth will continue to accelerate."", ""Let's take a look at what drove Palantir's robust results and what the future might hold."", 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', ""For the fourth quarter, Palantir generated revenue of $828 million, up 36% year over year and 14% quarter over quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.14, which climbed 75%. To put the results in the context of expectations, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $782 million and EPS of $0.11, so Palantir easily cleared Wall Street's already high bar."", ""The results were fueled by U.S. commercial revenue that jumped 64% year over year and 20% sequentially -- well ahead of management's guidance for growth of at least 50%. The U.S. government segment also answered the call, with revenue climbing 45%."", ""Customer metrics underpinned the company's robust results. Palantir's customer count grew 43% year over year, driven by a 73% increase in U.S. commercial customers. The underlying deals that fueled the results were also eye-opening, as Palantir inked 129 deals worth at least $1 million. Of those, 58 were worth at least $5 million, and 32 were worth at least $10 million."", ""It's worth noting that many of these contracts are also helping to lay the foundation for future profits. The company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or sales not yet booked as revenue -- climbed 40% year over year to $1.73 billion. When RPO is outpacing current revenue growth, it provides insight into future potential, suggesting its growth spurt has further to run."", 'The spark that ignited Palantir\'s blockbuster growth is the company\'s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is revolutionizing the way businesses profit from AI. The company employed a novel approach, hosting boot camps that marry users with Palantir engineers to help them apply AI to mission-critical operations, ""going from zero to use case in five days or less."" That strategy has been wildly successful.', ""Palantir provided full-year revenue guidance for 2025 of $3.75 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 31% at the midpoint of its guidance. The biggest contributor to its rosy outlook is the U.S. commercial segment -- which includes AIP -- as management is now forecasting growth of 54%, up from management's forecast for 50% growth just last quarter."", 'In Palantir\'s letter to shareholders, CEO Alex Karp said of AI, ""We are still in the earliest stages, the beginning of the first act, of a revolution that will play out over years and decades.""', ""The data clearly shows that Palantir is firing on all cylinders. However, some investors are concerned that the stock has gotten away from itself and Wall Street has joined the chorus. Of the 22 analysts that offered an opinion in February, only three rate it a buy or strong buy, 13 rate it a hold, and the remaining six rate hold underperform or sell ratings. Palantir's biggest doubters are nearly universal in citing the stock's valuation as the reason for their bearish calls."", ""A quick look at the numbers helps illustrate why. The stock is currently selling for 412 times earnings and 75 times sales (as of this writing) -- which is astounding by any stretch of the imagination. However, the most widely used valuation metrics tend to fall short when assessing high-growth stocks. Applying the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which considers Palantir's accelerating growth -- clocks in at 0.38, when any number less than 1 suggests an undervalued stock."", ""That said, given its lofty valuation, Palantir will continue to be volatile, and failure on the company's part -- real or perceived -- to live up to investors' elevated expectations could bring the stock crashing down. Recall that between early 2021 and late 2022, Palantir stock shed as much as 83% of its value."", 'The generative AI market is expected to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. If Palantir can successfully navigate the stormy seas of AI adoption and continue to carve out a profitable niche for itself, the stock price could be much higher a decade from now -- but there will likely be numerous pitfalls along the way.', ""Given the company's reliable execution, significant opportunity, and expanding profits, I believe Palantir Technologies is worth owning for the long term.

During the year and quarter ended December 31, 2024, we also excluded the one-time accelerated stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to our Market-Vesting SARs as each is associated with the early acceleration of such Market-Vesting SARs upon achievement of the market condition of such awards. At the time of grant, the achievement of the market condition of the Market-Vesting SARs was difficult to predict and dependent on future events that were uncertain and were not within our control. We believe separate presentation of SARs-adjusted income from operations provides useful information regarding the impacts of our Market-Vesting SARs.', 'Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, adjusted free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for a given period. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.', 'We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.', 'A reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release is included at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future, such as stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.', 'Available Information', 'Palantir uses its Investor Relations website at https://investors.palantir.com as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

The company's latest results once again provoked a fit of market hysteria, sending the stock up 22% in after-hours trading on Wall Street. All the more reason to reinforce the legend of a share that has quintupled in one year, once again pushing the reasonable limits of valuation. But who cares?"", ""The consulting group headed by Peter Thiel and Alexander Karp (the man in purple in the illustration) is built on the promise of its ability to overcome all difficulties to address the complex problems of its clients. It's a bit vague, but it seems to work. As good strategists, the company's directors have also been quick to integrate AI into their range of offerings.

This is no mean feat for a company that generates over 40% of its revenues from a public sector that is about to be swept under the rug by Elon Musk's DOGE."", '', 'Justin Emerson', 'Palantir, always in the right place at the right time', 'February 04, 2025 at 05:10 am EST', ""Palantir's Room For Growth"", 'Pre-market (Indicative prices)', 'Best financial\nportal', '+951% of historical\nperformance', 'More than 20 years\nat your side', '+ 1,000,000\nmembers', 'Quick & easy\ncancellation', 'Our Experts\nare here for you', 'OUR EXPERTS ARE HERE FOR YOU', 'Monday - Friday 9am-12pm / 2pm-6pm GMT + 1']"
