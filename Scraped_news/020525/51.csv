But look past Kupp's past accomplishments and you have a wideout on the wrong side of 30 who has struggled with injuries of late. Now that teams know the Rams want rid of him, the team has that much less leverage. Many squads will simply try to wait the Rams out and wait for Kupp to be released."", 'But something in what Kupp said in his statement after learning he was on the block could inspire the Chargers to make a run at him.', '""I was informed that the team will be seeking a trade immediately and will be working with me and my family to find the right place to continue competing for championships,"" Kupp\'s statement read.

George Pickens seems to be a No. 2, not necessarily a No. 1,"" he said. ""So, the Steelers, like I said, they have their work cut out for them this offseason,""', ""Whether Kupp can still be an alpha wideout is a legitimate question.

""Kupp has aged gracefully into a No. 2 option with the Rams as Puka Nacua has emerged as one of the top pass-catchers in the league, but he himself is still a reliable target who can get open on any down. A player like Kupp is exactly what the Bills need. The Bills have three fourth-round picks and three sixth-round picks. A pair of those sixth-round selections should be able to get the job done for the 32 year-old. If the Rams ask for just a fourth, Buffalo should comply.

Kupp's addition would free things up for Lamb while also giving Dak Prescott another established weapon to throw to. "", ""Baltimore isn't afraid to go after big names in free agency; just a year ago, it signed Derrick Henry to a two-year deal, and we all see how that's worked out for them. Kupp would join a loaded Ravens offense that also includes league MVP Lamar Jackson, fellow wideouts Zay Jones and Rashod Bateman and tight ends Isaiah Likley and Mark Andrews. "", ""Bo Nix thrived last year despite not having the most proven of receiving crops outside of Courtland Sutton. In Denver, Kupp would play with a up-and-coming quarterback and inside Sean Payton's pass-happy offense. Kupp's ability to make plays over the middle would certainly aid Nix, who routinely makes plays outside the pocket. "", ""Buffalo will do whatever it takes to supplant Buffalo as the AFC's best team, and adding Kupp could help them do that. Kupp could be a safety valve for Josh Allen, especially on possession downs. Kupp's presence would surely benefit Buffalo's young receiving corps that includes rookie Keon Coleman and 2022 third-round pick Khalil Shakir. "", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

And after almost being dealt midway through the 2024 season, it now appears the Super Bowl LVI MVP will be on a new team next season. ', ""Kupp also made his feelings about the Rams' decision crystal clear in a message to his fans on social media. "", 'But fully aware the NFL is a business, Kupp appears motivated to help elevate his next team. ', 'Which teams make sense as possible trade destinations for the former NFL Offensive Player of the Year? ', 'Cincinnati Bengals ', 'In an ironic twist, the Bengals, the team Kupp beat in Super Bowl LVI, could be in need of a new star receiver. With Tee Higgins expected to test free agency, Kupp could step right in as his replacement in Cincinnati. ', 'The Bengals would offer Kupp an opportunity to go from catching passes to a future Hall of Famer in Matthew Stafford to a much younger elite signal caller in Joe Burrow. ', ""Kupp would give Burrow a second option behind clear No. 1 target Ja'Marr Chase and someone to help move the chains in the short and intermediate passing game. "", 'New England Patriots ', 'Many have compared Kupp to former Patriots greats Julian Edelman and Wes Welker, making New England an interesting option. ', 'The Patriots believe they have their quarterback of the future, but they need to provide him with more weapons at his disposal. Who better to help Drake Maye take this game to the next level than a reliable veteran receiver like Kupp? ', 'Washington Commanders', ""Even though Jayden Daniels led Washington to the NFC Championship game — the franchises best season in decades — in his rookie season, those who follow the Commanders closely are concerned he may be headed for a sophomore slump if the clear holes on the roster aren't rectified.

', ""Calvin Austin III has had his moments behind Pickens, but he's far from Kupp's level. But with uncertainty at quarterback, Kupp could view Pittsburgh as too risky of an option.

Always free!', 'The Washington Commanders finished so far ahead of schedule that the questions for this offseason are relatively minimal and more so about filling in some spots around their core. Washington successfully identified a rising star at quarterback in Jayden Daniels last offseason. They also added two key pieces to their coaching staff in head coach Dan Quinn and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. Terry McLaurin remains a dangerous threat on the outside and Quinn\'s defense has a few budding prospects across the formation. So while the Commanders look to add to a group that went to the NFC Championship Game this past season, there is not much concern surrounding the actual team heading into the offseason. Instead, the name of the franchise has stirred some discussion, continuing from years of debate and fuss from multiple sides. Washington changed its long time name of the ""Redskins"" to the ""Football Team in 2020. In 2022, the team got a more lasting name in the ""Commanders"" which has lasted through the present day. Amid speculations for change, Commanders owner Josh Harris has made a perfectly clear statement on where the franchise stands. Monday morning, Harris announced the team will not be changing its name and will stick with ""Commanders"" moving forward. “I think it’s now being embraced by our team, by our culture, by our coaching staff. We’re going with that,” Harris said. Very apparent in Harris\' statement is the desire to charter a path forward not only from the team\'s controversial past name, but previous ownership that soured among the fanbase when the team was known as the ""Redskins."" While many Washington fans and fans around the league still embrace the previous name, it is relatively obvious to see where Harris is coming from on this issue. He and the franchise will need to work to blend the present with the rich history of the team. But with a new stadium potentially on the way and their foundational player in the locker room already, the vision for the ""Commanders"" seems the right change at the right time.', 'Four-time National League All-Star Pete Alonso is one of the top remaining MLB free agents. Spending his entire six-year career with the New York Mets, Alonso is coming off a season during which he appeared in all 162 games, finishing with 34 home runs and 88 RBI. Alonso\'s 2024 production was down a bit from his previous two campaigns. After hitting 40 homers and driving in a league-leading 131 runs in 2022, Alonso put up 46 homers and 118 RBI in 2023. Owning a career .854 OPS, the 30-year-old Alonso is a productive hitter who can help elevate a team in need of a first baseman or designated hitter. As MLB free agents come off the board and spring training draws nearer, Alonso\'s list of suitors has dwindled. Several reports have indicated the Toronto Blue Jays and Mets are the only teams pursuing the two-time Home Run Derby champion, and a more recent report has provided an update on that. Per MLB insider Hector Gomez, Toronto has offered Alonso a three-year contract. ""SOURCE: The #BlueJays have offers out to both Pete Alonso (3 years) and Alex Bregman (6 years). The jays are in play to land either of them,"" Gomez reported on X. Alonso reportedly turned down a three-year, $70 million offer from New York (via SNY\'s Andy Martino). Per that same report, it is unlikely Toronto\'s three-year offer to Alonso will exceed that dollar amount, but the team has reportedly decided to offer the slugger a three-year deal. Toronto has been active this offseason, most recently agreeing to a deal with three-time Cy Young award winner Max Scherzer, via ESPN\'s Jeff Passan.', ""New reports coming from NHL insider Frank Seravalli reveal that many Vancouver Canucks players are not happy at all that J.T Miller was traded away from the team. Daily Faceoff insider Frank Seravalli spoke on SN960 radio show recently about Friday's blockbuster trade sending J.T. Miller to the Rangers. The Canucks traded Miller, defenseman Erik Brannstrom and Jackson Dorrington's player rights for Filip Chytil, defenseman Victor Mancini and a 2025 first-round selection (protected for a top-13 selection). The move, Seravalli insisted, was one that Vancouver simply could not avoid, even with a three-game winning streak in tow. Two weeks ago, a similar arrangement had been in motion but collapsed over complications in negotiations with the Rangers, Seravalli disclosed. Although Chytil is the headliner in terms of return, Seravalli advised patience with regard to projecting an impact for him. Most importantly, he insisted, is that the biggest ripple impact will fall to Elias Pettersson, who must shoulder the full brunt of being the undeniably top center for the team. Elliotte Friedman also revealed the latest update on the team's plans for him. Seravalli says many Canucks players felt the wrong guy was traded Aside from its on-ice implications, Seravalli added, many Canucks skaters have been grumbling about the move, feeling it wasn't one that the team necessarily required or wanted. With Miller, a vocal presence and key player, gone, the tension in the room has developed in the form of frustration with management for not getting a different type of move accomplished, Seravalli added. Former NHL player Ryan Whitney also chimed in, saying if he were a Canucks fan right now, he would be absolutely furious that Miller was traded, adding that the wrong guy was moved out ... perhaps hinting Pettersson should have been gone? Now, with cap room cleared, Seravalli predicted additional activity out of Vancouver's brass. Next, eyes will be focused on how management reshapes the roster, and, most particularly, Pettersson's acceptance of increased responsibility."", 'The Pittsburgh Steelers enter the 2025 offseason in the same exact place they were to begin 2024: no clear-cut solution at quarterback, and all their current options are not slated to be on the team. Granted, two of the three quarterbacks from the 2023 season were given away via a cut and a trade, so it was more by choice then. This time, all of their quarterbacks from their most recent campaign are pending free agents. The team can\'t afford to have a complete overhaul of the room again. At least one guy needs to stay. While making an appearance on 93.7 The Fan, Mark Kaboly brought up the quarterback situation and gave some inside knowledge on how the front office feels. However, they may have to work a bit harder to keep their guy. ""I think they\'re more interested in [Justin Fields], but that doesn\'t mean he\'s going to be the guy they choose,"" explained Kaboly. ""If I\'m Justin, I like the position I\'m in right now. \'Oh man, you didn\'t want to sign me last year?\' I\'m sure if they would have went to him last year said, \'Hey, we want to add you here before the season starts for a year or so,\' he might have accepted it."" Justin Fields seems like the obvious choice for the Steelers to keep. He\'s younger, more athletic, and he has a much higher ceiling than the others. He also proved how humble he truly is by not making a scene when he was shockingly benched in the middle of the season. As long as he continues to develop, he could become an electric starter. There have been numerous reports that the organization leans towards Fields more than Russell Wilson, which makes a lot of sense. Wilson is a veteran leader, but that can only take you so far. The decision is simple: you take the guy with the higher ceiling, even if he has the lower floor. Wilson is not getting any younger. His deep ball is still amazing, but that doesn\'t mean anything if he takes sacks, whether or not it\'s his own fault. His pocket presence has been spotty. Even if he\'s the victim of poor offensive tackle play, Fields\' mobility can help make up for that, while Wilson\'s aging legs just simply can\'t do as much anymore. Steelers Need To Act Quickly Unfortunately, that high ceiling could help Fields get more money and/or be in a better situation. As Kaboly points out, the young quarterback is the one with leverage here. For all the reasons mentioned above, teams will be looking to bring him in to be their starter as opposed to Wilson. Before the 2024 season, assistant general manager Andy Weidl confidently stuck with the Steelers\' decision to give neither option an extension and figure everything out afterwards. Now, he and the rest of the front office need to figure out how to keep Fields around without overpaying him. Obviously, teams like the Steelers prefer upside over declining veterans. The front office should have foreseen this before the 2024 season. If they did, Fields would already be confirmed for the season for less money than he\'d make on any team in 2025. Tradition may have gotten in the way of logic yet again. According to Spotrac, Fields\' market value is set at about $6.4 million for just one year. However, why would he simply accept that when he will most likely have plenty of other suitors willing to give him more? If they truly want to keep him, it will likely have to be with a deal for at least two years. If not, they will have to go with Plan B: an even older version of Wilson, then play this game again in 2026.', 'Join hundreds of thousands of readers who start their day with The Morning Bark, the best newsletter in sports.']"

Rams Willing To Eat Money In Kupp Trade,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2025/02/rams-willing-to-eat-money-in-kupp-trade,"['In their search for a Cooper Kupp trade partner, the Rams are willing to eat some of the money remaining on the star wide receiver’s contract, according to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler.', 'Kupp is set to earn $20MM in 2025, made up of $12.5MM in base salary and a $7.5MM 90-man roster bonus due on March 17, per OverTheCap. $5MM of that roster bonus became fully guaranteed in 2024.', 'A pre-June 1 trade would already require the Rams to absorb the remaining prorations of Kupp’s signing bonus as a $17.26MM dead cap hit in 2025.

The delay would also cost them 2025 draft capital in addition to the opportunity to sign top free agents in March.', 'Accordingly, the Rams would rather get a trade done before the new league year starts, explaining their willingness to absorb even more of Kupp’s contract. In the past, the Rams have paid a roster bonus early as a way of eating money to facilitate a trade, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. That would help firm up a market for Kupp, who is expected to have suitors due to his pedigree as a tough, savvy, and versatile playmaker. If the Rams can alleviate the financial burden of acquiring the 31-year-old, his age and recent injuries would be his only remaining concerns.', 'Kupp’s skillset would make him a fit in almost any NFL offense, but certain teams will make more sense than others.

Moving on from Cooper Kupp is first domino to fall in Rams fixing the offense,https://www.turfshowtimes.com/2025/2/4/24358611/rams-offense-identity-sean-mcvay-cooper-kupp,"['FILED UNDER:', 'For the Rams offense to change where it needs to in 2025, moving on from Cooper Kupp was necessary', 'The Los Angeles Rams offense is going under another identity change this offseason following the team moving on from wide receiver Cooper Kupp. It won’t be the first time this has happened. Head coach Sean McVay has been one of the best at adjusting and improving the offense from a year-over-year basis. In 2021, the Rams moved to more of an under center, play-action game to more empty with Matthew Stafford at quarterback. Two years ago, the offense made arguably its biggest identity shift moving from a zone run scheme to more gap and duo concepts.', 'Coming off of a season in which the offense finished 15th in EPA per play and 13th from week 9-17, it’s not something that McVay will be content with. Even in 2023 with the offense dealing with injuries, the Rams offense finished 9th in EPA per play. It’s not often that a McVay offense finishes outside of the top-10 and the 2024 season was the first time that it happened since 2020 when they finished 23rd.', 'While 15th isn’t bad, it’s an average or above average standard that McVay has never settled for offensively. The most concerning part of the Rams offense was the lack of explosive plays. They ranked 15th in pass plays of 20 or more yards and just 19th in passes that traveled more than 20 yards in the air.', 'The offense struggled creating yards after catch. They finished 13th in yards after the catch per reception which was down from fifth in 2023. Their 5.44 yards after catch per reception was only .07 yards better than 2022 when Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp missed half of the season. That doesn’t even mention the run game in which they ranked 32nd in explosive run rate by nearly a full percentage.', 'Due to the lack of explosive plays, scoring for the Rams offense was hard. While they were efficient on a play-by-play standpoint, they averaged the fifth most plays per drive. However, unlike other teams in the top-5, they were just 15th in scores per drive. That was the lowest among the other teams in the top-5 in plays per drive. For comparison, the Rams were sixth in plays per drive in 2023, but they were also seventh in scores per drive.', 'After the season, McVay said about the offense,', '“I think the biggest thing is there would be a little bit more versatility...How do you utilize the offseason and how are you making yourself more versatile from a personnel perspective or from a run variety perspective? Those are the things that I’m excited to be able to dive into. I was talking to Liam Coen the other day. One of the coolest things that I think is reflected about what a great job he did was you’ve got a background and then when you watch them evolve with Bucky Irving and the way they ran the football and some of the variety and personnel groupings, I thought that was a cool reflection of maybe we think we’re going to do that and then what you evolved into if you’re able to understand that the best coaches adjust to their players. That’s what we’ve got to do a good job of as it moves forward from what it looks like from our offensive line and from the surrounding parts with our backs. I could go on and on about the variety of things that I’m excited about attacking to hopefully avoid some of the pitfalls that we had throughout the year to ultimately lead to more consistent production and play regardless of whatever our injury situation is.”', 'The Rams running it back with the same personnel was never going to happen. It’s true that they came 14 yards away from hosting the NFC Championship game and arguably then going to the Super Bowl. With that said, it’s also true that the Rams offense had its issues outside of the injuries. To simply run it back as is would be getting complacent and content. Over the past eight years, it’s pretty clear that’s not how McVay works. If a coach isn’t consistently trying to find an edge, they fall behind. That was a lesson that McVay learned after losing in 2018. The NFL is constantly evolving.', 'For much of the McVay era, the Rams offense has been intertwined with a lot of the pieces looking alike. That’s not a bad thing, but it also limits how much versatility an offense has from a personnel standpoint. Robert Woods and Kupp did different things, but they were both similar style wide receivers. Puka Nacua is a similar style of wide receiver as both Kupp and Woods. It’s true that he does some things differently and very well, but the overall play-style is similar. The same can be said about Jordan Whittington.', 'When the Rams have tried to introduce a different style of wide receiver such as a vertical deep threat, it’s mostly failed. It’s not a role that they’ve been consistently able to fulfill. There was some success with Brandin Cooks, but it has been the “tweener” big slot type receivers that have had the most success in the McVay offense.', 'The same can be said about the run game. Blake Corum was drafted last year because he was a similar style player as Kyren Williams. When Williams was hurt in 2023, the run game struggled. However, that seemed to be more about the talent behind Williams than the style of player. There’s going to be a drop off when you go from Williams to Royce Freeman or Darrell Henderson.', 'It seems McVay is starting to realize this to an extent. While moving on from Kupp isn’t an easy decision from an emotional standpoint, it was probably the correct one. Kupp wasn’t separating as well as he used to and wasn’t as dynamic after the catch.', 'The Rams offense is going to shift this offseason and the skill position players are likely going to look a lot different. This is a wide receiver room that’s going to be built around Puka Nacua and his skillset. That’s one reason why the Rams needed to move on from Kupp. This offseason is going to be about adding and finding wide receiver archetypes that best complement Nacua and building the passing game around him. That has to be the priority as well as getting some versatility in the running back room.', 'At the end of the day, what the Rams offense looks like is going to be different. What that exactly means is yet to be determined. What does the personnel look like? What schematic changes does McVay make? McVay has changed his offensive identity over the years and there’s a chance next season is version 2.5 of that offense. The first step of accomplishing that heading into 2025 was moving on from Kupp.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Now that the Rams are trying to trade him, they’ll have to be willing to absorb a sizable chunk of his 2025 pay in order to find a suitor.', 'Kupp is due to make $20 million in 2025, in the form of a $12.5 million salary and a $7.5 million roster bonus. Last year, $5 million of the bonus became fully guaranteed.', 'His days of making $20 million per year seem to be over. If a new team expects him to take less as part of a trade, all he has to do is refuse — and the end result is that the Rams will have to pay him the full $20 million or cut him and owe $5 million.', 'That could require the Rams to commit to paying more of the $20 million, in order to work out a trade. They’d basically be trading Kupp and cash/cap space for whatever they can get from a new team by way of one or more draft picks.', 'They also could pay Kupp the $7.5 million roster bonus and squat on his non-guaranteed salary pending a potential trade. That would make it harder for Kupp to find a landing spot, if he’s cut too late in the offseason to get a contract approaching his current market value.', 'In the end, the entire exercise could be aimed at getting Kupp to take less. If/when he realizes that no one else is willing to pay him more than what the Rams are willing to pay on a reduced deal, he might decide to take the $7.5 million plus whatever else the Rams offer for 2025.

"Cooper Kupp landing spots: Patriots, Steelers among top trade fits for Rams WR",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2025/02/04/cooper-kupp-trade-landing-spots-patriots-steelers/78202591007/,"[""Cooper Kupp apparently showed the Los Angeles Rams' hand on Monday when the former Super Bowl MVP said the team hoped to trade him this offseason."", 'Orchestrating a deal for the 31-year-old, however, might not come easily.', ""After winning the NFL's receiving triple crown in a campaign in which he was named the league's Offensive Player of the Year, Kupp has missed 18 regular-season games in the last three seasons due to injury. Compounding the complications are the financial factors, as Kupp is due a $7.5 million roster bonus and $12.5 million in salary in 2025. That payout might prove untenable for teams poking around on a player who has not reached 850 receiving yards in a season since 2021, meaning the Rams might need to either be willing to foot the bill for a portion of what Kupp is due or outright release him."", ""Regardless, the receiver's market should materialize in the coming weeks."", ""Here are six teams that could be fits for Kupp, either in a potential trade or as a free-agent landing spot if he's released."", 'All things Rams: Latest Los Angeles Rams news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.', ""It's easy to draw the connection here after Nick Caley, who last year served as the Rams' passing game coordinator, was hired to be Houston's offensive coordinator. Caley was only with Los Angeles for the last two years, so he hasn't worked with Kupp at his peak. But there's little question that Houston should be evaluating options for a trusted target given Tank Dell's uncertain timeline for a return from his gruesome knee injury suffered in December and Stefon Diggs' free-agent status. Kupp could take over Diggs' work as a short-to-intermediate target while allowing Nico Collins to remain the focal point of the offense, and his addition could help C.J. Stroud better navigate the protection problems that plagued the attack in 2024. The financials, however, could be tricky, as Houston currently has just $101,000 in cap space, according to Over The Cap."", ""With a league-high $120 million in cap space at their disposal, the Patriots should be plenty active this offseason in reshaping their offense around Drake Maye. But might New England have their sights set on other pass catchers? Tee Higgins looks to be the most transformational figure available for the aerial attack, and New England is well positioned to win any bidding war it chooses to enter for the pending free agent. Still, Kupp could be one part of an overhaul of the receiving corps, and he could help New England claw closer to Robert Kraft's stated desire of getting back to the playoffs."", ""Another team flush with cap space, the Commanders have more than $78 million available for 2025. That doesn't mean that Dan Quinn and Adam Peters will rush out to burn the flexibility afforded to them by Jayden Daniels' rookie deal, but Washington might be more equipped than many other teams to tolerate some risk here. A solid No. 2 receiver could elevate the attack given that no wideout came within half of Terry McLaurin's 1,096 receiving yards on the season. Kupp would serve as a fine complement to McLaurin, who is arguably the league's best in contested catch scenarios and thrives as a downfield option. But the two-time Pro Bowler is also due a hefty extension, and Washington might not want to reconfigure its receiver room around another high-cost option."", ""They're not exactly a move away from contending for the NFC North crown, so maybe this move would be a tough sell for general manager Ryan Poles. But Chicago does have nearly $63 million in cap space available, ranking sixth among all teams. And after the Keenan Allen acquisition backfired, the Bears could stand to add a safety valve for Caleb Williams as the quarterback tries to master new coach Ben Johnson's offense by learning to play more on schedule."", ""This doesn't seem like a pure Sean Payton move, as the coach might be more inclined to fill a void for the Joker role of a running back or tight end who can create mismatches in the passing game with their versatility. But finding a veteran playmaker in free agency could prove difficult, and Denver has to consider all of its options for better supporting Bo Nix in Year 2 of the quarterback's tenure. Establishing more consistency might begin with finding any pass catchers who can regularly create separation in the intermediate area, and Kupp can step in to solve that issue."", ""Mike Tomlin's team doesn't have clarity at quarterback yet after the coach said the team needed to weigh all of its options with Russell Wilson and Justin Fields both currently ticketed for free agency. No matter what the plan of attack behind center, however, a receiving corps that too often depended on volatile wideout George Pickens is due for a recalibration. Kupp could represent one of Pittsburgh's better shots at implementing a more sustainable offense in 2025, and his blocking should make him a fast favorite of both Tomlin and offensive coordinator Arthur Smith."", 'The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.']"

It took Calvin Austin III seven weeks to see that many footballs come his way, Van Jefferson eight.', 'It might also be worth noting that Austin, Jefferson and Mike Williams did not have a 1,000-yard season combined. Or that all of Pittsburgh’s wideouts not named George Pickens combined to produce just 1,094 receiving yards in 2024.', 'The Steelers’ need for wide receiver help is real and spectacular. There’s also sure to be plenty of speculation surrounding Kupp, who announced Monday that he’s on the trade block, though it’s hardly as simple as marrying a need with an available solution.', 'That said, it would be foolish to not at least kick the tires on Kupp, who led the NFL in catches (145), yards (1,947) and touchdowns (16) in 2021, making first team All-Pro, winning NFL Offensive Player of the Year and being named MVP of Super Bowl LVI.', 'However, perhaps appropriate given his position, there’s a catch.', 'A few of them, really.', 'The most obvious involves money. Or the balance of Kupp’s contract when mixed with his age (turns 32 in June), declining production and an inability to stay healthy (he has appeared in every regular season game just twice in eight years).', 'Before digging any deeper, let’s get this out of the way: It’s hard to see the Steelers (or any team) acquiring Kupp without some sort of financial adjustment made to his contract, specifically the Rams eating a portion of the receiver’s $7.5 million roster bonus that would be payable in March.', 'As things currently stand, Kupp is due $20 million in 2025, which factors in his $12.5 base salary. Kupp’s cap hit, when accounting for signing bonus and restructure money, falls at an unwieldy $29,780,000.', 'The “good” news is that nothing is guaranteed for Kupp on the final year of his contract, but it would carry a $27,330,000 cap hit if nothing was done.', 'Which is another way of saying that no sane team will pay the Rams to inherit that situation, especially for someone who has averaged 753 receiving yards while missing 18 of his past 51 regular season games.', 'Kupp has been hurt a bunch and lost the No. 1 receiving spot in Los Angeles to Puka Nacua, but that’s hardly a reason for the Steelers to sit this one out.', 'If you think about it, this is actually directly in their wheelhouse considering what Kupp has done in his prime — sure-handed, great over the middle, isn’t afraid to block — and general manager Omar Khan’s background.', 'Isn’t Khan the master of manipulating contracts and squeezing things under the salary cap?', 'A Kupp deal would take some creativity given the current financials. However, given the Steelers’ less-than-desirable situation at wide receiver, I’d like to see them find a creative way to get this done.', 'After all, the Rams are looking for an out here because Kupp’s production no longer matches his cap hit. Their leverage is limited if they want something in return. Failing that, it could make sense for them to wait this out and cut Kupp, allowing him to become a free agent.', 'But if I’m Khan, I’m trying to think differently here, assuming some semblance of an offensive posture and knowing passivity in this space has already cost my team. The price might be a fourth- or even a third-round pick, but that’s a gamble I’d be willing to take for a reworked Kupp contract and the possibility that he could really thrive here.', 'That is, of course, if Kupp indeed wanted this, which unfortunately feels like another wrinkle we must consider.', 'In his post, Kupp said the Rams would work with him and his family to find “the right place and continue competing for championships.” The jokes were quick and easy: Pittsburgh isn’t exactly that place right now, Cooper.', 'Seriously, though, a more practical question to consider might be this: Does Kupp want to play for a team where he doesn’t know who will be throwing him the ball?', 'Sure, his opinion may not matter. The Rams can still trade him regardless. But given the uncertainty, at least publicly, at quarterback, it feels like that’s input that may have to be considered.', 'Nevertheless, the Steelers have a golden (and blue) opportunity to address a glaring need in a big way. When healthy, Kupp has been among the best in the game. His skill set also offers a perfect complement to that of George Pickens.', 'Working something out with Kupp could also save the Steelers a high-round draft choice on a wide receiver, which seems to be the flavor du jour in the form of Emeka Egbuka. Nothing against the Ohio State wideout, who would be a delightful addition, but the Steelers have myriad other needs, especially on the defensive line.', 'I’m not advocating to blindly pay Kupp $20 million in 2025. But the Steelers do need wide receiver help and are run by a GM who’s known for his creativity with contracts. We’re also talking about a player who was of interest as recently as the trade deadline.', 'The Steelers might not have a quarterback at the moment, but they have to at least attempt the pass, right?', 'First Published: February 4, 2025, 7:18 a.m.\nUpdated: February 4, 2025, 7:19 a.m.']"

Nice pick, Rams.', 'Cooper Kupp has had a whale of a career with the Los Angeles Rams. The Super Bowl LVI MVP was the NFL’s Offensive Player of the Year in 2021, as voted by the Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers of America. That season, Kupp also earned first-team All-Pro honors and a Pro Bowl nod after compiling a league-leading 145 catches, 1,947 receiving yards, and 16 touchdowns. There are few route-runners as crisp as Kupp, who teams that ability with an affinity of catching everything his way.', 'Unfortunately, injuries have kept Cooper Kupp from reaching his potential. There have only been two seasons (2019, 2021) in which Kupp has played in 100 percent of his team’s regular season games. That he has not done so since 2021 is likely to be viewed as a yellow flag by any team that wishes to acquire him this offseason. But make no mistake, there will be a market for Kupp. A trade might not yield the largest return, but I don’t doubt that one of the NFL’s other 31 teams will want to roll the dice on someone with his skills.', 'With that being said, I do not expect the Chicago Bears to be one of those teams kicking the tires on Cooper Kupp. DJ Moore is already locked into a long-term deal. Rome Odunze is coming off a solid, but unspectacular rookie season. Keenan Allen is set to become a free agent when the new league year opens its doors in March, but has left the door open for a return to Chicago. This isn’t to say that I wouldn’t welcome Kupp on the Bears. However, I do not think it would be a good fit.

Cooper Kupp trade fits: Six logical landing spots for former Super Bowl MVP,https://www.nfl.com/news/cooper-kupp-trade-fits-six-logical-landing-spots-for-former-super-bowl-mvp,"['Wide receiver Cooper Kupp released a statement Monday saying he was informed by the Los Angeles Rams that the team is seeking to trade him ""immediately.""', ""The former All-Pro is coming off a campaign in which he caught 67 passes for 710 yards and six touchdowns in 12 games. It was the third straight season that Kupp, who will turn 32 in June, missed time due to injury, with 18 total games lost since 2022 -- even so, the veteran totaled over 700 receiving yards and at least five TD catches in each of the past three seasons. Kupp has played a full regular-season slate just twice in his eight years with Los Angeles, most recently in 2021, when he won the NFL's receiving triple crown and helped the Rams win Super Bowl LVI."", ""Kupp's contract will no doubt play a factor in any prospective trade, as he is due $20 million in 2025 and $19.85 million in 2026, per NFL Network Insider Mike Garafolo. But in terms of roster fit, there are several intriguing possible landing spots for the veteran heading into the 2025 NFL season."", 'So, with the Rams looking to move their longtime receiver, we asked our analysts to answer the following question:', 'What is the best trade destination for Cooper Kupp?', 'The Washington Commanders struck gold with Jayden Daniels in Year 1. Now it’s time to keep giving him weapons to put this team in position to make another run at the NFC championship. Terry McLaurin is a great talent at receiver. Washington needs more than that for this offense to keep evolving. The Commanders are projected to have a ton of cap space, so they can handle Kupp’s contract. They also have the understanding that the team that beat them in the NFC Championship Game, the Philadelphia Eagles, reside with them in the NFC East. It won’t be easy for the Commanders to again go as far as they did in 2024, but adding Kupp will make that goal much more attainable.', 'Kupp’s grit, toughness and championship pedigree make him an ideal fit for DeMeco Ryans’ rising program and the Texans’ new offense. The former triple-crown winner would re-team with recently hired offensive coordinator Nick Caley, with whom Kupp spent the past two seasons in L.A., giving the first-time play-caller a familiar face and respected leader to help establish his scheme. Not only would Kupp serve as a sure-handed option for C.J. Stroud in the passing game, but his willingness and proficiency as a blocker would provide a boost to the run game, as well. And with Stefon Diggs and Robert Woods due to hit free agency and Tank Dell still recovering from his serious leg injury, the 31-year-old former Super Bowl MVP could be just the veteran voice the Texans’ young WR room needs to help them, and the team overall, better contend with the conference’s heavyweights next season.', ""The Baltimore Ravens have a history of bringing in big-name stars who are on the back end of their careers (SEE: Steve Smith Sr. and DeSean Jackson). Kupp would join the Ravens offense as the third or fourth receiving option -- behind Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman -- which is ideal at Kupp's age. Lamar Jackson would greatly benefit from having a sure-handed Kupp in the middle of the field. Kupp's salary could make it hard for Baltimore to acquire him, but I love the on-field fit."", ""If you can't beat him … acquire him? Bengals fans might flinch at trading for Kupp, the Super Bowl LVI MVP who, along with Aaron Donald, sent Cincy home without a Lombardi three seasons ago. But with Tee Higgins possibly out the door and 2024 third-rounder Jermaine Burton already on the roster bubble, the Bengals are in need of a sure-handed WR to pair with Ja'Marr Chase and hold things down for Joe Burrow. Higgins played on a $21.8 million tag in 2024 and would be owed over $25 million if tagged again in 2025. Barring an extension for Higgins that lowers that number (unlikely), Kupp is a cheaper option with less long-term upside but comparable production and availability in the immediate future."", ""The Bills make a lot of sense. They have been among the AFC's elite for years and could use an offensive veteran to help get them over the Super Bowl hump. Kupp fits the Buffalo mold as a gritty, dependable receiver with postseason experience. With Amari Cooper and Mack Hollins heading to free agency, Kupp would be a perfect complement to young receivers Khalil Shakir and Keon Coleman in the passing attack. Plus, he's a willing blocker in the run game."", ""There has already been change in Jacksonville this offseason with the hiring of new head coach Liam Coen, and there's a chance the team moves on from Christian Kirk. Kupp would be a great replacement in the slot working alongside Brian Thomas Jr. and Gabe Davis. Plus, Kupp's leadership skills will undoubtedly help build the culture under the new regime."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
