""If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office.', '', '', '""It\'s no different than our prison system, except it would be a lot less expensive, and it would be a great deterrent,"" Trump added.', ""He said he would negotiate payment, which would decrease costs for the United States but help fund El Salvador's own mass incarceration."", 'Trump said that shipping criminals to El Salvador would be ""a very small fee compared to what we pay to private prisons.""', '""Frankly, they could keep them, because these people are never going to be any good,"" Trump said.', 'Trump\'s top envoy Rubio, who met Bukele on Monday, also said the Trump administration would review the proposal but acknowledged legal issues.

They are packed into cells without enough bunks for everyone. Moreover, there are no programs preparing these prisoners to return to society after their sentences-- no workshops or educational programs-- as they are never allowed outside.', ""Bukele's iron-fisted rule has been greatly credited for reducing gang violence in the Central American country since launching a sweeping crackdown in 2022 that has seen the imprisonment of over 80,000 people. But while the crime rate in what was once one of the world's most violent countries has fallen, the treatment of those imprisoned has triggered outrage among human rights organizations who call El Salvador's prisons inhumane."", ""Meanwhile, as part of his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, Trump has already announced that the United States will hold migrants at the notorious Guantanamo military detention facility in Cuba that was opened in January 2002. But that prison is built on a US naval base leased from Havana under a treaty dating back to 1903."", 'The detention facility was set up after the 11 September 2001 attacks to deal with prisoners who were termed ""enemy combatants"" and denied many US legal rights. Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden both sought to close the facility, but Congress has opposed efforts to shut Guantanamo and it remains open to this day.', 'Ahead of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio\'s visit this week, Washington had touted El Salvador as a possible ""safe third country"" for expelled migrants whose countries do not accept US deportation flights.', 'On Tuesday, the United States began flying detained migrants to the notorious military base in Cuba, where hundreds of terrorism suspects were held for years after the 9/11 attacks, many without formal charges.', 'Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world']"

You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.,https://www.democracynow.org/2025/2/4/rubio_right_wing_latin_america,"[""Sign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day."", 'As Secretary of State Marco Rubio visits Latin America on his first foreign trip in his new post, we look at the Trump administration’s policy orientation toward the right-wing government of El Salvador and the left-wing government of Guatemala with journalist Roman Gressier. Rubio is visiting both countries during his trip, which is expected to cement Trump’s ties to Salvadoran strongman enthusiast Nayib Bukele and to the conservative opposition in Guatemala. Rubio’s top agenda items are anti-immigration enforcement and U.S. competition with China.', 'AMY GOODMAN: We want to bring Roman Gressier into this conversation. He’s in Guatemala City, where Secretary of State Rubio will be. Roman, first we want to talk about what happened in Salvador. President Trump made his first call to a foreign leader, Saudi Arabia. His second was to Bukele in El Salvador. And now Bukele, as Rubio was just leaving there, has promised to imprison American prisoners for a fee at the much admired, by Trump, but horrified by human rights groups, prison system in El Salvador and also to take deportees from any country. The significance of this?', 'ROMAN GRESSIER: Hi. It’s great to be back with you.', 'Look, I think, in terms of the legal U.S. courts question and international law, I’m not sure how that latter promise will play out. But what we can observe is that a — look, Bukele was close to Trump in his first term, and this is a way of cementing that closeness into a migration-driven alliance in his second term.', 'From the rhetorical, where we saw a couple months ago, last June to be exact, we saw Trump Jr., we saw Tucker Carlson and other figures in the MAGA sphere at Bukele’s unconstitutional inauguration of his second term, and that was already on the rhetorical end. And then there’s the anti-woke discourse that they share and a certain affinity rhetorically again. And then, now they’re moving more formally into the realm of migration cooperation.', 'Now, in 2019, the Trump administration had negotiated with El Salvador a safe third country agreement. And this would clearly, at least on the rhetorical end, go much further than that. We’ll have to see what actually — parsing the language a little bit, Rubio said that Bukele had “offered” to receive U.S. citizens convicted of crimes and incarcerated in the United States. But the other things were “Bukele agreed to.” So I think that the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 deportees are perhaps more immediately likely or possible than the latter.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Roman, I wanted to ask you — of the five countries that Rubio is visiting, all of them have relatively conservative governments, and with the exception of Guatemala. What do you expect — what’s your sense of what Rubio hopes to get out of Guatemala and how that government may respond?', 'ROMAN GRESSIER: I think migration is the item of the day. Rubio will be arriving this afternoon, and he’ll be here tomorrow — excuse me. And tomorrow afternoon, he’ll be giving a press conference summing up his Guatemala trip.', 'The Arévalo administration, since the transition, has been meeting with Trump officials and the Heritage Foundation to promote the idea that they can get along and that, as they told the U.S. press on background — I don’t think they wanted to put a name to it, perhaps for optics, but they told the U.S. press on background that the Arévalo administration would be open to discussing the possibility of receiving regional return deportees. So, I think, on that plane, that will be a topic of discussion, and it’s certainly of interest to Marco Rubio.', 'But there’s a broader political issue where the Arévalo administration has been trying to send the signal that they can get along, in part because the public prosecutor’s office, which has been working to — which first worked to prevent Arévalo from taking office in January 2024, has now been working to put him on trial, remove him from office, etc. And just last week, the Supreme Court decided to move forward with a probe of Arévalo that could possibly lead to the revocation of his immunity from prosecution. Anyhow, it’s a very draw-out process, but the Supreme Court kicked the ball forward on that last week. So I think that domestic context is very important, given that the attorney general and her office have been eagerly courting Trump’s support and trying to promote the idea that they defend a conservative agenda.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I’m wondering if you could — if we could look back at the broader picture of this indication of the Trump administration focusing on Latin America in its first days in office, ostensibly over the migration crisis and fentanyl, but also over China’s growing influence. Isn’t the reality already that China has become the main economic partner of South America? It’s the largest trading partner with South America and the second largest with Latin America as a whole. So, really, the United States has been for now decades losing control of the markets of Latin America for its goods. Your sense of whether this has any impact on how the Trump administration is approaching the region?', 'ROMAN GRESSIER: Yeah, I think you’re right about that. It does have Marco Rubio’s fingerprint on it. And even in his recent Senate hearings during the Biden administration, he would frequently talk about Chinese influence in the region. Honduras broke relations with Taiwan two years ago. And Guatemala and Belize, which is part of the Commonwealth, the British Commonwealth, are the only two remaining countries now. Guatemala has kind of a balancing act, where they maintain historic relations with Taiwan while also having informal commercial ties to China. And I think that that could possibly be a topic of discussion for the visit, too, especially given that Marco Rubio is very interested in China policy as it pertains to Central America and the broader region, as you pointed out.', 'AMY GOODMAN: And very quickly, Roman, Latin America and particularly Central America, a place for the Trump administration to actually make money. You have President Trump’s nominee to be secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, also has ties to El Salvador. He’s the billionaire CEO of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which is a major backer of Tether, a cryptocurrency firm that recently announced it’s relocating to El Salvador. Bloomberg recently ran an article headlined “Commerce Nominee Lutnick Is Backer of Outlaws’ Favorite Cryptocurrency.” The article states that Tether is used by, quote, “drug traffickers, terrorists and scammers to move money around the world.” Your response, Roman?', 'ROMAN GRESSIER: I don’t want to get in over my head on that. I wasn’t aware of Lutnick’s relationship, but it is true that Tether does have a presence in El Salvador. And an array of cryptocurrency companies, major players on the global scale, have had some type of presence in El Salvador since 2021, when the bitcoin law was passed, though I would note that the bitcoin law was basically gutted in recent days.

No country’s ever made an offer of friendship such as this. We are profoundly grateful.”', 'The US State Department describes El Salvador’s overcrowded prisons as “harsh and dangerous”. The department’s website, in the information on El Salvador, says “in many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control, and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent”.', 'Rubio added that Bukele was also willing to take back Salvadoran citizens as well as foreign nationals.

He had just met with Bukele at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.', ""After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges."", ""Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet Trump administration demands for a major crackdown on immigration amid turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency."", ""He arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to reduce or eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so."", ""Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador."", ""President Donald Trump's administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States."", 'The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a ""safe third country"" agreement. That would mean the U.S. could deport non-Salvadorean migrants to El Salvador.', ""Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality."", 'Rubio said Bukele then went further and said his country was willing to accept and to jail U.S. citizens or legal residents convicted of and imprisoned for violent crimes.', 'Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.', 'Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, criticized the ""safe third country"" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington\'s ""backyard to dump the garbage.""', 'The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.', ""Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras."", '""Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,"" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. ""It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it\'s not good for anyone.""', ""Monday's deportation flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States."", '""This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,"" Rubio said. ""And it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we\'re going to continue to do it.""', 'His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.', ""While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency."", 'Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.', 'The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades — although its new status will likely be challenged in court — and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.', 'In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.', ""On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative."", '""I understand that it\'s a delicate issue in Panama,"" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. ""We don\'t want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,"" he said. ""I don\'t believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it\'ll yield fruits and result in the days to come.""', 'But back in Washington, Trump was less diplomatic, saying: ""China\'s involved with the Panama Canal. They won\'t be for long and that\'s the way it has to be.""', '""We either want it back, or we\'re going to get something very strong, or we\'re going to take it back,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""And China will be dealt with.""', 'As he has in the past, Trump again criticized the Carter administration for having signed a 1970s treaty to cede control of the canal to Panama and said it was a pact that Panama has since ""totally violated.""', '""They\'ve agreed to certain things, but I\'m not happy with it,"" Trump said.', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
