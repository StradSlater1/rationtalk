It slapped tariffs of up to 15% on U.S. imports of coal and liquefied natural gas and 10% higher duties on crude oil, farm equipment and selected cars, effective Feb. 10."", 'However, stocks showed little reaction to the news after Canada and Mexico on Monday managed to delay their tariffs for at least a month. Trump is set to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday about pausing tariffs, media reports said citing White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.', 'The broad S&P 500 index closed up 0.72%, or 43.31 points, to 6,037.88; the blue-chip Dow gained 0.3%, or 134.13 points, to 44,556.04; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq edged up 1.35%, or 262.06 points, to 19,654.02. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.517%.', ""Wall Street's coming off a volatile session on Monday when Trump's 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico caused a sell off that pushed the Dow down more than 600 points near the open. Initially, it looked like a full out trade war would erupt, with Canada announcing its own tariffs and Mexico considering some."", 'Invest wisely: Best online brokers', ""However, sentiment turned around and stocks erased much of their losses by the close after Mexico agreed to provide more border support to delay the tariffs for a month to buy time for more negotiations. Canada later made a similar move, suggesting to some analysts that Trump's tariff threats are a negotiating tool."", ""Trump's trade war with Mexico and Canada is on hold for now, but Deutsche Bank analysts say the fight with China is fundamentally different."", '""China\'s economic development in recent years, instead of moving it towards a consumer-oriented economy, has moved in the direction of a more advancedmanufacturing economy,"" they wrote in a note. ""This is now causing consternation in the West, with China making strides in many high-value added capital goods. While the U.S. is still the second-largest goods producer, it has less than half of China\'s global share, with many U.S. allies also seeing significant drops in their manufacturing share over the past 30 years. This may now have gone too far. Access to cheaper goods is no longer a good \'trade\' for the U.S. given the loss of economic security over production supply chains and technologies to a competing power.""', 'That means ""the U.S.-China trade war is likely to be fundamentally more enduring than the U.S.’s disputes with its neighbours,"" they said.', 'But even if more enduring, China has shown signs it wants to negotiate a pause. Trump and Xi are due to talk on Tuesday, reports said.', '""It seems investors were a bit sceptical this was the start of a trade war,"" wrote Hubert de Barochez, senior economist at Capital Economics, in a report. ""The peak-to-trough fall of nearly 2% in the S&P 500 (on Monday) was far from uncommon by past standards, and much less deep at the start of the trade war in 2018.

The cryptocurrency was last down 3.54% to $97,891.11, below the key psychological $100,000 mark.', 'However, some analysts note there remains an underlying bullishness to the cryptocurrency with Trump in office.', 'On Monday, Trump announced a U.S. sovereign fund, which ""has been met with significant approval, as investors see it as a foundation for future government purchases of bitcoin,"" said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at UK-based trading platform CMC Markets.
