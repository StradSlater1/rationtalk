Elon Musk is the X-factor in the new Trump administration,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/1/31/elon-musk-is-the-x-factor-in-the-new-trump-administration,"['Musk has grand designs to rework the world according to his own whims, and he now has the weight of the US government behind him.', 'Save articles to read later and create your own reading list.', 'Billionaire Elon Musk dedicated significant personal time and at least $260m to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.', 'That massive investment paid off for Trump, who has now returned to the White House. And it’s paid off for Musk, who has bought himself a choice seat at the new president’s table – he literally dined with the Trump family on Thanksgiving.', 'Musk has also been given a potentially powerful role as head of the “Department of Government Efficiency”, a nebulous nongovernmental entity charged with auditing the entire federal government. And as Trump begins to reassert his foreign policy in his early days back in office, Musk has made himself a key presence in Trump’s ad hoc diplomacy.', 'Musk joined Trump on a call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and at the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.', 'Musk’s growing role as an adviser, and perhaps more, on issues of foreign policy presents one of the biggest wild cards for the new Trump administration. If Musk remains as influential in the Trump administration as he has been during the campaign and transition periods, we are poised to see an American foreign policy driven by Musk’s net worth, his worldview, and, most notably, his ego.', 'Musk’s nine-figure investment in getting Trump elected has already benefitted Musk financially. Tesla’s market cap topped $1 trillion and Musk’s personal fortune grew to more than $300bn immediately after Trump’s win. Investors are counting on Musk’s companies benefitting from access to Trump, and they have good reason to believe that even American foreign policy will bend to serve these corporate interests.', 'Musk has managed to funnel American taxpayer dollars into his business ventures for years by painting his bottom line as a public good. Early in the Obama administration, the federal government extended a $465m loan to Tesla as part of its economic stimulus and clean energy agendas, helping the company move from a niche player to a major force in the auto industry. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times documented nearly $5bn in government subsidies acquired by Musk’s companies, including Telsa and SpaceX, and that number has only grown over time. For instance, although Musk had initially donated the use of his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine during its war against Russia, the Pentagon quietly picked up the tab for an undisclosed amount after Musk threatened to cut the service off.', 'But even these examples pale in comparison to the extent to which American foreign policy may be dictated by Musk’s corporate interests going forward. Amid European efforts to regulate Musk’s social media platform X and punish Musk for noncompliance, incoming Vice President JD Vance suggested that continuing American support for NATO be conditioned on Europe rolling back its efforts against X.', 'Musk has lobbied the Trump administration to kill a tax credit on electric vehicles, a move that would deal a blow to US car manufacturers like General Motors and Ford – helping Musk’s own Tesla by hurting these competitors – and benefit China, which already has a huge lead on the EV market, including much of Tesla’s production.', 'Musk’s influence on foreign policy may have an outsized impact on areas of the world where Trump is simply uninterested. Take sub-Saharan Africa, a region that Trump mostly ignored outside of dismissing countries there as “s***holes” and targeting several of them with his so-called “Muslim ban”. Musk’s Starlink service is rapidly expanding across Africa. This has boosted internet access in a number of countries, but continued expansion faces regulatory hurdles. This is a policy area in which Musk could use the levers of American influence to pressure these governments to drop their attempts to restrict or regulate Starlink. Such a move would have both benefits and costs for the countries involved, expanding connectivity for their citizens but potentially costing telecom jobs if local providers are pushed out of business. But the benefits to Musk are clear, and Musk is well-positioned to use his leverage here and elsewhere to the benefit of his corporate empire.', 'Outside of promoting positions and policies that would increase his already massive net worth, Musk has also established an increasingly conservative political agenda which sometimes supersedes his financial interests. Musk’s impulsive purchase of Twitter seems to have been driven by his absolutist position on “free speech” and his desire to own a platform where he can freely share his own opinions about the world. As Musk has drifted to the far right in his own views, which he regularly shares on X, he has found a kindred spirit in Donald Trump. In recent months, Musk has tweeted in favour of cutting foreign aid and expressed scepticism at international treaties that “restrict the freedoms of Americans,” ideas that resonate with Trump.', 'Trump and Musk indeed share a penchant for cosying up to authoritarians and the far right. After sparking controversy on Inauguration Day by giving what appeared to be a Nazi salute – an accusation that Musk has subsequently mocked online – the billionaire appeared by video at an event held by Germany’s far-right AfD party. Musk has previously insisted that “only AfD can save Germany.” Musk has similarly backed far-right opposition parties in countries such as the UK. In the past, Musk made statements appearing to appease Russian control over Crimea – apparently after Musk had communicated with Putin over the issue – and Chinese ambitions to take control of Taiwan. Musk is also developing a relationship with Argentina’s right-wing President Javier Milei, who has slashed the country’s budget in a move to fight out-of-control inflation, but at the cost of plummeting GDP and rising poverty. Musk sees Milei’s policies as a model to be duplicated in the US. When it comes to alienating longstanding American allies and placating autocrats and ideologues, Musk is set to reinforce Trump’s own tendencies.', 'But figuring out the ideological direction that Musk will turn American foreign policy is perhaps not the most relevant frame for viewing his involvement with the incoming administration. From Musk’s point of view, his concerns about the directions that the world will take on important issues like war and peace seem rooted less in principle and more in the idea that he should be the one guiding these outcomes. Musk is an egoist; he wants to be the one implementing the grand visions for the world, even if his mercurial nature means that the content of those visions changes frequently.', 'Look at his involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Shortly after the Russian invasion in 2022, Musk challenged Vladimir Putin to a fistfight to resolve the issue. When that solution did not work, Musk volunteered the use of his Starlink services to Ukraine, giving the country’s military a much-needed logistical lifeline. But Musk’s donation of his Starlink satellite internet services to Ukraine has not simply been an act of generosity or solidarity with Ukraine. Rather, it’s part of a larger effort by Musk to manage the conflict. This can be seen by Musk’s decisions to limit what Starlink can be used for – over the objections of the Ukrainian government and its military strategists. Furthermore, Musk has reportedly had initially undisclosed conversations with Vladimir Putin, and the businessman offered an unsolicited “peace plan” that was quickly rejected by Zelenskyy as appeasement to Russia.', 'In short, Musk unilaterally decided to insert himself as a major player in the Russia-Ukraine war. Having attempted to micromanage the conflict as a private citizen, Musk’s growing role as a quasi-government agent for Trump will only magnify his sense of self-importance in global affairs.', 'As a businessman, Musk has taken the approach of casting a wide net, invested in everything from electric vehicles to space travel to social media in order to create a many-headed corporate hydra. As he enters politics, his ill-defined Department of Government Efficiency has seen itself as having the entire federal government as its jurisdiction. Musk is likely to take a similarly all-encompassing view of foreign policy, stepping into any and every situation in which he sees himself as smarter than the experts.', 'And Trump, who values loyalty and wealth above credentials when selecting his top aides, seems to be encouraging this type of overreach.', 'Musk met with Iran’s ambassador to the UN in a conversation towards resetting relations between the two countries. This task is a tall order after Trump authorised the killing of a top Iranian general during his first presidency and Iran allegedly authorised an assassination plot against Trump in retaliation. Most administrations, seeking to negotiate such a significant reboot of bilateral relations with a major geopolitical foe in the middle of a precarious time for the Middle East, would assign the task to top-level professional diplomats rather than a mercurial billionaire.', 'But Donald Trump is not most presidents and Elon Musk is not most billionaires. The semi-isolationist “Make America Great Again” Trump is only somewhat interested in the rest of the world, and Musk has grand designs to rework the world, and other worlds as well, according to his own whims. Whether it’s Middle East diplomacy, European conflict or African infrastructure, look for Elon Musk to assert that he knows best, with the weight of the US government now behind him.', 'The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

Read it now.', 'Just two weeks into Trump’s second term, the US president’s chief cost-cutter, tech billionaire Elon Musk, has declared war on the federal bureaucracy — sparking an outcry over the vast and rapid flexing of power by a private individual.', 'The head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency has in recent days offered two million government workers’ buyouts to resign, begun dismantling foreign aid agency USAID, gained access to Treasury systems that control trillions of dollars in payments, and instructed staffers to probe the Department of Education with a view to closing it.', 'President Trump moved to downplay Musk’s power within the administration, telling reporters Monday that he “can’t and won’t do anything without our approval.” a “sense of helplessness” is already setting in among senior government officials, The New York Times reported. DOGE agents are operating in a haphazard and opaque way — working on multiple projects and different agencies and using different email addresses which has added to the anxiety within the civil service, The Times wrote. And Musk’s team is secretive, often declining to share their surnames and describing meetings with employees — some of whom were asked what projects they were working on and who should be fired — as “one-way interviews.”', 'The South African-born billionaire is operating “beyond scrutiny,” US historian Douglas Brinkley told The New York Times, and currently has limitless room to run: “There is not one single entity holding Musk accountable. It’s a harbinger of the destruction of our basic institutions.” One limiting factor to Musk’s assault on the government, however, is if he is able to remain in Trump’s good books as he carries out the “dirty work” of shrinking the federal government, Politico wrote: “He’s fine with Elon being the bad guy, a person close to the president told the outlet, but the US leader “could always change his mind about the situation if there is a political price to pay down the road.”', '', 'Musk’s “administrative coup” echoes his chaotic takeover of Twitter, which was marked by an extreme slashing of staff and spending at the outset with a view to fixing problems later, The Atlantic wrote. Unlike Twitter — now X — the federal government is “big and complex,” a former executive said, meaning attempts to dismantle it will face legal challenges and congressional backlash. Lawsuits have already been filed to block DOGE’s access to Treasury payment systems, for example, and federal ethics experts told NPR that Musk’s ownership of various companies could see him fall foul of conflict-of-interest laws. Still, court cases take time to resolve, and “who knows what kind of damage [Musk and DOGE] could inflict before that happens,” a former ambassador said.', '', '', 'Transparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.']"

', 'In doing so, Mr. Musk, the billionaire head of a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, appears to be carrying out the mission of President Donald Trump, who has vowed to cut waste and fraud in Washington.  ', 'To President Trump’s supporters, the Silicon Valley ethos that Mr. Musk brings to overhauling taxpayer-funded institutions is why he’s needed in Washington, where a permanent political class has proved unwilling or unable to prune a bloated bureaucracy. Previous presidents, like Ronald Reagan, who vowed to pursue smaller government all failed. Mr. Reagan himself quipped in 1964, “a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth.”', 'The Trump administration and Elon Musk seem to think drastic upheaval is the only way to tame bloated government bureaucracy. The question is whether they are smashing the Constitution to bits along the way.', 'That Mr. Musk is the world’s richest person and a huge political donor wielding a chainsaw over federal agencies that regulate his companies and safeguard citizens’ data is seen as less important than the results.

How can we get this on track?’ And I think DOGE serves that purpose,” says Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia.

Over the weekend, Mr. Musk insisted that the agency should be shut down. On Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that USAID would be downsized and folded into his department.

Unnamed federal officials told The Washington Post today that they’re now concerned about DOGE access to student loan data.', 'The overall effect has been to turn once banal-seeming federal IT systems into an ideologically driven bulldozer for removing programs deemed — by, apparently, Musk — as either unnecessary or excessively “woke.”', 'Musk’s approach is revealing just how much the day-to-day operation of government has come to depend on technological systems that can, in theory, be turned on and off with the flick of a switch. He’s also exploring the limits of how much power a lone official can wield if he has White House approval to take them over.', '“They’ve done their homework,” Ann Lewis, former director of Technology Transformation Services (TTS) under the General Services Administration, told POLITICO. “Going where the majority of the volume of government transaction data is seems very strategic.”', 'This story was adapted from Digital Future Daily, POLITICO’s afternoon newsletter about the power and politics of tech.', 'On the surface, Musk’s goals track with generations of previous good-government reformers, who have long imagined revamping the cumbersome federal hiring and procurement processes that have built up over years and decades.', 'It is also, notionally, within DOGE’s mission: In his order establishing the department, officially with a mere renaming of the existing U.S. Digital Service, Trump directed it to “implement the President’s DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.” Trump also issued a separate executive order calling on DOGE, OPM and the Office of Management and Budget to “integrate modern technology,” with DOGE providing advice on “specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency.”', 'In practice, however, many governance experts have watched the launch of DOGE with alarm bordering on horror.', 'As DOGE has advertised on Musk’s platform X, the office is using its access to federal data to mark for death diversity, equity and inclusion-related programs specifically, amounting to an ideological program far from the goals of productivity and efficiency.', 'There are also deep cybersecurity concerns about how his teams are operating. A lawsuit alleges that a Musk ally installed a private email server at OPM in order to send direct mass emails to civil servants. DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller has denied the allegations about the server, pointing DFD to an X post where she said “There’s nothing illegal and no server, just more made up tall tales from uniformed career bureaucrats who probably telework.”', 'Based on her grasp of how the government’s underlying technology works, Lewis says that by setting up DOGE within USDS, and installing close allies like Thomas Shedd in crucial tech positions — Shedd now holds her former job as director of TTS — Musk is setting himself up to expand his digital powers further through the technical machinery of the bureaucracy, rather than through higher-profile, and more accountable, top-level appointments.', 'Lewis suggests that if DOGE insinuates itself within the General Services Administration, which houses TTS, it could have access to the GSA’s tech talent and the multi-billion-dollar acquisition services fund — a pot of money earned by contract acquisition fees that it alone controls and can be used for further hiring and procurement.', 'It could also, if it wanted to, find allies with the technical know-how to further DOGE’s mission.', '“They found the two organizations [USDS and TTS] in the federal government where a lot of formerly private-sector tech talent lives,” Lewis said. (404 Media reported this afternoon on a meeting between Shedd and TTS employees where he offered praise, and asked their help in implementing AI throughout the government.)', 'Those reforms aside, the manner in which DOGE is going directly into the “pipes,” as it were, of the federal government seems possibly off-mission to many experts, rousing already high suspicions — especially if they have the power to get into the actual code, as Wired reported in one story.', '“There’s no good reason they should be able to directly edit code and stop or change payments, and to ignore the most basic controls around them,” Robert Gordon, a deputy assistant to former President Joe Biden and assistant secretary for financial resources under Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services, told DFD.', 'Gordon echoed comments from other technocratic government reformers who have said that, while the federal bureaucracy is badly in need of reform, DOGE’s blunt-force approach could be counterproductive — and could even backfire if lawsuits over its constitutionality force a rollback of its changes.', 'Musk and DOGE’s fusion of political decision-making with literal “admin privileges” is, in a way, the purest distillation of the Silicon Valley ethos that defines Trump 2.0: “We’ve always said that we could run the government more efficiently than the government, and now we’re going to do it, existing regulations or constitutional authorities be damned.”', 'Gordon expressed bafflement that anyone involved in governance and administration would even need direct access to sensitive IT systems.', '“Normally political appointees like me want to stay 100 miles away from these processes,” Gordon said. “I can imagine wanting access in some circumstances, to see them yourself … but the idea of monkeying with the actual payments, and having the authority to change them, is mind blowing. It’s a key thing that normal politicals stay the hell away from.”', 'The key difference, of course, being that Musk and his gang of 20-something wünderkinds are anything but “normal politicals” — and while legal challenges loom on the horizon, for now politics have seemed to shift to the level of the sysadmin.', '', '© 2025 POLITICO LLC']"

For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems — which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments — alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.

Elon Musk Is Putting the Entire Government “Into the Wood Chipper”,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/elon-musk-is-putting-the-entire-government-into-the-wood-chipper,"['Under the auspices of dismantling the “deep state,” Elon Musk has become something of a deep state unto himself—an unelected, unaccountable billionaire running roughshod over the United States government, with little apparent constraint from those who the American people actually elected.', 'But rather than rage against him, as Donald Trump has long done against the bureaucrats he claims to be politically motivated, the president has continued to empower him, designating the world’s richest man a “special government employee” and supporting his takeover, and possible dismantling, of federal agencies.', '“He’s a very talented guy from the standpoint of management and costs,” Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office. “We’re trying to shrink the government, and he can probably shrink it as well as anybody else, if not better.”', 'Trump’s comments came as Musk moved to put the US Agency for International Development (USAID) “into the wood chipper,” as the billionaire put it on his social media site, and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gained access to the Treasury Department’s payment system, alarming legal and security experts. “It’s an absolute nightmare,” as Alan Butler of the Electronic Privacy Information Center told Politico.', 'The unprecedented moves have already triggered several lawsuits. But Musk—who is riddled with conflicts of interest—has continued apace, appearing to set his sights on the Department of Education as his next target. “To my friends who are upset, I would say with respect, ‘Call somebody who cares,’” Republican Senator John Kennedy said Monday on Fox News. “It’s USAID today. It’s gonna be the Department of Education tomorrow.”', 'That about sums up the GOP response to Musk. Though Trump said Monday that the DOGE head can’t do “anything without our approval,” and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent assured lawmakers Musk is not controlling the department’s payment system, Musk has not appeared to encounter any real friction from the White House, let alone Capitol Hill Republicans. It’s a “constitutional question,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley shrugged to Politico, as Musk usurped congressional authority: “It’s how you define the executive powers of the president of the United States, and I can’t define that for you.”', 'Democrats have protested against this Musk-ification of the federal government. “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote Monday. But their protests always seem to be a step behind Musk, and there’s limited concrete action they can take as the minority on Capitol Hill. “This is the one shot the American people have to defeat BUREAUcracy, rule of the bureaucrats, and restore DEMOcracy, rule of the people,” Musk replied to Schumer. “It’s now or never,” Musk added. Public “support is crucial to the success of the revolution of the people.”', 'That last part may be true: While public backlash may mean little to the (theoretically) lame-duck president and his unelected wrecking ball, it could at least have an effect on the elected Republicans who enable them. If Trump and Musk can claim they’re acting on a mandate, there’s virtually nothing they won’t be able to get away with. If it’s clear the administration is overstepping the authority the public granted it, though, there may be at least some incentive for Republicans to pump the brakes.', '“Before it’s too late,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said Monday, “this is the moment for Americans [to] stand up and say, ‘We want our government back.’”', 'Inside America’s Most Unconventional Counterterror Squad', 'All the Looks From the 2025 Grammys Red Carpet', 'Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit', 'See the 2025 Oscar Nominations', 'The 10 Biggest Snubs and Surprises From the 2025 Oscar Nominations', 'How the MAGA World Ignited the Obama Divorce Rumors', 'The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires', 'Beware the Serial Squatter of Point Dume', 'The Best Rom-Coms of All Time', 'From the Archive: MAGA Non Grata', 'MORE FROM VANITY FAIR', 'CONTACT', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

How the world’s richest man laid waste to the US government,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-elon-musk-federal-government,"['Elon Musk has achieved astonishing power in Trump’s administration – and spent the weekend wielding it', 'S\nince declaring his support for Donald Trump in July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort, Elon Musk has rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, Musk has begun to make use of that power, making decisions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data, and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government.', 'Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the computer systems of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.', 'Musk, with the backing of Trump, is now working to shut down the US Agency for International Development (USAid) – the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. He bragged on Sunday about “feeding USAid into the wood chipper”. He has also targeted several other agencies in an aggressive attempt to purge and remake the federal government along ideological lines, while avoiding congressional or judicial oversight.', 'Many of Musk’s actions have taken place without forewarning or transparency, sowing chaos and confusion among the thousands of people employed at the agencies like USAid that he has gone after. Humanitarian organizations that rely on US funding have halted operations and laid off staff, while government workers have been locked out of their offices. He is operating Doge as an unofficial government department with no congressionally approved mandate while he technically holds the position of “special government employee”, which allows him to sidestep financial disclosures and a public vetting process.', 'Musk has gleefully posted on X, the social media platform that he owns, throughout the chaos. He has accused USAid of corruption, and of being a “criminal organization” and “radical-left political psy op”, without any evidence. Why? He tweeted an explanation of simply doing Trump’s bidding: “All @DOGE did was check to see which federal organizations were violating the @POTUS executive orders the most. Turned out to be USAID, so that became our focus.” He said it was “time for it to die”.', 'Musk also suggested that opposition to his team will be punished, reposting a letter sent to him from the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor for Washington DC, who vowed to “pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people”.', 'The New York Democratic senator Chuck Schumer wrote on Tuesday morning: “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government. DOGE is not a real government agency. DOGE has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law.” Musk responded that the reaction was “hysterical”.', 'As other Democrats and government oversight groups began to respond to the breakneck series of actions from Musk’s team, on Tuesday the Tesla and SpaceX CEO continued to plow ahead with his cuts and told his supporters: “We’re never going to get another chance like this.”', 'Immediately following Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, the president issued an executive order establishing Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. Rather than create an entirely new entity, the order renamed the US Digital Service, which was previously tasked with updating government IT systems, and brought the rechristened bureau into the executive office of the president.', 'Government accountability groups instantly saw red flags with its creation, filing four separate lawsuits that alleged Doge violated federal transparency laws while warning that the initiative was “slated to dictate federal policy in ways that will affect millions of Americans”.', 'The concerns from watchdog organizations have borne out. Musk and employees of Doge have gained access to sensitive government systems in the treasury department and USAid in recent days, as well as exerted control over the office of personnel management (OPM) and the General Services Administration, which handles federal real estate, with the goal of ending office leases. Two federal workers additionally sued on Tuesday for a temporary restraining order against Doge for allegedly operating an illegal server in OPM.', 'Attempts at blocking Musk’s team have resulted in several top agency officials being ousted. On Friday, the treasury department’s acting secretary, David Lebryk, resigned after refusing to grant Musk’s team access to highly secure systems that control about $6tn in annual payments to millions of Americans. The next day, two senior security officials at USAid attempted to stop Doge workers from gaining physical access to restricted areas at the agency – resulting in a standoff in which a deputy for Musk threatened to call the US marshals. Both security officials have subsequently been put on administrative leave, and on Sunday night staff at USAid received emails telling them to not come into work the next day.', 'The events unfolded swiftly and took place mostly outside of working hours, creating uncertainty over the weekend as to who was in charge and what authority the Doge team possessed. Many of the Doge team tasked with carrying out the overhauls of government agencies appear to have little to no experience in government and are extremely young. One of the engineers is as young as 19, Wired reported, while a 25-year-old who previously worked at two of Musk’s companies gained access to treasury department payment systems.', 'The Trump administration has maintained that all Musk’s actions have been legal and did not violate security protocols, although the details of what Doge employees are doing with access to government systems is still unclear. “No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” Katie Miller, a Doge spokesperson and wife of the far-right Trump administration official Stephen Miller, wrote on X.', 'Musk has claimed that his actions are cutting unnecessary costs and will allow for more efficient government, but he has also suggested his taskforce is ideologically opposed to liberal initiatives such as refugee services and the promotion of trans rights. He has routinely engaged with far-right and conspiracy theory-promoting accounts on X while touting his dismantling of USAid, an agency that has become a target in recent years among hardline conservatives. The far-right Heritage Foundation thinktank specifically called for reforming USAid in its controversial Project 2025 report, accusing it of spreading “climate extremism” and “gender radicalism”.', 'Sign up to TechScape', 'A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives', '', 'Trump has supported Musk’s aggressive approach to dismantling government agencies, confirming plans on Monday to shut down USAid and praising Musk as a “big cost cutter”. As backlash swelled and Democrats issued calls for action against Musk on Monday, Trump attempted to assuage some of the concerns and reassert that he was in charge.', '“Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We’ll give him approval where appropriate and where not appropriate we won’t.”', 'But there have been no public signs thus far that Trump has reined in Musk’s ambitions or prevented him from engaging in potential conflicts – he has many, as a number of his companies do extensive work with government agencies he now holds sway over. Several of Trump’s recent policy announcements also appeared to align with Musk’s worldview and personal grievances.', 'Trump declared on Monday that he would shut down all aid to South Africa, Musk’s country of birth, over what he alleged was a “massive human rights violation” in the form of a new land rights law. Musk has repeatedly accused the South African government of racism against white people and falsely claimed that the government is allowing a “genocide” against white farmers.', 'Another executive order from Trump on 31 January vowed to “unleash prosperity through deregulation” and declared that whenever a government agency issues a new regulation it must first remove 10 existing regulations. The order has echoed Musk’s longstanding calls for widespread deregulation of the federal government, which Musk reiterated in a livestream on Monday night on X, when he stated “regulations, basically, should be default gone”. He described the current administration as “our best shot” at this deregulation and “the best hand of cards we’re ever going to have”.', 'Musk has made sweeping and aggressive declarations about what else must change about the US government, indicating where he might strike next. He stated on Monday: “Activist judges must be removed from the bench or there is no justice,” and praised the representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for issuing calls for NPR and PBS to testify at a hearing about their operations. Greene, who is head of a “delivering on government efficiency” group within the House oversight committee that aims to support Musk’s efforts, accused the public media organizations of ideological bias – citing a PBS report that Musk “gave what appeared to be a fascist salute” during a speech last month.', 'It is uncertain what mechanisms may prevent further cuts by Musk. His immense influence coupled with his erratic behavior have made it difficult to quickly ascertain where the next axe may fall, such as on Monday when Musk claimed that a government agency that worked on a free IRS tax filing system was “deleted” while giving no further information. The agency’s program was still online as of Tuesday.', 'What is clear from Musk’s public statements is the intent to barrel ahead with accumulating more power over government agencies, while framing his crusade as an existential fight for the future of the country.', '“It’s now or never,” the billionaire tweeted on Tuesday. “Your support is crucial to the success of the revolution of the people.”']"

', 'The billionaire tech magnate has never been elected to office or been confirmed by the Senate for a high-level government job, but in the span of a few days, Musk has still gained access to sensitive federal data through his position as head of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency project, or DOGE, to push a far-reaching agenda and potentially spark a constitutional crisis. ', 'Musk has embraced Silicon Valley’s most notorious instincts to “move fast and break things” in a lightning battle to muscle into the computer systems and power structures of federal agencies. As he did with his corporate takeover of Twitter in 2022, he has brought in a team to assess details such as office building leases, budget line items, vendor contracts and the performance of individual employees — with the stated intention of radically downsizing the organization. ', 'With a cadre of engineers as young as 19 years old, and with the encouragement of Trump, Musk has demanded and been given access to sensitive government databases and the Treasury Department’s payment system with an unprecedented series of bureaucratic maneuvers. ', 'There are deep concerns among many Democrats and some Republicans that Musk — and his staff members who are not government workers and are not bound by the same ethics and rules that apply to federal workers — are acting in secret, without accountability and potentially against the law in the Trump administration’s effort to shrink the federal government.', 'DOGE is an office within the Executive Office of the President, according to a Trump executive order from Jan. 20, and Musk has been named a “special government employee,” according to a White House official. It is a temporary position that allows him greater access, but it also bypasses some of the disclosure obligations required of full-time government employees. ', 'DOGE’s targets include the U.S. Agency for International Development, which closed its headquarters Monday in anticipation of shutting down entirely. Musk’s DOGE has staff members working at the Treasury Department, which pays the government’s bills, and he has said on X that he wants to slash or overhaul several other agencies, including the General Services Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Education Department. ', 'A person who has been affiliated with Musk’s SpaceX is working as an adviser to the FBI director, NBC News has reported. The White House Office of Personnel Management has offered federal employees the option of taking “deferred resignations,” or buyouts, in an echo of Musk’s Twitter shakeup. ', 'Inside the offices of USAID, more than 1,000 staff members and contractors have been fired or furloughed because of a near-total freeze on foreign assistance, and the agency’s security leaders were put on administrative leave Saturday after they tried to prevent DOGE employees from accessing secure systems, NBC News has reported. At least some of the DOGE employees had insufficient security clearances, sources have said. ', 'Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Musk was operating a “shadow government” that put all government services at risk. ', '“If DOGE attacks USAID today, then you can be sure they’ll move on to another target tomorrow. Who knows, maybe it’ll be the Postal Service or the IRS or even the Social Security Administration?” he said. ', 'Musk did not respond to an email request Monday for an interview. ', 'It was not clear what Musk and his DOGE team planned to do with their access to sensitive data, such as Treasury records of all payments made by the government, but in social media posts, Musk has openly mused about cutting federal jobs, canceling contracts, stopping payments or selectively releasing records to illustrate his points about alleged waste. It is a playbook he has already used; he selectively released internal Twitter documents after he bought the company, arguing that the previous management had been politically biased. ', 'Many Democrats — and even some Republicans — say the attempted unilateral remake of the federal government is unlawful, as Trump and Musk have shoved aside not only career civil servants but also the authority of Congress itself. ', '“It’s a potential constitutional crisis,” said Brian Riedl, a former Senate Republican staff member who is now a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. In a phone interview, he said he was concerned that Musk’s power is going unchecked. ', '“Someone with as much power as Elon Musk has should be Senate-confirmed,” he said. “There needs to be some accountability to Congress and the voters.” ', 'Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Musk was breaking the law.

', 'Musk has been using as his primary example of suspected government waste a dubious claim that $50 million of taxpayer money went to pay for condoms sent to the Gaza Strip. The Associated Press reported last week that there was no evidence for the claim. ', 'And he has acted largely in secret, withholding not only the names of newly hired government officials who are helping him make decisions, but also the details of the decisions themselves and the supposed legal authority under which he is operating. On Monday, after people began posting the names of DOGE employees online, Musk accused them of breaking the law. ', 'Edward Martin, the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., said in a statement on X late Monday that he was prepared to prosecute people who were “targeting DOGE employees.” ', '“Our initial review of the evidence presented to us indicates that certain individuals and/or groups have committed acts that appear to violate the law in targeting DOGE employees,” he said, adding, “We also have our prosecutors preparing.” Earlier Monday, Martin wrote a public letter to Musk vowing to “pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.” ', 'Musk’s posts on social media indicate he is working unconventional, long hours, and he said he worked through the weekend. He has told multiple people that he is sleeping at DOGE’s offices, Wired reported last week. ', 'The acronym for Musk’s project, DOGE, is a joking reference to a volatile digital currency, and DOGE is not an official department created by Congress, but by any measure Musk has more influence with Trump than most Cabinet members. ', 'Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, appeared to be taken aback early Monday at how easily he had grabbed influence in Washington. ', '“Although it is a humorous name, ironically I think DOGE will have a very serious and significant impact on government waste and fraud and abuse — which is really astonishing,” he said in an audio-only event on X. ', 'Trump pledged Monday that the White House would closely oversee Musk’s activity. ', '“Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval, and we’ll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won’t,” he told reporters Monday in the Oval Office. ', 'But the questions hanging over DOGE are extraordinary, especially as they relate to the Constitution: Members of Congress are in charge of writing spending bills and control the nation’s checkbook. Cabinet leaders and department heads are subject to confirmation by the Senate. ', 'Trump, asked Monday about potential financial conflicts of interest for Musk, said: “Where we think there’s a conflict or a problem, we won’t let him go near it.” ', 'As a “special government employee” in the Trump administration, Musk must abide by ethics and conflict-of-interest policies that are generally less onerous than they are for full-time government staff members. He still has full-time jobs as the CEO of two major corporations, Tesla and SpaceX, and he is the owner of various other tech companies, including X, xAI and Neuralink. ', 'The Trump administration has not published a list of DOGE employees or even made it clear how many of them are full-time employees, as opposed to outside advisers or volunteers. On Sunday, Wired published the names of six young men, ages 19 to 24, who it said were working for DOGE. ', 'One of the DOGE staffers, Gavin Kliger, was the person who sent an email early Monday informing all USAID employees that the headquarters would be closed to most of them, according to a copy of the email seen by NBC News. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. ', 'Musk has boasted about his staff, calling them some of the “world’s best software engineers” and comparing them to warriors from ancient Greece. ', '“Not many Spartans are needed to win battles,” he posted Sunday on X. ', 'DOGE is not being transparent about other aspects of its work, including how many job cuts it may have recommended or prompted and any halts to congressionally approved spending that it may have suggested. Even measuring the impact of DOGE may be difficult because it is not clear how people outside the government could validate some of the metrics Musk is citing, such as the value of cuts. (Last week, Musk said DOGE was cutting the deficit by about $1 billion a day, without providing details, and then said he was “cautiously optimistic” about getting to $4 billion a day.)

Elon Musk’s Midnight Takeover ,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/elon-musk-takeover-doge-gsa-opm-secrecy-dei/,"['Chip Somodevilla/Pool/CNP/Zuma', '', 'Much like a gremlin fed after midnight, Elon Musk is staying up late and causing mayhem. As Musk-backed cuts and changes continue to spread across federal agencies, employees have found that many of the bizarre communications they’re receiving, as well as the unusual diktats transforming their workplaces in the name of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, are happening late at night and on weekends. ', 'On Sunday night, for instance, federal workers received another unusual email encouraging them to quit their jobs and take a “deferred resignation” in which they will supposedly be paid through September 30 while not working. The original message, sent January 28 and titled “A Fork in the Road,” generated intense backlash from federal workers and warnings from union leaders that the offer’s terms and legality were on shaky ground. The follow-up email, formatted as a Q&A and unsigned like the original, assured workers the offer was legitimate. (“We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to do so,” one passage read, about whether workers can get second jobs during the deferred resignation period. “The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.”)', 'Before President Donald Trump’s second term and Musk’s DOGE, it was “very unusual” to receive such important communications outside of normal working hours, one federal employee said, echoing several others. “Avoiding office hours at all costs, it seems.”', 'On Monday morning, meanwhile, workers discovered that a portion of the General Services Administration (GSA) office in Washington, DC, had suddenly been closed off; federal workers say they suspect it’s being occupied by DOGE personnel. They tell Mother Jones that an administrative suite of the GSA, along with bathrooms and a lunchroom, are now inaccessible to staff who aren’t on an “access list” and security is keeping others out. A GSA spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment before publication. ', 'Musk himself reportedly boasted to friends that he’d been sleeping at the DOGE offices in DC, according to Wired, which are based out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House. On Sunday night, he held a conversation on X’s Spaces at midnight to answer questions about DOGE, alongside Republican Sens. Joni Ernst and Mike Lee and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who was once named as DOGE’s co-chair before being unsubtly phased out. It was a meandering conversation, with Musk holding forth about how he would curb inflation by taking “a trillion dollars out of the deficit” in the next year, a feat he’d carry out by making massive cuts to government programs he deems to be wasteful. (He also predicted that in order to preserve their benefits, unscrupulous operators will claim to be “single mothers” whose benefits are being cut. Instead, Musk said, they actually are fraudsters operating a vast international criminal network. ) ', 'Beyond the bizarre hours and unusual communiqués, federal employees also are  objecting to the extreme secrecy with which people affiliated with DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management have carried out ostensible government functions. At the GSA, as Mother Jones has previously reported, officials affiliated with Musk and DOGE requested that employees submit to “code review”—demonstrating computer code they’ve written and defending its efficiency and usefulness—something that also happened when Musk took over Twitter. GSA employees have been asked to submit to these code reviews without knowing the full names of these individuals. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla employee who’s now directing the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, defended the move in internal communications, while also admitting the people conducting the reviews are not official GSA employees at the moment. ', 'An administrative suite of the GSA, along with bathrooms and a lunchroom, are now inaccessible to staff who aren’t on an “access list” and security is keeping others out.', '“The folks conducting the calls are advisers,” he wrote to employees. “They are in progress [sic] of onboarding to GSA.” When pressed by employees about why they were being asked to do code reviews with people who would not divulge their full names, he replied: “Agreed on it being weird and uncomfortable. The key issue is that we’ve already had some media attention on the process I’m using to understand the tech and the team—trying to protect these folks that are taking the time to do this for me.” In other words, back then, Shedd appeared to be trying to shield his effort, and the people involved in it, from media scrutiny by trying to hide their identities, a level of anonymity that government employees are not usually provided.', 'Despite the attempted secrecy, Wired has identified some of the young engineers working for Musk’s DOGE, whom they describe as having little or no experience in government; indeed, some of them appear to be fresh out of college. This crew of Musk acolytes, according to the publication, include Akash Bobba, Edward Coristine, Luke Farritor, Gautier Cole Killian, Gavin Kliger, and Ethan Shaotran. The majority of the men appear to have recently deleted their LinkedIn profiles and locked down other social media. ', 'Musk has suggested that individuals and media outlets that identify the DOGE engineers are, in his words, “guilty of a crime.” Ed Martin Jr., the interim US attorney for DC, has made it clear that he’s aligning himself with Musk, writing in an open letter on X, “we will pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.” The statement didn’t come with any concrete allegations of criminal behavior, and identifying government employees by name would not under normal circumstances be considered a crime. ', 'Other strange after-hours occurrences tread the line between outrage and black comedy, federal employees say. A worker at an intelligence agency says unidentified outside staffers arrived to sweep the office of anything they felt was related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, a target of a Trump executive order. That included a plaque, confiscated from a supervisor’s desk, that read, “Be kind to everyone.”', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently. We stand for justice and democracy.

Trump named Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent—himself a hedge fund billionaire—as interim administrator of the agency. Bessent then told the 1,600 employees of the CFPB to stop working while he reviewed its operations, which include numerous lawsuits against major banks and corporations over consumer fraud.', 'Both actions were entirely unlawful. The two agencies were established by Congress, the USAID under the Kennedy administration in 1961 and the CFPB in 2010. Neither can be shut down on the say-so of the president alone, without congressional action. But Trump’s policy since his inauguration has been to break the law whenever he pleases, relying on the impotence of the Democrats and support of his fascist partisans in the Supreme Court.', 'In relation to the USAID, several officials from the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), the Musk-run group Trump established by executive order, arrived at the headquarters Saturday but were denied access to some of the premises by agency security officials. A confrontation ensued, with threats to bring in US Marshals, before the Musk aides were given access.', 'The two top security officials at USAID were immediately placed on administrative leave, and Musk tweeted, in the gangster lingo both he and Trump embrace: “USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.” He later declared on X, which he owns, “USAID was a viper’s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America.” Trump added his own vilification, claiming USAID was run by “a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them out.” ', 'Such language testifies to the fascist mania that is now gripping the US financial oligarchy. While the bulk of its $50 billion budget funds food aid and refugee relief projects in 60 countries, USAID was established as an instrument of American imperialist foreign policy during the Cold War. It has long been used as a cover for US intelligence operations in countries where the official military-intelligence agencies lacked access.', 'The closure of the USAID and CFPB is a dress rehearsal for the shutdown of much more important agencies, with genuine popular support, like the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and much of the Department of Health and Human Services. These have all been targeted for elimination or deep cuts, spelled out in the 900-page blueprint for the new administration drawn up in Project 2025.', 'The USAID and CFPB employees have been put out on the street with little or no chance of either returning to work or finding an equivalent position if the two agencies are integrated into larger federal units, like the State Department or the Treasury, as some officials suggest.', 'Musk is effectively treating the workforce of the federal government like the super-exploited workers in his Tesla factories or the workers at Twitter, fired en masse after he bought the social media platform and reorganized it, turning it into a mouthpiece for fascist propaganda.', 'The ruthless treatment of the federal workers is a warning to the working class as a whole. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan gave the green light for a wave of corporate union-busting when he carried out the mass firing of striking PATCO air traffic controllers. Trump and Musk are following that example, only this time applying it more broadly, to a vast array of federal workers.', 'The shutdown of the two federal agencies follows Trump’s attempt last week to halt all federal grants and payments in an order issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the White House agency that oversees federal spending. A federal judge temporarily blocked that order, which had already led to the shutdown of federal payments to state, local and non-governmental agencies, including for Medicaid, the most widely used US health insurance program.', 'Trump vowed to continue the attack on federal social spending. On Friday, at his instruction, DOGE was given access to the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS), the Treasury system which carries out more than 1 billion transactions a year. The BFS sends out 90 percent of the payments made by the US government, including Social Security checks, income tax refunds and federal paychecks. The Treasury’s top career civil servant, David Lebryk, abruptly retired after objecting to the blatant political intervention into a previously purely technical apparatus: The Treasury merely executes payments approved by other federal agencies but does not rule on their merits.', 'It is clear that Trump and Musk are seeking direct control of the payment mechanism to enforce the cuts that they were temporarily barred from carrying out by the court order. While Treasury Secretary Bessent claimed that the access was “read-only,” Musk has already boasted on X that DOGE aides are “rapidly shutting down” payments. Although Musk claimed that “terrorist” groups were receiving funds from the Treasury, the only acknowledged cutoff was a funding for a Lutheran charity.', 'The operations of DOGE are aimed at giving Musk, and through him Trump, direct control over the day-to-day operations of the federal government. Musk aides, many of them on loan from Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, have been installed at the Office of Personnel Management, which functions as the federal Human Resources department, the General Services Administration, which manages government property, real estate and leasing, as well as the Treasury.', 'The response of the Democratic Party to these unprecedented assertions of dictatorial power was a combination of handwringing and warmongering. Democratic senators Jeanne Shaheen and Tim Kaine complained that the Musk aides who took over USAID lacked proper security clearances for handling the agency’s secrets. There were similar criticisms made of the open door for Musk aides at the Treasury.', 'Appearing on MSNBC, former Obama National Security Council official Ben Rhodes denounced the shutdown of USAID as “essentially ceding the whole globe to China and other countries to fill the space that was once filled by the United States.” He added, “it’s also incredibly strategic national security interests of the United States, which, you know, Elon Musk just seems to care less about, and Donald Trump as well.”', 'The truth is that Trump is a no less rapacious defender of American imperialism than the Democrats and vice versa. That has already been demonstrated by his drive to construct a Fortress North America through the acquisition of Greenland, the absorption of Canada, and “taking back” the Panama Canal. But he disdains the “soft power” methods represented by the USAID, in favor of brute force and economic bullying.', 'The events of Monday confirm the assessment which the WSWS has made of the incoming Trump regime. As our New Year’s statement declared: ', 'The incoming administration will be a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. To a degree unprecedented in American history, the oligarchy itself will exercise direct control over the state--from Musk, the world’s richest man and head of the Orwellian “Department of Government Efficiency,” to the assemblage of billionaires that will staff Trump’s cabinet and White House. ... The character of the new government marks a violent realignment of the state to correspond with the nature of capitalist society itself.', 'Musk’s ever more direct personal involvement also makes clear that the fight against the social counterrevolution being carried out by the Trump administration is inextricably bound up with the expropriation of the vast wealth controlled by the oligarchs, as part of the socialist reorganization of economic life.', 'The overriding concern of the Democrats is to smother any genuine opposition to Trump and maintain collaboration with their fascist “colleagues” across the aisle.', 'Workers in the US, Canada and Mexico must emphatically oppose all attempts to corral them behind their respective ruling classes and governments in the developing trade war.', 'While the full details are still emerging, the disaster, the political infighting and cover-up which have followed it already expose and intersect with a colossal political crisis and instability in the United States.', 'For the first time in the 75-year post-war history of the German parliament, one of the major parliamentary groups has made common cause with fascists to help an authoritarian and racist motion achieve a breakthrough.', '']"

It’s an example your company shouldn’t follow.', 'BY KIT EATON @KITEATON', 'Elon Musk. Photos: Getty Images', 'Elon Musk Department of Government Efficiency is already controversial, but now President Donald Trump has added another wrinkle. Hours after Musk revealed a plan to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a White House official spoke to USA Today to explain that Musk was officially joining the federal government. Musk is now officially a “special government employee,” which allows him to work for the government for a certain amount of time. Musk won’t be taking a paycheck, in keeping with his self-appointed mission to cut government spending. Also, he’s already the richest man in the world.', 'The thing is that the “special” term may rankle some critics and government workers, even though it may please the not-exactly-humble Musk. Some may also bristle because former President Joe Biden used the same system to hire a top aide. ', 'USA Today explains the designation gives Musk authority to work on behalf of the government for 130 days in a year without having to publicly disclose his finances. Not that Musk really needs to do that anyway, given that the status of his fortune is more or less public knowledge, as is his battle with the American legal system over a potential $56-billion pay deal from Tesla.', 'The title does underline that Musk has direct approval from the president, and Trump supported this when speaking to reporters on Sunday. “Sometimes we won’t agree with it, and we’ll not go where he wants to go,” he said, adding, “but I think he’s doing a great job.”', 'FEATURED VIDEO', 'This Health Food Founder Would Rather Go Broad Than Niche', 'This also means Trump’s shadow is cast across all the purported money-saving activities that DOGE is busy doing. Critics of Musk’s plan to shut down USAID (which he alleged is a “criminal” organization, despite the fact that it’s an official government body, established by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to help people in need) note it may actually end up putting thousands of U.S. workers out of a job, as a report at CNN notes.', 'DOGE’s actions and its very existence are raising difficult legal questions, and Musk’s access to government institutions is bothering critics. NPR reports that Richard Painter, who served as the lead ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, has noted that Musk isn’t allowed to “participate in any United States government matter that has a direct and predictable effect on his financial holdings,” and if he does, he’s committing a crime. ', 'The special status given to Musk means his tacit approval from the president also smacks of the kind of workplace favoritism that can deeply unsettle a typical workforce. Favoritism, like nepotism, is something that workers regularly complain about in workplace surveys, particularly when a new hire seems to lack the relevant experience or credentials to carry out the task they’ve been hired to do. So is Musk really special? This sort of unease over expertise has also been levied at Musk’s DOGE team, who seem to trend young in age and low in experience of government work.', 'Meanwhile, at NASA, interim administrator Janet Petro (a Trump appointee who is the agency’s first female head, and who has already moved swiftly to embrace Trump’s push to abolish DEI) seems to have made a similar move. Petro has announced that long-term SpaceX employee Michael Altenhofen has joined the organization as her “senior adviser.” ', 'Altenhofen, tech news site Ars Technica notes, interned at NASA in 2005 but has spent the interim period working at SpaceX, including a recent role as lead of its human spaceflight program. This new NASA position is unlikely to quell industry worries that the Trump administration, with close Trump ally Musk in the president’s inner circle, will play favorites when it comes to future commercial space contracts. It may also seem like a surprising move, since Petro is only the interim head of the space agency. Trump has already tapped entrepreneur and two-time astronaut Jared Isaacman to be the actual NASA administrator, though he must still be confirmed.', 'Trump, for his part, seems blithely calm about the clash between Musk’s own enterprises and his involvement in the government.

The efficiency mandate, Ehikian wrote, was “effective immediately.”', 'Ehikian’s email also served as the internal announcement of a series of new appointees across key roles in the agency. They include Thomas Shedd, who is taking over the leadership of the Technology Transformation Services, the essential government unit for the government’s technology products and services.', 'Shedd spent the previous eight years building software for vehicle and battery factories at Tesla, Musk’s car company. His approach in the new role carries echoes of Musk’s private-sector strategies, one of the people familiar with the matter said, citing a Shedd email this week to hundreds of GSA employees to schedule “touch-base” sessions and bring with them an example of a recent “technical win.”', 'In addition to managing the federal government’s real estate, GSA manages some of the most massive government contracts.', 'Critics have questioned the inherent conflict of interest in Musk’s associates working within the GSA, even though they all should have signed nondisclosure agreements. Musk has billions of dollars in government contracts, and one source familiar with the situation noted that some of his closest associates now have access to “sensitive and often classified acquisitions information for billions of dollars in government contracts.”', 'According to two sources familiar with the situation at GSA, every office agency must present proposals this week to cut 50% of their business expenses, in addition to the GSA efforts to significantly reduce the federal government’s real estate footprint. GSA is also expected to begin terminating about 3,000 of the “soft term” leases (of nearly 7,000 total leases across the country). Leadership have been advised of a push to cancel 300 leases per day.', 'The GSA didn’t respond to a request for comment.', 'Late last week, the DOGE appointees were granted full access to the government’s payments system after the top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left his job unexpectedly. The DOGE appointees had clashed with Lebryk after they expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.', 'Musk himself acknowledged his interest in the Treasury Department’s payment processing in a middle-of-the-night post on his social media platform Saturday.', 'He wrote his team “discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.”', 'The post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system’s value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation’s economy lies in its reliability.', 'The Treasury moves have spurred a lawsuit, filed Monday on behalf of government unions and others, alleging a “massive and unprecedented” intrusion into private government data.', 'It adds to a pile of lawsuits that has grown quickly in the last two weeks, in some cases halting the administration’s actions.', '“That’s why this whole mishmash is so troubling,” McClanahan said. “They have managed to break so many rules and so many laws with some fairly simple actions that a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in the media and politicians and everyone get tangled up on. … You’re basically punching smoke when you’re trying to litigate against this.”', 'This story has been updated with new reporting', 'CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Alayna Treene, Jennifer Hansler, Lauren Kent, Alex Marquardt and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

See our ethics statement.', 'Elon Musk has an uncanny ability to sort out which of America’s rules are real. It turns out punishment from the National Labor Relations Board isn’t real, punishment from NASA isn’t real, and punishment from the FAA isn’t real. The Delaware Chancery Court is extremely real. Based on the past two weeks, the Delaware Chancery Court may be the only real thing in the entire American government.', 'Here’s a quick recap. While putative President Donald Trump was busy alienating allies through tariffs and wasting water in California — real mad king hours — Musk pushed out the head of the FAA. Then the reports came fast and thick: Federal employees received a “fork in the road” email highly reminiscent of Musk’s Twitter ultimatum, encouraging them to resign, sent from an insecure server. A bunch of goons, some of them actual teenagers, reportedly got access to the US Treasury systems. (Read-only, reportedly, for now.) Longtime civil servants were locked out of the personnel systems that, by the way, house the personal data for government employees. Musk’s lackeys are in control of the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration. They’ve gotten ahold of classified information, and are now shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Musk said he “spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.”', 'Did I get everything? Probably not. For instance, Musk has made statements that he “deleted” a department, but since he’s a known liar, that may not be true. Between whatever Musk is posting about on X, the pace at which events are occurring, and the general confusion among government employees, giving a full summation of events is impossible. Perhaps between the time this is published and you read it, there will be more bullshit.', 'The clear goal here amounts to a coup over the administrative state', 'Still, based on the events that have transpired so far, it seems the clear goal here amounts to a coup over the administrative state. My editor reminds me that many of you were not paying attention in civics class and so: our government’s famed checks and balances system relies on Congress controlling spending. Musk’s job was originally framed as making recommendations for programs that Congress could cut.', 'The present Trump administration, which also did not pay attention in civics class, either doesn’t know or doesn’t care about checks and balances. First, it tried to freeze spending with a legal pronouncement. That was quickly halted by several courts. Then Musk decided to bust into the bureaucracy and start ripping out wires — a technical solution to a legal problem.', 'If I wanted to destroy democracy in the US, I’m not sure what I would do differently.', 'Does that sound like liberal hysteria? Okay, here’s Brian Riedl, an economist who works for the conservative Manhattan Institute, and before that, the Heritage Foundation and Republican Senator Rob Portman: “I see a lot of people want to throw out 230 years of constitutional government and replace it with an authoritarian dictator because they have big feelings about the budget and can’t be bothered to work through Congress.”', 'Musk’s chaos is compounding other crises', 'At Musk’s functional companies — SpaceX and to some degree, Tesla — he’s put in a playpen where he can’t damage the real work. At Twitter, we saw what happened when there was no padding between him and the company: he began switching things off at random, firing engineers willy-nilly (and then trying to rehire them), and turning its revenue into a giant bonfire. Now Musk has brought this strategy to the federal government.', 'The most immediate consequences have been borne by USAID, whose programs include George W. Bush’s effort to care for HIV patients in Africa — one that is reputed to have saved 20 million lives so far. The building housing USAID has been shuttered. An email explaining the move attributed it to “agency leadership,” and replies to the email “should be directed to an email address that appears to be associated with Gavin Kliger, whose LinkedIn profile identifies him as a special adviser to the director of the Office of Personnel Management and who works for DOGE,” according to The Wall Street Journal.', 'And Musk’s chaos is compounding other crises. Take the two plane crashes in major cities last week — one in DC and one in Philadelphia. Days earlier, Musk had pushed out the head of the FAA, who had fined SpaceX for not getting its launch changes approved. The vast majority of air traffic control facilities are understaffed, so it does seem weird that just days before the first crash, those who were on staff had been offered buyouts. After the second crash, a note went out saying air traffic controllers were exempt from a hiring freeze that took place after Trump took office.', 'Consider again the Twitter playbook — because this is just the beginning. Let’s say Musk gets direct access to treasury payments, which seems very likely to be his aim. Will he stop paying bills, as he did with Twitter’s leases? Might be fun to discover what the military does when they don’t get their paychecks, or how many grandparents get evicted when the Social Security checks don’t go out. How many of Musk’s unsecured servers do you think foreign spies have penetrated already? All of them, maybe?', 'The real question is: who will stop him?', 'As for the Treasury stuff — well, if I were a government contractor that wasn’t SpaceX, I’d be nervous. I mean, if you upset Musk, do you think he’s going to pay out your contracts on time?', 'Does Musk have the authority to do this? Doesn’t matter. As we know from previous Musk experience, the real question is: who will stop him? So far the answer appears to be no one. The CIA, FBI, and NSA appear to be doing nothing. The US attorney’s office in DC is threatening individuals and groups who “appear to violate the law in targeting DOGE employees.” The Democratic party is making strongly worded statements and issuing letters of concern.', 'The stiffest resistance Musk is getting to his unconstitutional romp through the inner workings of the American government is from the workers themselves — both through union lawsuits and through a simple refusal to do as he asks. Some workers are also suing over the insecure server for the “fork in the road” email. Two unions, the AFL-CIO and the SEIU, are suing the Treasury and Scott Bessent “to halt Defendants’ unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information contained in Defendants’ records to Elon Musk.”', 'We are all supposed to pretend this is happening in the name of efficiency and cost-savings, and not as a way for Musk to pursue his shitty personal feuds. How posting to X at all hours of the day is efficient is a question I’m not sure anyone can answer, but then, it’s kind of one of the more minor questions in this scenario. And when I say “this scenario,” I mean that Elon Musk is going to do whatever he wants, and post through it, and threaten anyone who tries to stop him with, apparently, a US attorney.', '“Regulations, basically, should be default gone.”', 'Donald Trump, Musk’s wholly owned puppet, has said Musk won’t do anything without his approval. Sure. Okay. I don’t see what difference that makes. We all remember “executive time,” don’t we? This man only wants to golf and watch TV.', 'But don’t worry, there’s to be a new sovereign wealth fund, which seems like a wonderful place for Musk and his Silicon Valley friends to siphon off government money, money that is no longer being used for wasteful purposes like Meals on Wheels or the Head Start program. And Musk’s failing X could be propped up by making it the official source of government communications. Oh, and “regulations, basically, should be default gone,” Musk said on a midnight rant on X. In this environment, The Onion’s headline “Elon Musk Offers Self $10 Billion Federal Buyout” reads more like a prediction than satire.', 'What’s good for Musk isn’t good for the rest of us. His factories are famously unsafe places to work. After he bought Twitter, he drove out security professionals — making the platform more vulnerable to fraud. SpaceX has been busily polluting Texas. Throughout the years he’s been very clear: he’s going to do whatever he wants, whatever the consequences.', 'Now he’s bringing that sensibility to the federal government. As long as Musk doesn’t have the power to stop payments, he hasn’t completely succeeded. About 90-odd years after the original Business Plot — to overthrow President Franklin Roosevelt and install a dictator — Musk appears to be quite close to finishing the job. So here’s the question: are there any real rules in America, at all?', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', 'The Verge’s Allison Johnson joins the show to talk about the new Samsung Galaxy S25, what’s new in this high-end phone, and what it means for all the other smartphones coming this year. After that, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, talks us through how to think about the privacy implications of RedNote, TikTok, DeepSeek, and all the other tech that puts us in contact with China.
