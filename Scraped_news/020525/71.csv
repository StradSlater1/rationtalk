How dangerous is the new COVID variant? How does bird flu spread to humans? Is bird flu going to become a pandemic? What is HMPV?', 'AMA\'s Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia, JD, MPH, discusses the ""mystery virus"" human metapneumovirus, that HMPV is not new, and shares trends in seasonal influenza and COVID-19 cases. Also covering the latest bird flu news of H5N9 on a California duck farm, as well as a raw pet food recall and the dangers of H5N1 for dogs and cats. AMA Chief Experience Officer Todd Unger hosts.', 'AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students.', ""Garcia: That's the human metapneumovirus, or HMPV, for short. And some in the media have sensationalized it by calling it the mystery virus. But there's really no mystery to it, and it's not new by any stretch. "", ""Unger: Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer. Welcome back, Andrea. "", ""Garcia: Thanks, Todd. It's good to be here. "", ""Unger: Well, we're looking at a lot of news out there about bird flu, so let's start there. A rare strain of the virus has been discovered on a California poultry farm. Andrea, tell us more about that and what it could mean. "", 'Garcia: Yeah, Todd. There was an article in The Guardian earlier this week, and it noted that the World Organization for Animal Health reported the first outbreak of a rare bird flu in poultry, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N9, and this has been detected on a duck farm in California. Authorities said the discovery of H5N9 came in addition to the detection of the more common H5N1 strain on that same farm in Merced County. ', ""Almost 119,000 birds on the farm have been killed since early December. And according to the USDA, this is the first confirmed H5N9 case in poultry in the United States. The agency also said they're conducting comprehensive epidemiological investigations and enhanced surveillance and response. "", ""The concern, once again, is whether or not this novel virus will cause human infections and become a pandemic subtype. That's not known yet and may actually not be known for some time. But it's certainly important to conduct further research on this. "", 'Unger: Absolutely. And alongside this news, The New York Times also published an article that bird flu is entering a, quote, ""new phase."" What exactly does that mean? ', ""Garcia: Well, Todd, I think it means that we really need to keep a close eye on this. And while it's impossible to predict the course of this virus, as you mentioned, The New York Times did lay out some potential scenarios based on what we know right now and how things are shifting, even ever so slightly. First, I think let's recap where we're at. "", 'So the virus has infected more than 900 herds and 67 people in the U.S., killing one individual. The experts in The Times article said that while a human pandemic is not inevitable, some developments indicate that the possibility may no longer be quite so remote. ', ""Unger: I guess that's really the bottom line here and all the discussions that we're having. Andrea, can you take us through some of those developments that are decreasing or, I guess, the odds that it's remote? "", ""Garcia: Well, I think, first, there's the question of reinfection, which could dictate how this virus evolves over time. And like much of this, this isn't, at this point, 100% clear. The article gives one example where a few dairy herds in Idaho were affected this past spring, and then they displayed mild symptoms for a second time in November. "", 'Now, the USDA has said that it does not see evidence of new infections or reinfections in previously affected herds but rather a lack of clearance of that original infection. However, outside experts have said that the trajectory of symptoms in Idaho herds suggests a second round of illness. ', 'Unger: So why is it so important to make the distinction? ', ""Garcia: Reinfection in and of itself wouldn't be particularly surprising, and symptoms could potentially be milder the second time around, which would be good. However, this suggests that the virus could circulate on farms indefinitely, and the longer it circulates, the more opportunities it has to evolve into a more dangerous form. Also, if the symptoms from reinfections are extremely mild, it would likely make that rapid detection difficult, if not impossible. "", ""Unger: Now, Andrea, a second big question, of course, is about the virus's ability to spread between animals and humans. And I know that's a worry we've discussed a lot here before. Did that article or any other news sources address that concern? "", 'Garcia: It did. And the worry here is that if bird flu circulates long enough, it could also eventually find that right combination of genetic mutations to make it easily transmissible among people. And adding to these concerns, in early December, scientists reported that, in a lab setting, a single mutation helped the virus infect human cells more efficiently. ', 'If you recall, late last year, two people, a Canadian teen and a Louisiana resident, who was over the age of 65, became seriously ill with bird flu. And while the Canadian teen eventually recovered, the Louisiana man did not. ', 'Unger: I remember you talking about that. Why are those particular cases so significant, then? ', ""Garcia: Well, prior to those cases, people infected in the current outbreak didn't have severe symptoms. Both of those patients contracted a virus belonging to the D1.1 genotype that's been detected in wild birds and poultry. It is distinct from the one in dairy cattle. And in both individuals, that virus gained mutations during the course of infection that might allow it to better infect people. "", 'Right now, the CDC still says the risk to the general public is low. But we also know how easily and quickly that could change. And given this, we really just cannot underestimate it. ', ""Unger: Well, if history has taught us anything, it's that we can't underestimate any virus. And before we leave the topic of bird flu, we've seen some headlines about pet food. What does this have to do with bird flu, and why the concern now? "", 'Garcia: Well, cats appear to be especially vulnerable to the H5N1 virus, and domesticated cats have actually died from bird flu in a number of states. In most cases, this was after consuming raw pet food or raw milk contaminated with the H5N1 virus. According to an article by NBC News, this has prompted the recall of at least one brand of pet food, as well as new federal guidelines on pet food quality. ', ""This week, the FDA suggested that pet food manufacturers take precautions in their food safety plan, such as seeking ingredients from flocks or herbs that are healthy, and taking processing steps, such as heat treatment, that are capable of inactivating viruses. In its warning, the FDA said that H5N1 can be deadly to cats as well as dogs, so we're encouraging consumers to carefully consider the risk of this emerging pathogen before feeding their pets undercooked meat or an uncooked pet food product. We know that both the CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association also discourage uncooked meat diets for companion animals. "", ""Unger: Well, that's good to know, especially for us pet owners, including me. Andrea, let's turn our attention to something different now, and that's seasonal influenza. How are the numbers looking this week? "", 'Garcia: Well, flu continues to be trending high across most states, and public health experts have expressed concern that, obviously, we could be missing H5N1 cases, as the most commonly used influenza tests do not distinguish between bird flu and seasonal flu. At CDC HAN, we discussed last week on a shortened timeline for subtyping all influenza A specimens among hospitalized patients does help to address this. ', 'Also, in the rare case a person is simultaneously infected with seasonal flu and H5N1, the virus could, in theory, exchange genetic material to create a new virus that spreads more easily between humans. So while the chances of that happening are low, that\'s another thing to watch out for. But what really caught my attention this week was a Washington Post article with the headline, ""COVID isn\'t as bad this winter. Flu is worse. Here\'s why."" ', 'Unger: That is an interesting quote. What did you learn? ', ""Garcia: Well, it does feel like everyone is sick with everything right now. But the chances are it's not COVID. The COVID wave this winter has been less severe than previous years. We know that hospitalization rates are down, and wastewater surveillance levels are lower. Instead, we've seen a mix of other viruses this season, walking pneumonia, RSV, norovirus, bird flu, in addition to seasonal influenza, who's hospitalization rate is three times as high as COVID this season. "", 'Unger: Wow. Andrea, did the article offer any insights as to why this is the case? ', ""Garcia: Well, Todd, unlike flu and RSV, we know that COVID hangs around in the spring and the summer, and the COVID wave in the summer of 2024 was worse than in the summer of 2023. People who had COVID in the summer and were exposed to it again in recent weeks were less likely to become infected and spread the virus. I think vaccination also played a role, and while those numbers aren't where we'd hoped they'd be, more people got the updated COVID vaccine heading into this winter than last. "", ""And now that practically everyone has some degree of immunity to COVID, the virus does have to evolve to bypass those antibodies. And that's just not happening like it once was. According to the article, the XEC variant, which now accounts for nearly half of new cases, is not substantially different than the KP and the FLiRT variants that drove our summer wave. "", ""So I want to be clear. This doesn't mean that this will always be the case. More threatening variants could absolutely still emerge. But in the meantime, we know that it is other viruses that are really keeping physicians busy. "", ""Unger: Speaking of other viruses, before we wrap up, Andrea, I've been hearing about another virus in China that apparently has now made its way here to the U.S. What is that virus? And is there cause for concern? "", 'Garcia: Well, Todd, that\'s the human metapneumovirus, or HMPV for short. And some in the media have sensationalized it by calling it, ""the mystery virus."" ', ""But there's really no mystery to it, and it's not new by any stretch. According to a New York Times article that ran earlier this month, HMPV has circulated in humans for decades. It's a respiratory illness and is so common that most people will be infected as children and experience several infections in their lifetimes. "", 'In countries with months of cold weather, HMPV can have an annual season, much like flu. And then in hotter climates, it circulates at lower levels all year long. In higher-income countries, the virus is rarely fatal. In lower-income countries, with weaker health systems and poorer surveillance, deaths are more common. ', ""Unger: Andrea, if this is a virus that's been circulating for decades, why haven't we heard of this or heard a lot about it lately? "", ""Garcia: Well, Todd, it certainly doesn't have the same name recognition because it's rarely discussed by name. According to a physician in The Times article, the clinical features are difficult to distinguish from other viral illnesses, and physicians don't routinely test for HMPV. "", 'Most infections typically go unrecognized and are chalked up to whatever respiratory thing happens to be going around. These symptoms include cough, fever, nasal congestion and wheezing. Most infections are mild, but severe cases can result in bronchitis or pneumonia, particularly among infants, older adults and people who are immunocompromised. ', 'Unger: So, Andrea, why is it making news now? ', 'Garcia: Well, Todd, cases have been increasing, and Chinese authorities have said that HMPV cases could spike even more during the Lunar New Year holiday, which we know is at the end of this month. We also know from recent articles that levels are currently high in the UK, which is often indicative of what we can expect here.', ""According to an article last updated on Sunday, Britain is on high alert as cases have surged, prompting both health warning and calls for masking. A report from mid-January suggests that HMPV is already currently increasing in some parts of the United States, including in Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska. So, it's something to keep an eye on but certainly nothing to panic about. "", ""Unger: All right, Andrea. Well, thank you so much for the update. And that wraps up this week's episode.

But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with ""highly pathogenic avian influenza,"" meaning it caused severe disease.', '""Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,"" the USDA said of the flock.', 'Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.', 'Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.', ""H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases."", 'A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a ""reassortment,"" where H5N1 was able to genetically mix with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.', '""The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,"" the spokesperson said. ', 'Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said. ', '""The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,"" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be ""terribly surprising"" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.  ', '""H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,"" Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.', 'H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called ""low pathogenic avian influenza"" by veterinarians. ', '""H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,"" said Tompkins.', 'Some of the earliest records of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials reported had ""mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.""', ""The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry."", '""The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn\'t mean trouble necessarily,"" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.', 'Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5 strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him. ', '""It\'s not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,"" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA\'s Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.', 'Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.', '""So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn\'t have that, it can\'t outcompete,"" said Swayne.', 'As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.', 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.', 'It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.', '""The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,"" said Pekosz.', 'The USDA said the virus was detected at a ""commercial duck meat"" farm in California\'s Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.', 'A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread. ', ""More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry."", 'Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.', '""Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,"" said Swayne.', 'Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.', '""If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There\'s probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,"" said Swayne.', 'Alexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

Now, Crescent Duck Farm is the only one left. It produced a million ducks a year, until two weeks ago, when bird flu shut the farm down. Corwin said, ""I saw a flock one day that was great, and the next day was lethargic, wasn\'t eating. It looked like something I\'d never seen before.""', ""Dozens of state and local agricultural workers, dressed in biohazard suits, assisted in the euthanasia of the entire flock – 100,000 ducks. Whether it's ducks or chickens, since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, reached the United States in 2022, over 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized."", '""It\'s a staggering number, there is no doubt,"" said Jodie Guest, a professor of epidemiology with Emory University\'s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta. ""But it is, and always has been a policy across administrations, with the USDA, that this is how they handle infections like this among poultry. And as we\'ve seen bird flu move [across] species, it becomes even more important to try to contain that infection in the flocks that it\'s in, so that we don\'t continue to see spread.""', 'Except that\'s exactly what has happened. H5N1, Guest said, was in all 50 states by the end of 2023, transmitted by wild birds through their feces and saliva. ""So, in 2024 we saw bird flu jump from our poultry and wild birds, to mammals, to cows. And that was a very startling change,"" she said.', 'Until 2024, there was only one human case in the U.S. In just a few months, the number jumped to 67, with one death.

This is not the same type of bird flu that\'s already been spreading on dairy cow and poultry farms in the U.S., causing at least several dozen infections in humans. That virus is called H5N1.', 'So what is H5N9? How does it differ from H5N1, and should we be equally concerned about it?', 'Related: Bird flu strikes 1st child in the US — CDC says infection source unknown', 'H5N9 is a highly pathogenic avian flu (or bird flu) virus that bears some structural similarities to H5N1.', '""Low pathogenic"" H5N9 viruses have previously been detected in birds in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, dating back to the 1960s. However, these infections are usually associated with less-severe symptoms than ""highly pathogenic"" strains are. This is the first time highly pathogenic H5N9 has been seen in the U.S., and these deadlier strains are also fairly uncommon worldwide.', 'New subtypes and strains of influenza can emerge if viruses pick up random genetic mutations as they multiply, as well as if multiple viruses swap genetic information with one another. This latter process is known as genetic reassortment, and it usually happens when an organism is infected with at least two different viruses at the same time.', 'Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.', 'Some experts suspect that H5N9 may have emerged among the ducks in California due to genetic reassortment occurring between circulating H5N1 viruses and other flu viruses containing the N9 protein.

These bird flu viruses are known as ""highly pathogenic"" because they are extremely deadly to certain poultry — like chickens — and culling an exposed flock is typically considered the best way of preventing additional flocks from getting sick.', 'Scientists have recently expressed increasing concern that a strain of bird flu could mutate into a form that easily spreads among humans, sparking a pandemic.

However, not all bird flu viruses are equipped to efficiently infect people and then spread between them. When given more chances to spread to new animals, the viruses have a higher chance of picking up that ability and harming humans.', ""Notably, over the past couple of years, H5N1 has spread to new countries, including the U.S. It's been widely infecting wild birds and poultry and has also jumped into various mammals, including cattle and domestic cats. Since its discovery, H5N1 has infected more than 900 people globally, and in the past year, at least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected.

I think a lot of that is just bad luck. So birds across the country, wild birds, are infected with a virus. And Ohio is one of the leading states for poultry production, so we have a lot of birds in the beginning to potentially be susceptible to this virus. So it seems that we just have a lot of farms that have unfortunately been in contact with wild birds and transmitted the virus to the domestic poultry here. And we've seen it not just in chickens, which is what we're seeing mostly across the country, but also in domestic turkey, which, again, we have a lot of turkey farms here in this state."", ""A: Again, I don't think we know that data. It's really hard to get that. You have to go out and capture birds and test them, and for most wild birds — and this is not always the case — but usually it is not a serious infection, so they can carry the virus. And in birds, it's a gastrointestinal infection, so they can carry it and not get sick. So it's hard to really get great data on prevalence in these birds because lots of them can be carrying it around and not show it. So I'm not sure we have great surveillance data on wild birds throughout the country."", ""A: There have been reports of potential outbreaks that, as far as I know, are still being tested here in the local area. And so if you see wild birds that do appear to be ill, call wildlife professionals; don't take care of them yourself. If it is something in a place where you can't avoid it, it's close to your house or your driveway or something and you need it to be moved, bag it up, use a mask, use gloves, wash your hands afterwards. Try not to get too close to it because this can be spread potentially through touch but also through the air. So just avoid it as much as you can. Call wildlife professionals if possible."", ""And besides wild birds, we're also seeing this in dairy cattle. There's a dairy cattle outbreak as well, which we've also seen cases in Ohio, and some of that also has been transmitted via raw milk. So that's another aspect that has infected people is getting this by drinking raw milk. And in addition to people being sick with that, it has also affected barn cats on farms where this is present. So if you have indoor-outdoor cats, if you're near a dairy farm, especially, or if they have access to wild birds, you may want to keep those inside while this is going on so they don't have access to potentially get infected."", ""A: From an infectious disease edidemiologist, raw eggs are always a bad idea, since they do have salmonella and other organisms as well. So I would always advise to eat eggs well cooked. I'm not aware of any confirmed cases coming from raw eggs to date, so those don't seem to be as big of a risk factor. But again, I would always recommend to have those well cooked anyway."", ""A: Well, actually, most of the cases in the U.S. have been mild, so we don't know really that this is changing its virulence at all. We've been following this since 1997, and in that first outbreak that was in birds in Asia, 18 people got sick, and six of them died. So that's a much higher fatality rate than anything we've seen here in the United States so far. One case out of 67 is a much lower fatality rate than what we have seen collectively over the last 20-odd years. But we're concerned about that person that passed away."", ""Most of the cases that we've seen this year have been in contact with poultry and/or dairy cattle. They've been farm workers for the most part. The death in Louisiana was not a farm worker; it was a person who had contact with wild birds. So there are a couple different strains of H5N1 circulating, the one that is mostly in dairy cattle and one amongst wild birds. And from what we've seen, the one that this person in Louisiana got from wild birds seems to be more harmful than the ones circulating in dairy cattle right now. Of course, that can change on a dime. Viruses evolve very quickly. But we think that they were just infected with that strain, and also, it sounds like they were a little bit older and had some other conditions that may have made it more difficult for them to fight off a flu infection."", ""A: We don't know how well it will match what is currently circulating. With flu vaccines anyway, we get those ready according to what is circulating in the spring so that the vaccines will be ready in the fall for flu season. And usually we have a good match; sometimes we don't. And so if we don't have a great match, that just means that the vaccine will not work quite as well. Usually they still protect against serious infection, against hospitalization, but sometimes they won't be as good at protecting against infection outright. Or you get vaccinated, but you'll still get sick, but you won't end up in the hospital. So that may be what's happening if we have a mismatch between an H5N1 vaccine that is already created and the strain that is circulating at whatever moment that the vaccine starts to be given out. But we'll see. It's hard to tell right now, at this moment, what could be happening if and when we start a major vaccine campaign for this."", ""A: Oh yeah, and to develop different vaccines as well. So the H5N1 vaccines that we have currently in the stockpile are very similar to our regular seasonal flu vaccines as far as how they're produced. But companies, of course, are starting to work on mRNA vaccines for H5N1, and because those can be produced more quickly if there is a change in the makeup of the virus, potentially those could be rolled out more quickly than the traditional flu vaccines that we use. There's a lot of research into not only those type of mRNA vaccines, but the Holy Grail, really, of flu vaccine research, is to get a vaccine that would protect against all strains so that you didn't need to get a flu vaccine every single year as the strains change. That's been going on for a long time with, unfortunately, no major development in that yet, but that is still ongoing research."", ""A: Yeah, there are. But the problem with those is that some of them are produced in eggs. So all viruses, of course — they have to grow in some kind of a cell. They can't grow on their own. And so sometimes we can use different types of cells in a Petri dish that have been grown specifically to grow viruses. But for flu, one of the types of processes that we use is to grow it in eggs. And if we have a virus that is wiping out chickens that is already putting our egg supply in doubt, we're not going to have enough eggs to use for flu vaccines. So that's definitely a concern that he's said he would limit it to basically the types of production we have now, which are slower and don't produce as much vaccine in a short period of time as the mRNA vaccines do. We showed with COVID how quickly those can be developed, tested and rolled out. So if we really need to get 100 million or 200 million doses, enough to vaccinate a good chunk of the country, the fastest way to do that might be with mRNA vaccines. And so if he's ruling those out, that's problematic."", ""A: I don't think so right now. Right now, the people that I would think should be paying close attention to this are farmers who might have this coming into their animals. Obviously, we've seen it in poultry; we've seen it in dairy cattle. But I'm most concerned about it getting into pig populations because pigs can serve as quote-unquote mixing vessels, where they could be infected with a human strain of flu, infected with an avian strain, it can mix and match within the pig and then come out to humans with a version that may spread better in humans. So, pig farmers, I would think — they usually already have very good biosecurity, but I hope they're looking at that and making sure that all of their animals and their workers are safe. So those are the ones that I think would be most concerned about it right now, and again, also anyone who might have contact with live or deceased wild birds because we know those are a reservoir for this, and it's hard to tell which ones are infected. But for, I think, the general population right now, there's not much risk to them in general."", ""But I teach a course on disaster preparedness; I always recommend that you have a plan for any kind of disaster, whether that's a blizzard or a power outage or a pandemic. So I recommend people are prepared but not overly worrying about about bird flu."", 'Patrick Williams covers growth and development for the Akron Beacon Journal.

The farm is one of many in the area that has been hit hard by H5N1 HPAV.', 'Courtesy photo', 'VERSAILLES — H5N1 HPAV (avian flu) is not letting up in west central Ohio. The numbers have continued to rise in Darke and Mercer counties and now Van Wert County is beginning to see cases hit their poultry farms.', 'According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Ohio is leading the nation in reported cases of the virus over the past 30 days. In the 30 days prior to Jan. 29, Ohio had 7.3 million birds affected, but there were cases before that period began and there have been new cases reported since.', 'All of the cases in Ohio have been in Darke, Mercer and Van Wert counties. No backyard/hobby flocks have been affected by the H5N1 HPAV.', 'Since Jan. 24, another 2.8 million birds have been euthanized across the three counties because of HPAV.', 'This brings the total to 7,960,136 birds euthanized in all three counties since Dec. 27, 2024. Darke County has had 2,587,035 layers, 889,845 pullets and 101,075 turkeys affected by the virus. Mercer County has witnessed a huge increase since their first report on Jan. 23. The county has been forced to destroy 4,171,772 layers, 176,454 turkeys and 12,600 ducks. The newest county reporting the avian flu is Van Wert with 21,355 turkeys affected.', 'Weaver Eggs had sunk millions of dollars into biosecurity prior to this current outbreak, but the virus was still able to find its way to one of their barns and caused the company to lose 1.3 million layers.', 'According to Tim Weaver, each of their trucks are dedicated to one farm. The truck is not permitted to go to other farms, and must go through a truck wash each time it comes onto the farm. Employees follow a similar practice. Employees are only allowed on one farm and cannot be assigned to the other farms. All of this is done to prevent cross contamination.', 'Weaver Eggs and other poultry producers have also followed their practice of issuing no-go zones for employees and truck drivers. If a hot spot has been identified, employees and truck drivers must go five to seven miles around the hot spot in order to get to their workplace or destination.', 'The poultry farmers may be able to receive assistance from the USDA. According to the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA), the USDA provides indemnity and compensation for some of the losses and costs for producers when HPAI is detected in a flock. That amount is based on factors such as flock size and indemnity values.', 'Getting back to normal for these producers may take several months. When there is detection, the ODA staff follows USDA guidelines for quarantine to prevent the spread of the disease. A control area and surveillance zone are set up to monitor other facilities nearby. Part of these guidelines and response includes regulatory staff conducting environmental sampling of the premises prior to restocking. Following approval from ODA and USDA, restocking and production can begin.', 'According to Weaver, it could take three or four months before they can start to get back to their normal production levels.', 'The threat of the avian flu is also beginning to affect businesses outside of what would typically be considered agriculture. The Akron Zoo and Columbus Zoo and Aquarium have announced the birds that are susceptible to the virus will not be in their normal enclosures and will not be viewable by the public.', 'The cost is yet to be determined for this area, but in 2022 the cost topped $3 billion, nationally. Consumers have already experienced an increase in the cost of eggs, chicken and turkey. While some of the increase is due to inflation, some of the other costs are associated with avian flu hitting farms throughout the nation.', 'ODA Director Brian Baldridge attributes some of the spread of avian flu to wild birds that are looking for coops; although a reason for the current outbreak has not been given.', 'Baldridge said, “In 2024, we had no commercial detections, at all, right up until Christmas Eve and we had our first detection and since then it has been very busy and, unfortunately, we have had multiple detections on premises and farms throughout kind of the western side of the state.', 'Baldridge encourages producers to keep an eye on their flocks to ensure they are healthy. He advised that it’s not only important for commercial farms, but it is also important for backyard flocks. If a backyard flock begins to see birds having respiratory issues or are dying, the owner should contact their veterinarian.', 'There has only been one backyard flock affected by the virus since mid-December and that was in Greene County.', 'HPAV has also taken a toll on cows across the country with numerous herds affected by the virus.', 'Since 2022, Ohio has only had one HPAI affected dairy herd. As part of a federal order, ODA’s Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory has tested thousands of milk samples from dozens of counties across Ohio. There continues to be weekly milk testing submissions to the lab as part of the Dairy Herd Status Program. This simple USDA-based testing program allows dairy producers to move lactating cattle across stateliness without individual tests. Additionally, this program provides financial assistance to producers for disease prevention strategies, veterinary costs, and biosecurity.', 'Although rare, avian flu can be transmitted to humans. According to Maine.gov, the risk of infection is the highest for people who work with infected wild or domestic animals or unpasteurized (raw) milk. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), there were 66 confirmed cases of H5N1 bird flu in the United States in 2024. There have been 67 since 2022. There has only been one death attributed to an individual as a result of avian flu. The CDC reported the death on Jan. 6.', 'Commercial and backyard poultry operators are asked to be vigilant because of how quickly avian flu can spread. Those with backyard or hobby flocks should call the ODA at 614-728-6220 or afterhours at 888-456-3405. Commercial poultry operators should call the Ohio Poultry Association (OPA) at 614-882-6111.', 'If the public spots deceased wild birds, such as raptors, waterfowl or any other large congregation of sick or dead birds, they should call 800-WILDLIFE (945-3543).', 'You can also call your veterinarian who will contact the ODA or OPA to determine what testing should be performed. Once samples are collected and if they are positive for H5 or H7 virus, they are considered as presumptive positives and are forwarded to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. NVSL is the only laboratory in the United States that is authorized to officially confirm the presence of a HPAI and identify the specific strain of the virus.', 'To contact Greenville Daily Advocate Editor Ryan Berry, email rberry@aimmediamidwest.com.']"

', '“But it has enormous potential to mutate to a form that is very dangerous.”', 'Bird flu is widespread around the world resulting in outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, as well as cases in people who work in those industries, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ', 'There is no evidence of person-to-person spread so far, the agency reports, noting that the one person who died was exposed from a backyard flock. ', 'But the commercial poultry industry has been hit hard with many millions of chickens being culled to prevent the spread of the virus resulting in a nationwide shortage of eggs and spiking prices.', 'And bird flu has been found in several other species, including cows, domestic and wild cats, raccoons, foxes, and bears, experts say.  ', '“Almost 15 years ago, we were all very nervous about bird flu. But it never mutated and kind of died out,” said Benjamin. ', '“But now it’s come back, and the concerning part is that it’s infecting so many other species,” he said. “And when this flu goes from birds into other species, like pigs … it becomes more infectious to people.” ', '“We don’t live in little silos,” said Dr. Scott Curry, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina with the Division of Infectious Diseases. “Viruses mix and match in all different species.”  ', '“The risk of a mutation … is where our concern comes in for humans,” adds Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist with the SC Department of Public Health. ', '“At this time there is no evidence it’s being transmitted from person to person,” she said. “But if people who are infected with seasonal flu are also infected with bird flu, there can occur a genetic mutation that can result in a new virus that is transmitted from person to person.”', 'Particularly concerning is the case of a 13-year-old Canadian girl with asthma who became seriously ill with bird flu requiring intubation for several weeks and dialysis, said Dr. Helmut Albrecht, Medical Director of the Center of Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at Prisma Health and the University of South Carolina, noting that human deaths from bird flu have occurred in other countries for years.', 'While the girl survived, the source of her exposure hasn’t been found, he said, adding that the strain she had is mostly seen in wild birds in that area.', '“It also had adaptations to being better prepared for mammals and humans,” he said.', '“The strain they found in this individual … has been shown to be more capable of infecting people,” said Benjamin. “The good news is that it didn’t. So far.”', 'In South Carolina, there have been no reported cases of bird flu in people, Bell said, adding that DPH is following CDC guidelines for enhanced surveillance including testing patients hospitalized with flu to see what kind they have and taking appropriate measures to make sure it doesn’t spread.', 'CDC says the current risk to public health is low and adds it is keeping a careful eye on the situation “working with states to monitor people with animal exposures.”', 'Just 67 cases have been reported in people as of Jan. 27, according to the CDC. ', 'But with most cases being mild, and many workers in these industries being undocumented, it’s a good bet that’s an undercount, experts said.', '“I can assure you we have more cases than we know about,” said Benjamin. “Most cases are mild and ... are not reported. Even in areas where there have been outbreaks in dairy cows, we knew we were missing cases in people.” ', '“‘It appears that avian influenza is just as often as not a mild illness,” said Curry. “It’s easy to imagine it is in thousands … of farm workers. And the more of those (human infections) we have, the more we’re rolling the dice.”', 'Albrecht said the cases reported so far are “probably the tip of the iceberg.”  ', '“We found these cases not because they presented as severe, but because the system included agriculture,” he said, “… that’s where we have the surveillance.” ', 'But how accurate that system is, is anyone’s guess, he said, “because we don’t know how many patients with mild disease don’t show up.”', 'For example, Albrecht said, undocumented farm workers may not come forward fearing deportation.', '“Are you going to risk that with pink eye and sniffles?” he said. “Obviously that’s a concern that one could have.”', 'Nonetheless, he said, farm owners should make their employees aware they are at risk.  ', 'Bird flu was found in South Carolina in 2021 in samples from wild birds – including waterfowl like geese, ducks, and shore birds as well as birds of prey like vultures and hawks that feed on dead birds, said Dr. Michael Neault, state veterinarian headquartered at Clemson University. Since then, it’s been found throughout the U.S. in wild birds and has flared up now and then, he said. ', '“We’re in one of those situations now where cases are flaring up across the country,” he said. “Since 2022, there are well over 108 million birds – commercial and backyard – that had to be culled out.”', 'While commercial flocks have been culled in Georgia and North Carolina, that hasn’t happened in South Carolina yet, said Julie Helm, director of the state Poultry Health Program.', '“But it is a matter of when,” she said. “We knew this was going to be a high-risk season based on the number of birds flying down last fall from Canada and it infecting so many other species. A couple states not impacted before are now having huge flocks being culled.”', 'There are more than 4,300 poultry farms in the state, some 750 of them large commercial operations with up to 4 million birds, Helm said.', 'On the other hand, backyard flocks in the state have been affected. ', 'A mixed flock of pheasants, quail, and ducks in Spartanburg County tested positive around Christmas and had to be euthanized, Neault said.  ', '“The birds are dying anyway, they get so sick,” said Helm, “So we do have to depopulate affected flocks so it doesn’t spread to other farms.”', 'Backyard flock owners should follow steps to prevent infection of their birds, such as ensuring poultry is separated from wild birds, she said. Some also have clothing and shoes only worn around farm birds to prevent accidental contamination, she said. ', '“Viruses mutate all the time, even among birds. And we’re always concerned about what can happen,” Neault said. “The USDA and CDC and state public health and us are all watching this very closely.”', 'While there are no state laws regarding backyard flocks, the commercial poultry industry has its own standards around feeding, testing and more, Neault said. ', 'And there’s a national disease surveillance program required for commercial farms to reduce the spread of disease, Helm said, adding that veterinarians are required to notify authorities within 48 hours of a positive test.', 'Clemson Extension also shares information and biosecurity alerts to producers and backyard flock owners, Neault said.', 'While vaccination of flocks has been discussed for years, it’s impractical and hard to do, they said.   ', 'Neault and Helm say that birdfeeders aren’t a risk because the virus is not typically found the birds that visit most yards. ', 'But they say that anyone who finds a dead bird should wear gloves and a mask, use a shovel to pick it up, and bury it in the woods or double-bag it and put it in the trash.', 'And experts advise people not to eat or drink unpasteurized products, or feed their pets raw food or milk either, because the virus can spread to pets that way.', 'Meanwhile, the DPH is also getting information to health care providers, farmers and others as part of its public health measures, Bell said, noting there is guidance for poultry and dairy workers to protect them against exposure, including wearing masks.', 'The state is always monitoring for the emergence of novel infectious diseases, Bell said, adding that early mitigation and containment measures are important to control them when the numbers are small.', '“Because once we get efficient transmission from person to person, as we’ve all seen, it becomes so much more difficult to control,” she said. “If we were to have the emergence of a novel virus, we might be looking at something similar to Covid, which would be the worst-case scenario.” ', 'The foundation of state preparedness is surveillance to identify cases and taking appropriate control measures, Bell said. ', 'So, patients hospitalized with flu are tested quickly to see if it’s the seasonal variety, Albrecht said, and if it’s not, further testing is done to see whether it’s bird flu.', 'Rapid home tests for bird flu are not yet available, he said, but he expects they will be at some point.', 'Meanwhile, people should avoid contact with animals and stay home if they get sick to avoid exposing others, Bell said, adding that people should also get vaccinated against the flu and use proper hand hygiene.', 'Curry adds that the nation is at a record low for seasonal flu and Covid vaccinations.', 'While science overall is better prepared than it was for Covid, Albrecht said, public health is still under-resourced.', '“We’ve never had an adequate public health response because we don’t have an adequate public health system,” Albrecht said. “A preventive public health approach would be better. It requires more resources.”', 'So far, at least, seasonal flu, which kills dozens of people every day, is more of a threat than bird flu, he said.', 'And bird flu typically responds to available antiviral drugs, he said, while there’s a stockpile of vaccine that can get the country over the first hump as additional vaccine is made quickly with the mRNA technology used for Covid.', ' ', '2025 | Powered by Locable | Terms of Service']"
