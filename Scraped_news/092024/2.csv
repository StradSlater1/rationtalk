Former Teamsters leader criticizes non-endorsement of Harris for president,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/20/teamsters-jim-hoffa-harris-endorse/,"['James P. Hoffa, who led the Teamsters for 23 years, said it was a mistake for the union not to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, the “correct choice for labor.”', 'James P. Hoffa, the longtime former leader of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on Thursday called the union’s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 race a “critical error,” adding that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was the “correct choice for labor and working families.”', 'In a statement, Hoffa — who served as the Teamsters’ general president for 23 years before retiring in 2022, and is the son of mid-century labor legend Jimmy Hoffa — said this election was “too important for our union to not do its duty.”', '“There is only one candidate in this race that has supported working families and unions throughout their career,” he added, “and that is Vice President Kamala Harris.”', 'The union announced Wednesday that it would not endorse either presidential candidate. “Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,” current Teamsters head Sean O’Brien said in a statement.', 'Hoffa also characterized the non-endorsement as “a failure of leadership” by O’Brien, his successor. The two have had a fractious relationship since before the 2024 election campaign, The Washington Post has reported.', 'Follow Politics', 'In response to Hoffa’s criticism, a Teamsters spokesperson said that the union needs “true bipartisan support for working people” and that Hoffa was “turning a deaf ear” to its membership. Kara Deniz said in a statement that the Teamsters “will continue to support and respect all our members — Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.”', 'O’Brien addressed the Republican National Convention in July, a striking departure for the powerful union that has long supported Democrats. He did not publicly endorse Donald Trump, but his presence alone — among GOP lawmakers and a former president who have pushed anti-worker policies — sent shock waves through labor and Democratic circles.', 'O’Brien had requested to speak at the Democratic convention but did not receive an invitation, according to the union, though several other major labor leaders — and a retired Teamster member who leads a committee that advocated for a 2021 bailout of failing pension plans — did address the convention.', 'During Hoffa’s tenure, from 1999 to 2022, the union supported the Democratic candidate in every presidential election. In 1996, it did not endorse a candidate, and in decades past has supported Republican candidates including Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.', 'The Teamsters have nearly 1.3 million members, according to union numbers. Of its board members, 14 voted to endorse neither candidate this year, while three voted to endorse Harris and none voted for Trump.', '“Every major union has endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket,” Hoffa said in his statement. “But instead of standing in solidarity with all of labor and helping Harris-Walz get over the finish line, the IBT has chosen to take a seat on the sidelines.”', '']"

Although the union, the largest in the U.S., did not explicitly back the Republican candidate, the former president viewed the lack of any endorsement as a victory.', '""It\'s a great honor,"" he said. ""They\'re not going to endorse the Democrats. That\'s a big deal.""', 'Polls conducted by the union found that roughly 60 percent of members favored Trump, while about 34 percent backed Vice President Kamala Harris. This marks a significant shift for a union that has historically supported Democratic candidates, including backing Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.', ""The Teamsters' decision reflected a labor union divided over political identity and policy, despite its members having directly benefited from the Biden administration. It was Biden who, soon after taking office, signed into law a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that included $86 billion for multiemployer pension plans. Tens of billions of those dollars went to a pension fund owned by about 350,000 members of the Teamsters union."", 'While in office, Biden also became the first sitting president to walk a picket line when he joined striking UAW autoworkers in Michigan a year ago in a show of support. He nominated labor-friendly lawyers to the National Labor Relations Board and appointed Harris to run a task force promoting union organizing and collective bargaining.', 'Trump, meanwhile, applauded the practice of firing employees who were threatening to strike in a recent interview with Elon Musk, which is a violation of federal labor law (the UAW has since filed a grievance over those remarks).', 'Following the expected Democratic backlash to the Teamsters\' nonendorsement, O\'Brien told CNN on Thursday that while he acknowledged President Biden as ""the most pro-union president"" and was ""truly appreciative"" of his efforts, the union\'s decision was meant to serve as ""a wake-up call"" for this campaign, specifically directed at the Democrats.', '""I am a Democrat. But we need to hold them accountable. This is an opportunity as well for both parties to take a hard look, and for the Democrats to refocus and say something\'s wrong. We\'ve got to recapture American workers,"" he said.', ""The timing of the Teamsters' decision comes during what should have been an economic high point for the administration, and by extension, Harris' campaign. The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates, economic growth remains strong, unemployment is still low, and inflation has eased considerably since its high."", 'Yet the question remains whether these gains will be felt by union workers by November, as Professor Todd Belt from George Washington University explained to Newsweek.', '""Prices are still high, and many union members with contract work are seeing wages that haven\'t kept up with the consumer price index. As a result, people are still feeling economic pain.""', 'For Belt, the challenge facing Harris is her difficulty in distancing herself from ""Bidenomics,"" a factor that could explain the growing disconnect between the leadership and rank-and-file members of unions like the Teamsters. Unlike Biden, Harris doesn\'t have the same deep, personal relationship with labor, which could hurt her in states like Pennsylvania.', '""While Trump couldn\'t pull the endorsement away from Biden in 2020 because of his long-standing ties with the union, Harris faces a bigger challenge. She doesn\'t have that history and will need to work harder to win over this group,"" Belt said.', ""Marick Masters, business professor emeritus at Wayne State University in Detroit who follows labor issues, said the Teamsters' lack of endorsement suggests a realignment within the union's membership."", ""For many of those workers, issues such as gun control, abortion and border security override Trump's expressions of hostility toward organized labor, Masters said."", ""Union members are usually viewed as a core Democratic voting bloc, but Trump has been working this election cycle to win over rank-and-file members. Belt said Trump's messaging on immigration and trade is resonating with many working-class voters, pulling white working-class union members away from Democrats by casting them as elites out of touch with workers' needs."", ""Still, for some experts, the decision is nakedly political. With O'Brien facing a backlash from some Teamsters members after speaking at the RNC—and with other labor leaders actively supporting Trump—it's no surprise that the Teamsters decided not to make an endorsement, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University."", '""If the leaders of the Teamsters decided to go against what their members wanted, they would lose their positions. Every leader depends on the legitimacy of the people they lead,"" echoed Belt.', 'The Teamsters staying neutral in November could play a pivotal role in several swing states with significant union membership, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, where union votes could tip the balance. The lack of an endorsement leaves the door open for both candidates to continue courting rank-and-file members as November approaches.', ""While the union as a whole decided to withhold an endorsement, local chapters in some battleground states like Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin have already pledged their support for Harris. Meanwhile, factions like the Teamsters National Black Caucus broke with O'Brien earlier in the year, also voicing their support for the vice president."", 'Other unions have shown trepidation about endorsing either presidential candidate. The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) on Friday ultimately endorsed Harris—but with a caveat sure to have raised eyebrows among Democratic leadership.', '""The manner in which party leaders engineered Biden\'s replacement at the top of the ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris was thoroughly undemocratic,"" the UE leadership said in a statement.', '', '', ""Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair."", 'Hold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.', '', '', 'Jesus is a Newsweek Live News Reporter based in New York.

O’Brien said in a statement. “We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges.”', 'The Teamsters’ rebuff reflected a labor union torn over issues of political identity and policy, one that mirrors a broader national divide. Vice President Harris has unmistakably backed organized labor, while former President Trump has appealed to many white blue-collar workers even as he has openly scorned unions at times. By not endorsing anyone, the Teamsters are essentially ceding some of their influence in November’s election as both candidates claimed to have support from its members.', 'Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt noted in an emailed statement that more than three dozen retired Teamsters members spoke last month in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention, having endorsed Harris. Their pensions were saved through the 2021 passage of the Butch Lewis Act that President Biden and Harris championed.', '“While Donald Trump says striking workers should be fired, Vice President Harris has literally walked the picket line and stood strong with organized labor for her entire career,” Hitt said. “The Vice President’s strong union record is why Teamsters locals across the country have already endorsed her — alongside the overwhelming majority of organized labor.”', 'The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of its members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris, a fact that the Republican’s campaign immediately seized upon by sending out an email that said the “rank-and-file of the Teamsters Union supports Donald Trump for President.”', 'Harris met Monday with a panel of Teamsters, having long courted organized labor and made support for the middle class her central policy goal. Trump also met with a panel of Teamsters and even invited O’Brien to speak at the Republican National Convention, where the union leader railed against corporate greed.', 'The Teamsters’ choice to not endorse came just weeks ahead of the Nov. 5 election, far later than endorsements by other large unions such as the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the United Auto Workers that have chosen to devote resources to getting out the vote for Harris.', 'With O’Brien facing a backlash from some Teamsters members after speaking at the Republican convention, it’s no surprise that the union decided not to make an endorsement, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University.', 'Trump’s praise of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk in saying that Musk would fire workers if they went on strike really made a Trump endorsement very unlikely, Wheaton said. “The members were not in total agreement,” he said.', 'Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University in Detroit who follows labor issues, said the Teamsters’ lack of an endorsement suggests a realignment within the union’s membership.', 'For many workers, issues such as gun control, abortion and border security override Trump’s expressions of hostility to unions, Masters said.', 'The Teamsters detailed its objections to the candidates in a statement, starting with its objection to a contract implemented by Congress in 2022 that applies to members working in the railroad sector.', 'The union wanted both candidates to commit to not deploying the Railway Labor Act to resolve contract disputes and avoid a shutdown of national infrastructure, but Harris and Trump both wanted to keep that option open. The Teamsters said it would reduce its bargaining power.', 'Harris has pledged to sign the PRO Act, which would strengthen union protections and is something the Teamsters support. She also criticized states that enact laws making it more difficult to unionize. Trump, in his January roundtable with the Teamsters, did not promise to veto a proposal to make it harder nationwide to unionize.', 'Other unions have shown trepidation about offering an endorsement for one of the two presidential candidates. The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America on Friday ultimately endorsed Harris with a caveat that “the manner in which party leaders engineered Biden’s replacement at the top of the ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris was thoroughly undemocratic,” union leadership said in a statement.', 'But the Teamsters’ lack of endorsement also suggests an indifference to the Biden-Harris administration, which signed into law a measure that saved the pensions of millions of union retirees, including many in the Teamsters.', 'As part of its 2021 pandemic aid, the administration included the Butch Lewis Act to save the underfunded pensions of more than 1 million union workers and retirees’ underfunded pensions.

Does it matter?', 'by Ellen Ioanes', 'The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the US’s largest and best-known labor unions, has declined to endorse a candidate for president, citing major political divides among its membership, as well as dissatisfaction with each major candidate’s stances on key union priorities.', 'In a tight presidential race where the vast majority of labor unions have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Teamsters’ decision not to do so could be seen as a high-profile rebuke, especially since Harris is part of a Democratic administration that has, for the most part, been highly supportive of labor union rights. Whether the decision actively hurts her, however, remains to be seen.', 'The Teamsters represent more than a million workers from many industries, including UPS drivers and workers in construction, healthcare, and sanitation. Their members are located throughout the United States. But Teamsters have a particularly strong base in the Midwest and in swing states that could be decisive in November.', 'Ahead of the decision, the Teamsters polled members on their presidential preferences. In a September telephone poll, 58 percent of Teamsters members supported Republican candidate Donald Trump, and 31 percent said they’d like the union to endorse Harris. In straw polls conducted at town halls prior to President Joe Biden’s decision to exit the race in July, 44 percent of members supported Biden, versus 36 percent for Trump.', 'While the poll results suggest a general preference for Trump, a number of Teamsters local unions and subgroups have vocally come out in support for Harris. The Teamsters National Black Caucus endorsed Harris in August, not waiting for the national organization’s decision. In the wake of Wednesday’s announcement, local unions in battlegrounds like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania — among others — also endorsed Harris.', 'Now both camps are claiming to have the Teamsters behind them, Trump because of the poll results, and Harris because of the local endorsements.', 'The lack of endorsement may not ultimately matter much when it comes to how Teamsters will vote. The polls and local endorsements so far have made it clear that most Teamsters have a set preference this election cycle, and it’s not clear that an endorsement from the national union would have done much to change that.', 'Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, told Vox that where union endorsement really matters is on the ground, campaigning.', '“Union endorsements are valuable because they usually come with access to resources, particularly volunteers to knock on doors and work phone banks,” Squire said. “Leadership may be able to persuade some members to vote the way they would like, but the real value is in campaign assistance.”', 'Besides the setback of having fewer volunteers, there’s also some possibility that the non-endorsement could sway non-union voters sympathetic to labor issues.', '“There’s the broad symbolism” of the lack of endorsement, Vanderbilt University professor of sociology and political economy Larry Isaac told Vox.', 'Teamsters national president Sean O’Brien said, “We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members’ right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges.” That statement, along with the larger choice not to issue an endorsement, makes an explicit argument that neither candidate would look out for organized labor.', 'Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, there were indications that the union might not endorse at all, in a break with other major unions — which wasn’t a total shock given that the Teamsters have often been out of step politically with the rest of the US labor union movement, Isaac said. The United Auto Workers, the American Federation of Teachers, the AFL-CIO, and many smaller unions across industries and across the country have endorsed Harris.', 'Still, the Teamsters’ announcement may be enough to influence some voters. Americans support unions at higher levels than they have in decades — and some data suggests voters were more likely to support candidates they perceived as being pro-union in the 2022 elections.', 'Through her connection to Biden, Harris does have a good record on labor; Biden stood at the picket line with UAW workers when they were striking last summer, and has generally supported the right to strike and sought to undermine corporate power. But the administration also forced Teamsters members back to work under what union leadership said was a less-than-ideal contract ahead of a railroad strike in 2022.', 'But Harris’s own policies and values distinct from Biden’s aren’t all that well known, though she has supported the Protect the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would strengthen protections around workers’ right to organize and bargain collectively. But Teamsters leadership was reportedly unimpressed with what they heard during a meeting with Harris earlier this week.', 'Trump, on the other hand, appointed labor antagonists to the National Labor Review Board and approved legislation that restricted workers’ right to organize and strengthened workplaces’ ability to break up a union during his presidency. Rather than focusing on pro-labor policy, Trump has spent the 2024 campaign courting the working class with his populist message. Still, Trump too, apparently did not impress Teamsters in his roundtable meeting with members.', '', 'YOU’VE READ 1 ARTICLE IN THE LAST MONTH', 'Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.
