‘He deserves to live’: South Carolina to execute first man in 13 years despite doubts raised by evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/freddie-owens-south-carolina-execution,"['Khalil Allah is set to be killed by lethal injection despite a key witness saying last month he made false remarks at trial', 'South Carolina is on track to execute a man on death row for the first time in 13 years, despite new evidence raising doubts about critical testimony used to secure his conviction.', 'Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah, 46, is scheduled to be killed by lethal injection on Friday, one of six executions that could move forward in the coming months in South Carolina, marking a brutal resurgence of capital punishment since the state’s last execution in 2011.', 'Allah, previously known as Freddie Owens, was convicted of armed robbery and the murder of a store cashier named Irene Graves in 1997, when he was 19 years old. He has long argued that he did not shoot her, and the state’s key witness alleged in an affidavit last month that he made false remarks at the instruction of prosecutors during the trial.', '“[Allah] has maintained his innocence throughout, and the evidence shows that his sentence is based on trial court errors and the prosecution withholding evidence,” Gerald “Bo” King, Allah’s public defender, said in an interview. He has filed multiple unsuccessful motions in recent weeks to save his client’s life. “It is extraordinary and tragic that his execution is moving forward.”', 'Allah, who recently grappled with choosing his execution method, would be one of the youngest people at the time of the crime to be executed by South Carolina in decades. Like many sentenced to death in the US, Allah endured a lifetime of trauma before his conviction.', 'Allah faced physical and psychological abuse from his caretakers at a young age, growing up in a family that struggled with substance abuse, where he was forced as a child to support his parents’ drug dealing, according to a neuropsychologist who interviewed and evaluated him.', 'His father, stepfather and grandmother all experienced periods of incarceration. He grew up witnessing domestic violence against his mother, had severe learning disabilities, regularly missed school, and was imprisoned in juvenile facilities where he was exposed to physical and sexual abuse, according to his attorneys. Experts have diagnosed him with “organic brain damage”, exacerbated by his tumultuous childhood, saying his brain was “analogous to a car with weak brakes”, with diminished decision-making and cognitive functioning.', '“He grew up with a degree of poverty and violence that many of us can’t begin to imagine,” King said.', 'On 1 November 1997, prosecutors say Allah and three other men robbed a convenience store and in the process killed Graves, an employee and mother of three. She was shot in the head. Footage showed two masked, unidentifiable assailants holding guns at the store.', 'Allah and his friend and co-defendant, Steven Golden, were due to face a joint murder trial, but as the trial was beginning, Golden pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and criminal conspiracy – and agreed to testify against Allah.', 'There was no forensic evidence tying Allah to the shooting, his lawyers said in a recent filing, so Golden’s direct witness account was crucial. Golden testified that Allah killed Graves.', 'Golden’s official plea agreement said he was not guaranteed a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying, and that he was still facing the death penalty. But Golden, who remains incarcerated, signed an affidavit last month stating “this wasn’t true”.', '“We had a verbal agreement that I would not get the death penalty or life without parole,” he said, arguing that this was “the only reason I agreed to the deal”. He said the prosecutor had instructed him to falsely testify to jurors that there was no agreement about his sentence. He was ultimately sentenced to 30 years while Allah, convicted in February 1999, was sentenced to death.', 'One document from 1999 supports Golden’s new affidavit: Golden’s lawyer at the time drafted a plea agreement laying out that his client would be spared the death penalty. But that record was not introduced as evidence in the trial; Allah’s lawyers have accused prosecutors of failing to disclose this “secret deal”.', '“His conviction and sentence were premised on a witness whose testimony was obtained through an agreement that wasn’t disclosed, and that should give everyone pause,” said King.', 'On Wednesday, after publication of this article, Allah’s attorneys released a new affidavit from Golden that went even further, stating that Allah “is not the person who shot Irene Graves” and “was not present” during the robbery. Golden said he concealed the identity of the “real shooter” out of fear that “his associates might kill me”, and that he was coming forward now because he wanted “a clear conscience”.', '“I don’t want [Allah] to be executed for something he didn’t do,” he wrote in the new affidavit. Allah’s lawyers filed an emergency motion to stop the execution, citing Golden’s new declaration.', 'In previous filings, Allah’s attorneys have also noted that his guilty verdict was atypical. He was convicted of murder without a jury explicitly ruling that he pulled the trigger. At trial, prosecutors instructed jurors that they could convict Allah simply if they believed he was present during the deadly robbery.', 'Allah’s lawyers have pointed to the state’s closing arguments, in which a prosecutor said it was “not important” who the shooter was: “If you find that both of these individuals are present and you find that Ms Graves was killed by one of them, even though you don’t find which one at this point … they are both guilty,” the prosecutor told the jury. “The one issue you are here to decide is was [Allah] present … when Ms Graves was killed.”', 'Since the death penalty was reinstated in the US in 1976, only 22 people have been executed for murders they did not directly commit, where they were considered accomplices or were present during the incident, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit that analyzes capital punishment.', '“The supreme court has said the death penalty should be reserved for the worst people who commit the very worst crimes,” said Robin Maher, the group’s executive director. “Most Americans would agree that someone who does not intend to kill anyone, and does not kill anyone, does not meet that criteria.”', 'Allah’s team has argued that a death sentence should not be applied to a defendant who “did not kill or intend to kill”.', 'The courts twice reversed Allah’s death sentence, but it was reinstated and South Carolina’s supreme court unanimously denied two requests from lawyers to stop the execution last week, saying Allah had not demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” warranting the intervention and rejecting his legal arguments.', 'The justices argued Golden’s affidavit did not prove there was a secret deal, but rather reflected Golden’s conversations with his own lawyer at the time. The attorney general’s office has denied that there was a secret deal. The justices also argued evidence showed Allah was the shooter, including testimony from others who alleged he admitted it. Even if he wasn’t the shooter, he was still a “major participant in the murder” and that execution was justified, the justices said. Prosecutors have also said Allah confessed to killing a man in jail in 1999, which was raised during his original sentencing, but those charges were dropped.', 'South Carolina is pursuing a spate of executions at a time when use of the death penalty, and its support among Americans, is declining. Since 2023, seven states have conducted executions: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. Twenty-nine states have abolished capital punishment or instituted a moratorium on executions, while half of Americans say they believe the death penalty is unfairly applied.', '“We’re not seeing among the general public any clamor for an increased use of the death penalty,” said Maher. “This is coming from a handful of elected officials in a handful of states that are rushing towards executions.”', 'South Carolina had an unofficial pause on executions for more than a decade because its supply of lethal injection drugs dried up and pharmaceutical corporations refused to publicly supply more, fearing public pressure. But last year the state passed a law to shield the identity of suppliers and has since restocked the drugs.', 'The state now instructs death row prisoners with execution dates to choose the method they will be killed: lethal injection, electrocution or a firing squad.', 'Allah, however, objected to signing a form authorizing one of those options, a step he said amounted to participating in suicide, a violation of his Muslim faith. One of his lawyers, granted power of attorney, chose lethal injection on his behalf.', 'If his lawyer hadn’t chosen, Allah would have been subject by default to the electric chair, which he strongly opposed, said King: “He had deep religious objections … The depth of his conviction is evident in the fact that he absolutely did not want to be electrocuted and still felt he could not participate in the election of another method.”', 'In his final days, Allah has been weighing what his final meal will be and which incarcerated neighbors will get his property, King said. Prison officials also interrupted a legal visit to inspect his veins and select an injection site.', 'The state supreme court recently announced the next five executions to be scheduled, saying they would be spaced at least 35 days apart. Civil rights organizers and faith leaders have called on Henry McMaster, South Carolina’s Republican governor, to grant Allah clemency, his final recourse. The governor’s office did not respond to inquiries, and the attorney general’s office declined to comment.', 'The Rev Hillary Taylor, executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, noted the state’s dark history of killing young Black defendants; before 1972, when the supreme court temporarily overturned the death penalty, 44 teenagers were executed, and all but two were Black. “We can disrupt that racist legacy,” she said.', '“Governor McMaster has touted South Carolina as an extremely pro-life state. We’re asking him to be consistent with his pro-life ethics and to value all life,” she continued. “Khalil deserves to live.”']"

"‘He didn’t do it’: days before execution in South Carolina, key witness says he lied",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/south-carolina-execution-freddie-owens,"['Lawyers scramble to halt death of Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah, AKA Freddie Owens, after claim from co-defendant', 'Two days before South Carolina is scheduled to execute a man on death row, the key witness for the prosecution has come forward to say that he lied at trial and the state was putting to death an innocent man.', 'Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah, 46, is due to be killed by lethal injection on Friday. His attorneys filed emergency motions to halt the execution, citing new testimony asserting that Allah was wrongfully convicted, but the state supreme court denied the requests late Thursday, saying the execution should proceed.', 'Allah, who was previously known as Freddie Owens, was convicted of an armed robbery in November 1997 and the murder of a convenience store cashier named Irene Graves. He was 19 years old at the time. Allah has long asserted his innocence in the killing of Graves, a 41-year-old mother of three, who was shot in the head during the robbery.', 'There was no forensic evidence tying Allah to the shooting. The state’s central evidence against Allah was testimony from his friend and co-defendant, Steven Golden, who was also charged in the robbery and murder. Golden and Allah were due to face a joint murder trial, but as the case was starting in 1999, Golden pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and criminal conspiracy and agreed to testify against Allah.', 'Surveillance footage at the store showed two masked men with guns, but they were not identifiable in the footage. Golden, who was 18 years old at the time of the robbery, said at the trial that he and Allah had been the men in the footage, and that it was Allah who shot Graves.', 'But on Wednesday, two days before the scheduled execution, Golden came forward with an explosive affidavit, stating that Allah “is not the person who shot Irene Graves” and “was not present” during the robbery. Golden said he concealed the identity of the “real shooter” out of fear that “his associates might kill me”, and that he was coming forward now because he wanted “a clear conscience”.', '“I don’t want [Allah] to be executed for something he didn’t do,” he wrote in the new affidavit.', 'Golden said he was high when police questioned him days after the robbery, and the detectives claimed they knew Allah had been with him: “They told me I might as well make a statement against [Allah], because he already told his side to everyone and they were just trying to get my side of the story. I was scared that I would get the death penalty if I didn’t make a statement.”', 'He alleged prosecutors later promised him that he would not face the death penalty or life in prison if he testified against Allah, and he agreed.', 'In a response filed on Thursday, the attorney general’s office suggested that Golden was not credible, saying he “has now made a sworn statement that is contrary to his multiple other sworn statements over twenty years”. Lawyers for the state also noted that people in Allah’s life at the time testified that Allah had confessed to them that he was the shooter. Allah’s attorneys rejected the allegations that he had previously confessed, suggesting that testimony was unreliable.', 'The state supreme court sided with the attorney general, ruling the new evidence did not amount to “exceptional circumstances” warranting a reprieve.', 'The justices said Golden’s new statement was “squarely inconsistent” with his repeated past testimony, and that there was “no indication of the circumstances under which Golden was asked to sign his most recent affidavit”. The justices also maintained that other evidence suggested Allah’s guilt.', 'Gerald “Bo” King, one of Allah’s lawyers, criticized the court’s decision not to intervene “despite compelling evidence of his innocence that emerged only yesterday”, adding in a statement Thursday night: “South Carolina is on the verge of executing a man for a crime he did not commit. We will continue to advocate for [Allah].”', 'Allah’s execution would be the first in 13 years in South Carolina and could be the start of a rapid series of executions in the coming months in the state. The state supreme court recently announced five additional executions that it would seek to schedule after Allah is killed, saying they would be spaced apart by at least 35 days.', 'South Carolina had unofficially paused executions in 2011 as pharmaceutical companies stopped supplying lethal injection drugs, fearing public pressure. But the state restocked its supply after it passed a law last year shielding the identity of suppliers.', 'Allah’s attorneys had raised a series of objections to his execution in recent weeks, before Golden’s new statement. They noted Allah had been convicted of murder without a jury explicitly ruling that he pulled the trigger. Prosecutors told jurors at his trial that they could convict him for murder simply if they believed he was present during the robbery, and his lawyers have argued that the death penalty should not be applied to a defendant found guilty as an “accomplice”.', 'His lawyers have also noted that he endured a lifetime of severe violence and trauma and had been diagnosed with brain damage.', 'If executed, Allah would be one of the youngest people at the time of the crime to be put to death by South Carolina in decades.', 'Allah’s lawyers have also filed a clemency petition with the governor’s office to stop the execution.', 'The Rev Hillary Taylor, executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, said on Thursday it would be a “huge miscarriage of justice” if the execution proceeds: “Khalil should not have to die for somebody else’s wrongdoing. That is not accountability. That is not justice.”']"

(FOX Carolina) - South Carolina has executed Greenville County killer Freddie Owens, the first inmate to be put to death by the state in 13 years.', 'Owens, 46, died by lethal injection on Friday, September 20 - nearly three decades after the murder of convenience store clerk Irene Graves.', 'His final meal consisted of two cheeseburgers, french fries, ribeye steak, six wings, two strawberry sodas, and a slice of apple pie.', 'FOX Carolina anchor Justin Dougherty was a media witness to the execution. Dougherty said at 6:35 p.m., the warden gave permission to proceed with the execution and the curtains opened between the execution chamber and the witness room. This was delayed from the initially scheduled time of 6 p.m. while officials awaited word from the U.S. Supreme Court.', 'Minutes before the execution moved forward, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency stay of execution appeal for Owens and Governor Henry McMaster declined to grant any form of clemency.', 'Owens was in a green jumpsuit and lying horizontally with a white blanket up to his chest. An IV was going into his arm from another room.', 'Owens did not give any final statement. Dougherty said in his final moments, Owens had a soft smile and did not appear to be in pain. He held eye contact with his defense attorney and mouthed words to her that were unclear.', 'In his last moment of consciousness, he said “bye” to his attorney.', 'Between 6:37 p.m. and 6:42 p.m., Owens appeared unconscious but slowly nodded his head and exhibited shallow breathing. Owens did not move at all between 6:43 p.m. and 6:53 p.m.', 'At 6:53 p.m., a doctor did a wrist check for Owens’ pulse. She then used her stethoscope and at 6:55 p.m., Owens was confirmed dead.', 'Afterward, an official with the South Carolina Department of Corrections said, “The case of South Carolina against Freddie Owens is complete.”', 'Owens was 19 years old on Halloween night in 1997 when he committed a string of robberies. Irene Graves, 41, was a clerk at one of the convenience stores he targeted. Owens reportedly became angry with how long Graves was taking to open the safe and shot her in the head.', 'Owens was convicted of Graves’ murder in 1999. In the 24-hour holding period between his guilty verdict and sentencing, he killed cellmate Christopher Bryan Lee at the Greenville County Detention Center. Lee was detained for a traffic charge.', 'Family members of Graves and Lee were present for the execution. They stared at Owens throughout the process.', 'In addition to anchor Justin Dougherty, the other media witnesses to the execution were Jeffrey Collins of the Associated Press and David Ferrara from the Post and Courier Greenville. A spiritual advisor and a member of the Greenville County solicitor’s office were also present.', 'A last-minute innocence claim from Owens’ codefendant during the robbery where Graves was killed did not stop officials from carrying out the execution.', 'Steven Golden signed an affidavit the day before the execution saying, “Freddie Owens is not the person who shot Irene Graves.”', 'Golden said he was high on cocaine and marijuana when he was arrested on Nov. 11 and questioned by police. At the time, he signed a statement saying Owens shot Graves in the head. He also testified against Owens during his murder trial.', 'Multiple courts said Golden’s affidavit contradicted numerous previous testimonies and Owens’ own admissions.', 'A member of Owens’ legal team, Gerald “Bo” King, Chief of the Capital Habeas Unit for the Fourth Circuit in the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Western District of North Carolina released the following statement:', '“Freddie Owens did not kill Ms. Graves. His death tonight is a tragedy. Mr. Owens’s childhood was marked by suffering on a scale that is hard to comprehend. He spent his adulthood in prison for a crime that he did not commit. The legal errors, hidden deals, and false evidence that made tonight possible should shame us all.”', 'FULL COVERAGE: Execution of South Carolina killer Freddie Owens', 'Copyright 2024 WHNS.

However, the attempt to reduce conflicts has also been a constant. In the myriads of tools and mechanisms that have emerged to reduce possibilities of conflict, sports stands out. Diplomacy is practised through sports and sports events facilitate dialogue and cooperation among countries.

While sports in itself has great potentials to reduce conflict, it remains marred by a lack of gender equality and sexism. Gender inequality has always remained and continues to remain a big source of discrimination leading to various forms of social and political conflicts. Sexism in sports is a persistent issue that has affected women athletes, coaches as well as officials.', 'To begin with, there is the ever-persistent, across professions’ issue of pay disparity. Women often receive lower salaries, prizes and endorsements. As per in 2022, female athletes earn 30-50% less than their male counterparts.

There is also an absolute lack of representation in leadership positions in addition to the stereotyping and objectification of women in media and amongst fan attitudes.', 'Billie Jean King, Wilma Rudolph, Mia Hamm, Serena Williams, and Simone Biles are just a few of the many athletes who have tried to combat sexism in sports, but the struggle is far from over.

In the same year, Breanna Stewart earned $119,000 while Stephen Curry earned $40 million! If sports in itself were not plagued by sexism, the media’s irresponsible attitudes only add fuel to fire. The bias in the media against women athletes leads to a disproportionate focus on male sports, a sexualisation of women athletes, and a presentation of the very few women commentators and analysts as not being mentally competent enough, and as a mere tool for eyeball attraction.

South Carolina executes first man in 13 years despite new evidence of innocence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/south-carolina-death-row-prisoner-execution,"['Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah, 46, killed by lethal injection days after state’s key witness recanted critical testimony', 'South Carolina executed a man on death row on Friday, days after the key witness for the prosecution came forward to say he had lied at trial and the state was putting to death an innocent man.', 'Khalil Divine Black Sun Allah, 46, was killed by lethal injection, pronounced dead at 6.55pm, according to the Associated Press, which was one of several media witnesses to the execution.', 'His lawyers had filed emergency motions for a delay this week, citing new testimony suggesting he had been wrongfully convicted. But the state supreme court rejected the pleas and Henry McMaster, the Republican governor, announced just before the execution that he would not be granting clemency.', 'Allah, who was previously known as Freddie Owens, was strapped to a gurney in the death chamber when the curtain opened for media to view the proceeding, the AP reported. He appeared to mouth a goodbye to his lawyer, who smiled at him. Allah seemed to lose consciousness after roughly one minute.', 'His breathing became shallow and his face twitched for several minutes before he stopped moving. He was declared dead roughly 10 minutes later. Allah made no final statement.', 'Allah’s execution was the first in 13 years in South Carolina and could be the start of a rapid series of executions in the coming months.', 'The state gave Allah a choice of lethal injection, electrocution or firing squad, but Allah objected to signing off on a method, saying that amounted to suicide and violated his Muslim faith. His attorney chose lethal injection for him.', 'Allah was convicted of the armed robbery and murder of convenience store cashier Irene Graves in November 1997. He was 19 at the time. Graves, a 41-year-old mother of three, was shot in the head during the robbery. Allah has long asserted his innocence.', 'Prosecutors had no forensic evidence connecting Allah to the shooting. Surveillance footage at the store showed two masked men with guns, but they were not identifiable.', 'The state’s case rested on testimony from Allah’s friend and co-defendant, Steven Golden, who was also charged in the robbery and murder. As their joint trial was beginning, Golden pleaded guilty to murder, armed robbery and criminal conspiracy and agreed to testify against Allah. Golden, who was 18 at the time of the robbery, said Allah shot Graves.', 'But on Wednesday, two days before the scheduled execution, Golden signed a bombshell affidavit recanting his testimony, saying Allah “is not the person who shot Irene Graves” and “was not present” during the robbery. Golden’s declaration said he had been high when police questioned him days after the robbery, and that he had been pressured into writing a statement blaming Allah.', '“I substituted [Allah] for the person who was really with me,” he wrote, saying he concealed the identity of the “real shooter” out of fear that “his associates might kill me”. He did not identify this person.', 'Golden said he agreed to plead guilty and testify when prosecutors assured him he would not face the death penalty or a life sentence – a deal that was not disclosed to the jury.', '“I don’t want [Allah] to be executed for something he didn’t do,” he wrote in the new affidavit. “This has weighed heavily on my mind and I want to have a clear conscience.”', 'The state attorney general filed a response on Thursday suggesting Golden’s new statement was not credible and did not warrant a new trial. Lawyers for the state also argued that other evidence pointed to Allah’s guilt, alleging that Allah had confessed to the shooting to his mother and girlfriend. But Allah’s lawyers rejected the claims of the “jilted former girlfriend” and said his mother had “disavowed” a statement police had her sign suggesting her son had confessed.', 'The state supreme court sided with the attorney general, ruling the new evidence did not amount to “exceptional circumstances” warranting a reprieve and suggesting other evidence supported Allah’s guilt. The justices have also pointed to Allah’s reported confession to killing a man in jail in 1999, an issue raised during his original sentencing, but those charges were dropped.', 'The US supreme court also denied Allah’s last-ditch request for relief on Friday, but the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor indicated she supported temporarily halting the execution.', 'Dora Mason, Allah’s mother, condemned the “grave injustice that has been perpetrated against my son” and the state’s “unwillingness to consider new evidence” in a statement released through a local activist on Friday before the execution: “I urge the people of South Carolina to consider the value of human life, the fallibility of our justice system, and the irreversible nature of capital punishment. I implore you to question the morality of taking a life in the name of justice, especially when doubt exists.”', 'She offered condolences and prayers to the victim’s family, pleaded for the governor to intervene, and shared this message to her son: “I want you to know that I love you more than words can express. You have always been my guiding light, and your strength and resilience inspire me every day. I will stand by you until the very end.”', 'Allah’s lawyers have also argued that a death sentence was not appropriate for his conviction. He was found guilty of murder without a jury explicitly ruling that he pulled the trigger. Prosecutors told jurors they could convict him for murder simply if they believed he was present during the robbery. It is rare for people to be executed for murders they did not directly commit.', 'His lawyers have also noted that he endured a childhood of severe violence and was diagnosed with brain damage.', 'Allah is one of the youngest people at the time of the crime to be put to death by South Carolina in decades.', '“[Allah] did not kill Ms Graves. His death tonight is a tragedy,” Gerald “Bo” King, his attorney, said in a statement. “[His] childhood was marked by suffering on a scale that is hard to comprehend. He spent his adulthood in prison for a crime that he did not commit. The legal errors, hidden deals and false evidence that made tonight possible should shame us all.”', 'South Carolina has not conducted an execution since 2011. Faced with growing backlash, pharmaceutical companies stopped selling lethal injection drugs to the state, but last year South Carolina passed a shield law to conceal the identity of suppliers and has since purchased pentobarbital, a sedative.', 'The state supreme court last month announced five executions it plans to schedule after Allah, saying they would be spaced at least 35 days apart.', 'After Allah’s execution, the ACLU of South Carolina urged the governor to grant clemency to those on death row “before the state kills in our name again”.', 'The Rev Hillary Taylor, executive director of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, said the flaws in Allah’s case were a reminder that “the death penalty is not given to the ‘worst of the worst’, it is given to the people who are least able to represent themselves in court”', 'In a statement after the execution, Taylor said: “Khalil’s execution shows the inherent discrimination of the death penalty: our justice system does not care that the right person is executed. Any person is an adequate substitute, especially if that person is young, Black, poor, and disabled.”', 'Ensley Graves-Lee, Graves’s daughter, said in an interview on Thursday that it had taken a toll on her family to have their tragedy back in the news in recent weeks and that she was shocked to learn of new developments in the case.', '“I understand that it is probably difficult for the other side, and I’m sure they would do anything to save someone they love,” said Graves-Lee, who was 10 years old when her mother was killed. “I have to remind myself that I have had no choice in any of the matter. I was 10 when she died and 12 when the verdict came … I had no choice in the death penalty at all.” She added: “I feel like I’m preparing for a funeral … I don’t know if there’s closure after it, but I’m just trying to get past this part that was already decided for me.”', 'Graves-Lee, a speech pathologist, said she wanted her mother remembered for how hard she worked for her three children, holding down three retail jobs at the time of her death: “She dedicated her life to her children,” she said. She said her mother took extra jobs so she and her brother could pursue dancing and gymnastics, adding: “I’m sure she had dreams for herself, but she always put us first, any sport or any activity we wanted to do, she allowed us to do.”', 'She also recalled her mom taking them to the mountains and looking at houses in the neighborhood they fantasized buying. She died on 1 November, but had already done Christmas shopping for her children, and her former co-workers at a Kmart sent the gifts she had purchased.', '“I hate that my mother can’t be here. The circumstances took a lot away from the both of us. My children don’t have their grandmother. She didn’t get to see her children grow up. And it wasn’t fair to her,” Graves-Lee said. “I’m hoping that she’s at rest after tomorrow, too.”']"
