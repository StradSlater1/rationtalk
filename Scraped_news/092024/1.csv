That building had been identified as a possible hazard before the event, Rowe said, yet officials didn't take appropriate steps to correct the potential problems."", '“Line-of-sight issues were acknowledged, but not properly mitigated. Issues were encountered the day of the visit with respect to line-of-sight concerns, but they were not escalated to supervisors,” Rowe said. “While some members of the advanced team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols.”', 'Among the other problems: Some local police at the site were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, meaning officers did not know that the Secret Service were not receiving their radio transmissions.', ""Law enforcement also overly relied on cell phones, instead of Secret Service radio frequencies, to communicate vital information. As officers searched for Crooks before the shooting, details were being transmitted “via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion” instead of through the Secret Service's own network."", ""“The failure of personnel to broadcast via radio the description of the assailant, or vital information received from local law enforcement regarding a suspicious individual on the roof of the AGR complex, to all federal personnel at the Butler site inhibited the collective awareness of all Secret Service personnel,” the report said. That's an acronym for AGR International Inc., a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where the rally was held."", ""That breakdown was especially problematic for Trump's protective detail, “who were not apprised of how focused state and local law enforcement were in the minutes leading up to the attack on locating the suspicious subject.” Had they known, the report says, they could have made the decision to relocate Trump while the search for the gunman was in progress."", 'The report raises more serious questions about why no law enforcement were stationed on the roof Crooks climbed onto before opening fire.', 'A local tactical team was stationed on the second floor of a building in the complex from which Crooks fired. Multiple law enforcement entities questioned the effectiveness of the team’s position, “yet there was no follow-up discussion” about changing it, the report says. And there was no discussion with Secret Service about putting a team on the roof, even though snipers from local law enforcement agencies “were apparently not opposed to that location.”', 'The tactical team operating on the second floor of the building had no contact with Secret Service before the rally. That team was brought in by a local police department to help with the event, without Secret Service’s knowledge, the report says.', 'The Secret Service understood in advance that the rally site, selected by Trump’s staff because it better accommodated the “large number of desired attendees,"" was a security challenge because of lines of sight that could be exploited by a would-be attacker. And yet, the report said, no security measures were taken on July 13 to remove those concerns and the Secret Service lacked detailed knowledge about the local law enforcement support that would even be in place.', '', ""The report's executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned more than a week after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse."", ""The Secret Service's investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general office."", ""Rowe has said the July shooting and Sunday's episode, in which 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after Secret Service agents detected a rifle poking through shrubbery lining the West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where Trump was playing, underscore the need for a paradigm shift in how the agency protects public officials."", 'Trump, he said, is receiving the “highest levels” of protection and the Secret Service response in Florida was an example of procedures working as they should.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The Hawley Report has been shared with the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump to supplement their investigation.', 'The Hawley Report’s findings are highly damaging to the credibility of the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

On July 30, Senator Hawley questioned Acting Director Rowe in a Senate hearing.

To have someone that can be waiting for allegedly 12 hours and not be spotted by Secret Service ... it certainly raises many questions,” Mr. Peters said.', 'Former President Trump has been blaming Democrats’ rhetoric accusing him of being a threat to democracy for inspiring violence against him, though it’s as yet unclear what the motives were for the gunmen in the two suspected assassination attempts.', 'Senator Peters conceded that inflammatory rhetoric could be dangerous. But he pointed the finger back at Mr. Trump, warning that the former president’s recent accusations, with no evidence, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing neighbors’ pets and eating them had led to threats of violence in that town.', '“I’d just say, Be careful in the words that you use to express your view, because words have power. We certainly saw words have power with Donald Trump talking about eating cats and dogs. The amount of violence that was threatened in Ohio, in that small little town, that they were forced to close schools and hunker down. That shows you that the words that you use and the stories you tell can be really powerful, and people need to be very careful about that,” he said.

The report is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, according to the agency.', '""We need a shift in paradigm in how we conduct our protective operations,"" he said. ""The threat level is evolving and requires this paradigm shift.""', 'Rowe clarified this shift involves looking at the agency ""holistically.""', 'The acting Secret Service chief detailed the timeline leading up to when gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding Trump and two others and killing one attendee. Crooks began shooting just after 6:11 p.m. local time on July 13. Rowe said that one minute before, the Secret Service\'s security room called a countersniper response agent to report an individual on the roof of the building where Crooks was stationed, called the AGR building. That ""vital piece of information was not relayed over the Secret Service radio network,"" the acting director said.', 'At 6:10 p.m., local police confronted Crooks on the rooftop, and a site agent called a deputy to learn what was going on, Rowe said.

Rowe also said there were ""communications deficiencies"" with officers at the site, including an ""over reliance"" on mobile devices that led to information being siloed.', 'While there were discussions before the rally about how the AGR building and a nearby property were going to be secured, Rowe said there should have been more clear direction about what the Secret Service needed.

The assassination attempt sparked immense criticism of the Secret Service and questions about how Crooks was able to gain access to the rooftop so close to where Trump was speaking. The Secret Service director at the time of the shooting, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned in its wake, and Rowe was installed as its acting leader. A bipartisan congressional task force and the FBI are also investigating the shooting.', 'The Secret Service released a five-page summary of the report, which highlighted the ""communications deficiencies"" between the agency and state and local law enforcement assisting with secure at the rally in Butler. One instance involved a local tactical team on the second floor of the AGR building that did not have prior contact with the Secret Service before the rally. The summary also states that multiple law enforcement agencies questioned the ""efficacy"" of the sniper team\'s position in the building, but ""there was also no discussion with Secret Service advance personnel about positioning that team atop the AGR roof.""', 'The agency found that there was a ""lack of detailed knowledge"" about the state and local law enforcement who would be in and around the AGR complex, which was outside the security perimeter for the rally.', 'Addressing the communications issues, the summary states that the failure to broadcast Crooks\' description through the radio network to federal personnel at the rally ""inhibited the collective awareness of all Secret Service personnel.""', '""This failure was especially acute in terms of [Trump\'s] protective detail, who were not apprised of how focused state and local law enforcement were in the minutes leading up to the attack on locating the suspicious subject,"" it reads.

The former president wasn\'t exposed to where he was on the golf course,"" he said. ""The procedures work, the redundancies work, so that high level of protection is working.""', 'In the wake of the latest incident, the House unanimously voted to boost Secret Service protection for all major presidential and vice presidential candidates to be on par with the sitting president, a step that Rowe said the Secret Service has already implemented since July 13. Congress is also debating whether to increase funding for the Secret Service as part of legislation funding the government ahead of an Oct. 1 deadline. Rowe said the Secret Service\'s resources are being stretched thin by the heightened protection levels, and said the agency was having ""productive"" conversations with lawmakers about a funding boost.', 'As for Trump\'s Secret Service protection, Rowe said he has the ""highest levels.""', '""We are not capitalizing on a crisis,"" he said.

The son of a machinist (Andrew) and a housewife (Anna), Frank was the eldest brother to Eugene “Dean” and Andrew, both of whom preceded him in death. Frank graduated from Monongahela High school in 1946 before working at Combustion Engineering Corp. On a whim, he took the college entrance exam and was accepted to the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1953 with a degree in geology. Always the absentminded scientist, Frank was drafted to the Army in 1954 after forgetting to register his draft card. He earned the rank of specialist first class as a laboratory technician and was stationed in Metz, France. Frank described his time in the military as “the best years of my life,” having spent two years touring Germany, Italy and Spain. Following his discharge, he earned a master’s degree in geophysics at the University of Indiana and a Ph.D. from the University of Rochester. He was the first of his family to hold a college degree. In 1959, he met Joann Affinito and was welcomed into her large and loving family. Joann would become the love of his life and the mother to his two daughters, Lisa (Ismail) Orabi and Mia (John) Wicke. For 63 years of marriage, Joann was a faithful homemaker, ardent supporter and feisty sparring partner. Together they traveled thousands of miles by car, enjoyed countless mornings at McCarthy’s Restaurant and thrived off their love for their grandchildren, Abrahim (Noha) and Ismail. For 50 years, Frank was a faculty member of the Geology Department at SUNY Potsdam and for 50 years, teaching was his obsession. His presence at SUNY Potsdam was immense. He taught thousands of undergraduates, graduates, grade schoolers, retirees and prisoners in earth science, geophysics and astronomy. He gave countless planetarium shows to anyone who would listen and located groundwater for anyone who needed it. He did these things passionately and always for free. He ran and operated seismology stations across the North Country and became known locally as “the earthquake man.” Frank was a man of immeasurable passions and hobbies. He loved running the country roads of Potsdam, hiking the Adirondack Mountains and riding his bike to work. He took aerobics, karate and yoga classes. He loved college football on Saturday, the New York Times on Sunday and books every day of the week. He loved Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra and Harry Belafonte. He loved his back porch and watching birds at the feeder. He loved sunsets on Cape Cod and the local taverns of Connecticut. He loved angel hair pasta and Gallo Hearty Burgundy wine. He was insatiably curious, he was a prolific academic, a kind man, a sincere man, a friend to anyone and everyone and an unintentional comic force. Frank passed away on Sept. 15, 2024, at the age of 96. He will be missed as he was loved — deeply. Visiting hours were 4 to 7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 20, 2024, at GARNER FUNERAL SERVICE in Potsdam, N.Y.

Rowe Jr. said during a press conference Friday the agency “should have been more direct” with state and local law enforcement about what was needed to secure the area.', 'The report found local law enforcement was unaware of all active radio frequencies during the rally, leading to officers communicating with each other outside of Secret Service frequencies and attempting to relay information about Crooks to the Secret Service that was not received.', 'Trump’s security detail was not informed about ""how focused state and local law enforcement were in the minutes leading up to the attack on locating the suspicious subject,” according to the report, which noted the detail could have relocated Trump had it known about the search for Crooks.', 'The report also found a counter drone device could have been used ahead of the rally to detect a drone Crooks used near the rally site hours before the event, though Secret Service agents could not get the device operational due to technical difficulties.', ""Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

The assassination attempt left one rally attendee dead and two in critical condition who ultimately survived. Trump’s right ear was nicked by a bullet during the shooting, causing blood to run down the side of his face and Secret Service to rush to his aid before escorting him away. The assassination attempts on Trump provoked the House to push a bipartisan bill for increased Secret Service protection of Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Puskar, File)', 'WASHINGTON (AP) — Communication breakdowns with local law enforcement hampered the Secret Service’s performance during a July campaign rally where former President Donald Trump was shot and wounded, according to a document released Friday that lays out a litany of missed opportunities to stop a gunman who opened fire from an unsecured roof.', 'A five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be finalized report lays bare the cascading and wide-ranging failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania at which Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire.', 'Those include an absence of clear guidance from the Secret Service to local law enforcement, the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and “complacency” among some agents, said Ronald Rowe Jr., the agency’s acting director.', 'Though the failed response has been well-documented through congressional testimony, news media investigations and other public statements, the summary document released Friday marks the Secret Service’s most formal attempt to catalog the errors of the day and comes amid fresh scrutiny of the agency following Sunday’s arrest of a man who authorities say stalked Trump at a Florida golf course.', '“This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service. It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,” Rowe said at a news conference accompanying the release of the summary. The full document is still being finalized.', 'The report details a series of “communications deficiencies” before the shooting by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds in Trump’s direction from the roof of a building less than 150 yards from where Trump was speaking. That building had been identified as a possible hazard before the event, Rowe said, yet officials didn’t take appropriate steps to correct the potential problems.', '“Line-of-sight issues were acknowledged, but not properly mitigated. Issues were encountered the day of the visit with respect to line-of-sight concerns, but they were not escalated to supervisors,” Rowe said. “While some members of the advanced team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols.”', 'Among the other problems: Some local police at the site were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, meaning officers did not know that the Secret Service were not receiving their radio transmissions.', 'Law enforcement also overly relied on cell phones, instead of Secret Service radio frequencies, to communicate vital information. As officers searched for Crooks before the shooting, details were being transmitted “via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion” instead of through the Secret Service’s own network.', '“The failure of personnel to broadcast via radio the description of the assailant, or vital information received from local law enforcement regarding a suspicious individual on the roof of the AGR complex, to all federal personnel at the Butler site inhibited the collective awareness of all Secret Service personnel,” the report said. That’s an acronym for AGR International Inc., a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where the rally was held.', 'That breakdown was especially problematic for Trump’s protective detail, “who were not apprised of how focused state and local law enforcement were in the minutes leading up to the attack on locating the suspicious subject.” Had they known, the report says, they could have made the decision to relocate Trump while the search for the gunman was in progress.', 'The report raises more serious questions about why no law enforcement were stationed on the roof Crooks climbed onto before opening fire.', 'A local tactical team was stationed on the second floor of a building in the complex from which Crooks fired. Multiple law enforcement entities questioned the effectiveness of the team’s position, “yet there was no follow-up discussion” about changing it, the report says. And there was no discussion with Secret Service about putting a team on the roof, even though snipers from local law enforcement agencies “were apparently not opposed to that location.”', 'The tactical team operating on the second floor of the building had no contact with Secret Service before the rally. That team was brought in by a local police department to help with the event, without Secret Service’s knowledge, the report says.', 'The Secret Service understood in advance that the rally site, selected by Trump’s staff because it better accommodated the “large number of desired attendees,” was a security challenge because of lines of sight that could be exploited by a would-be attacker. And yet, the report said, no security measures were taken on July 13 to remove those concerns and the Secret Service lacked detailed knowledge about the local law enforcement support that would even be in place.', 'The report’s executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned more than a week after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse.', 'The Secret Service’s investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general office.', 'Rowe has said the July shooting and Sunday’s episode, in which 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after Secret Service agents detected a rifle poking through shrubbery lining the West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where Trump was playing, underscore the need for a paradigm shift in how the agency protects public officials.', 'Trump, he said, is receiving the “highest levels” of protection and the Secret Service response in Florida was an example of procedures working as they should.', 'PARKERSBURG – The Wood County Commission has approved an additional prosecutor who will focus specifically on ...', 'PARKERSBURG – City residents can receive up to a $200 rebate for placing security cameras on their property in an ...', '', 'Copyright © Marietta Times | https://www.mariettatimes.com | 740-373-2121']"

It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,” Rowe said at a news conference accompanying the release of the summary. The full document is still being finalized.', ""The report details a series of “communications deficiencies” before the shooting by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds in Trump's direction from the roof of a building less than 150 yards from where Trump was speaking. That building had been identified as a possible hazard before the event, Rowe said, yet officials didn't take appropriate steps to correct the potential problems."", '“Line-of-sight issues were acknowledged, but not properly mitigated. Issues were encountered the day of the visit with respect to line-of-sight concerns, but they were not escalated to supervisors,” Rowe said. “While some members of the advanced team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols.”', 'Among the other problems: Some local police at the site were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, meaning officers did not know that the Secret Service were not receiving their radio transmissions.', ""Law enforcement also overly relied on cell phones, instead of Secret Service radio frequencies, to communicate vital information. As officers searched for Crooks before the shooting, details were being transmitted “via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion” instead of through the Secret Service's own network."", ""“The failure of personnel to broadcast via radio the description of the assailant, or vital information received from local law enforcement regarding a suspicious individual on the roof of the AGR complex, to all federal personnel at the Butler site inhibited the collective awareness of all Secret Service personnel,” the report said. That's an acronym for AGR International Inc., a manufacturing plant just north of the Butler Farm Show grounds, where the rally was held."", ""That breakdown was especially problematic for Trump's protective detail, “who were not apprised of how focused state and local law enforcement were in the minutes leading up to the attack on locating the suspicious subject.” Had they known, the report says, they could have made the decision to relocate Trump while the search for the gunman was in progress."", 'The report raises more serious questions about why no law enforcement were stationed on the roof Crooks climbed onto before opening fire.', 'A local tactical team was stationed on the second floor of a building in the complex from which Crooks fired. Multiple law enforcement entities questioned the effectiveness of the team’s position, “yet there was no follow-up discussion” about changing it, the report says. And there was no discussion with Secret Service about putting a team on the roof, even though snipers from local law enforcement agencies “were apparently not opposed to that location.”', 'The tactical team operating on the second floor of the building had no contact with Secret Service before the rally. That team was brought in by a local police department to help with the event, without Secret Service’s knowledge, the report says.', 'The Secret Service understood in advance that the rally site, selected by Trump’s staff because it better accommodated the “large number of desired attendees,"" was a security challenge because of lines of sight that could be exploited by a would-be attacker. And yet, the report said, no security measures were taken on July 13 to remove those concerns and the Secret Service lacked detailed knowledge about the local law enforcement support that would even be in place.', '', ""The report's executive summary does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame nor does it indicate whether any staff members have been disciplined, though The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned more than a week after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse."", ""The Secret Service's investigation is one of numerous inquiries, including by Congress and a watchdog probe by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general office."", ""Rowe has said the July shooting and Sunday's episode, in which 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after Secret Service agents detected a rifle poking through shrubbery lining the West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course where Trump was playing, underscore the need for a paradigm shift in how the agency protects public officials."", 'Trump, he said, is receiving the “highest levels” of protection and the Secret Service response in Florida was an example of procedures working as they should.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
