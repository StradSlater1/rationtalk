OPINION: Pager attack in Lebanon was terrorism. And Americans helped pay for it.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/09/20/hezbollah-israel-pager-attack-walkie-talkies/75291091007/,"['This story was updated to add new information.', 'Lebanon has been attacked by something the world has never seen before ‒ a mass sabotage of electronic devices remotely detonated.', ""Tiny bombs inside pagers and walkie-talkies went off as the devices' users were in homes, supermarkets, buses and on the streets. At least 37 people, including two children, were killed and thousands wounded in two waves of attacks this week. Lebanon's government and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group that uses the nation as a base for its militants, both blamed Israel. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks directly, but anyone who pays attention to the Middle East understands that this operation almost certainly originated in Tel Aviv."", 'On Friday, Israel launched an airstrike that reportedly killed senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil in Beirut. Israeli officials said Hezbollah later fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel.', 'War has always involved sabotage. But the morality and legality of sabotaging pagers is highly questionable. As is its wisdom.', 'When you turn pagers into bombs, you have to know that there will be a high risk of collateral damage. The pagers belonged not just to military members of Hezbollah, but also medical staff and others.', ""In the past, when Israel targeted specific cellphone users, including killing a bomb maker working for Hamas, it seemed like a much better way to respond to terrorism − with minimal risk of collateral civilian deaths, as compared with, say, a missile strike on an apartment.This time, an entire nation, Lebanon, has been terrorized. Its medical facilities are straining to handle all the bomb victims. Some in Lebanon are comparing the feeling of insecurity to the awful aftermath of the 2020 Beirut dock explosion.Hezbollah is helping Hamas, and both groups kill Israeli civilians without mercy or regret. They kill Israeli children when they can. I have no illusions about their methods. But I don't financially and politically support Hamas or Hezbollah."", 'As an American, I financially support Israel with my tax dollars. If they are murdering Lebanese children, then to some extent, I did that.', 'OPINION:Hamas murders more hostages. Biden must do more to save them.', 'And how, exactly, is this helping Israel? Is there a chance Hezbollah goes, ""Well, we didn\'t realize how dangerous Israel was, let\'s negotiate."" The cyber attack has shaken the hornets’ nest and killed a few terrorists, that\'s all.', 'Sure, Hezbollah’s ability to communicate internally has been gravely damaged, at least momentarily. But this tactic is spurring anger at Israel across all sectors of Lebanese society, and indeed, the Arab world. Iraq is sending medical supplies to Lebanon; Egypt is expressing solidarity.', 'Will it be harder or easier for Hezbollah to get recruits? The pager and walkie-talkie explosions killed and wounded a few fighters, but there will be three or four replacements for each one who fell.', ""Hezbollah has always been a terrible challenge for Israel. It’s a non-state actor, with a military force far stronger than Lebanon's national army. A few years ago, I asked a Lebanese government minister how a fight between Hezbollah and the Lebanese military would go, and he predicted that Hezbollah would win in a week."", 'Hezbollah also is funded by Iran, and gets more sophisticated weaponry every year. Compared with Hamas, Hezbollah has always been far more potent as a military force.', 'The long-term hope for Israel in its relationship with Lebanon has to be that Hezbollah is eventually brought under control of the political authorities in Beirut, and that a coalition of Sunni, Druze, Christian and moderate Shiite leaders makes peace with Israel.', 'That is the dream, but also the only realistic way the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel ends well.', 'OPINION:My father survived the Holocaust. Why are students taking part in a new call to violence?', 'The cyber attack just pushed that day off by years. Is a massive sabotage of devices as bad as a Hamas bus bombing, which indiscriminately killed Israelis? No, but Israel should remember what happened when bus bombings left body parts all over the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The attacks devastated the Israeli left, the side that had been working for peace and even a two-state solution. They unified the nation around harder policies against Palestinians.', 'They strengthened Israel’s will to fight.', 'That’s what’s happening in Lebanon, as even Hezbollah’s fiercest opponents are now rallying to their support.', 'It also will inevitably cause more and more Americans to wonder if we should be such strong supporters of a nation that uses tactics that terrorize an entire country and inevitably leave behind dead and wounded children.', ""Jeremy Mayer is an associate professor in the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, where he also directs the master's and Ph.D. programs in political science.""]"
Does intl. law allow electronic devices to be weaponized?,https://www.dw.com/en/does-international-law-allow-electronic-devices-to-be-weaponized/a-70288140,"['Who primed the communication devices that exploded in the Lebanese strongholds of the Islamist terrorist group Hezbollah? And how should the attack be viewed in the context of international law?', 'There is still much uncertainty around the multiple explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon this week. What we know so far is that at least 37 people were killed, more than 3,000 injured and that the war between Israel and militias in Lebanon has escalated once again.', 'Pagers are radio devices used by the Islamist group Hezbollah— considered a terrorist organization by the EU, the United States and other governments — because, unlike cellphones, they cannot be geolocated. ', ""In Taiwan, the prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the company that manufactured the devices, following a report in The New York Times that the Israeli secret service planted small explosives in pagers ordered by Hezbollah."", 'So far, the Israeli government has made no comment on the explosions, nor has it claimed responsibility for the attacks. Confusing and contradictory reports continue to circulate, including some indicating that a company in Bulgaria was also involved in manufacturing the exploding pagers — a claim that has been denied by the Bulgarian authorities.', '', 'Helmut Aust, professor of international law at the Free University of Berlin, said the attacks are very difficult to assess.', '""In international law, you must first determine the nature of the conflict,"" he told DW. ""Is it an international or a non-international armed conflict? And despite the cross-border nature in this instance, it\'s not entirely clear. International armed conflict is a conflict between the armed forces of two states. [...] Hezbollah is not the armed force of Lebanon.""', ""Since October 7 last year, when the Islamist group Hamas launched major attacks from the Gaza Strip, Israel has repeatedly asserted its right to self-defense. But does Israel's right to self-defense extend to attacks against Hezbollah, an organization that is backed by Iran?"", '""In international law, the right to self-defense assumes you are defending yourself against an armed attack, and that the attack is ongoing,"" said Aust. ""Of course, Hezbollah is firing rockets into Israeli territory. But for a long time there have also been Israeli military operations in Lebanon. It\'s difficult to pinpoint when exactly the current conflict began. Many things remain unclear in the fog of war.""', 'Nonetheless, Aust stressed that international humanitarian law prohibits so-called ""indiscriminate attacks."" ""Attacks are also prohibited if they can be expected to result in civilian casualties and injuries at a level disproportionate to the anticipated military advantage,"" he explained.', ""This could indeed apply in the case of the pagers and walkie-talkies — Lebanon's Health Ministry has said children were also killed and injured in the explosions. Stefan Talmon, professor of international law at the University of Bonn, also said a key principle of international law is that military strikes must target combatants, and must do so as precisely as possible."", '""Hezbollah combatants are still legitimate military targets when they are not on the battlefield, even when they retreat to their barracks or sleeping quarters,"" Talmon told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday. ', 'Marco Sassoli, a professor of international law at the University of Geneva, holds a similar view. ""From the perspective of humanitarian international law, the key question is whether the people killed were legitimate targets,"" he told the Swiss radio station SRF. ""These would be either combatants in an armed conflict or an armed group. Those who fulfill an ongoing combat function may be attacked. And I believe Israel can argue that it is engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah.""', 'Aust also drew attention to another provision of international law: ""There are specific rules in international law that cover weapons like these,"" he said. ""They derive from Protocol II of the 1996 UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Israel is also bound by this protocol. It contains a provision prohibiting the use of booby traps that consist of apparently harmless movable objects specifically designed and built to contain explosives. The pagers and walkie-talkies could certainly fall under this definition.""', ""Aust is well aware that warnings about violations of international law are not likely to deter Israel, Hamas or Hezbollah from resorting to increasingly extreme forms of warfare. Nonetheless, he insisted that it's important to have international regulations, even if they are repeatedly and grossly violated."", '""We can\'t expect international law to perform miracles,"" he said. ""If Israel\'s actions are defined as violations of international law, it\'s not going to make the government change its behavior. But there is value simply in maintaining legal standards. Were we to abandon this altogether, we would have even fewer tools with which to establish relatively objective criteria for how countries should conduct themselves at war.""', 'As things stand, he concluded, international partners can at least refer to international law as a way of exerting pressure on warring parties, to get them to moderate their actions.', 'This article was originally written in German.', ""While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

In a statement Wednesday, the Iran-backed Hezbollah said there would be a “severe reckoning” over the blasts, blaming Israel.', 'Israel has not commented directly on the explosions, but two U.S. officials and a senior diplomat in the Middle East told NBC News that Israel was behind the attack.', 'Images circulating online show destroyed pagers in Lebanon whose features are consistent with those made by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo. The company’s founder and president, Hsu Ching-kuang, told reporters Wednesday that the pagers were made by another company licensed to use its brand.', '“There is an agent in Europe whom we have cooperated with for three years, they are the agent for all of our products,” Hsu said at the company’s offices in the northern Taiwanese city of New Taipei.', '“We are not a big company, but we are a responsible company that cares about our products,” he said.', 'In a statement, Gold Apollo identified the other company as the Hungary-based BAC Consulting. The company is authorized to use Gold Apollo’s logo for product sales in certain regions, “but the design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,” the statement said.', 'Reached by phone Wednesday, BAC Consulting Chief Executive Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono confirmed that her company worked with Gold Apollo.

Did another manufacturer produce them and simply label them with the Apollo brand? This part is still under investigation by the authorities,” a ministry spokesperson told NBC News.', 'The explosions Tuesday come amid rising concern that tensions between Israel and Lebanon could spiral into all-out war.

The U.S. and other Western governments are still gathering information about the attack and how it was carried out, two U.S. officials and a Western official said.', 'It was unclear why Israel carried out the attack when it did and whether it was an opportunistic operation or something more strategic that would be followed by other actions, the officials said.', 'The officials did not confirm reports about how the devices might have been tampered with and designed to detonate.', 'Videos suggest that explosive devices were integrated into the pagers, said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services, a technical intelligence consulting firm.', '“The scale suggests a complex supply-chain attack, rather than a scenario in which devices were intercepted and modified in transit,” he said on X.', 'Pagers are favored by members of Hezbollah who avoid using cellphones for fear that Israel could use them to track and monitor them. Lebanese officials warned the public Tuesday to stay away from their wireless communication devices pending further notice.', 'Hezbollah said it was investigating the explosions and that there would be a “severe reckoning that the criminal enemy must face for the massacre it committed on Tuesday against our people, our families and our fighters in Lebanon.”', 'The group said earlier that “a girl and two brothers” were among those killed by the explosions, some of which appeared to have been captured on closed-circuit TV video and shared on social media.
