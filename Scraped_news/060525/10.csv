RESTRICTING THE ENTRY OF FOREIGN NATIONALS TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES FROM FOREIGN TERRORISTS AND OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY THREATS,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/restricting-the-entry-of-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety-threats/,"['BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n \nA PROCLAMATION', 'During my first Administration, I restricted the entry of foreign nationals into the United States, which successfully prevented national security threats from reaching our borders and which the Supreme Court upheld.  In Executive Order 14161 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), I stated that it is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes. ', 'I also stated that the United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or our national interests.  More importantly, the United States must identify such aliens before their admission or entry into the United States.  The United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the United States do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists or other threats to our national security.', 'I directed the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to identify countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  After completing that process, the Secretary of State determined that a number of countries remain deficient with regards to screening and vetting.  Many of these countries have also taken advantage of the United States in their exploitation of our visa system and their historic failure to accept back their removable nationals. ', 'As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.  I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks.  Nationals of some countries also pose significant risks of overstaying their visas in the United States, which increases burdens on immigration and law enforcement components of the United States, and often exacerbates other risks related to national security and public safety.', 'Some of the countries with inadequacies face significant challenges to reform efforts.  Others have made important improvements to their protocols and procedures, and I commend them for these efforts.  But until countries with identified inadequacies address them, members of my Cabinet have recommended certain conditional restrictions and limitations.  I have considered and largely accepted those recommendations and impose the limitations set forth below on the entry into the United States by the classes of foreign nationals identified in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation.', 'NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.  I therefore hereby proclaim the following:', 'Section 1.  Policy and Purpose.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks and other national security or public-safety threats.  Screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with visa adjudications and other immigration processes play a critical role in implementing that policy.  These protocols enhance our ability to detect foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism, or otherwise pose a safety threat, and they aid our efforts to prevent such individuals from entering the United States.', '(b)  Information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices of foreign governments are important for the effectiveness of the screening and vetting protocols and procedures of the United States.  Governments manage the identity and travel documents of their nationals and residents. They also control the circumstances under which they provide information about their nationals to other governments, including information about known or suspected terrorists and criminal-history information.  It is, therefore, the policy of the United States to take all necessary and appropriate steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices and to regularly share their identity and threat information with the immigration screening and vetting systems of the United States.', '(c)  Section 2(b) of Executive Order 14161 directed the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, within 60 days of the date of that order, to jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, a report identifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension on the entry or admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)).', '(d)  On April 9, 2025, the Secretary of State, with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, presented the report described in subsection (c) of this section, recommending that entry restrictions and limitations be placed on foreign nationals of several countries.  The report identified countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full suspension of admissions and countries that warrant a partial suspension of admission.', '(e)  In evaluating the recommendations from the Secretary of State and in determining what restrictions to impose for each country, I consulted with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, appropriate Assistants to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  I considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals.  And I further considered various factors, including each country’s screening and vetting capabilities, information sharing policies, and country-specific risk factors — including whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals. ', 'I also considered the different risks posed by aliens admitted on immigrant visas and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas.  Persons admitted on immigrant visas become lawful permanent residents of the United States.  Such persons may present national security or public-safety concerns that may be distinct from those admitted as nonimmigrants.  The United States affords lawful permanent residents more enduring rights than it does to nonimmigrants.  Lawful permanent residents are more difficult to remove than nonimmigrants, even after national security concerns arise, which increases the costs and aggravates the dangers of errors associated with admitting such individuals.  And although immigrants are generally subject to more extensive vetting than nonimmigrants, such vetting is far less reliable when the country from which someone seeks to emigrate maintains inadequate identity-management or information-sharing policies or otherwise poses risks to the national security of the United States.', 'I reviewed these factors and assessed these goals, with a particular focus on crafting country-specific restrictions.  This approach was designed to encourage cooperation with the subject countries in recognition of each country’s unique circumstances.  The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are, in my judgment, necessary to prevent the entry or admission of foreign nationals about whom the United States Government lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose to the United States.  The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are necessary to garner cooperation from foreign governments, enforce our immigration laws, and advance other important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives.', '(f)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined to fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries:  Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.', '(g)  I have determined to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries:  Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants. ', '(h)  Sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation describe some of the identity-management or information-sharing inadequacies that led me to impose restrictions.  These inadequacies are sufficient to justify my finding that unrestricted entry of nationals from the named countries would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Publicly disclosing additional details on which I relied in making these determinations, however, would cause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and many such details are classified.', 'Sec. 2.  Full Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern.  The entry into the United States of nationals of the following countries is hereby suspended and limited, as follows, subject to the categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers described in section 5 of this proclamation:', '(a)  Afghanistan', '(i)   The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan.  Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According to the Fiscal Year 2023 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“Overstay Report”), Afghanistan had a business/tourist (B-1/B-2) visa overstay rate of 9.70 percent and a student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay rate of 29.30 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Afghanistan as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(b)  Burma', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Burma had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent.  Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Burma as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(c)  Chad', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent.  According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent.  The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.  ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Chad as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(d)  Republic of the Congo', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, the Republic of the Congo had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 29.63 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.14 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of the Republic of the Congo as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(e)  Equatorial Guinea', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Equatorial Guinea had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 21.98 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 70.18 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Equatorial Guinea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(f)  Eritrea', '(i)   The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea.  Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals.  Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Eritrea had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 20.09 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.43 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Eritrea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(g)  Haiti', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Haiti had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 31.38 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 25.05 percent.  Additionally, hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.  This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.  As is widely known, Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Haiti as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(h)  Iran', '(i)   Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.  Iran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Iran as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended.', '(i)  Libya', '(i)   There is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya.  The historical terrorist presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Libya as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(j)  Somalia', '(i)   Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects.  A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from Somalia’s territory.  The United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven.  Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations.  Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States.  The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement.  Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Somalia as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(k)  Sudan', '(i)   Sudan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According to the Overstay Report, Sudan had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 26.30 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 28.40 percent. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Sudan as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(l)  Yemen', '(i)   Yemen lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  The government does not have physical control over its own territory.  Since January 20, 2025, Yemen has been the site of active United States military operations.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Yemen as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', 'Sec. 3.  Partial Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern.', '(a)  Burundi', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Burundi had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 17.52 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Burundi as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Burundi to the extent permitted by law.', '(b)  Cuba', '(i)    Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.  The Government of Cuba does not cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement information with the United States.  Cuba has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Cuba had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 7.69 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 18.75 percent.', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Cuba as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Cuba to the extent permitted by law.', '(c)  Laos', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Laos had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent.  Laos has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Laos as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Laos to the extent permitted by law.', '(d)  Sierra Leone', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.83 percent.  Sierra Leone has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Sierra Leone as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Sierra Leone to the extent permitted by law.', '(e)  Togo', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Togo had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 19.03 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.05 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Togo as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Togo to the extent permitted by law.', '(f)  Turkmenistan', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Turkmenistan had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 21.74 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Turkmenistan as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Turkmenistan to the extent permitted by law.', '(g)  Venezuela', '(i)    Venezuela lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Venezuela has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Venezuela had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 9.83 percent.', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Venezuela as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B‑1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Venezuela to the extent permitted by law.', 'Sec. 4.

Others with high overstay rates were Equatorial Guinea (22 percent), Eritrea (20 percent) and Yemen (19.8 percent).', 'On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order, calling on his state department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”.

In this declaration, they said that “banning travel from the original countries did not enhance national security and might even undermine counterterrorism efforts”, Mittelstadt said.', 'That earlier ban went through several revisions.

The list of those countries with full travel bans includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, a list that could have impacted teams competing at both the Club World Cup and Gold Cup.

""These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants,"" the proclamation reads in part.', 'The new travel restrictions will begin on Monday and are not expected to impact those with visas issued beforehand or green card holders.', 'The proclamation lists several exemptions for the ban, including athletes and staff traveling to the U.S. for major sporting events. The World Cup and Olympics were name-dropped specifically, but a spokesperson for the White House said the Club World Cup and Gold Cup are amongst the events that the exemption applies to.', ""Haiti's men's national team will take part in the Gold Cup this summer, while several players at the Club World Cup hail from nations that were listed in the proclamation.

I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks,"" the proclamation read.', 'Nationals of 12 countries will be barred from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.', 'Several of the countries on the list, according to Trump’s proclamation, regularly declined to accept the return of their nationals or had visa overstay rates the administration deemed “unacceptable” and indicative of “a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.”', 'Others on the list, like Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, were included for inadequate screening and vetting measures, the proclamation noted.', 'An additional seven countries came under partial travel restrictions, in which entrance into the country under several visa programs was suspended but an outright ban was not implemented. Those countries are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The proclamation includes exemptions for any lawful permanent resident of the United States, recipients of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas, diplomatic visas, immediate family member immigrant visas and visas “for ethnic and religious minorities in Iran.” It also included exceptions for adoptions, dual nationals traveling on passports from unrestricted countries and athlete or members of athletic teams traveling to the country for the World Cup or the Olympics.', 'The travel restrictions are set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Monday.', ""The travel ban risks worsening already strained geopolitical tensions, with the United States' role on the global stage having been shaken in recent months by Trump's efforts to enact tariffs on dozens of countries nationwide, cut humanitarian aid to poorer nations and force countries to accept immigrants he's seeking to deport while punishing those that do not."", 'In a video the White House shared Wednesday night, Trump called the travel restrictions ""a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil.""', 'He began the message by pointing to recent violence in Boulder, Colorado, where a man injured at least 12 demonstrators in what city officials called an antisemitic attack, as justification for a renewed travel ban.', '“A recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” Trump said.', 'The suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is from Egypt, and he entered the country on a tourist visa before he applied for asylum. His tourist visa expired as his asylum case was pending. Egypt is not on the list of countries under the newly announced travel bans.', ""Soliman's family were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday and were being processed for removal proceedings, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A judge subsequently issued an order Wednesday to prevent the deportation of Soliman's wife and five children."", 'Trump added that his administration considered “the large-scale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers identities, inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories, and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays” in determining the countries that would be affected by the ban.', 'Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan and independent public policy research organization, noted that even though Trump cited terrorism-related concerns in announcing the new restrictions, terrorist attacks by people from the 12 countries facing outright bans are rare.', '“A single terrorist from those countries murdered one person in an attack on US soil: Emanuel Kidega Samson from Sudan, who committed an attack motivated by anti-white animus in 2017. The annual chance of being murdered by a terrorist from one of the banned countries from 1975 to the end of 2024 was about 1 in 13.9 billion per year,” Nowrasteh wrote.', 'The new travel restrictions mark the return of one of the most divisive policies of Trump\'s first term, a 2017 travel ban that he called one of his “most successful policies"" Wednesday.', 'During his first term, Trump similarly banned foreigners from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, citing terrorism concerns. Despite Democratic backlash and several legal challenges to the effort, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the policy in a split decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts making it clear that the ability to regulate immigration falls within the president’s purview.', 'The president can block non-nationals from coming into the United States, Roberts said at the time, if the determination is made that allowing them to enter “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” Meanwhile, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that based on the evidence in the case, “a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.”', 'Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are the only countries included across both of Trump’s travel bans.', 'Those restrictions remained in place until Jan. 20, 2021, when then-newly elected President Biden overturned them after he signed a proclamation titled “Ending Discriminatory Bans on Entry to The United States.”', 'Trump has for years expressed a desire to limit immigration from Haiti and African nations, deriding them as ""shithole"" countries and making clear his preference for European immigrants in discussing the visa lottery system at a White House meeting in 2018.', 'Shortly after he took office for the second time, Trump limited refugee admissions from almost all countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar. In May, however, he granted refugee status to 59 South Africans from the white ethnic group that ruled South Africa during apartheid.', 'The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration Friday to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration, making them subject to deportation. Those parolees came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.', 'The Trump administration canceled an extension of Haiti’s Temporary Protected Status in February after the Biden administration extended the designation into 2026 because of violence and political turmoil on the island.

The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has gone out of his way to appear publicly with Trump in recent months, taking a seat next to the president at the first public meeting of his World Cup taskforce and arriving late to the Fifa Congress in order to meet Trump during his tour of the Middle East.', 'It is also not clear whether the “World Cup” mentioned in the exemption applies to both the 2026 World Cup involving international teams and the 2025 Club World Cup, which will feature many of the world’s top club teams in venues across the US this year.', 'Also unclear is whether the ban will force US-based players who play internationally for countries subject to the ban to return from the current Fifa international window early.

He was considering it beforehand, but Sunday’s assault put it into motion faster. The suspect in the attack, however, was an Egyptian national, and Egypt was not included on the list of banned countries.', '“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,” White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson wrote on X.', '“These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,” she wrote.', 'Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”', '“The list is subject to revision based on whether material improvements are made. And likewise new countries can be added as threats emerge around the world, but we will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm and nothing will stop us from keeping America safe,” the president said.', 'The proclamation takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on June 9, according to the White House.', 'Wednesday’s proclamation comes less than five months after the president was inaugurated. On his first day in office, he issued an executive order directing cabinet members, including the secretary of state, to compile a list of countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.”', 'In his first term, Trump barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the US, a policy that saw court challenges. The Supreme Court upheld the third version of Trump’s travel ban that was issued in 2017. It restricted entry in varying degrees from Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Venezuela.', 'President Joe Biden ultimately repealed it when he took office in 2021.', 'The barring of nationals from Afghanistan could impact Afghans who worked alongside the US during its two decades of war there. Tens of thousands of Afghans have already been caught in limbo due to other Trump administration executive orders suspending the US refugee admissions program and the suspension of foreign aid funding for flights of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders.', 'The executive order says it provides an exemption for Afghan Special Immigrant Visas, but countless other vulnerable Afghans who do not qualify for the program are likely still at risk.', 'Shawn Vandiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a leading US coalition of resettlement and veterans’ groups, said the travel ban “disproportionately affects families and individuals seeking lawful entry into the US.”', 'The proclamation “is a strategic move, not a response to an immediate threat,” Vandiver said in a statement.', 'The ban also sparked criticism from the governments of impacted countries.', 'Venezuela’s Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace said on Wednesday that being in the US “is a big risk for anyone, not just Venezuelans.”', '“If you’re really that foolish, then go to the United States,” Diosdado Cabello said on government TV, Reuters news agency reported.', 'Oxfam, meanwhile, warned that the proclamation “marks a chilling return to policies of fear, discrimination, and division.”', 'The ban will deny entry to the US for individuals and families fleeing war and persecution, “forcing them to remain in dangerous conditions,” Abby Maxman, Oxfam America’s President and CEO, said in a statement.', 'Helen Regan, Shania Shelton and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.', 'This story and headline have been updated with additional information.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Trump’s New “Supercharged” Travel Ban,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/trump-new-travel-ban-muslim-ban-supercharged/,"['An Afghan man passes in front of an air travel agency in Kabul, Afghanistan.Ebrahim Noroozi/AP', '', 'On Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a new travel ban on foreigners, primarily targeting people from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. Under the guise of protecting the United States against “foreign terrorists” and national security threats, this executive order amounts to an even more sweeping bar than the infamous travel ban on Muslim-majority nations that President Donald Trump implemented during his first term.', '“There is no evidence this is making us safer.”', 'The reinstated travel ban represents the administration’s latest attack on immigrants. Slated to go into effect Monday, it prohibits most travel and lawful immigration from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. It also limits entry for travelers from seven other nations: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.', 'The rationale for the restrictions, according to the presidential proclamation, is based on “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism” concerns. The executive order states that the countries hit with the restrictions lack proper vetting and screening processes for issuing passports and other civil documents and have high visa overstay rates. It also mentions the nations’ willingness (or lack thereof) to take back deportees from the United States as a factor.', 'There are a number of exemptions to the ban: travelers who already have valid visas, green card holders, Afghan nationals eligible for a special visa for assisting the US government, and immediate relatives of American citizens. It also carves out exceptions for “ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran,” dual citizens traveling with a passport from a country not listed in the proclamation, and athletes coming for the World Cup or other major sports events.', 'The 19 countries targeted by the travel ban represent more than 475 million people, the American Immigration Council noted. “The travel bans of the Trump administration’s first term never demonstrated any meaningful value as a national security tool,” Jeremy Robbins, executive director of the organization, said in a statement. “Sweeping national origin bans declare many innocent people to be a threat based on factors they cannot control in their home countries. There is no evidence this is making us safer.”', 'Other immigration policy experts and observers have raised questions about the Trump administration’s justification for the severe travel restrictions. Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute pointed out that there’s little evidence to support claims that immigrants from the countries covered by the ban commit acts of terrorism at any significant rate.', 'Upon announcing the executive order, Trump brought up the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, against a group of demonstrators calling for Israeli hostages in Gaza to be released. The alleged perpetrator is an Egyptian national who authorities say entered the United States on a tourist visa in 2022 and later applied for asylum; this, Trump said, “has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals.” Egypt, however, isn’t included in the list of countries targeted by the executive order.

Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs.', 'For all but four of the 19 countries hit with restrictions, the administration pointed to high rates of their nationals overstaying their visas after entering the US.', 'Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The suspect in that attack was originally from Egypt, which was not on Wednesday’s travel ban list. He obtained a two-year work authorization that expired in March, a Homeland Security (DHS) official said.', 'Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests.', 'Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade.', 'Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone.', 'The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023.', 'The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation.', 'RELATED VIDEO\nTrump confirms on social media he authorized airstrikes on Somalia', 'Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead.', 'The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia.', 'Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity.', 'Chad had one of the highest rates of visa overstays of any country included in the ban; around half of the people admitted to the US from the central African nation overstayed their visa in the 2023 financial year, according to the DHS, though the numbers of Chadians granted such visas was relatively small. The White House said Wednesday that Chad’s overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.”', 'The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States.', '“Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added.', 'The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”', '“While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” its statement read.', 'The ban targeted three Middle Eastern adversaries with which the US has limited or no diplomatic ties.', 'The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan’s official government. The militant group reclaimed power in 2021 amid a chaotic and deadly withdrawal of US forces under the Biden administration. Afghans who helped the US government during Washington’s two-decade involvement in the country are exempt from the ban; they fall under a Special Immigrant Visa program that has allocated more than 50,000 visas since 2009.', 'The Trump administration targeted Yemen’s Houthi rebels with airstrikes for several weeks earlier this year, in response to the group attacking ships and disrupting trade routes in the Red Sea. The Houthis control much of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.', 'Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. Gangs control at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and have launched attacks in the country’s central region in recent years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced.', 'Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. The move comes a week after the Supreme Court allowed Trump’s administration to suspend a Biden-era humanitarian parole program that let half a million people from the two countries, plus Nicaragua, temporarily live and work in the US each year.', 'Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.”', 'Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday.', 'Of all the countries targeted, the new restrictions may impact Venezuelans the most. More than 55,000 people from Venezuela received nonimmigrant visas to enter the US in 2023, and nearly 800,000 Venezuelans in total were granted such visas over the preceding decade, according to the State Department.', 'The White House said both Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, have failed to co-operate with the US regarding the return of their nationals.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nMyanmar’s earthquake devastated the war-torn nation. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity', 'Myanmar’s ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army.', 'The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March.', 'The US and Laos meanwhile have a complicated history, hampered by the US bombing of the country during its war in Vietnam. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday’s ban.', 'Egypt was spared inclusion in the travel ban, even though the restrictions were expedited after an Egyptian national was charged with attempted murder after the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado.', 'Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. Relations between Cairo and Washington date back to 1922, when Egypt gained independence from the United Kingdom, and have continued ever since.', 'According to the US embassy in Egypt, some 450 Egyptians travel to the United States annually on professional and academic exchange programs.', 'The Arab nation has also historically been the second biggest recipient of US military aid, following Israel. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country’s human rights record.', '“Egypt is a valued U.S. partner in counterterrorism, anti-trafficking, and regional security operations, which advance both U.S. and Egyptian security,” the US embassy said in 2023.', 'Amnesty International called the travel ban based on nationality “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel.”', 'CNN’s Helen Regan and Ana Melgar contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

New Travel Ban Will Leave Families Separated,https://www.rescue.org/press-release/new-travel-ban-will-leave-families-separated,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'New York, NY, June 5, 2025 —  The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is seriously concerned that the Trump administration’s proclamation(opens in a new window) imposing a new Travel Ban will inhumanely and unjustly separate families from their loved ones and prevent people fleeing crisis and conflict from reaching safety in the US. The ban, which is slated to take effect on June 9, 2025, will suspend the entry of citizens from twelve countries and significantly restrict entry of those from seven others on the basis of their nationality. ', 'This travel ban will apply to many people who have been forced from their homes by conflict or persecution, including those from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Cuba, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Venezuela, and Yemen. Several of these countries are on IRC’s 2025 Emergency Watchlist of countries most at risk of new or worsening humanitarian emergencies including Sudan (#1), Myanmar (#3), Haiti (#8), Somalia (#10), Afghanistan, Chad, and Yemen.', 'While the ban provides specific exceptions for Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders and certain persecuted minorities from Iran, it will exclude the arrival of most others from the listed countries, including the family members of refugees and people granted asylum who are already in the US, and does not have a waiver for urgent humanitarian circumstances. ', 'This action will have far-reaching impacts, both in the US and abroad: preventing American families from reunifying with their loved ones, including the spouses and children of permanent residents, and could leave persecuted religious minorities and other refugees in danger. It is a further retreat from American humanitarian values following on the heels of the executive order (opens in a new window)issued on January 20, 2025 indefinitely halting resettlement.', ""Hans Van de Weerd, IRC’s Senior Vice President, Resettlement, Asylum & Integration, said, “The administration's action to ban certain nationalities from the United States is discriminatory and harmful. This proclamation bans people from some of the most fragile and conflict-affected countries in the world. Refugees and immigrants are not a threat to US security or the economy—in fact, they make key social, economic and cultural contributions to US communities."", '""At a moment when the world faces the largest refugee crisis on record, resettlement and other pathways to safety are needed more now than ever. Continuing to be a land of refuge and a place of freedom is consistent with core American values and traditions. The IRC remains steadfast in our commitment to provide refugees, asylum seekers, and other newcomers to America, including our clients in the US whose loved ones will be excluded under this order,  with accurate information, legal representation, workforce development and other support they need to thrive and continue to contribute to their new communities.”', 'The International Rescue Committee responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises, helping to restore health, safety, education, economic wellbeing, and power to people devastated by conflict and disaster.

A similar ban during Trump’s first administration sparked major protests at U.S. airports and numerous lawsuits. The new ban targets visitors from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and the Republic of Congo, which is also known as Congo-Brazzaville, not to be confused with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. New travel restrictions will also be placed on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Amnesty International criticized the ban as “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel.” The White House released a video of Trump speaking about the ban.', 'President Donald Trump: “The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them.”', 'We will have more on this story after headlines. ', 'At the United Nations, the United States on Wednesday vetoed another Security Council resolution calling for an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” in Gaza. The vote was 14 to 1, with the other permanent members of the Security Council — Russia, China, France and the U.K. — all supporting the ceasefire. Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour responded to the U.S. veto.', 'Riyad Mansour: “This draft resolution had a simple goal: demanding a ceasefire that would allow the beginning of the monumental work needed to end the horrific humanitarian situation, to stop the genocide, to release hostages and prisoners, and to get the Israeli occupying forces out of Gaza before they get a chance to implement their plans to destroy our people.”', 'Hours after the U.N. vote, Israel attacked the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. Three Palestinian journalists were killed; a fourth journalist was seriously wounded. This marks the eighth time Israel has targeted the hospital. Meanwhile, the shadowy new U.S.- and Israel-backed aid group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has suspended operations for a second straight day, after over 100 Palestinians were shot dead while seeking aid earlier this week. This is a survivor.', 'Survivor: “We only wanted to feed our children. They’re the ones who need food, not us. We’re used to going without, like during Ramadan. That’s why we rushed to the aid distribution site. They tempted people with promises of help, but in the end, they opened fire. Why? What did we do to deserve this?”', 'A new CNN investigation backs up eyewitness reports Israeli troops opened fire near an aid distribution site on Sunday, contradicting denials by Israel. Meanwhile, in southern Gaza, the Israeli military has recovered the bodies of two Israeli Americans — Judi Weinstein Haggai and her husband Gadi Haggai — who had been killed in the October 7 attack.', 'On Capitol Hill, seven members of the group Doctors Against Genocide were arrested Wednesday inside the Hart Senate Office Building. The doctors said they were attempting to deliver to lawmakers what they called a “prescription” to end the forced starvation of children in Gaza. ', 'Here in New York, a group of veterans and peace activists have begun their third week on hunger strike outside the United Nations. We will speak to one of the hunger strikers, Kathy Kelly, later in the show.', 'And in London, pro-Palestinian protesters formed a red circle around the British Parliament on Wednesday. Iyas AlQasem of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign took part in the protest.', 'Iyas AlQasem: “Palestinian lives do matter. And everybody here is saying that if you’re a human with a conscience, you cannot watch a genocide. And worse than that, you cannot continue to arm a genocide. And that’s why they’re here.”', 'In Ukraine, Russian drone strikes killed five people and wounded six others in the northern city of Pryluky. The dead included a 1-year-old child found under the rubble. Elsewhere, Russian bombs struck the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, heavily damaging a government administrative building and injuring two people. And at least 18 people were injured when Russian drones struck apartment buildings in Kharkiv overnight, with two children among those injured.', 'The attacks came after President Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to retaliate for Ukraine’s drone strikes on military airfields, which reportedly struck more than 40 Russian aircraft. Putin’s threat came during a 75-minute phone call between the two leaders, their second call in recent weeks. Trump wrote afterward, “It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.”', 'On Tuesday, Ukraine announced saboteurs had successfully set off explosives planted underwater at the foundations of a key bridge connecting Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. The explosion briefly halted traffic. It was Ukraine’s third attack on the bridge since Russia’s invasion in 2022. ', 'Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected a key demand of the Trump administration’s proposed nuclear deal, saying Iran must be allowed to continue enriching uranium for peaceful purposes. Over the weekend, the Trump administration proposed a deal that would have allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium, but only temporarily — something Khamenei called unacceptable.', 'Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: “If we have 100 nuclear power plants but no enrichment, it won’t help us, because nuclear power plants require fuel. If we can’t produce this nuclear fuel within the country, we’ll have to turn to America. They may set 10 conditions for supplying nuclear fuel.”', 'Human Rights Watch is calling for an investigation into the U.S. bombing of an oil port on Yemen’s Red Sea coast on April 17 that killed 84 people and wounded more than 150 others. Forty-nine of the dead were port workers. Also killed were several truck drivers, two civil defense workers and workers’ family members, including three children. Human Rights Watch said the U.S. government’s decision to strike the oil facility while hundreds of workers were present shows a “callous disregard for civilians’ lives.”', 'The Trump administration has escalated its attacks on Columbia University. In a letter to the nonprofit that accredits Columbia, the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights asks for the school’s accreditation to be canceled and accuses Columbia of violating the rights of Jewish students by “acting with deliberate indifference” toward reports of harassment during campus protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza.', 'Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday moved to block nearly all international students from attending Harvard University — taking a separate approach this time, after a federal court in Boston blocked a similar effort by the Department of Homeland Security last week. Trump’s new effort invokes national security as a rationale. In a statement, Harvard officials rejected the freeze on international scholars as “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”', 'The Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely force most — or all — of the nation’s 37 tribal schools to shut down. ProPublica reports that even before Trump’s proposed cuts, tribal colleges were receiving a quarter-billion dollars per year less than the inflation-adjusted amount they should receive. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights once called tribal colleges “the most poorly funded institutions of higher education in the country.”', 'President Trump’s order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50% took effect Wednesday. In response, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum accused Trump of violating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and said Mexico would soon announce countermeasures.', 'President Claudia Sheinbaum: “If there is no agreement, we will be announcing measures next week, because our responsibility is, first, to protect employment, Mexican workers, and, second, the steel industry.”', 'The Congressional Budget Office reported Wednesday that President Trump’s sprawling domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO projects nearly 11 million people will lose health insurance if the proposal becomes law. ', 'In New Jersey, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has filed a federal lawsuit claiming false arrest, malicious prosecution and defamation over his arrest last month by masked federal agents outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail.', 'Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are calling on Republican Chair Jim Jordan to condemn the actions of Homeland Security agents last week when they handcuffed and detained a staffer for New York Democratic Congressmember Jerry Nadler. The incident began when Federal Protective Service agents knocked on the door of Nadler’s Manhattan offices demanding to be let inside, saying they were searching for “protesters.” One agent accused Nadler’s aides of “harboring rioters.” Staffers had been observing protests outside an immigration court in the same building and had invited two protesters inside their office. Congressmember Nadler later told CNN the agents handcuffed and detained his staffer even though they lacked a warrant.', 'Rep. Jerrold Nadler: “The tactics were totally unacceptable, and they needed a warrant. And my office is a congressional office. It’s a completely separate branch of government, a coequal branch of government with the executive, for which they work. And they had no right to come in. They had no right to disregard the coequal branch of government, which is to say the Congress.”', 'In El Salvador, a judge has ordered the detention of prominent anti-corruption lawyer Ruth López for six months while she awaits trial. She was arrested last month over allegations of embezzlement — charges she says are trumped-up. On Wednesday, López shouted to reporters as she was led into a courtroom in handcuffs for a closed-door hearing.', 'Ruth López: “I want a public trial! The people deserve to know. Whoever doesn’t owe, doesn’t fear.”', 'Ruth López is the head of the anti-corruption and justice unit at Cristosal, a leading Salvadoran human rights group that has frequently criticized the policies of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.', ""We're hiring a Director of Audience, Director of Technology, and Senior Headline News Producer!""]",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVNORkI0T0RSTFUwUjNkelkzVFJEMEFoalJBeWdLTWdZQllJcm9xUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

But it also means that another change Trump made this week is flying under the radar — one with consequences for millions of people around the world.', 'What just happened? On Wednesday evening, the Trump administration announced a total ban on entry to the US for citizens of 12 countries, resurrecting a key first-term policy. The ban also includes partial restrictions on seven other countries and is set to take effect this coming Monday, June 9.', 'Which countries does the ban impact? Immigrants, students, and tourists will all be affected. Citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen are subject to a total ban, while all immigrant visas and many classes of non-immigrant visa for citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela are covered by the partial restrictions.', 'What’s the context? This new ban isn’t a surprise — a “Muslim ban,” which was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court after multiple iterations, was a flagship policy in the first Trump administration, and the second Trump administration has previously signaled its intent to bring back some version of the policy. In March, it was reported that the administration was considering various restrictions on at least 43 different countries.', 'The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.', 'What’s different this time? The new ban covers more countries and cites a wider range of justifications.

This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls.', 'Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House.', 'The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.', 'A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles.', 'Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt.', 'Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result.', 'While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said.', 'While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order.', ""Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level."", 'The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia.', 'There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals.', 'Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism.', ""But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list."", ""Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X."", 'The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.', 'Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries.', 'However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country\'s overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump\'s ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested.', '""If they\'re relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC.', 'But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy.', ""Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date."", 'It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.', 'Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"".', 'The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.', 'It was repealed in 2021 by Trump\'s successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"".', 'Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.', '""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"".', '""They\'ve put more thought into it.""', 'Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad.', '""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they\'re unlikely to get visas now,"" she said.', '""Even EB-5 investors - people who\'ve put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""', 'Additional reporting by Leyla Khodabakhshi', 'The US secretary of state has accused the International Criminal Court of taking ""illegitimate actions"".', 'The judge called the rapper\'s actions ""absolutely unacceptable"" after he nodded and made faces at the jury.', ""Some may ask if Mark Rutte's proposal to deter Russian aggression has at least a little to do with appeasing the US president, writes Jonathan Beale."", ""Trump's proposed 3.5% tax on remittances by foreign workers could seriously impact top recipient India."", 'Families react to the delay of the trial of a Libyan man accused of making the bomb that destroyed Pan Am flight 103.', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

Trump’s new travel ban: the countries chosen and how it differs from the last one,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/what-is-trump-travel-ban-countries,"['President’s sweeping proclamation targets citizens of many countries and would dramatically reshape US border policy', 'US politics live – latest updates', 'Nearly five months into his second term, Donald Trump has announced a new sweeping travel ban that could reshape the US’s borders more dramatically than any policy in modern memory. The restrictions, revealed through a presidential proclamation on Wednesday, would target citizens from more than a dozen countries – creating a three-tiered system of escalating barriers to entry.', 'The proclamation represents one of the most ambitious attempts to reshape the US’s approach to global mobility in modern history and potentially affects millions of people coming to the US for relocation, travel, work or school.', 'A travel ban restricts or prohibits citizens of specific countries from entering the US. These restrictions can range from complete visa suspensions to specific limitations on certain visa categories.', 'Trump’s day one executive order required the state department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”.', 'His travel ban proclamation referenced the previous executive order, as well as the recent attack by an Egyptian national in Boulder, Colorado, upon a group of people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.', 'A presidential proclamation is a decree that is often ceremonial or can have legal implications when it comes to national emergencies.', 'Unlike an executive order, which is a directive to heads of agencies in the administration, the proclamation primarily signals a broad change in policy.', 'The following countries were identified for total bans of any nationals seeking to travel to the US for immigration or non-immigration reasons:', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'Republic of the Congo', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Trump is also partly restricting the travel of people from:', 'Burundi', 'Cuba', 'Laos', 'Sierra Leone', 'Togo', 'Turkmenistan', 'Venezuela', 'The proclamation broadly cites national security issues for including the countries, but specifies a few different issues that reach the level of concern for the travel ban.', 'For some countries, such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Venezuela, the proclamation claims that there is no reliable central authority for issuing passports or screening and vetting nationals traveling out of the country.', 'For other countries, such as Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan, the proclamation cites a high rate of immigrants overstaying their business, tourist and student visas in the US.', 'Finally, there are several countries that are included because of terrorist activity or state-sponsored terrorism, including Iran, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia and Cuba.', 'In the draft travel ban plans that were leaked in March, the original list contained 43 nations across three tiers of restrictions. Now the ban has been filtered down to 19 countries.', 'Among the puzzling inclusions is Venezuela, which the White House says lacks competent document-issuing authorities. Trump has recently pursued a thaw in relations with the country that has proven useful to his deportation initiatives– though the country’s inclusion is likely tied to Venezuelans already in the US who have been a clear target for the White House.', 'The 2017 ban initially targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries before expanding to include North Korea and Venezuela. This new proclamation is broader and also makes the notable addition of Haiti.', 'During his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump amplified false claims made by his running mate, JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were “eating the pets of the people that live there”. The proclamation falsely claims that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden administration” and this “influx harms American communities”. In fact, about 200,000 Haitians were granted temporary protected status, which gives legal residency permits to foreign nationals who are unable to return home safely due to conditions in their home countries.', 'Also notable are the restrictions on Afghans, given that many of the Afghans approved to live in the US as refugees were forced to flee their home country as a result of working to support US troops there, before the full withdrawal of US forces in 2021. The agreement with the Taliban to withdraw US troops was negotiated by Trump during his first term.', 'Last month, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced “the termination of temporary protected status for Afghanistan”, effective 20 May.', 'The restrictions will be reviewed every 180 days for potential modification.', 'Current visa holders remain largely protected: the restrictions only apply to people outside the US without valid visas as of 9 June. No existing visas will be revoked, the White House said.', 'But new visa applications from people from these countries will be suspended or severely limited, with some exceptions for diplomatic visas, immediate family members and cases involving US national interest – one such example being the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.', 'For employers, the ban threatens significant workforce disruptions across the tech, healthcare and education sectors, with companies unable to hire from the 12 countries targeted by a full ban. For the seven countries on a partial ban, employers can still hire on some work visas but cannot sponsor green cards, and visas will have reduced durations.', 'The impact could be particularly severe for international Stem talent, medical professionals and academic recruitment.', 'The education and health industries alone employ about 5.5 million foreign-born workers.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVNORkI0T0RSTFUwUjNkelkzVFJEMEFoalJBeWdLTWdZQllJcm9xUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

Egypt itself is not on the banned list."", ""Other reasons cited include alleged breaking of US visa rules by people from the countries in question. Here is a closer look at some of the president's reasoning."", 'A range of accusations have been made against Afghanistan in a presidential proclamation signed by Trump. The document highlights that the Taliban, which controls the country, is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group.', 'The move comes just weeks after the Trump administration appeared to signal that it believed the situation had improved in Afghanistan, when it announced the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans living in the US.', 'Afghanistan is further accused by Trump of lacking a ""competent or co-operative"" central authority for issuing passports or civil documents.

The east African country is branded by Trump as a ""terrorist safe haven"". Like Iran, it is also accused of failing to accept its nationals when removed from the US.', 'However, a further point was made by Trump: ""Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects.""', 'Somalia\'s internationally-based government faces a significant challenge from armed Islamists. It has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"" by Trump.', 'Libya, in north Africa, is cited for its ""historical terrorist presence"", which is painted as a security threat to Americans.', ""Libya and Somalia are also among the countries on Trump's list which have been criticised for their perceived incompetence at issuing passports."", 'The document highlights that ""hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration"".', 'Trump points to various perceived risks that this has entailed - including the creation of ""criminal networks"" and high visa overstay rates.', 'Data from the US Census Bureau suggested more than 852,000 Haitians were living in the US in February 2024, though it does not give a breakdown of when those migrants arrived.', 'Many came after a devastating earthquake in 2010, or after fleeing gang violence that took hold in the Caribbean nation.

Eritrea is also blamed for failing to make the criminal records of its national available to the US, and of refusing to accept deported nationals.', ""As with Somalia, Yemen is also accused of lacking control over its own land. Trump's proclamation highlights that it is the site of active US military operations. The US has been combating Houthis, who have seized much of the north and west of the country during an ongoing civil war."", 'People from seven other nations face partial restrictions:', 'The breaking point came after Musk criticised Trump\'s centrepiece ""big, beautiful"" spending bill as an ""abomination"".', ""A knock-down fight between world's the richest person and the most powerful politician is playing out in public view."", 'The tech billionaire took to his social media site, X, as the president expressed disappointment in his opposition to his spending bill.', 'The judge called the rapper\'s actions ""absolutely unacceptable"" after he nodded and made faces at the jury.', ""Some may ask if Mark Rutte's proposal to deter Russian aggression has at least a little to do with appeasing the US president, writes Jonathan Beale."", 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

Those already in the U.S. may still be able to renew their visas, but reentry could be complicated.', 'The move fulfills one of Trump’s 2024 campaign pledges and follows a recent antisemitic attack in Colorado, which the president said on Truth Social, was ""yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.""', 'Travelers should consult the U.S. State Department’s website or an immigration attorney for the latest guidance, especially if they are from or have family in one of the listed countries.', 'The full travel ban applies to nationals of the following 12 countries:', 'Additionally, partial restrictions are imposed on nationals from:', 'The travel restrictions will take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Monday, June 9, 2025.', 'Travelers from the fully banned countries who attempt to enter the U.S. after the ban takes effect will likely be denied boarding by airlines or turned away upon arrival in the U.S. Those from partially restricted countries may face additional scrutiny, delays, or denial of entry, depending on their visa type and purpose of travel.', 'Individuals from the affected countries who have already purchased tickets to travel to the U.S. should consult with their airlines and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.

Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partially restricted.', 'The US president said that he “considered foreign policy, national security, and counter-terrorism goals” in deciding the scope of the ban. Trump had cued up the ban in an executive order signed on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidates for a ban by 21 March.', 'Trump has cited a range of justifications for the bans, including national security and concerns that visitors from those countries are overstaying their visas.', 'But advocates and experts have said that blanket travel bans discriminate against groups of people based on ethnicity alone. They will probably result – as the travels bans did during Trump’s first term – in the separation of families. The bans on travel from Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela could be especially impactful in US communities with huge immigrant populations from those countries.', '“This discriminatory policy, which limits legal immigration, not only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and communities that rely on the contributions of people who come to America from this wide range of countries,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative of Washington.', 'The decision to ban travel from these countries comes amid a wave of hardline immigration policies that Trump has issued, including the blocking of asylum claims at the southern border and cancelling temporary protected status for immigrants from a number of countries facing deep humanitarian crises. Trump has also signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University and ordered US consulates to conduct social media screening of every visa applicant seeking to travel to the university.', 'In a video message released on social media, Trump said he was making good on a promise to act following the recent attack at a Boulder, Colorado, event showing support for Israeli hostages. The attack by an Egyptian national “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas.

According to the court, the ban fell within the remit of a president’s national security powers. North Korea and Venezuela were also included.', 'The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said then: “The Muslim ban’s bigotry should have been as clear to the supreme court as it is to the Muslims demonized by it.
