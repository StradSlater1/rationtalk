Mission 2 was to touch down on the lunar surface at 60.5 degrees north and 4.6 degrees west, in Mare Frigoris, the same region in the Moon’s northern hemisphere where Mission 1 attempted to touch down at Atlas Crater in 2023.', 'Resilience, in orbit around the Moon since early May, was scheduled to land one month after its lunar orbit insertion. The spacecraft attempted its landing on Thursday, June 5, at 19:17 UTC (4:17 AM JST Friday, June 6) near the center of Mare Frigoris, but data was lost 90 seconds before landing. The company stated there was a contingency plan for up to three alternate sites with dates and times for each should that be needed, but this plan was not used.', '', 'If Resilience had landed according to plan, it would have been the second fully successful commercial robotic lunar landing of not just this year but also in history, after Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 “Ghost Riders In The Sky”, which Resilience shared a ride to orbit with on a Falcon 9. It would also have become the second successful Japanese lunar landing after SLIM, which was a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency project.', '', 'Other commercial landing attempts include and the Intuitive Machines IM-1 and IM-2 spacecraft, which were able to function for a time on the surface but ended in non-nominal orientations due to landing issues. The ispace company’s first HAKUTO-R mission failed due to a misinterpretation of altimeter data caused by a computer software issue exposed when the spacecraft passed a crater wall on its way to the landing site.', 'This interpretation of the data — rejecting it as bad when it was in fact correct — caused Mission 1 to hover at five kilometers above the lunar surface. After the lander ran out of fuel, it spun uncontrollably and impacted the surface, ending the mission. Resilience, though using the same basic HAKUTO-R design as Mission 1, incorporated upgrades from the lessons learned based on the first flight.', 'After its rideshare launch to the Moon on Jan. 15, 2025, Resilience arrived in a highly elliptical lunar orbit on May 6 at 20:41 UTC (5:41 AM JST May 7). The arrival came after taking a fuel-efficient trajectory, which included a flyby of the Moon on Feb. 15 before attaining a maximum distance of 1.5 million km from Earth.', 'The Moon as seen from ispace’s HAKUTO-R Mission 2 lander Resilience. (Credit: ispace)', 'The lunar flyby came to within 8,400 km of the lunar surface, the closest Resilience would come to the Moon prior to its orbital insertion. Immediately after orbital insertion, the spacecraft reached a highly elliptical lunar orbit of 44 km by 5,910 km with a 104-degree inclination according to calculations by citizen scientist Scott Tilley. Over the following weeks, the lander gradually lowered its orbit, ending up in a circular orbit around 100 km altitude on May 28 after a 10-minute engine burn.', 'Resilience, with a 340 kg dry mass, orbited the Moon once every two hours prior to starting the landing sequence, and completed all orbital control activities — the eighth out of its 10 planned mission milestones — a few days before its landing attempt. The attempt started well enough with a good deorbit burn followed by a pitch-up maneuver to adjust attitude. The lander moved into a terminal descent phase before its touchdown, and it used one main landing thruster plus six assist thrusters.', 'Screenshot of live telemetry from HAKUTO R M2 Resilience’s landing attempt. (Credit: ispace)', 'Everything seemed to go according to plan until close to 90 seconds before landing, when telemetry showed the craft descending rapidly. The last readings from the spacecraft showed the lander only 52 m from the surface, and that value quickly changed to over -300 m – in other words, underneath the surface – before all telemetry was lost. The time of landing passed without any further contact, and with clearly worried controllers assessing the situation.', 'The landing was to become the mission’s ninth milestone, and if all had gone well, it was to be followed by establishing a steady power-positive state using Resilience’s solar panels, capable of generating up to 350 watts. It would have attempted to obtain a steady communications link.', 'The landing site was chosen so that the 2.3 m tall lander, with a total footprint of 2.6 x 2.6 m, could have remained in contact with Earth at all times. These activities were to be the tenth and final mission milestone, which would have allowed customer activities on the lunar surface.', 'The Tenacious rover shown in its protective box on the Resilience lander before launch. (Credit: ispace)', 'Resilience carried a small lunar rover and several payloads from various companies. The micro rover, known as Tenacious, had a carbon fiber structure, massed five kilograms with dimensions of 26 x  31.5 x 54 cm, and was manufactured by ispace in its Luxembourg facility. The rover was carrying a work of art on board, a Falu red miniature cottage called Moonhouse by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg, which it was to deposit on the lunar surface.', 'Tenacious also featured a soil scoop to gather regolith, which it was to then photograph for NASA. The rover also contained a forward-mounted high-definition camera. Tenacious was to be controlled from the ground with Resilience, equipped with X-band communications, functioning as a relay, and was to rove around the landing site untethered.', 'The lander’s secondary payloads included a Takasago Thermal Engineering Company-developed water electrolyzer as well as a food production experiment module developed by the Euglena Company. A radiation probe flown by Taiwan’s National Central University was also on board, as well as a “Charter of the Universal Century” commemorative plaque provided by Bandai Namco.', 'Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter image of Resilience’s planned landing site in Mare Frigoris. (Credit: NASA/ASU/GSFC)', 'The United Nations also had a small payload aboard Resilience. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization provided a memory disk, which will be a cultural artifact aboard the lander. The memory disk has examples of 275 human languages.', 'This memory disk, intended to preserve a record of cultural and linguistic diversity, was the latest attempt by humanity to preserve some of its knowledge aboard space missions. It was similar in purpose to the famous “Golden Records” carried by Voyager 1 and 2 and other items included in missions leaving Earth.', 'The HAKUTO-R Mission 2, though conceived and operated by a Japanese company, had international elements. The Tenacious rover was actually the first European-built rover to go to the Moon. Moreover, the European Space Agency supported mission communications with ground stations in Argentina, Australia, French Guiana, Spain, and the United Kingdom.', 'Illustration of the APEX 1.0 lander, scheduled for launch in 2027.

The company develops the lander for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services as part of “Team Draper,” led by US space and defense contractor Draper.', 'Regardless of how the HAKUTO-R Mission 2 turned out, more commercial and government-operated robotic landing missions are planned for the lunar surface prior to human missions planned by NASA and China. After a very long period in the late 20th Century with no lunar missions at all, renewed international competition and cooperation, along with a surging commercial space sector, are expected to keep lunar exploration on this century’s spaceflight agenda.', '(Lead image: Rendering of the HAKUTO-R Mission 2 lander Resilience and its Tenacious rover on the lunar surface.

And company executives said that taking a slow and steady path to the moon can offer Ispace some long-term advantages.', '“What is good about this four- or five-month trajectory is, every day, there are small things that happen … something we didn’t expect,” Ispace Chief Financial Officer Jumpei Nozaki told CNN in January. “This (journey to the moon) is really a learning phase.”', 'Three teams of Ispace employees have been rotating in and out of the company’s mission control room in Tokyo, racking up months’ worth of practice in overseeing the unpredictable and daring physics of deep-space travel — a rare opportunity, the company’s founder and CEO, Takeshi Hakamada, told CNN.', 'Such a gradual approach to the moon does not, however, guarantee landing success.', 'Ispace’s first attempt to put a spacecraft on the lunar surface ended with a crash landing in April 2023 after a 4 ½-month journey from Earth.', 'Ultimately, Resilience’s long trajectory offers Ispace both pros and cons.', 'Resilience is on a path to the moon that’s often referred to as a low-energy transfer. It’s essentially a slow, cruising route — much like traveling to a friend’s house on a bike and coasting on the downhills, using little fuel or energy.', 'On such a path, the Resilience lander travels for hundreds of thousands of miles, soaring into deep space and waiting for the moon’s gravity to naturally capture the spacecraft into lunar orbit.', 'In contrast, other vehicles such as Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost and the Nova-C lander, developed by Texas-based company Intuitive Machines, have used large engines to fire themselves on a much more direct path. Intuitive Machines’ latest Nova-C lander, for example, reached the moon about a week after takeoff.', 'Compared with lunar landers developed by Ispace’s competitors, Resilience is lightweight and relatively cheap with a smaller rocket engine.', 'All the time Resilience spends in orbit allows mission operators to “verify many kinds of systems during this long journey,” such as the vehicle’s sensors, navigation and other software systems, Nozaki said.', 'But there are downsides, too.', 'And Nozaki said that, no matter the outcome of Resilience’s trip, Ispace will abandon the low-energy transfer approach with its third mission.', 'Ispace’s upcoming lunar lander, called Apex 1.0, will be flown in partnership with Massachusetts-based company Draper, under CLPS for the Artemis program, with the aim of taking a more direct route to the moon.', 'Reaching the moon quickly is also “really important for our customers,” Nozaki said.', 'These clients include research groups, companies and governments that pay Ispace to fly cargo such as science instruments on board the lunar lander.', 'Spending months in transit can put extra wear on instruments as they are exposed to the intense radiation environment and wild temperature swings of space before they begin operating on the lunar surface, according to Ispace.', 'Still, the company is hopeful a group of three science instruments currently on board Resilience will carry out exciting tests after the vehicle reaches the moon on Thursday.', 'Resilience is carrying a module designed to test algae-based food production, a deep-space radiation monitor and a water electrolyzer experiment, which is a device that aims to generate hydrogen and oxygen in the lunar environment.', 'Ispace’s first lunar lander was descending toward the Atlas crater, a feature on the northeast side of the moon’s near face, when it crashed in April 2023.

If Japanese space company ispace pulls off the landing, it will also be the first non-US firm to touch down on lunar soil, after its first attempt in 2023 failed.', 'The company’s Resilience lander started its moon-bound journey on 15 January, when it launched aboard a SpaceX rocket together with Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander. While Blue Ghost touched down on 2 March, Resilience took a more circuitous journey to the moon, travelling beyond it into deep space before doubling back and entering lunar orbit on 6 May.

The landing attempt will be streamed on ispace’s YouTube channel.', 'There are six different experiments on board Resilience, including a device that can split water into usable hydrogen and oxygen, a module that can produce food from algae and a deep-space radiation monitor. The lander will also deploy a 5-kilogram rover, called Tenacious, to explore and photograph the lunar surface during a planned two-week mission.', 'The landing attempt will be ispace’s second attempt at landing on the moon after its first spacecraft, Hakuto-R, crashed into the lunar surface after losing communications. While the company says it has upgraded Resilience with improved sensors based on data it collected from the first mission, it still has a formidable task, as the spacecraft must slow down from hundreds of kilometres per hour to zero in less than 3 minutes.

But the mission failed to land safely, Ispace officials confirmed hours later.', '• The exact reasons for the mission’s failure are currently unclear. However, the lander likely crashed into the lunar surface.', '• If fully successful, Resilience would have been only the second private-sector lunar lander to make an upright landing on the moon, and the first built outside of the US to do so. It was the second attempt at a soft landing by Ispace, which is headquartered in Tokyo.', '• Resilience was one of several robotic landers developed by companies and governments across the world as part of a renewed race to explore the lunar surface.', '• Earlier this year, two NASA-backed, Texas-based companies — Firefly and Intuitive Machines — each made moon-landing attempts. Firefly’s was the first fully successful effort by a commercial outfit, while Intuitive Machines’ lander tipped on its side.', '• NASA was not directly backing this attempt, but Ispace is working with the US space agency on a future lunar mission.', 'Resilience had been circling about 100 kilometers (62 miles) above the moon in a stable, circular orbit, Ispace confirmed. It then descended successfully to about 20 kilometers (12 miles).', 'At that point, Resilience “successfully fired its main engine as planned to begin deceleration.”', 'It was not clear exactly how the vehicle was oriented, however. Ispace confirmed only that the spacecraft’s orientation was “nearly vertical” before data was lost.', 'Before landing, Resilience was expected to complete a pitch-over or roll maneuver that would change its position from lying horizontal in relation to the moon’s surface to sitting upright.', 'But the biggest issue may lie in how Resilience measured its altitude. That sounds similar to why Ispace’s first lander, the Hakuto-R spacecraft that crash landed in 2023, failed. However, executives said the problems appear to be different.', 'During Ispace’s 2023 failed landing attempt, Hakuto-R’s software wrongly threw out correct altitude data, which led to the failed landing attempt.', 'During Resilience’s touchdown attempt today, a laser rangefinder — or a sensor designed to measure distance to the moon’s surface — “experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values.”', '“As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing,” a statement from the company noted. “Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.”', 'That indicates Resilience likely crashed.', 'Executives at Ispace are not yet sure what may have happened to Resilience.', 'The company’s Japan-based leadership said that information sent back from the spacecraft to mission control in the moment before landing was different from the issue that plagued Ispace’s first Hakuto-R lunar lander during a 2023 mission.', '“The data that we’ve been looking at — it wasn’t exactly the same as we have seen from the first mission,” said Ispace’s Chief Technology Officer Ryo Ujiie in translated remarks.', 'The Hakuto-R spacecraft crash-landed during that trip after a software error caused the vehicle to miscalculate its altitude.', 'NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is an imaging satellite in orbit around Earth, captured a shot of the first Hakuto-R’s landing site — showing an impact crater that confirmed the vehicle had crashed.', 'Executives confirmed that they will once again ask NASA if the agency can tune the LRO’s cameras to help confirm what may have happened with Resilience. The spacecraft was expected to land in within a 750-mile-long (1,200-kilometer-long) plain called Mare Frigoris — or the “Sea of Cold.”', 'During a news conference, Ispace executives confirmed they are no longer trying to regain contact with the lander.', '“This is our second failure, and about these results, we have to really take it seriously,” Ispace’s CEO Takeshi Hakamada said in translated remarks.', 'Mission teams will now look to do a thorough review of what went wrong and apply lessons learned to Ispace’s next project, an attempted lunar landing of a craft called Apex 1.0.', 'Ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada, who is currently in Tokyo where Resilience mission control center is located, is set to conduct a news conference at 8 p.m. ET.', 'The event will be broadcast on YouTube here.', 'Ispace’s Resilience lander did not take a direct route to the moon, like some spacecraft that went before it, zooming to the lunar surface in mere days.', 'Resilience instead took a slow, swooping path to the moon that took over four months. (Such a gradual trip required little fuel, which is one way the company has managed to keep Resilience’s price tag down.)', 'During that time, three teams of Ispace employees have been rotating in and out of the company’s mission control room in Tokyo. Ispace hasn’t needed large teams “on console” — the aerospace term for when an engineer is managing data on a computer in mission control — but at least some engineers have been keeping a close eye over the vehicle during every stretch of this mission.', 'That experience is extremely valuable, Ispace’s founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada and chief financial officer Jumpei Nozaki told CNN in interviews conducted earlier this year.', '“What is good about this four- or five-month trajectory is, every day, there are small things that happen … something we didn’t expect…This (journey to the moon) is really a learning phase.”', 'Jumpei Nozaki, Ispace CFO', 'All lunar landing attempts — even missions such as this with no humans on board — bring with them an element of risk and awe.', 'Success is far from guaranteed. Overall, more than half of all lunar landing attempts have ended in failure, tough odds for a feat humanity first pulled off nearly 60 years ago.', 'While technology has advanced in the past five decades, the fundamental challenges of landing on the moon remain the same. Here’s what Resilience has had to overcome — and what it has yet to face.', 'As the space community and stakeholders looked on, waiting for confirmation about the status of the Resilience lander, Ron Garan, a former NASA astronaut and the chairman of Ispace’s US subsidiary, told CNN he did not see anything concerning in the live data shared on the livestream.', '“I’m not in the mission control room. I’m not seeing the telemetry, but I’m getting updates on my phone — everything was normal” in the moments before touchdown, Garan said.', 'Garan also highlighted a fact that many companies vying to build lunar landers have acknowleged: When attempting to develop the technology to go to the moon — and do it on a private-sector budget — it’s a tough feat.', 'Ispace does have another shot to get this right: The company has a new lander, called Apex 1.0, that it’s developing alongside US-based company Draper. That mission is slated to fly in 2027, and Ispace says it’s got all the funding it needs to get through that mission.', '“The reason why we’re doing this,” Garan said of today’s landing attmept, “is to learn.”', '“What Ispace has done in the past and will continue to do in the future, is be very open, very transparent, if anything did go wrong,” Garan added.', 'Ispace just posted an update on social media confirming that the company has not given up hope on the lander.', 'At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with RESILIENCE, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander. We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few… pic.twitter.com/D2TMGHK5f3', 'Ispace also took a few hours to confirm that its last lander failed. Ispace’s CEO previously told CNN that he expected to have contact with the lander at least within the first 10 minutes if everything had gone according to plan.', 'Ron Garan, a former NASA astronaut and the chairman of Ispace’s US subsidiary, told CNN in an interview: “I’m optimistic that we will have a good outcome.”', 'Garan said teams can still troubleshoot possible reasons that there may be communications issues with the lander. If the vehicle is tipped on its side, for example, that could create a situation where it takes mission controllers longer to get in touch with Resilience.', '“There also is the possibility that we’re not successful. We didn’t land successful. And so if that is the case, then we’re going to figure out, just like we did on Mission 1, figure out what the lessons learned are,” he said.', 'Ispace’s motto for this mission has been “never quit the lunar quest.” And the company’s CFO previously told CNN that Ispace is fully funded through its third mission, which will make use of a new lander model called Apex 1.0, and will be carried out as part of a contract with NASA.', 'Scott Kelly, the former NASA astronaut famous for his “year in space,” was at the Ispace watch party in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In an interview with CNN, he said he stopped by to support his friend and fellow NASA astronaut corps alumnus Ron Garan, the company’s chairman.', '“What (Ispace) is doing is really exciting. But space is hard, and the mood is harder, and like Ron was saying, they met a lot of their objectives so far, which is great,” Kelly said.', 'He also responded to questions about the space policy furor unfolding on Capital Hill.', 'President Donald Trump abruptly yanked his support of the Elon Musk-backed NASA administrator nominee, Jared Isaacman, over the weekend.', '“That’s really unfortunate,” Kelly said. “(Isaacman is) such a great guy, and I think uniquely, uniquely qualified for this moment. … I think he would have been an outstanding administrator.”', 'When asked about Trump’s stated plan to explore Mars — a pivot away from his first-term goal of focusing on returning astronauts to the moon — alongside lunar landing efforts, Kelly said, “NASA is constantly hamstrung by the fact that when we get a new administration, we get a new plan.”', '“When President Biden was elected, my brother (Democratic Senator Mark Kelly) made a point to his administration that just because it was President Trump’s plan doesn’t mean we need to abandon it,” Scott Kelly said.', 'When asked about Trump’s proposal to slash NASA’s science budget by almost 50%, Kelly said NASA “will be decimated.”', 'On the livestream, Ispace said “we haven’t been able to confirm, but (mission control) members will continuously attempt to communicate with the lander.”', '“This is part of the business, unfortunately,” ISpace’s Ron Garan added at an event in Washington, DC. But “one really important thing is the bar is open now.”', 'Ispace executives and industry leaders that have gathered at a watch party in Washington, DC are nervously awaiting news.', 'To fill time, Ron Garan, a former NASA astronaut and the chairman of Ispace’s US subsidiary, is taking questions from the crowd about Ispace’s long-term goals.', 'He added during a pause, “If I knew how to tap dance, I would.”', 'Cameras at Ispace’s mission control have panned to concerned looking faces on engineers.', 'The status of the vehicle is still unknown, nearly 10 minutes after its projected touchdown time.', 'Earlier, Ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada had told CNN that mission controllers would ideally learn about a safe touchdown within a minute after landing. After several minutes of troubleshooting, the odds of this mission ending in a success story are beginning to look unlikely.', 'It’s past the time that Resilience should have landed on the moon. But a clear confirmation of the vehicle’s health and safety has not been given.', 'At a watch event in Washington, DC, the crowd is quiet and in suspense.', 'The vehicle is currently just 5 kilometers, or 3 miles, above the lunar surface. Landing should be just moments away. But on the livestream, officials cautioned not to be led astray if the data reading for altitude hits “zero.”', 'Mission controllers will need to deliver independent confirmation of a safe landing.', 'The vehicle is now beginning its pitch over and final descent.', 'There will be no live footage of Reslience’s landing attempt. On missions to deep space, antennas communicating with Earth have limited bandwidth, and mission controllers prioritize precision data over stunning views.', 'But Resilience should be able to give Ispace a clear indication of how the landing went within just moments.', '“We have sensors installed on our landing gear,” Ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada told CNN. “Once we land on the moon, there’s a switch that can confirm the landing, and then the signal comes to us.”', 'During Ispace’s first lanar landing attempt in 2023, that signal never came through, which is why mission controllers had a pretty early indication that something was wrong, Hakamada said. After 10 minutes of troubleshooting, mission controllers declared that landing attempt a failure.', 'During the “breaking burn phase” — the lander will “burn very furiously, and then we try to reduce it as much as we can.”', 'The next phase, called the “breaking burn slash pitch up phase,” will see the vehicle pitch over to the upright position.', 'Then the vehicle will enter “terminal descent,” as Resilience moves to mere meters above the surface.', 'The final phase is called terminal landing. That’s when the lander’s engines cut off and — hopefully — mission teams can confirm a safe touchdown.', 'It’s time for the lander to begin rapidly decelerating. An engine burn lasting about 10 minutes just kicked off. It’s one of the first steps in the final landing process.', 'When NASA”s Apollo spacecraft reach the moon, astronauts on board could help scan for a safe landing spot with their own eyes. Robotic spacecraft, however, don’t have that luxury.', 'And while other lunar landers are equipped with their own sensors — or robotic eyes — to pick out a flat, safe landing spot during final descent, Resilience is not.', 'The company previously determined landing sites for Resilience, working with a lunar scientist, said CEO Takeshi Hakamada.', '“We try to find the very flat area, because our landing capability is very limited … We say ‘blind landing’,” Hakamada told CNN. “We don’t rely on visual sensors to identify the obstacles, so we have attitude sensors to measure the altitude from the ground. But we don’t have any sensors to avoid the obstacles.”', 'When asked why Ispace opted to forgo such sensors, Hakamada said it was a design decision made in the company’s early days.', 'Ispace has worked with US-based company Draper, which has its roots in NASA’s Apollo program, on guidance and navigation systems, Hakamada said. And the company was told that using visual sensors would take longer in the development process, so that concept was cut for speed.', 'The rover aboard Resilience, called Tenacious, was developed by Ispace’s European branch with co-funding from the Luxembourg Space Agency.', 'The 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover would be the first from Europe to land on the moon, and — if the compact four-wheeled vehicle accomplishes its main objective — it could be the first to collect a sample from the moon’s surface and sell the ownership rights back to NASA.', 'NASA previously agreed to pay Ispace $5,000 for the sample.', 'Just note: The move is largely ceremonial. The sample will likely stay on the moon, alongside the Tenacious rover and Resilience lander, indefinitely.', 'Still, accomplishing a lunar soil sample collection has been a goal chased by private-sector companies for a decade now. It was Ispace’s founding goal when the company was founded in 2010 and while it competed in the Google Lunar XPrize.', 'Google Lunar XPrize was created in an effort to spur private-sector innovation at a time when few companies were developing new technologies for deep-space exploration.', 'The XPrize offered a $20 million grand prize to the first company that could land on the moon, deploy a rover, and dig up some lunar dirt. But the prize ended in 2018 — after years of delays and development hangups — with no winner.', 'But Ispace went on to raise substantial money from private investors, allowing the company to continue chasing its goals.', '“Tenacious perfectly captures the spirit of this small rover, poised to achieve groundbreaking milestones.”', 'ispace-Europe, CEO Julien Lamamy', '© 2025 Cable News Network.
