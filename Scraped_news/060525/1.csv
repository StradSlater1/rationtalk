And the court did so unanimously. And the person who wrote the unanimous opinion for the court was Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. I will now walk into the ocean.', 'What makes the whole situation even more galling to me is that it’s probably the correct decision. It’s right in terms of the law—even though the underlying facts in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services are a case study in white fragility in the modern age.', 'The plaintiff in this case is Marlean Ames, a straight white woman who worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services. Ames applied for a promotion, but didn’t get it. Instead, the promotion went to a man, and that man happened to be gay. That’s all I know about him from the court record, but I promise you that if the man happened to be a heterosexual white guy, this never would have reached the Supreme Court.', 'Ames claimed that hiring a gay man over her was an instance of “reverse” discrimination. She argued that the government (and remember we’re talking about the government of the state of JD Vance’s Ohio here) discriminated against her because she is straight. She filed a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits workplace discrimination.', 'Ames had every right to sue. Anybody, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation can sue under the Civil Rights Act, because anybody can be discriminated against in certain circumstances.', 'Ohio, however, is still governed by a rather archaic rule regarding workplace discrimination lawsuits. It requires people who are in the “majority” group (white people generally, or straight people in this case) to show that there are “background circumstances” at their place of work that suggest a pattern of discrimination against them. It places a “heightened burden” of evidence on members of the majority when they bring discrimination suits.', 'I think the rule makes sense. No matter what Stephen Miller or Chris Rufo tell you, white people have not been historically discriminated against in this country, and they are not now. Neither are straight people. It’s not too much to ask people in the majority to meet a heightened evidentiary standard before claiming that, all of a sudden, everybody hates them. They still can bring a claim, and win, but they should be forced to show something more than “OMG, they hired a gay man, a gay man, can you believe it? I am a victim of the gay agenda.”', 'Of course, I’m not white, and I’m not homophobic. Asking straight white people to acknowledge that they’ve had every advantage this world has to offer is not something we are allowed to do in this country. Instead, we live in a world where every time a white person doesn’t get something they think they’re entitled to, we’re supposed to assume they’ve been treated unfairly.', 'I did not expect the Supreme Court to buck the prevailing trend in this case. I predicted that this case would come down 9–0 in favor of Ames, as it has. At oral arguments, the conservatives were predictably incensed at the notion that white people should have to meet a heightened standard because of their privilege and power in this society, while the liberals were suspiciously silent.', 'In her unanimous opinion for the court, Justice Jackson analyzed the case in a conservative, textualist manner. She said (correctly) that Title VII makes no mention of special burdens or heightened standards based on one’s classification as a “majority” person. Congress could have written Title VII to include a heightened burden for white folks, but it didn’t. It could have amended Title VII to include an additional burden if it felt “reverse” discrimination claims were getting out of hand, but it hasn’t.', 'Jackson further argued (again, correctly) that the Supreme Court’s own interpretation of Title VII rejects the notion that its standards should change based on the race, gender, or sexual orientation of the litigants. Her reasoning in Ames is similar to Justice Neil Gorsuch’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, where Gorsuch ruled, over the objection of his conservative colleagues, that Title VII’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination includes a prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation.', 'If Jackson is right and the unanimous court is right and I agree that they’re right, then why am I so salty about the opinion? Well, it’s because I know what’s coming next. Reverse discrimination claims are on the march. White people, emboldened by Trump, are acting like every time a non-white person is hired or promoted for any job, anti-white discrimination is the culprit. Flooding the courts with reverse discrimination claims is literally part of the Project 2025 playbook. Straight white guys I know and am friends with have confessed that they at least wonder if anti-white discrimination played a role when they don’t get a job or a promotion. None of the white guys I know would actually sue over it (at least, they better not), but I’m not friends with a lot of white guys.', 'JEET HEER', 'ELIE MYSTAL', 'CHRIS LEHMANN', 'BOOKS & THE ARTS / ERIN SCHWARTZ', 'The 9–0 opinion in this case is like hanging an “Open for Grievances” sign on every federal courthouse. We’re going to be inundated with this stuff, and most of these people will have nothing more than the fact that they, a white person, didn’t get what they wanted.', 'I’m not saying the liberals on the court should have considered all that while deliberating this case. I probably wouldn’t have if I were on the court. Even though I like the Ohio rule, it’s clearly at odds with the text and modern interpretation of Title VII. It would be very Republican of me to expect the justices to abandon key and obvious legal principles just to achieve a desired cultural effect.', 'But, I’m not on the court, so I still get to be pissy about this one.

Honickman) was nearly so, with Justice Jackson concurring in all but one part of the majority.', 'Perhaps more remarkable, at least to those who view the Court only through a political lens, is that each of the three majority opinions by the liberal justices reached a result that would be politically coded as conservative. These three cases weren’t trivial: SCOTUSblog identified them among the eight remaining cases that it classified as “major cases.”', 'These rulings provide occasion to posit the very modest proposition that, for all of my many disagreements with and criticisms of the three liberal justices, they are much more principled than the Court’s MAGA critics are.

As Justice Jackson notes, five courts of appeals had “held or suggested that majority-group plaintiffs must satisfy a heightened burden to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment under Title VII.” Justice Jackson’s admirably concise opinion relies on text and precedent to conclude that “Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements onmajority-group plaintiffs alone.”', 'In Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. v.

Indeed, according to the Mexican government, as many as 90 percent of the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico originated in the United States.', ""The Mexican government's lawsuit, which sought billions of dollars in damages, alleged that U.S. gun manufacturers failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent this gun trafficking, which they knew was going on."", ""But the court didn't buy that argument. As Kagan said in court on Thursday, the Mexican government might have had a good theory, but U.S cities brought similar suits in the early 2000s, and Congress promptly passed a law shielding gun manufacturers from lawsuits stemming from the criminal use of a firearm by a third party."", 'The law does have an exception for cases in which a manufacturer or seller knowingly aids and abets criminal sales.

The state had maintained that the social ministry group didn't qualify for the exemption because it is not a proselytizing entity."", 'Writing for the court today, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said: ""It is fundamental to our constitutional order that the government maintain \'neutrality between religion and religion.""', '""There may be hard calls to make in policing that rule,"" she acknowledged, ""but this is not one of them.""', 'Reacting to the decision, Eric Rassbach, who represented the Catholic Charities Bureau, said, ""Wisconsin shouldn\'t have picked this fight in the first place. It was always absurd to claim that Catholic Charities wasn\'t religious because it helps everyone, no matter their religion.""', ""The Catholic Charities victory caps a remarkable run of victories for religious entities at the Supreme Court, nearly 20 wins going back to Donald Trump's first term."", ""At the same time, however, Thursday's decision could open the door to large numbers of religious groups, some of them employing tens of thousands of people, fleeing and weakening the unemployment compensation system, which at one time was mandatory in Wisconsin and other states."", 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9ObFUwUTJOMlRqbHlUWG93VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdEpZek9tUW8=-w280-h168-p-df

Ames, who is straight, alleged that she had been discriminated against by gay superiors.', 'Ames started working at the agency that oversees juvenile corrections in 2004 and, after a decade, she had moved up the ranks from the role of an executive secretary to program administrator. When a bureau chief position opened up at the department in 2019, she applied.', 'Just a year earlier, Ames underwent a performance evaluation by her boss, a gay woman. Her boss found Ames mostly met expectations but rarely exceeded them. According to court records, there were concerns that Ames lacked the “vision” and leadership skills required for the bureau chief role.', 'Ames was passed over for the promotion and then demoted to another role that paid less than she had previously been earning. According to Ames, this wasn’t due to her performance but because she was straight. The agency said it passed on Ames because of concerns over her leadership abilities and that, historically, she had been “abrasive and not collaborative” though her work ethic was considered strong.', 'When she sued for discrimination based on her sexual orientation, Ames noted that the person who evaluated her was gay and so was the person who got the promotion she had applied for. The individual who actually made the hiring decision for that position, however, was straight.', 'Initially, a federal district court in Ohio tossed Ames’ lawsuit, finding she had failed to prove there was a pattern of discrimination by gay people at the department against straight people.', 'As a heterosexual, the courts consider Ames part of a majority group, as opposed to people who are part of a protected class. Protected classes cover a person’s sex, sexual orientation, age, ancestry, color, religion and more. But for a person in the majority to successfully sue for discrimination, some courts — not all — require evidence of “background circumstances” to support their claim.', 'Background circumstances must show that the person or people outside the majority are engaged in an unusual pattern of discrimination against the majority. Ames never proved that pattern, according to the district court, and when she appealed, judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit didn’t think she had proved it either. (Currently, only a handful of circuits require background circumstances, including the 6th Circuit; others, like the uber-conservative 5th Circuit, don’t apply the standard at all. And notably, the background circumstances rule has also been rejected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission itself, the very body that oversees enforcement of laws that make discrimination illegal.)', 'When Ames’ lawyers came to the Supreme Court in February and asked the high court to reverse the 6th Circuit’s decisions, the justices seemed to signal how they would rule, as they asked questions about the fairness of requiring more burden of proof for one group of people versus another when they are suing for discrimination.', '“For most plaintiffs,” Justice Jackson wrote, the initial steps they must take to provide a burden of proof “is not onerous.”', '“A plaintiff may satisfy it simply by presenting evidence ‘that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.’ But, under Sixth Circuit precedent, plaintiffs who are members of a majority group bear an additional burden at step one: They must also establish ‘background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.’”', 'The Sixth Circuit’s “background circumstances” rule, the justice added, can’t “be squared with the text of Title VII or our longstanding precedents.”', '“And nothing Ohio has said, in its brief or at oral argument, persuades us otherwise,” she wrote.', 'In the concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the “background circumstances rule also highlights how judge-made doctrines can be difficult for courts to apply.”', '“Because courts lack an underlying legal authority on which to ground their analysis, there is no principled way to resolve doctrinal ambiguities. The ‘background circumstances’ rule suffers from this flaw. A number of courts have described the rule as ‘vague and ill-defined,’” he wrote, citing a series of rulings in reverse discrimination from years past. “Most notably, the ‘background circumstances’ rule requires courts to perform the difficult — if not impossible — task of deciding whether a particular plaintiff qualifies as a member of the so-called ‘majority.’”', 'Thomas continued: “How a court defines the boundaries of a population can affect whether a particular person falls into a majority or minority group. Women, for example, make up the majority in the United States as a whole, but not in some States and counties.”', 'When trying to define the majority in terms of race, it becomes “even more difficult,” Thomas wrote, noting the growth of “multicultural families” throughout the U.S.', 'Attempts to “divide us all up into a handful of groups have only become more incoherent with time,” Thomas wrote, quoting directly from Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 2023 decision for Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. Presidents and Fellows of Harvard College.

The Supreme Court this week made it easier for members of so-called “majority groups” to sue for discrimination by siding with an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she twice lost jobs to lesser-qualified gay candidates because she is straight.', 'Federal civil rights law does not distinguish between members of majority and minority groups, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in the unanimous decision striking down the standard used in nearly half of federal circuit courts.', 'Legal experts say the closely watched ruling could spur more reverse discrimination complaints at a moment when workplace diversity equity and inclusion programs are already under threat from the Trump administration.', ""“The ruling certainly puts employers on notice that discrimination against ‘majority’ employees is just as unlawful as discrimination against minority employees,” said William Jacobson, Cornell University law professor and founder of the Equal Protection Project, an advocacy group that opposes race-based policies. “There is no safe haven or carve-out for so-called 'reverse discrimination.’”"", 'Employers will have to change how they approach discrimination claims, said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management. While the rules were enforced equally, the level of response was often different based on who brought a bias claim, he said.

Supreme Court rules for straight woman who claims she was subjected to reverse discrimination ,https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/06/supreme-court-rules-for-straight-woman-who-claims-she-was-subjected-to-reverse-discrimination/,"['The Supreme Court on Thursday sent the case of an Ohio woman who contends that she was the victim of reverse discrimination back to the lower courts. In a unanimous ruling by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the justices agreed that a federal appeals court in Cincinnati was wrong to impose a higher bar for the case brought by Marlean Ames to move forward than if Ames had been a member of a minority group. ', 'Ames had worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for 15 years, starting as an executive secretary in 2004 and eventually becoming a program administrator. In her 2018 performance evaluation, Ames’s new supervisor, who is gay, indicated that Ames met expectations in 10 categories and exceeded them in an 11th. ', 'The dispute began in 2019, when Ames applied for a new position within the department. Not only did she not get that job, but she was also demoted to a previous position, where her hourly salary was just over half of what she had previously been making. ', 'Ames filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that she had been the victim of employment discrimination based on her sexual orientation. The department had hired a lesbian for the position that she had sought, she contended, as well as a gay man to replace her after she was demoted. ', 'The United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit threw out Ames’s sexual orientation claim. Because Ames is straight, the court of appeals explained, her claim could not go forward unless she could show “background circumstances” to support her allegations of reverse discrimination – for example, evidence that a member of a minority group made the allegedly discriminatory decision or showing a pattern of discrimination against members of a majority group. But in this case, the court of appeals emphasized, the department officials who actually made the hiring and demotion decisions were straight, and there was no “pattern” of reverse discrimination. ', 'In a nine-page decision on Thursday, the court revived Ames’s claim and sent the case back to the lower court for another look under the proper standard. Federal employment discrimination law, Jackson explained, prohibits intentional discrimination based on “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” ', 'The Supreme Court has outlined a three-step test for discrimination claims. At the first step – the one at issue in Ames’s case – a plaintiff must produce enough evidence to support an inference that the employer intended to discriminate. This is generally, Jackson wrote, not a high bar: “A plaintiff may satisfy it simply by presenting evidence ‘that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.’” But the court of appeals in this case, Jackson continued, incorrectly added an additional requirement, directing Ames to “establish ‘background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.’” ', 'The 6th Circuit’s rule, Jackson wrote, is inconsistent with the text of the federal employment discrimination law, which bars discrimination against everyone – without distinguishing between members of a minority group and members of a majority group. “By establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’—without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.” ', 'The Supreme Court’s cases, Jackson added, also make clear that the test for showing discrimination in a case like Ames’s “does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group.” “The ‘background circumstances’ rule flouts that basic principle,” she concluded. ', 'Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion that was joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Thomas suggested that the three-step test that the court has developed to use in discrimination claims – known as the McDonnell Douglas framework – “lacks any basis in the text of” federal employment discrimination law “and has proved difficult for courts to apply.” “In a case where the parties ask us to do so,” he concluded, he “would be willing to consider” overruling it.

A plaintiff might meet that requirement, for instance, by providing statistical evidence documenting a pattern of discrimination against members of a majority. Ames couldn’t do that and so she lost in the lower courts.', 'But Jackson said the Supreme Court’s past cases made clear that the requirements needed to bring a successful lawsuit under federal anti-discrimination law “do not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group.”', 'The “background circumstances” rule, Jackson wrote, “flouts that basic principle.”', 'Ames started working for Ohio’s state government in 2004 and steadily rose through the ranks at the Department of Youth Services.

But neither federal anti-discrimination law nor Supreme Court precedent speak to creating one set of requirements for a majority employee to file a discrimination suit and a different set for a minority employee. During oral arguments in the case in late February, it was clear Ames had widespread support from the justices.', 'Citing the “background circumstances” requirement, the Cincinnati-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Ohio. Federal appeals courts based in Denver, St. Louis, Chicago and Washington, DC, applied that same standard, according to court records.', 'The decision doesn’t necessarily mean that Ames – or other employees – will ultimately win their lawsuits. Rather, it wipes out a hurdle in such cases that barred some plaintiffs from demonstrating employers acted with discriminatory motive.', '“We wanted to make sure that the same laws and standards apply to everyone,” Xiao Wang, who represented Ames and who is the director of the University of Virginia School of Law Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, told CNN. “This Supreme Court ruling makes it easier for courts to root out unlawful discrimination in the workplace.”', 'Justice Clarence Thomas, a member of the court’s conservative wing, joined the majority but also wrote a separate concurrence to argue against what he described as “judge-made” doctrines. In a footnote in that opinion, Thomas slammed employers and for being “obsessed” with DEI initiatives.', '“A number of this nation’s largest and most prestigious employers have overtly discriminated against those they deem members of so-called majority groups,” Thomas wrote.', '“American employers have long been ‘obsessed’ with ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ initiatives and affirmative action plans,” he added.', '“Initiatives of this kind have often led to overt discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority,” he said.', 'Thomas’ argument was that the justification for the background circumstances requirement – that employers don’t usually discriminate against members of a majority group – is faulty. But his decision to go after DEI directly comes at a moment when Trump has sought to politicize workplace diversity efforts.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nSupreme Court shuts down Mexico’s lawsuit against American gunmakers', 'The case landed on the Supreme Court’s docket last fall, about a month before Trump was elected on a pledge to clamp down on diversity and inclusion efforts in both the government and the private sector. The administration has taken a number of steps in that direction, including attempting to cut funding to entities federal officials allege have supported DEI efforts. Many of those actions are being reviewed by courts.', 'But Ames’ case was more procedural.

It involved a clearly illegal “background circumstances” rule. This rule imposes a slightly higher burden on members of majority groups — such as white people, straight people, or Christians — who allege workplace discrimination compared to members of minority groups who bring similar claims.', 'Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.', 'As Jackson writes in her opinion, this disparate treatment of majority-group plaintiffs is not allowed. She quotes the Supreme Court’s opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. (1976), which held that the federal law governing employment discrimination prohibits “racial discrimination in private employment against whites on the same terms as racial discrimination against nonwhites.”', 'The plaintiff in Ames alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than race.
