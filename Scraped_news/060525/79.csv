Measles Is Now Showing Up in Wastewater,https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-now-showing-wastewater-155809456.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Credit - Getty Images', 'Measles cases in the U.S. have been rare in recent decades, thanks to a strong childhood vaccination program. But a few cases inevitably pop up each year as travelers bring the virus in from other countries and infect unvaccinated people, primarily children.', 'Those cases are no longer blips. Now that the measles vaccination rate is dropping precipitously across the U.S.—due in part to anti-vaccine sentiments—cases are rising. So far in 2025, 14 outbreaks have been reported in 33 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (By comparison, in 2024, there were just 16 outbreaks reported during the entire year.)', 'Scientists may now have a new way to catch cases. For the first time, researchers have posted national information on where the measles virus is showing up in wastewater.', ""Wastewater surveillance is a useful public-health tool because it provides an objective glimpse into where a given virus is causing infections—often before traditional testing methods. For viruses like measles, which infected people shed in urine, feces, or saliva, it can provide a critical heads-up for health officials. “It gives us a finger-to-the-wind weather map of what is happening with infectious diseases,” says Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor at Emory and principal investigator and co-program director of WastewaterSCAN, an academic and commercial group that includes researchers from Stanford University, Emory University, and Verily (which is Alphabet Inc.'s research organization)."", ""Here's what wastewater is revealing about measles in the U.S."", 'WastewaterSCAN began testing sewage in the U.S. for the COVID-19 virus in 2020 and has since added other disease-causing microbes including influenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), norovirus, enterovirus, mpox, Candida auris, and hepatitis A.', 'This spring, the scientists began developing a test for picking up signs of the active or ""wild type"" measles virus that is causing outbreaks in the U.S. The test uses samples from nearly 150 sewage sites across the country and can pick up signs of measles within 48 hours.', 'Read More: What to Know About the New COVID-19 Variant NB.1.8.1', ""So far, they have detected it in three sites: one day in Hollywood, Md.; four days toward the end of May in Sacramento; and twice in mid-May in Stamford, Conn. WastewaterSCAN is only one such wastewater surveillance network in the country, though it's the first to test for measles on a national level. The CDC launched its National Wastewater Surveillance System in 2020 and includes more than 1,400 sites that cover 150 million Americans. Some state health departments—including in Texas, where the current measles outbreaks began—also test wastewater samples. WastewaterSCAN collaborates with the CDC, but the CDC does not yet test for measles in wastewater."", 'Doctors who see patients with measles must report the case to the CDC so the agency can track it and respond to any outbreaks. But it takes time for people to develop symptoms, seek medical care, get tested, and then have their case reported if the test is positive. In addition, the first symptoms of measles are common ones like fever, runny nose, and cough—before the telltale rash appears. Plus, not everyone may get sick enough to know they have measles, so their cases may go unreported. Still others may get sick but not have access to health care and therefore never seek medical help.', 'Read More: Measles Vaccination Rates Are Plummeting Across the U.S.', 'Wastewater monitoring bypasses those hurdles and can theoretically catch evidence of the virus much earlier. That could be especially helpful with a highly contagious disease like measles, in which one infected person can quickly spread the virus to as many as 18 others. “This is anonymous testing that combines everyone in a community,” says Wolfe. “And for measles, it’s likely that shedding [of the virus] into wastewater is happening before people necessarily recognize what they have.”', 'This type of tracking for measles is too new to know yet whether it can detect cases in a region before people start testing positive, Wolfe says. But wastewater surveillance was able to pick up signs of the COVID-19 virus days or sometimes even weeks before cases began appearing in hospitals and testing labs.', 'Over time, as more data are collected on measles, health experts can begin to look for trends and patterns, such as increases in the number of positive samples. That could help public-health departments focus resources like vaccines in areas where infections are spreading. If the number of positive samples start to decline, that information could also give them a heads up when infections are under control.', 'Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself against measles infection, and the immunization provides close to lifelong immunity. Making sure that anyone who is eligible is up to date on their measles vaccines can help them avoid infection.', 'Contact us at letters@time.com.']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNWlla3RvTTNRd2RHaE1RMWRqVFJERUF4aW5CU2dLTWdNQlZ4NA=-w280-h168-p-df

On Wednesday, Sacramento County officials announced they found the virus during routine wastewater testing.', 'The California Department of Public Health says the disease is getting more attention because cases have risen since 2023. The CDPH and the CDC recommend the vaccine to keep children from getting the disease.', '“It is widespread in many parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia,” a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health wrote in an email to ABC10. “Measles has been a major cause of childhood mortality worldwide but is preventable by immunization.”', ""California's Public Health Department noted the vaccine is covered by most health insurance plans and most health care providers."", 'For pediatrician Dr. Sunia Suhail, from the University of California, Davis Children’s Hospital, the measles vaccine is a standard recommendation for her young patients.', '“I recommend immunizations to all of my patients to help protect them against measles,” she told ABC10. “Personally at UC Davis, I haven’t run into any patients with measles, so far luckily, but I do counsel all my families about the risks of the infection and how to keep them and their kids safe.”', 'Vaccines can be scheduled at MyTurn.ca.gov or through health care providers.', ""It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids."", '“On average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,” said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. “There’s only a few viruses that even come close to that.”', 'Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.', 'The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 F, according to the CDC.', 'There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.', 'People who have had measles once can’t get it again, health officials say. ', 'It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.', 'Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea but about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.', 'Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.', 'It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”', 'The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.', '“Before a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got measles,"" Weaver said. ""But then when the vaccine came along, that was a complete game-changer and one of the most successful vaccines in the history of medicine.”', ""There is “great data” on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades."", '“Any of these outbreaks we’re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,” he said. “If we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we’re not going to see this happening in the future. And we’ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.”', 'Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.', 'Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.', 'Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.', 'Also, people with documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, the CDC added. However, those immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus — or people who don’t know which type they got — should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.', 'Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.', '“I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said.
