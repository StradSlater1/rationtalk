Belkin’S First Foray Into Gaming Gear Includes A Pretty Slick Switch 2 Charging Case,https://www.well-played.com.au/belkins-first-foray-into-gaming-gear-includes-a-pretty-slick-switch-2-charging-case/,"['', 'Belkin does what Nintendon’t', 'By', 'Published', '', 'You might know Belkin from such product categories as USB cables, power banks and phone cases, but did you know it’s now entered the world of gaming? Launching today, the brand is joining just about every other accessories manufacturer right now and vying for a slice of that sweet Nintendo Switch 2 launch pie with a range of accessories designed for the just-released new console.', 'And while typically that’s not something I’d be excited enough about to spend time on a news post, this particular range holds at least one genuinely cool bit of kit that I can see quickly becoming a favourite for those who plan on travelling or commuting with their Switch 2 – the Belkin Switch 2 Gaming Charging Case.', '', 'This carry case for the Switch 2 seems like it’s getting a lot right out of the gate. It looks slick, it’s made with nice materials, holds your game cards, it has special grooves to accommodate the Switch 2’s kickstand for quick tabletop play and even has a hidden AirTag compartment (AirTag not included) should you want some extra security for your new $700 investment. But its neatest trick is an included 10K/20W power bank that comes nestled inside its own slot in the case to keep your Switch 2 juiced up as you go.', 'Now, sticking a power bank in a portable console case might not sound revolutionary, but given the overall quality of the case and Belkin’s experience in the field (please, people, don’t buy your batteries on Temu!) I feel like it’s a pretty compelling offer. A 10K bank should theoretically get you 1.5-2 full charges of the Switch 2’s 5220mAh internal battery, so it’s a decent bit of backup – and importantly shouldn’t cause you any issues at the airport.', '', 'Having already scoped out what some of the other locally-available third parties and Nintendo itself are offering in terms of travel cases for the Switch 2, I reckon this is going to be one of the best options out there – albeit the most expensive that I’ve seen so far at AUD $99.95. It’s not the slimmest either, so it sits in a kind of middle ground between a standard handheld carry case and one of the much bigger bags that also fits a plethora of extra controllers, the dock and so on, which this one doesn’t.', 'The Gaming Charging Case isn’t the only new Switch 2 accessory that Belkin has launched today, it’s got a more compact travel case, some screen protectors, cables and even a bigger power bank debuting as well, but at the risk of this post reading even more like an advertorial I’m going to let you research the rest on your own. It’ll be interesting to see whether Belkin has success with this first step into the world of gaming or if it should stick to selling me yet another USB-C cable after I’ve lost my fifth in a row.', 'Are you picking up a Switch 2 today?

Switch 2 controllers connect to the system magnetically, after all.', 'To charge original Switch Joy-Cons, you’ll either need to connect them to an original Switch, or to accessories like the Joy-Con charging grip or Joy-Con charging stand.', 'Keep in mind that your original Switch Joy-Cons don’t have some of the functionality of Switch 2 Joy-Cons, namely mouse control and the C button used to access GameChat features.', 'Yes, and in my tests, it was just as easy as using the old Joy-Cons. Just like original Joy-Con controllers, the original Switch Pro Controller can be connected wirelessly to a Switch 2 for gameplay. It can be charged by connecting it to the Switch 2 dock via a USB cable.', 'The Switch 2 Pro Controller is nearly identical to the original Switch Pro Controller, though the new one has a C button and a pair of programmable buttons (GL and GR) built into the rear of the Switch 2 Pro Controller’s hand grips.

You can connect it to a USB port on the Switch 2 dock for four-player games of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.', 'We’ve seen reports of some users having issues connecting third-party Switch controllers, like those from manufacturer 8bitdo, to Switch 2.

Or the Mario Kart Joy-Con 2 Wheel, for that matter. No, here I'm pointing out one extra that you'll absolutely require for storage, another for keeping the console protected on the go, and the last to improve your gaming control experience."", ""I've written a separate feature on 'What the heck is microSD Express and why does the Switch 2 require it?', which is worth reading to get some background information on this new type."", ""Physically, a microSD 'EX' card is the very same size as any other microSD card.

Here’s how it works.', ""In a match between the new Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller vs the original, you'd be forgiven for getting mixed up between the two. Yes, Ninty has made some changes to the gamepad compared to the OG 2017 accessory, but playing spot the difference means getting up close and personal with the pads."", ""By rights, the new Switch 2 gamepad should be in direct succession to the best Nintendo Switch Controller throne. The original is sitting pretty at the top right now, and it could continue to do so if it now goes on to be available for less. However, it's missing a few features that help it pair better with Nintendo's latest best gaming handheld contender, and the differences might be enough to help it win out."", ""I'm personally planning on maining the original Nintendo Switch Pro Controller with the Switch 2 for now. It's been going strong for eight years now without any aging drawbacks, which is a huge testament to its build quality. That said, I've been running through the differences to weigh up whether it's worth spending $84.99 on the newbie or grabbing the OG for less while it's still around."", '', ""I won't lie, the Nintendo Switch Pro 2 Controller price tag makes me feel a little queasy. No matter which way you swing it, $84.99 / $74.99 is a lot to pay for a gamepad, especially one that doesn't really tap into premium elements. Sure, you're getting a few extras compared to the original, but extra back buttons and aesthetic differences aside, you're not getting anything revolutionary here for the money."", ""The short answer is that the original Switch Pro controller wins hands down in terms of price. However, I'm wary that Nintendo will likely discontinue the gamepad into the abyss so that its new Switch Pro controller reigns supreme. If that happens, the power (resellers) that be could start listing the accessory for more than MSRP, and in that instance, the new pad could look more appealing."", 'Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more', 'Winner: Original Switch Pro Controller', '', ""In the hands, the Switch 2 Pro Controller feels nearly identical to the original. It's not an exact replica, and it is actually slightly lighter than the OG pad at 235g, but Nintendo has more or less simply built upon its original, beautiful blueprint."", ""I'll get onto additional features, but I want to highlight that the Pro Controller 2's back buttons will enhance comfort levels for some players. Being able to map toggles at the rear means if you find discomfort in clicking the analogue sticks for some functions, or even just prefer to keep your thumbs still in Mario Kart races, you'll be able to tweak things to suit your own preferences."", ""Nintendo has also made some tweaks to its thumbsticks, as they're noticeably smoother than the original setup. You're not getting hall effect sensors, but the changes do seem to benefit movement ergonomics, therefore giving the new pad an additional slight edge."", 'Winner: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller', '', ""The new Switch 2 Pro Controller isn't exactly feature-packed compared to the original, but it does add a few extras that tie in with the new handheld. Back buttons are becoming increasingly common in even standard gamepads, and Ninty has added two to the back of its new accessory. They're even remappable, so you'll no longer have to conform to using traditional face buttons if you're accustomed to having toggles around back."", ""The other new addition is a dedicated 'C' button at the front that's used to access the new GameChat feature. If you're planning on using Nintendo's new social hub, it's going to help you instantly respond to group invites without leaving your game and help you dive into the app without heading to the home screen."", ""The old Pro Controller lacks the button, meaning you'll have to come out of your game and use the GameChat icon instead. This will be more fiddly and feel less slick, and while the idea of paying $85 just to gain that specific button feels wrong, it is the only way to fully embrace the feature."", '', ""The 'C' button isn't the only engineered inconvenience that'll tempt you to pick up a Switch 2 Pro Controller, as the OG gamepad also can't wake the handheld out of sleep mode. If you're the kind of player who likes to kick back and fire up your setup from the couch, that's going to be an upset, and sticking with the original pad means you'll need the right Joy-Con to hand to turn the system on in docked mode."", ""On a less irritating note, Nintendo has also added a 3.5mm audio jack to the Switch 2 Pro Controller - a huge win if you use a wired gaming headset with the PS5 or Xbox Series X. The original is missing the connector entirely, but that makes sense considering the OG handheld doesn't have any sort of voice chat built into its operating system."", 'Rather begrudingly, I have to give the features crown to the Switch 2 Pro Controller. While half its new abilities could have easily been added to the OG gamepad via a system update, the 3.5 headphone jack and back buttons are nice extras.', 'Winner: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller', ""Both the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller and the OG gamepad feature the same 40-hour runtime via a 1,070mAh battery. Your mileage will vary based on what you're playing, especially if you've got a lot of HD rumble going on. However, when you do eventually run out of juice, the Switch 2 Pro Controller will charge much faster thanks to its modern innards."", ""Specifically, the Switch 2 Pro Controller will fully charge in 3.5 hours versus 6 hours with the original Pro Controller. That'll make a massive difference if you're trying to prepare for big Mario Kart World sessions and need some pads juiced up fast, and sticking with the OG controllers will ultimately mean spending longer tethered to a USB cable."", ""I haven't had the chance to tear down a Switch 2 Pro Controller yet, but if it's harder to get into the back than the original, that could be a major drawback. The 2017 gamepad features an incredibly easy-to-replace battery, and if you're not fussed about charge times, you could upgrade the OG accessory with a much larger capacity."", ""Still, the enhanced charge speed means the Switch 2 Pro Controller trumps the original in the battery department. Again, it might be a winner, but I'd reflect on that MSRP and ask yourself whether the perk is worth paying extra for."", 'Winner: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller', 'Looking for more add-ons?

Heck, it's a sizable upgrade over the first Pro Controller, despite the obvious aesthetic similarities."", ""You've got the new 'GL' and 'GR' buttons, for starters. While many might not make use of these at all, the ability to map inputs to them on a per game basis is simply remarkable and may prove quite useful in the coming years.

We asked him what upgrades he thought were worth the investment with for new device. Between new controllers, carrying cases, and more, there are a few things he thinks are must-haves to ensure that your Switch 2 is at its best.', 'Right off the bat, Epstein recommends investing in the official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.

This controller will essentially replace the standard Joy-Con controllers that the device comes with (specifically when docking the Switch 2 onto your TV).', ""The Pr0 Controller is far more comfortable to use due to its larger design and button layout.

Plus, the Pro Controller's charging time is fast."", 'Your Nintendo Switch 2 already comes with 256GB of storage, but if you plan on downloading an abundance of games, you may find yourself needing more space. If you fall into this category, Epstein highly recommends getting an SD card, but not any old card will do the trick.', ""It's important to note that the Switch 2 is only compatible with microSD Express cards up to 2TB of storage. This especially comes in handy when you're storing games, screenshots, game footage, and more. Right now, Samsung has an official Nintendo microSD card that's made for the Switch 2, while SansDisk also has one that's compatible with the device."", 'The Switch 2 has some cool new features, especially when it comes to its camera. ""The Switch 2 supports some multiplayer features where you can share your screen and overlay yourself, or even put your face in the games,"" Epstein says.', ""While he recommends Nintendo's first-party camera, he has confirmed with reps of the brand that technically any USB-C webcam will do."", 'Just like it\'s predecessor, the Switch 2\'s biggest appeal is being able to play games on the go. That being said, Epstein highly recommends getting a protective carrying case so you can safely transport it. ""The Switch 2 has a big screen and you don\'t want to let it get scratched, so it\'s smart to put it in a case when it\'s in your bag,"" Epstein says.', ""While there's a Nintendo-certified case you can grab right now, there are also plenty of alternative options available on Amazon that are sleek, protective, and far more affordable."", 'Josiah is the Digital Content Producer for the commerce team at Popular Mechanics, Best Products, Runner’s World, and Bicycling Magazine.

Nintendo Switch 2 Gear Guide: Over 100 Third-Party Accessories In One Place,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gear-guide-over-100-third-party-accessories-in-one-place/1100-6531965/,"['GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.', ""From officially licensed Hori accessories to Walmart-branded budget gear, there's no shortage of third-party Switch 2 cases, grips, controllers, chargers, and more."", 'By Steven Petite on June 2, 2025 at 2:45PM PDT', 'Get the latest gaming news, reviews, and deals sent to your inbox Monday to Friday.', ""When the Nintendo Switch 2 launches this Thursday, it will be joined by a lineup of about 10 first-party accessories. While a few of those accessories, namely the Joy-Con 2 and Switch 2 Pro Controllers, have features you won't find in other gear, most of Nintendo's optional accessories have comparable, cheaper alternatives from third-party manufacturers. And there are categories of accessories, such as ergonomic grip cases, that are only available from third-party manufacturers. There's an almost overwhelming number of Nintendo Switch 2 carrying cases, screen protectors, grips, and more accessories up for grabs already. To help make shopping for Switch 2 gear easier, we dug through Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, GameStop, and more stores to collect all of the notable products we found in one place."", 'Keep in mind that current Switch owners likely already own at least a few compatible accessories, as the Switch 2 is backward compatible with first-party and many third-party controllers, headsets, and more. If your accessory connects via Bluetooth or USB, it should work with Switch 2. That said, form-fitting carrying cases, screen protectors, grips--basically any accessory that touches the console besides thumbstick caps--will need to be replaced.', 'While this guide focuses on third-party Switch 2 accessories, we also have a Switch 2 launch week restock guide for those in the market for the console and sold-out first-party accessories.', ""Let's kick things off with Amazon, because the Nintendo Switch 2 situation at the biggest online retailer in the US is unique. Amazon easily has the widest variety of Nintendo Switch 2 accessories. At the same time, the retailer does not have the Switch 2 console, first-party games, or Nintendo-made accessories. Amazon hasn't carried Nintendo gaming products for over a year, so any first-party hardware found on the retailer's US storefront, for now at least, will be sold by a third-party reseller. Amazon does, however, carry officially licensed third-party accessories like this Mario Kart World-themed carrying case."", ""Below, you'll find hubs for Nintendo Switch 2 accessories at Amazon from popular brands such as RDS Industries, JSAUX, Skull & Co., Hori, Spigen, and Tomtoc. We also curated hubs for screen protectors, racing wheel attachments, microSD Express Cards, and more. We'll go into more detail on each of these brands and product categories below, but if you're looking to shop for Switch 2 accessories at Amazon, the list below is a good place to start."", ""Other major retailers, such as Walmart and Best Buy, have far fewer products to choose from on the accessory front. However, their lineups include Nintendo-made products, as well as better availability of officially licensed third-party gear from Hori and PowerA. You'll also find accessories from brands owned by particular retailers, including an assortment of very cheap gear from Walmart's Onn brand."", ""RDS Industries was responsible for some of the Nintendo Switch's marquee themed cases for the original Switch's launch back in 2017, and now the officially licensed manufacturer has a Mario Kart World-themed version of its signature Game Traveler Deluxe Carrying Case. Available to preorder now for $25 at Amazon, the hardshell carrying case features a recessed design that provides a snug fit while also offering room for 12 game cards and four microSD Express cards. It comes with a cleaning cloth and has a red zipper with the Mario logo."", 'RDS Industries also has a standard black edition of the Game Traveler Deluxe as well as larger-sized options and two crossbody bags.', ""Frequent Nintendo collaborator Hori is the third-party manufacturer with the most officially licensed Switch 2 accessories at this time. It's also responsible for one of the most popular third-party accessories we've seen since Switch 2 preorders opened: the Piranha Plant Camera. The Super Mario-inspired camera for GameChat is limited to 480p resolution, which is inferior to the official 1080p Nintendo Camera in terms of video quality. Still, that hasn't stopped the Piranha Plant from chomping into enough wallets to sell out at multiple retailers."", ""Hori is also releasing a smaller camera designed with portability in mind; this $60 camera has a removable stand and can be used like a USB-C dongle in handheld mode. Another notable Hori accessory is the $40 Horipad Turbo Wired Controller, which is one of only a few controllers with Nintendo's new C button for GameChat."", ""Here's a full list of Hori's Nintendo Switch 2 accessories. Release dates have shifted around multiple times, but everything is expected to launch before the end of June."", ""PowerA regularly releases officially licensed controllers and other accessories themed around popular Nintendo franchises. As such, it's not surprising that PowerA is behind the first couple of franchise-themed Switch 2 controllers. A pair of Super Mario-inspired wired controllers will launch in the coming weeks for $40 each. The Mario Time Switch 2 Controller features Super Mario hopping through a side-scrolling stage, while the Mushroom Kingdom design has graphics of a bunch of major characters from the series. These controllers are part of PowerA's Advantage series and feature two remappable back buttons, as well as the new C button for GameChat--something you will only find on officially licensed third-party Switch 2 controllers. PowerA also has a sleek gray travel case with the Switch 2 logo for only $20."", 'JSAUX is a popular brand for budget-friendly Steam Deck carrying cases, grips, docking stations, and more. The manufacturer has used that experience to craft a fairly robust lineup of accessories for the Switch 2 launch. Perhaps the most notable pieces of JSAUX Switch 2 gear at Amazon are the ergonomic grips and protective console shells. The ergonomic grips are up for grabs for as low as $13, while a three-piece dockable shell set--which protects the console and each Joy-Con 2 Controller--is available for only $17. You can also grab a pair of racing wheel attachments for less than $15 and a few different styles of carrying cases for under $20.', ""The Nintendo Switch 2's microSD reader is only compatible with Express cards. The Express technology is still in its early days, so there aren't many options to pick from, and restocks of some cards can sell out in hours or even minutes. That said, the officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card is in stock for $60 at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop. If you want a cheaper 256GB option or a card with more storage space, you should check out the Walmart-owned Onn brand. You can get a 512GB Onn microSD Express Card for $65.77. The 256GB model is only $35.77."", 'Dbrand Killswitch Grip Case for Nintendo Switch 2', 'Starts at $60 | Releases in June', 'Satisfye ZenGrip 2 for Nintendo Switch 2', '$50 for Grip | $70 for Grip + Case | Releases Summer 2025', ""Dbrand's popular Killswitch grip for Steam Deck is my personal favorite, especially in terms of customization and build quality. The Switch 2 Killswitch looks to be the most versatile in Dbrand's lineup. For $60, you'll get a package containing a three-piece grip--the Joy-Con 2 Controllers can be detached while the grips are on them--a console skin, and a USB-C dock adapter with 4K 60fps passthrough. The adapter allows you to dock your console for TV mode without removing the grip. You can add a front travel cover to the Killswitch and thumbstick grips by purchasing the $80 (was $100) bundle. The travel cover allows the Killswitch to fully replace a traditional carrying case. A $100 (was $135) bundle adds a game card holder and a pair of tempered glass screen protectors. Preorders for the Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch opened on June 2."", ""Satisfye's ZenGrip 2 has the same basic goal: Improve ergonomics in handheld mode. With the ZenGrip 2, you simply slide the console into the grip and you're ready to go. While it doesn't offer the same robust protection on all sides, you won't need an adapter to dock your Switch 2 like normal. It also has a built-in stand while retaining support for the Switch 2's kickstand. There are two game card slots on the back of the handles, and you'll have access to all ports while using it. Since it has a one-piece design, you'll need to remove the Switch 2 from the grip to use single Joy-Con controllers. I've tested Satisfye grips for Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck, and I've always had great experiences. Satisfye makes premium grips that are both durable and comfy. ZenGrip 2 preorders are available for $50 or for $70 in a bundle with a custom hardshell carrying case."", ""While we're on the subject of ergonomic grips, it makes sense to mention Skull & Co. The third-party accessory manufacturer, which designed one of our favorite grips for the original Switch, has now released a similar model for the Switch 2. In terms of price, the NeoGrip falls between JSAUX and Dbrand/Satisfye at $30. The NeoGrip features three pairs of handles of varying sizes/shapes, allowing users to customize the grip to fit their preferences. The NeoGrip is also available in a bundle with Skull & Co.'s Maxcarry Case for $50."", ""Skull & Co. also has a more budget-friendly StandGrip and various grip caps for analog sticks and buttons. The most interesting of the bunch are the $10 button cap sets that include four-way and eight-way D-pad covers. Like the original console, the Switch 2 Joy-Con Controllers lack a traditional D-pad, so we're keen to try out these attachable accessories to see how well they work."", ""Tomtoc's hardshell carrying case is one of the most expensive options on this list, but for those who favor slim designs, Tomtoc's form-fitting cases are hard to beat. Tomtoc also has a stylish Crossbody Sling Bag and a Shoulder Bag that can be used in tandem with the carrying case."", ""When browsing the Nintendo Switch 2 store pages at Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop, you'll find a variety of accessories you won't find anywhere else. The GameStop gear has GameStop branding, whereas Walmart used its tech subsidiary Onn for its Switch 2 accessory branding. Best Buy has accessories from a company called NEXT. We're unsure if Best Buy owns this company, but it is the only retailer carrying these accessories."", 'Walmart has a selection of extremely affordable Switch 2 accessories through its budget tech brand Onn. The highlights include a $20 wired controller with two back buttons, $12 soft carrying pouch, and cheap microSD Express Cards that have sold out numerous times already. The 512GB model is only $65.77, and the 256GB model is just $35.77.', ""All of the products listed below are manufactured by the budget-friendly brand NEXT. There are a few interesting options here, including the Joy-Con 2 Quad Charging Station for $27, Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip for $23, and a combo pack with wall and car chargers for $32. There's also the Ultimate Switch 2 Starter Kit, which comes with a carrying case, car charger, game card case, and more for $44."", ""The prices for GameStop's branded gear are, in general, not all that appealing. Most of the accessories on the list below initially had lower prices before GameStop increased them. The Deluxe Carry Case, shown above, is perhaps the most reasonable of the bunch, as it offers the same basic functionality as Nintendo's $85 All-in-One Carrying Case for $50 less."", 'Just make sure to read each listing carefully, as a few of the accessories have unexpected restrictions. For example, GameStop\'s USB-C dongle only supports 720p video out, yet it costs $60. Then there\'s GameStop\'s ""6-in-1"" Joy-Con 2 Charging Station, which holds six controllers but can only charge two of them simultaneously.', ""If you've ever purchased a screen protector from Amazon for any device, chances are you've come across amFilm and iVoler. Both manufacturers make great tempered glass screen protectors for a wide range of electronics. If you struggle with applying screen protectors, this 2-Pack from amFilm comes with an auto-alignment kit and only costs $9."", ""Nintendo's official steering wheel attachments for the Joy-Con 2 Controllers look nice, but if you don't want to spend $25 on the pair, Amazon is flooded with third-party options. Many are from generic brands you likely haven't heard of, but JSAUX's two-pack of wheels is an interesting and budget-friendly alternative. You'll also find Joy-Con 2 attachments that add traditional controller handles for when you are playing multiplayer games with single Joy-Con 2 controls. In some cases, you can get a set of wheels and handle grips for around $20."", ""A handful of manufacturers have attempted to make attachments for the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode. The concept is intriguing, but whether these initial attempts will work remains to be seen. Below, you'll find three curated Amazon hubs for Joy-Con 2 wheels, controller grips, and mouse mode grips. We also selected a few from each category that are either popular with Amazon shoppers or look promising."", 'Joy-Con 2 Accessory Hubs Curated by GameSpot', ""We've rounded up some additional grip cases, carrying cases, and travel bags below. All of the products in both sections are sold by Amazon."", ""Spigen has several ergonomic grip cases to choose from, all of which go for $30. Meanwhile, aforementioned screen protector manufacturer iVoler has created a dockable grip case. Though it's not designed to improve ergonomics, it should prevent scratches to your console and controllers."", ""Some of the most popular Switch 2 carrying cases at Amazon are from generic brands such as Lmcpa and TZGZT. I bought the latter out of curiosity, and from a build perspective, it feels solid. Nice quality, especially at its current sub-$13 price point. Plus, it comes with two tempered screen protectors with a mounting frame. Note: I haven't actually been able to use the case with the Switch 2 yet, but I will circle back on this after launch once I've gotten hands-on experience with it."", ""8BitDo, one of the most respected third-party controller manufacturers, technically hasn't advertised its products for the Nintendo Switch 2 yet, but the Switch 2's backward compatibility means that a wide assortment of 8BitDo Switch controllers should work on the new console."", ""8BitDo released a new flagship controller for Switch earlier this year, and it's very good. This $70 controller should prove to be a formidable alternative to the Switch 2 Pro Controller. The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller features two remappable back buttons, two additional shoulder buttons, trigger locks, TMR electromagnetic sticks (which are better than Hall Effect), custom profile support, and a range of adjustable settings, including rumble and stick/trigger sensitivity. Since it supports Bluetooth, it should sync to the Switch 2 without issue. We're interested to see if the 2.4GHz USB-C dongle will work with the new console, too. Like 8BitDo's other premium Ultimate controllers, it comes with a matching charging dock."", ""8BitDo also recently revealed a leverless arcade controller for Switch and PC. Once again, it has Bluetooth support, so it should work on Switch 2 out of the box when it launches on July 15. And if you like playing Nintendo 64 games on Switch Online, the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller should be on your radar. It doesn't have a firm release date because it is scheduled to launch alongside the Analogue 3D."", 'The last product on the list below is an extremely handy accessory for Switch that I will be testing with the Switch 2 on launch day. The 8BitDo Bluetooth Adapter 2 lets you use practically any Bluetooth controller on Switch. For instance, I played Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with an Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller.

The battery’s remaining power can be checked easily using an LCD screen on the power bank itself, so users never have to guess how much charge is left.', 'The power bank can also be removed, which gives you the option to charge your Nintendo Switch 2 separately if you prefer.

Why are they selling a $450 portable console with no game-themed carrying case? Having some cute first-party Mario or Kirby accessories at launch seems like the least they could do to make up for not making the console available in atomic purple. Sure, there's only one color for Joy-Con 2 controllers, but couldn't they at least make some Joy-Con pad covers shaped like Triforces?

It felt like an exciting step for a console to try to emulate some form of keyboard and mouse controls for first-person shooter games."", ""As reviewers get their hands on the first Switch 2's, I'm feeling slightly more ambivalent about this new feature. Using the Joy-Cons as a surrogate for a wired mouse just seems too clunky for games that require speedy target acquisition, not to mention that the whole control scheme just doesn't look comfortable. If you're clasping the tiny controllers in that upright position and dragging them along a desk for a prolonged period of time, I feel like you're just asking for a nasty hand cramp."", 'My dreams of widespread FPS game adoption on the Switch 2 haven\'t been dashed quite yet, though. It turns out that you can plug a USB mouse into the new Nintendo console and use that for some games that permit mouse controls.

Why It\'s OK to Wait, and while the FOMO is most definitely real (I love my OG Switch and definitely plan to get a Switch 2 this year), I can stand to wait a bit. I have no burning desire to play any of the launch games now, the new features like mouse control don\'t float my boat (yet), and summer is starting, so I\'d rather touch some grass.', 'As Scott said: ""As good as the Switch 2\'s upgrades are, and as fun as the new Mario Kart and Donkey Kong games seem to be -- and the GameCube gaming library also seems like a blast of retro fun -- the Switch 2 is very much an iterative upgrade for now.

The Best Nintendo Switch 2 Accessories Available Now,https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories,"['After eight whole years of Nintendo’s console-handheld hybrid, its successor, the Nintendo Switch 2, is finally in our hands. While it’s an all-new system, there are some old accessories that still work with the new platform. But because of its bigger screen and the new magnetic Joy-Con, that old Switch case isn’t going to fit the new system. You’ll need a handful of new accessories to get the most out of your next-gen Switch. From finding the best grips for your Joy-Con 2 to the easiest bubble-free screen protectors to guard that shiny new display, we have you covered in this Switch 2 accessories guide.', '', 'I’ve researched the best Switch 2 accessories you can buy during this launch window based on both hands-on experience and research from some of our favorite Switch 1 accessory manufacturers. Of course, we’re still in the early days, and plenty of companies are still shipping their products to retailers as I’m writing this. Some haven’t even made them available for preorder yet, so I’ll continue to update this list over time with my favorite new accessories as I go hands-on with them over the next few months.', 'So before you rush to see what Pro Controller you should pick up on day one, let’s get up to speed on what you need to know about buying accessories for your Nintendo Switch 2. There are a few accessories that warrant their own articles because both categories come with some caveats that you need to know before buying anything for your Switch 2.', ""Bigger games with great graphical detail meant the Switch 2 needed a faster storage solution for your downloaded games. That means your old SD cards from the Switch 1 will not work here. You need to get a MicroSD Express card for the Switch 2, which is faster (and more expensive) than the basic model. We'll be updating our guide to the best MicroSD Express cards for Nintendo Switch 2 as we do more testing now that the console is out."", ""The Switch 2 may be portable, but it’s not invincible. If you’re gearing up to take Mario Kart World or Cyberpunk 2077 on the road, you’ll need to protect your console with a sturdy, reliable case. Again, your original Switch case is not going to fit your Switch 2, so you will need to purchase a new one. In addition to materials, construction, and form, I specifically made sure to look for extra features like comfort grips, game cartridge storage, bundles, and tested brands when making my suggestions. Of course, whether you want to go with a slim soft case like the one from Tomtoc or a bulkier hard case like CoBak's, you have options for your preferences."", ""Even though the Switch 2 has a built-in layer that acts as screen protector – don't peel that off – a good screen protector is non-negotiable for handheld devices. Since the launch of the original Switch, tons of companies have stepped up their game, offering new applicators, matte finishes, and kits to make sure your protector doesn’t trap dust or air bubbles when you apply it. Some are also built to take hits like a tank (though we’d never suggest testing this out yourself)."", 'I use some of these brands to protect other devices I own, like my Steam Deck and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphone, and many of the same design principles are applied across different designs, including the Switch 2. Most of these also come with extra units in case your first protector gets damaged.', 'The Switch 2 still has a standard audio jack, yet it’s the small but major secondary USB-C port that makes wireless gaming headsets even more useful. A majority of the best gaming headsets are compatible, and since Bluetooth isn’t the best idea for gaming (as was evident on the original Switch) I recommend checking out our picks for headsets that go particularly well with the Switch 2 rather than just using the earbuds you’re probably wearing right now.', 'Unless you want to stick with the packaged Joy-Con 2, you’re going to want the new Pro Controller, or one of the gamepads made in its image. Especially if you’re playing more sophisticated games that demand precise controls or need something more comfortable for long sessions, a proper controller will probably be the most beneficial accessory for your Switch 2.', 'While you could certainly use an original Pro Controller or whatever your previous gamepad of choice was, the Switch 2 brings new features to the table – notably, a 3.5mm audio jack that allows you to use a wired headset for audio and chatting in-game without being tethered to your console. You may be interested in Switch 2’s GameChat feature, and you can seamlessly go into a video and/or voice chat room with friends with the new C button. Not every new controller has it, but licensed manufacturers like PowerA do include it. Lastly, the built-in programmable back buttons on the official Pro Controller can be a game-changer, letting you map normal inputs to them, and that can improve performance or comfort across many different types of games.', 'If you’re just looking for a solid Pro-style controller, our favorite original Switch controllers will serve you well. Something like the Gulikit KK3 Max has programmable back buttons, Hall Effect sticks, high polling rate for smoother inputs, and is versatile enough to use on PC without trouble. Either way, you have plenty of great options.', 'Although it promises some ergonomic enhancements from the original Switch, the Switch 2 still won’t have fully formed grips on the new Joy-Con – the likes of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally X still have an ergonomic advantage that can help make long handheld play sessions more comfortable. But you already have ways of improving the ergonomics of the Switch 2 with a handful of attachments available now. The grips above are the best we could find for playing in handheld mode from reliable manufacturers, including ones I’ve already gone hands-on with like DBrand’s Killswitch 2 grip and case combo and the Genki Attack Vector.', 'Even though the Switch 2 ships with a central grip to attach both Joy-Con to use like a singular controller, they’re not perfect. Especially for intense games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, there are more comfortable ways to play using the Joy-Con. Some companies are even starting to offer stands to help prop up your Joy-Con in the new Mouse Mode as well, which comes in handy for navigating menus and playing games like Civilization VII. Getting a proper connecting grip can be a more cost-effective solution compared to buying an entirely new gamepad, so long as you’re happy with the inputs of the Joy-Con. And many of these options will also charge your Joy-Con while they’re in use, which is a neat little cherry on top.', 'Nintendo has stated that the Switch 2 Joy-Con could last as long as 20 hours on a full charge, which is the same amount of time as the original Joy-Con. When looking at wireless controllers nowadays, 20 hours is fairly decent, although they still go by pretty quickly compared to other wireless controller options. It’s intuitive to just reattach your Joy-Con when they’re not in use to keep them charged, but if you plan on having multiple sets ready to go at all times, it’ll be a good idea to have a charging station on-hand. For those who often host multiplayer get-togethers with the likes of Super Mario Party Jamboree’s new Jamboree TV content or Mario Kart World, a Joy-Con charging station will make your life easier. I made sure to include models that feature as many ports as possible so you never run out of charged controllers.', 'The original Switch’s battery life remains one of its weak spots depending on the game you’re playing (some drain more power than others), even after a mid-gen refresh that brought some welcome improvements. It’ll remain something you have to manage by nature of using a portable gaming device especially if you’re taking the Switch 2 on long flights, trips, or car rides. That maximum battery life of 6.5 hours won’t always hold up and looking for an outlet is less than ideal when charge times can be quite longer than something like a smartphone.', 'Being able to charge in-between sessions untethered comes in clutch more often than you may expect, so having an extra battery pack to get some extra juice can be a total game-changer. I personally love Anker’s line with built-in USB-C cables, but Magsafe options like Genki’s Energy Pack are also really enticing. Either way, make sure you check the capacity and wattage of a portable charger before purchasing one you plan to use with your Switch 2 – some might simply be overkill for what you need.', 'It feels like every new Nintendo console comes with a mountain of weird accessories. From Wii Sports-style tennis rackets to fishing rods, there’s a lot of extra and niche add-ons mixed in with the core accessories that are typically more practical. That’s not to say there aren’t some cool ideas that stretch the imagination of gaming on the Switch. Hori’s Piranha Plant camera is a fun example – while it costs $5 more than the first-party camera, it’s a fun alternative that’s can double-up as some themed decor. (Though don\'t expect it to work miracles: The camera has a pretty dismal 480p resolution.) While it’s not an ideal way to play, the steering wheel attachment can be a fun and more accessible way for younger kids to play Mario Kart World. These accessories don’t fall into the conventional categories like controllers and cases, but they’re worth considering regardless. I’ve also thrown in a couple of ""starter kits"" that make for decent one-and-done purchases that include most of what you’ll want on day one.', ""Charlie's a freelance contributor for IGN.

It has a built-in power bank that can keep the hybrid handheld juiced while it’s stowed, so you’re always fully fuelled the next time you come to play.', 'It looks like your typical carry case from the outside, but unzip if and you’ll spot the 10,000mAh power bank with enough capacity to charge a Switch 2 one and a half times. It’s got a built-in LCD screen to show how much power it has remaining before you’ll need to pop it out of the case to top up, and the included cable is malleable enough to plug into your Switch 2’s USB-C port while the case is closed. A second USB-C port means the power bank can also charge your phone or other tech.', 'Elsewhere the hard-shell carry case has a separate mesh pouch for storing cables, a hidden holder for an AirTag or other tracker, and a stitched-in game holder with (almost) more room for cards than there are launch titles.', 'Original Switch and Switch OLED owners don’t have to miss out, either; Belkin bundles a set of foam inserts in the box, which will keep the older, smaller consoles secure. The charging case is yours for $70/50, direct from Belkin and via Amazon.', 'This might be Belkin’s first foray into gaming, but starting with cases makes a lot of sense; a whopping 85% of Switch 1 owners bought a case to keep their console safe while travelling, and I’d be shocked if that number didn’t climb higher for the larger, pricier Switch 2.', 'Multi-format accessories for other consoles and mobile gamers aren’t expected any time soon, with Belkin focused firmly on the Switch 2 for now. The range also includes a more basic travel case at launch, along with a tempered glass screen protector.', ' The former won’t charge your console, but it still has a separate section for cables, a hidden AirTag holder, and a pouch for stashing a handful of game cards. The carry handle also unclips to become a wrist strap. There are no inserts for the OG switch, though – this is strictly for the new handheld only. It’s going on sale today for $30/£20.', 'The tempered glass screen protector has an anti-reflective coating that Belkin says improves outdoor visibility. You’re meant to place it over the Switch 2’s pre-installed screen film, which Nintendo has urged console owners not to remove.', 'Belkin knows fitting screen protectors can be a faff, so includes an alignment tool in the box that should prevent unsightly air bubbles. It’s made from 60% post-consumer recycled glass, and will set you back $25/£20.', ""A tech addict from about the age of three (seriously, he's got the VHS tapes to prove it), Tom's been writing about gadgets, games and everything in between for the past decade, with a slight diversion into the world of automotive in between.

From new tech to add-ons, our guide will help you decide', 'S\nince its announcement in January, anticipation has been building for the Nintendo Switch 2 – the followup to the gaming titan’s most successful home console, the 150m-selling Nintendo Switch. Major console launches are rarer than they used to be; this is the first since 2020, when Sony’s PlayStation 5 hit shelves. Whether you’re weighing up a purchase or just wondering what all the fuss is about, here’s everything you need to know.', 'The Switch 2 is out today, 5 June, priced at £395.99 (US$449.99/A$699/€469.99) or at £429.99 (US$499.99/A$766/€509,99) bundled with its flagship game, Mario Kart World. Like its predecessor, it’s a portable games machine with a built-in screen – you can use as a handheld mini-console when you’re out and about, or slide it into the dedicated dock device and plug it into your TV via an HDMI cable for a big-screen experience at home. A little bigger than the original Switch, with a crisp, clear 7.9in LCD touch screen, as opposed to the old 6.2in display, it comes with two Joy-Con controllers, which are chunkier than the previous versions. These now attach magnetically to each side of the screen with a pleasing clunk, replacing the fiddly sliding mechanism that most Switch owners disliked. They’ve also got bigger L and R buttons on the top, which sounds like a minor detail but is a huge deal for anyone trying to perfect their Mario Kart power-slides.', 'The tech inside the Switch 2 is a lot more advanced than the previous console, featuring a custom nVidia processor, and a screen capable of displaying at 4K resolution (when plugged into a compatible TV) or 1920x1080 resolution in portable mode. It’s also got 5.1 surround sound, and supports high-dynamic range lighting (HDR) graphical effects at frame rates of up to 120hz. This brings the Switch 2 almost up to scratch with other modern consoles: most experts are placing its tech specs somewhere between the PS4 and PS5, or between Xbox One and Xbox Series X.', 'The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with the console itself, two Joy-Con controllers, a power adaptor and USB-C charging cable, a dock, a Joy-Con grip (which allows you to connect the two Joy-Cons together to create a traditional-looking games controller), and two Joy-Con wrist straps to stop them flying out of your hands.', 'Nintendo is going big on the social features of the console. Its GameShare function will allow you to play compatible games with other people who don’t own a copy – they just need their own Switch or a Switch 2, and can play along in the room with you or connect online. This is particularly important for families sharing one copy of a game. Meanwhile, GameChat is kind of like Zoom, but for games: you can invite a bunch of pals into a group video chat session where you can talk to each other while playing the same game, playing different games, or just hanging out. If you all buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera you’ll be able to see little video windows of each other on the screen, too. GameChat requires a paid subscription to Nintendo’s online gaming service, which costs £17.99 (US$19.99/€19.99/A$29.95) a year or £3.49 (US$3.99/€3.99/A$5.95) a month, but is free until 31 March.', 'The console is launching with around 25 games, though many of these are enhanced versions of older Switch titles. The big newcomers are Mario Kart World, an open-world take on the classic karting game; the introductory game Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour; the co-op survival challenge Survival Kids and anti-gravity racer, Fast Fusion. Some favourites making it across are Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom. Most games will retail for between £45–£70 and will be available to buy and download online, or as physical boxed copies. You can also still play almost all your old Switch games on the new console, and there’s a huge back catalogue of retro NES, Nintendo 64, SNES and GameCube classics from the 1980s, 90s and 00s available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.', 'There are three things you may want to buy alongside the console. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller is a traditional console joypad intended for serious play. Then you have the Nintendo Switch 2 camera, basically a webcam compatible with the GameChat service, but also with any games that might use camera features. You may also want a microSD Express card to provide additional storage for your games.', 'If you haven’t pre-ordered, you may have to be patient and shop around. Some of the larger retailers including Amazon, Argos, Currys and John Lewis are saying they may have a few in stock today and it’s worth trying Nintendo’s online store. Be extremely wary of buying from private sellers on eBay or similar sites – there will be a lot of con artists out there. Remember when people found their PlayStation 5 deliveries were instead full of bags of rice?']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNURXbVpuZDJZMGEzVjVWM1JXVFJEaUFSamNBU2dLTWdPTll4SQ=-w280-h168-p-df
