He and other admitted students around the world are anxiously tracking the school’s feud with the Trump administration, which is seeking to keep it from enrolling international students.\nOn Thursday, Harvard challenged President Donald Trump’s latest move to bar foreign students from entering the US to attend the college, calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands. In an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. Last month, a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard’s certification to host foreign students.\nAdmission to Harvard, then months of uncertainty\nIncreasingly, the nation’s oldest and best-known university has attracted some of the brightest minds from around the world, with international students accounting for one-quarter of its enrollment. As Harvard’s fight with the administration plays out, foreign students can only wait to find out if they’ll be able to attend the school at all. Some are weighing other options.\nFor Nuguse, 21, the war in Ethiopia forced schools to close in many parts of the province. After schooling resumed, he then took a gap year to study and save money to pay for his TOEFL English proficiency test in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.\n“The war affected me a great deal and when I found out the news that I was accepted to Harvard, I was ecstatic. I knew it was a proud moment for my family, teachers, mentors and friends, who were instrumental in my achievement,” he said.\nThe following months have been filled with uncertainty. On Wednesday, Trump signed a directive seeking to block US entry for Harvard’s international students, which would block thousands who are scheduled to come to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for summer and fall terms.\nHarvard’s court challenge a day later attacked Trump’s legal justification for the action — a federal law allowing him to block a “class of aliens” deemed detrimental to the nation’s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the US to study at Harvard doesn’t qualify as a “class of aliens,” Harvard said in its filing.\n“The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” the university wrote.\nIn the meantime, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni.\n“Each of us is part of a truly global university community,” Garber said Thursday. “We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.”\nCrackdown on international students affects interest in the US\nThe standoff with Harvard comes as the administration has been tightening scrutiny of student visas nationwide. Thousands of students around the country abruptly lost permission to be in the US this spring before the administration reversed itself, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week the US would “aggressively revoke” visas for students from China.\nWhile many admitted students say they’re waiting to find out if they can come to the US, prospective students still in high school are starting to look elsewhere, said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services.\n“It is one blow after another,” said Henniger, who works with colleges in the US, Canada and Europe to recruit international students. “At this point, international student interest in the US has basically dropped to nil.”\nThe future of Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students has been hanging in the balance since the Department of Homeland Security first moved to block its foreign enrollment on May 22.\nFor many, the twists and turns have been exhausting. Jing, a 23-year-old master’s student, is currently completing an internship in China this summer, and unsure if he can reenter the US for the fall semester.\n“It is tiring, we all feel numb now. Trump just makes big news headlines once every few days since he got back to the White House,” said Jing, who agreed to speak under his family name out of concern about retaliation from the Trump administration.\nJing said he is going to watch and see what happens for now, in case the move against international students is a negotiating tactic that does not stick.\nThe possibility that Trump could block foreign enrollment at other colleges only raises the uncertainty for students planning to pursue their education overseas, said Craig Riggs, who has been working in international education for about 30 years and is the editor of ICEF Monitor. He said he urges families to consult carefully with advisers and not to overreact to the day’s headlines.\n“The rules under which students would make this huge decision to devote years of their lives and quite a bit of money to studying at Harvard have been shown to change quite quickly,” Riggs said.\nAn aspiring economist, Nuguse was the only student accepted to Harvard this year from Kalamino Special High School, which caters to gifted students from underprivileged backgrounds from across Tigray.\nAfter receiving acceptances also to Columbia University and Amherst College, Nuguse chose Harvard, which he had long dreamed of attending. He said he hopes it will work out to attend Harvard.\nNuguse was granted a visa to study at Harvard, and he worries it might be too late to reverse his decision and attend another university anyway. He received an email from Harvard last week, telling him to proceed with his registration and highlighting a judge’s order in Harvard’s favor in the dispute over foreign enrollment.\n“I hope the situation is temporary and I can enroll on time to go on and realize my dream far from reality in Ethiopia,” he said.', 'WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Thursday that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace, even as Germany’s new chancellor appealed to him as the “key person in the world” who could halt the bloodshed by pressuring Vladimir Putin.\nIn an Oval Office meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the US president likened the war in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in February 2022 — to a fight between two children who hate each other. Trump said that with children, “sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” adding that he relayed the analogy to Putin in a call this week.\n“I said, ‘President, maybe you’re going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot,’ because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart, before they’re able to be pulled apart,” Trump said. “You see in hockey, you see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds, let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”', '', ' ', 'The comments were a remarkable detour from Trump’s often-stated appeals to stop the violence in Ukraine — and he again denounced the bloodshed Thursday even as he floated the possibility that the two countries should continue the war for a time. Merz carefully sidestepped Trump’s assertions and emphasized that the US and Germany both agree on “how terrible this war is,” while making sure to lay blame squarely on Putin for the violence and make the point that Germany was siding with Ukraine.\n“We are both looking for ways to stop it very soon,” Merz said in the Oval Office. “I told the president before we came in that he is the key person in the world who can really do that now by putting pressure on Russia.”\nThursday’s meeting was the first time the two leaders sat down in person, and Merz left the public portion unscathed as he successfully avoided the kind of made-for-TV confrontation in the Oval Office that befell other world leaders such as Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky and Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa. Trump and Merz began by exchanging pleasantries — Merz gave Trump a gold-framed birth certificate of the US president’s grandfather Friedrich Trump, who emigrated to America from Kallstadt, Germany, and Trump called the chancellor a “very good man to deal with.”', '', ' ', '“He’s difficult, I would say? Can I say that? It’s a positive. You wouldn’t want me to say you’re easy, right?” Trump said, gently ribbing Merz. “He’s a very great representative of Germany.”\nMerz told German reporters after the White House meeting that he had invited Trump to visit Germany, “his home country,” and added that the two leaders “get along well on the personal level.”\nTrump and Merz had previously spoken several times by phone since Merz took office on May 6. German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship. Merz avoided the antagonism that defined Trump’s relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in the Republican president’s first term.\nMerz emphasizes Ukraine support\nThe 69-year-old Merz — who came to office with an extensive business background — is a conservative former rival of Merkel’s who took over her party after she retired from politics.\nMerz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelensky in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.\nOn Thursday, Trump also kept the threat of sanctions on the table — but for both Russia and Ukraine. He said he has not looked at bipartisan Senate legislation that would impose harsh economic punishments on Moscow, but said of sanctions efforts that “they would be guided by me,” rather than Capitol Hill.\n“When I see the moment where it’s not going to stop ... we’ll be very, very tough,” Trump said. “And it could be on both countries, to be honest. It takes two to tango.”\nFor Merz’s part, he used Friday’s anniversary of D-Day — when Allied forces launched an assault that began the liberation of Europe from German occupation — to appeal to Trump to help lead the ending of another violent war on the continent.\nMerz noted that June 6, 1944, began the liberation of Germany from a Nazi dictator and that “American is again in a very strong position to so something on this war and ending this war.”\n“That was not a pleasant day for you?” Trump interjected to the German leader when he referenced D-Day.', 'At home, Merz’s government is intensifying a drive that his immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, began to bolster the German military after Russia invaded Ukraine. In Trump’s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5 percent from allies.\nAhead of Thursday’s meeting, a White House official said the administration planned to stress to Germany that it should increase its defense spending and that the upcoming NATO summit in The Netherlands was a good opportunity to commit to Trump’s 5 percent pledge. But during an exchange with reporters, Trump praised Berlin: “I know that you’re spending more money on defense now and quite a bit more money. That’s a positive thing.”\nScholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany’s armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2 percent target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027. Merz has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5 percent of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5 percent on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.\nTariff trouble\nAnother top priority for Merz is to get Germany’s economy, Europe’s biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump’s tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.\nGermany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the US last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the US sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.\n“Germany is one of the very big investors in America,” Merz told German reporters Thursday morning ahead of his visit with Trump. “Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.”\nThe US president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the US Trump’s 25 percent tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles.\nThere’s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs “benefit no one and damage everyone” while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union’s executive commission. Trump hinted at that Thursday, saying the trade situation will mostly depend on the negotiations with the 27-country bloc.\n“We’ll end up hopefully with a trade deal,” Trump said. “Or we’ll do something. We’ll do the tariffs.”\nTrump recently delayed a planned 50 percent tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month.\n ', 'WASHINGTON: Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday said Germany, Europe’s largest economy, was ready to take over a greater leadership role on future trade agreements as the United States and the EU race to reach a trade deal before a July 9 deadline.\nMerz told reporters he had a productive meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday, and the two men had agreed to strengthen cooperation on trade matters and other issues.\nMerz said he and Trump spoke at length about trade and tariffs during their meeting in the Oval Office, and over a lunch, where Merz said he highlighted the manufacturing facilities operated by German automakers in the United States.\n“We will send officials to further deepen these topics. We want to reach a mutual solution,” Merz told reporters, noting that while the European Union was responsible for setting trade policy, Germany had a significant role to play given the size of its exports.\nTrump has set a July 9 deadline for the 27-bloc European Union and other trading partners to reach trade deals and avert steep tariffs. US and EU officials met in Paris on Wednesday and said negotiations were constructive and advancing quickly.', '', '', 'Europe, already facing a 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25 percent levy on car imports, could see tariffs on its exports to the US surge from 10 percent to as high as 50 percent if no deal is reached.\nMerz told ZDF German television that he told Trump that German automakers produced about 400,000 vehicles in the United States, about the same number as in Germany, with some of those vehicles then exported back to Germany.\n“There is a balance,” he said. “Can we not acknowledge that for every car that is imported another car is exported by the same manufacturer and drop the tariffs?“\nMerz said he would also address the issue with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, adding that there was scope and potential momentum to reach a solution.\n“If a trade dispute escalates, that hurts everyone, also hurts the German manufacturers in America and the roughly one million families in America that are paid by German firms,” he told Germany’s ProSieben television station.\n“I’m optimistic that we’ll make progress. But we’re not yet at the goal line.”', 'Shares of Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors feared his dispute with President Donald Trump will hurt the company.\nTesla plunged closed down more than 14 percent as a disagreement over the US president’s budget bill turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn’t haven’t gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.\n“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”\nThe drop on Thursday wiped out nearly $150 billion from Tesla’s market value, partially reversing a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would testing an autonomous, driverless “robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, this month.\nInvestors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the US, and that could slam Tesla because so much of its future business depends on that.\n“There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy when in come to autonomous,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them 20 or 25 cities next year. If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.”\nTrump’s threat to cut government contracts seem targeted more to another of Musk’s businesses, SpaceX, his privately held rocket company that received billions of dollars to send astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, provide launches and do other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to sent astronauts to moon next year.\nA subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite Internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk’s once-close relationship with the president.\nOn a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved his satellite service for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals for the company in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.\nOne measure of SpaceX’s success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares recently reportedly valued it at $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion just a year ago. Tesla shares initially got a lift from his support of Trump. In the weeks after Trump was elected, Tesla shares soared, hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17. But they gave back those gains during Musk’s time as head of a government cost-cutting group as Tesla’s reputation took a hit. They’ve recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus much more on Tesla and its upcoming launch of driverless taxis.', 'WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to cut off government contracts with billionaire Elon Musk’s companies, and Musk suggested Trump should be impeached, as the bromance between the president and his former adviser disintegrated into a barroom brawl.\nTrump started the feud in remarks from the Oval Office. Musk quickly responded with posts on his social media site X, and within hours both were trading barbs on their respective social media platforms.\n“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social.', '', 'Their sparring hammered shares of Musk’s electric vehicle maker Tesla, which lost about $150 billion in value, closing down 14.3 percent for the day.\nMinutes after the closing bell, Musk replied, “Yes,” to a post on X saying Trump should be impeached.\nTrump’s Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of Congress and are highly unlikely to impeach him.', 'The trouble between the two built up over the week. On Tuesday, Musk began denouncing Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill. The president held his tongue while Musk, his former adviser, campaigned to torpedo the bill, saying it would add too much to the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.\nTrump broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters in the Oval Office he was “very disappointed” in Musk.', '', '“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.', 'As the spat got increasingly bitter, Musk also posted that Trump “is in the Epstein files,” referring to US government documents on disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who committed suicide in jail while awaiting trial for sex crimes.', '“That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Musk said, without offering evidence of how he might know the information.\nBesides Tesla, Musk’s businesses include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink. The billionaire spent nearly $300 million in the 2024 election in support of Trump and other Republican candidates.\nMusk, whose space business plays a critical role in the US government’s space program, said that as a result of Trump’s threats he planned to begin decommissioning SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft. Dragon is the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station.', 'In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW', 'SpaceX’s cheap, reusable Falcon 9 rockets have made it the world’s most active launch provider. Its vast Starlink network has disrupted the global satellite communications market.', 'Ever-present ally\nAfter serving as the biggest Republican donor in the 2024 campaign season, Musk became one of Trump’s most visible advisers as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which mounted a sweeping effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.\nMusk was frequently present at the White House and made multiple appearances on Capitol Hill, sometimes carrying his young son.\nOnly six days before Thursday’s blowup, Trump and Musk held a joint appearance in the Oval Office, where Trump praised Musk’s government service and both men promised to continue working together.\nA prolonged feud between Trump and Musk could make it more difficult for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. In addition to his campaign spending, Musk has a huge online following and helped connect Trump to parts of Silicon Valley and wealthy donors.', 'In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW', 'Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future.\nSoon after Trump’s Oval Office comments, Musk polled his 220 million followers on X: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80 percent in the middle?“', '‘Kill the bill’\nMusk’s blistering attacks this week targeted what Trump calls his “big, beautiful bill.” Musk called it a “disgusting abomination” that would deepen the federal deficit, and his posts amplified a rift within the Republican Party that could threaten the bill’s prospects in the Senate. Nonpartisan analysts say Trump’s bill could add $2.4 trillion to $5 trillion to the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.\nTrump asserted that Musk really objected to the president’s elimination of consumer tax credits for electric vehicles.\nTrump also suggested that Musk was upset because he missed working for Trump.\n“He’s not the first,” Trump said on Thursday. “People leave my administration ... then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile.”\nMusk wrote on X, “KILL the BILL,” adding he was fine with Trump’s planned cuts to electric vehicle credits as long as Republicans rid the bill of “mountain of disgusting pork” or wasteful spending.\nHe also pulled up past quotes from Trump decrying the level of federal spending, adding, “Where is this guy today?”\nTrump, meanwhile, posted on Truth Social that Musk “went crazy.”', '‘Ingratitude’', 'Politicians and their donor patrons rarely see eye to eye. But the magnitude of Musk’s support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free rein the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling-out.\nMusk offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. “Such ingratitude,” Musk added in a follow-up post.\nMusk first announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Pennsylvania rally last July. News of Musk’s political action committee in support of Trump’s election came days later.\nMusk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew on Air Force One for weekend stays at Mar-a-Lago, slept in the Lincoln Bedroom and joined Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat — sometimes more than one.\nThree months ago, Trump purchased a red Tesla from Musk as a public show of support for his business as it faced blowback.\nMusk bid farewell to Trump last week in a somewhat somber news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service.\nTrump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday.\n“I said, ‘Do you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup.’ Which is interesting,” Trump said.', '‘Disgusting abomination’', 'The Republican president’s comments came as Musk has griped for days on social media about Trump’s spending bill, warning that it will increase the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill a “disgusting abomination.”\n“He hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office, presaging the rest of his day. “But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.”\nObservers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would combust in dramatic fashion. It did, in less than a year.\nWhite House aides were closely following the drama playing out on dueling platforms Thursday with bemusement, sharing the latest twists and turns from the feud between their boss and former co-worker, as well as the social media reaction and memes. Officials in the extremely online administration privately expressed the belief that like the other digital scuffles that have defined Trump’s political career, this would also work out in his favor.\nTrump said Thursday in the Oval Office that he and Musk had had a great relationship but mused: “I don’t know if we will anymore.”\nHe said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.”\n“It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it,” he said.\nHe brushed aside the billionaire’s efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party’s leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future.\nTrump said Musk “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles.\n“False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”\nIn another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”\nBesides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk’s promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Trump withdrew Isaacman’s nomination over the weekend and on Thursday called him “totally a Democrat.”\nMusk continued slinging his responses on social media. He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media.\n“Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?”\nOn the White House grounds Thursday afternoon, Trump’s red Tesla still sat in a parking lot.', 'Following Trump’s remarks, a White House official, speaking on background, underscored the shift in the once-close dynamic between Musk and Trump.\n“The president is making it clear: this White House is not beholden to Elon Musk on policy,” the official said. “By attacking the bill the way he did, Musk has clearly picked a side.”']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXJla05XUVcxelRsTlZhMnhrVFJDM0FSaVRBaWdCTWdZQnFJNmx2Z1U=-w280-h168-p-df

US-based entities are also forbidden from engaging in transactions with them, including through the “provision of funds, goods or services”.', 'The ICC quickly issued a statement in response, saying it stood behind its judges and “deplores” the Trump administration’s decision.', '“These measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 States Parties from all corners of the globe,” the statement said.', '“Targeting those working for accountability does nothing to help civilians trapped in conflict. It only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity.”', 'In a fact sheet, the State Department explained that Bossa and Ibanez Carranza were sanctioned for authorising an investigation into US troops in Afghanistan in 2020, during Trump’s first term as president.', 'Previously, the ICC had blocked a request to probe alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, where the US had been leading a slow-grinding war from 2001 to 2021.', 'But it reversed course the following year, granting a prosecutor’s request to investigate US forces and members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for war crimes in “secret detention facilities” in Afghanistan and elsewhere.', 'Afghanistan, the court noted, was a member of the Rome Statute, which includes the 125 countries where the ICC has jurisdiction.', 'But the Trump administration at the time blasted the court’s decision, calling the ICC a “political institution masquerading as a legal body”. It has long argued that the US, which is not party to the Rome Statute, lies outside the ICC’s jurisdiction.', 'Another country that is not a member of the Rome Statute is Israel, which has used similar arguments to reject the ICC’s power over its actions in Palestine.', 'The second pair of judges named in Thursday’s sanctions — Alapini Gansou and Hohler — were sanctioned for their actions against Israeli leaders, according to the US State Department.', 'The US is Israel’s oldest ally, having been the first to recognise the country in 1948. It has since offered Israel strong support, including for its ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed an estimated 54,607 Palestinians so far.', 'Experts at the United Nations and human rights organisations have compared Israel’s military campaign in Gaza to a genocide, as reports continue to emerge of alleged human rights abuses.', 'In November 2024, those accusations spurred the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who have both been accused of war crimes in Gaza, including intentional attacks on civilians.', 'Alapini Gansou and Hohler reportedly took part in those proceedings.', 'This is not the first time that the US has issued restrictions against an ICC official since Trump returned to office for a second term on January 20.', 'Shortly after taking office, Trump issued a broad executive order threatening anyone who participates in ICC investigations with sanctions. Critics warned that such sweeping language could pervert the course of justice, for example by dissuading witnesses from coming forward with evidence.', 'But Trump argued that the recent arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant necessitated such measures.', 'He also claimed that the US and Israel were “thriving democracies” that “strictly adhere to the laws of war” and that the ICC’s investigations threatened military members with “harassment, abuse and possible arrest”.', '“This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel,” the executive order said.', 'Under that order, the US sanctioned ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, who had petitioned the court for the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. That, in turn, slowed the investigation into Israel’s actions in Gaza, and Khan later stepped away from his role amid allegations of sexual misconduct.', 'But Trump has a history of opposing the ICC, stretching back to his first term. In 2019, for instance, Trump announced his administration would deny or yank visas for ICC officials involved in investigating US troops in Afghanistan.', 'Then, in 2020, he sanctioned ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and a court official named Phakiso Mochochoko for their involvement in the investigation. Those actions were later overturned under President Joe Biden.', 'Critics, however, warn that Trump’s actions could have dire consequences over the long term for the ICC, which relies on its member countries to execute orders like arrest warrants. The court itself has called for an end to the threats.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXJla05XUVcxelRsTlZhMnhrVFJDM0FSaVRBaWdCTWdZQnFJNmx2Z1U=-w280-h168-p-df
