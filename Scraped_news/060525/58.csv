No title found,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/jun/05/spain-v-france-nations-league-semi-final-live,"['Spain, who were 5-1 up at one stage, survived a late rally from France in a festival of attacking football in Stuttgart', 'Sid Lowe’s match report has landed, which means it’s goodnight from me, and indeed him. Thanks for your company and emails. Bye-bye.', 'An alternative take on tonight’s game is that the players disgraced themselves. Here’s Jose Mourinho after Arsenal won 5-4 at White Hart Lane in 2040.', 'Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score.', 'In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly.', 'So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.', '“Well, that was good silly fun,” says Kári Tulinius, “but how did two teams with as many good defensive players allow this to happen? I’m hoping this and the Barcelona v Inter semifinal is a sign we’re entering a period of football dominated by attacking, and not just that the two backlines wear already on the beach.”', 'Yeah, I’m still trying to make sense of it. End-of-season fatigue? Nations League sweet spot? I’m not sure. Whatever the reason, ‘good silly fun’ is a very nice way to describe it.', 'That was like a game from the 1950s, with each team taking it in turns to attack and both defences largely powerless to stop them. There were attempts on goal, 17 of them on target, and it’s not much of an exaggeration to say the game could have finished 10-10.', 'Spain will play Portugal in the Nations League final on Sunday after a memorable game of footbasketball in Stuttgart. Spain led 4-0 and 5-1 but France refused to go away and came close to a comeback for the ages.', '90+6 min A Spain player has been booked for kicking the ball away, don’t ask me who it was. France have a free-kick to throw into the box, their last chance… and Unai Simon comes out to claim with authority.', 'Haha, this is ludicrous. Cherki – what a player he looks – teases a gorgeous cross from the right edge of the area and Kolo Muani scores with a downward header from five yards.', '90+2 min Gusto’s cross is headed well wide by the off-balance Barcola. Time is running out for France.', '90 min Five minutes of added time. Spain bring on Gavi for Mikel Merino.', '87 min: Chance for France! Barcola surges down the left, turns back and tees up the onrushing Kolo Muani on the edge of the area. He sidefoots over the bar and Didier Deschamps waves his arms in disgust.', '86 min Samu gets beyond the France defence and sweeps a shot across goal that Maignan does well to save with his legs.', 'Okay this is ridiculous. Malo Gusto’s excellent low cross is turned into his own net by Vivian, who had to do something with Mbappe waiting behind him to score.', '84 min “Scotland play Iceland in a friendly at Hampden tomorrow, Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Should provide a nice counterpoint to this game.”', '82 min Yamal wriggles away from Theo Hernandez, who essentially tries to kidnap him with a weirdly tender rugby tackle. He’s booked.', '80 min I’ve just realised this is Cherki’s first game for France. Can’t be many who have scored a better goal on their international debut.', 'Rayan Cherki, one of Europe’s most coveted young players, adds to his fast-growing reputation with a fantastic volley. My word, that’s a storming goal. Mbappe played a simple pass to him on the edge of the D; he stunned the ball up in the air and lashed a volley that beat Simon for pace.', '78 min Spain v Portugal in the final? Oh go on then.', '77 min: Double substitution for Spain Dani Vivian and Samu replace Robin Le Normand and Mikel Oyzarzabal, whose excellent hold-up play led to the first two goals.', '76 min: France substitution Randal Kolo Muani replaces Ousmane Dembele.', '76 min Spain are winning 5-1 and their keeper has been brilliant. Unai Simon makes another good save, plunging to his right to push Mbappe’s shot round the post.', '74 min “$£!@£$!,” writes Charles Antaki. “Can’t think of a better response to all of this – hard to keep up. Dictionary Corner: turns out that kind of cartoon code for impoliteness is called Grawlix. If there’s another goal there’ll be more of it.”', '73 min “You can’t give the Ballon d’Or to a teenager, can you?” says Joe Pearson. “Can you?”', 'I mean you can, but it’s never happened before. I think Ronaldo (the original) is the youngest winner at 21.', '72 min: Dembele hits the post from a seriously tight angle. This game is bonkers.', '72 min: France substitution Lucas Hernandez replaces Clement Lenglet.', '70 min The scary thing is that France have played well, certainly in attack. Spain, once ridiculed for being all hat and no cattle, have been a model of efficiency tonight.', 'Lamine Yamal has got his second with a terrific finish. Zubimendi lofted a pass out to Porro, who cushioned a lovely first-time volley behind the France. Yamal ran onto it, slithered away from the last defender Lenglet and poked an early shot across goal that Maignan – who was setting himself for the kind of shot a normal human being would have taken – could only help into the net. Just brilliant.', 'That’s the end of that.', '66 min Dembele’s corner from the right is volleyed over by Barcola, 12 yards out at the far post. He caught it sweetly but couldn’t keep the shot down.', '64 min: Double substitution for Spain Fabian Ruiz and Dani Olmo come on for Pedri and Nico Williams.', '64 min: Triple substitution for France Rayan Cherki, Malo Gusto and Bradley Barcola replace Kalulu, Doue and Olise.', '62 min: Doue goes close! Maybe Mbappe is right. After a long spell of French possession in the final third, Doue whips a curling shot across goal and not far wide.', 'Mbappe sends Simon the wrong way and runs to pick the ball out of the net. He still thinks there’s some life in this game.', '58 min: Penalty to France! Mbappe gets the wrong side of Pedro Porro, who panics and puts hands on his man. Mbappe accepts the invitation and throws himself to the floor. It’s soft but I can’t see it being overturned.', 'Two quick goals in the first half, two even quicker ones in the second. Pedri strode forward from midfield, lent the ball to Nico Williams, got it back and clipped the ball over Maignan with a swagger.', 'It was a fine finish from Pedri, not least because Williams’ return pass was slightly behind him. He dragged it into the space, weighting the touch perfectly, and then stunned it over Maignan.', 'Well that escalated quickly.', 'Yamal takes the penalty himself, rolling it decisively into the bottom-right corner. Maignan went the wrong way.', '52 min: The penalty stands It was an ill-conceived tackle from Rabiot, and that’s being kind. He had to do something with Yamal through on goal, but taking a shortcut through the back of Yamal wasn’t the ideal solution.', '51 min France lose the ball in a dangerous area. Williams plays in Yamal, who is brought down by his old friend Rabiot. He pleads his innocence but it was a clear foul and Rabiot is booked.', 'France may yet be saved by an offside decision against Yamal.', '48 min The other left-back Hernandez combines with Doue and fires a similar ball right across the face of goal. Dembele couldn’t quite reach it on the stretch.', '47 min After some good link play from Dembele and Olise, Kalulu fires a low cross that flashes through the six-yard box, literally begging for somebody to score. Mick Quinn would have put that away, you know it and I know it.', '46 min Spain get the second half under way – no changes on either side.', '“Would Huijsen’s disallowed goal fall into the shortlist for best disallowed goal of all time?” asks Colum Fordham, who already knows the answer has three letters. “Quite stunning. I think some goals should be allowed if they meet certain aesthetic criteria and VAR be dammed. Great match between two highly technical sides. The Spanish keeper Simon is having a great game.”', 'Half-time reading', 'That first half was a tremendous advert for the Nations League. There were 22 shots at goal – 13 from France, who were arguably the better team aside from the devastating four-minute period in which Nico Williams and Mikel Merino scored for Spain.', '45+2 min Rabiot leaves a bit on Yamal, who made a fool of him in last year’s semi-final. Not quite enough for a yellow card.', '45+1 min “Is the France manager still unpopular or does Eric Cantona’s opinion not reflect that?” writes Ian Copestake. “Water-carrying your way to semi-finals also wasn’t good enough for the great British public I recall.”', '45 min Dembele tries to take matters into his own hands – well, his left foot – with a scurrying run and swept shot from the D that is held to his left by the flying Simon. He’s had an excellent half.', '44 min A beautiful free-kick routine from Spain ends with Huijsen hooking a brilliant volley past Maignan – but the man who headed the ball across to him, Zubimendi, was fractionally offside.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXFRak5pVjNWaGRTMVhkRXBuVFJEMEFoalJBeWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Not quite, because Rayan Cherki was determined to make his debut a memorable one. The 21-year-old got the ball 25 yards from goal, turned and uncorked a left-footed blast that Simon had no hope of saving.

He‘s also been linked with a move to Chelsea.', 'RB: Malo Gusto—The full-back was horrific on his previous outing in the Conference League final, but Jules Koundé’s absence from the squad means Gusto’s set to start on Thursday.', 'CB: Ibrahima Konaté—The Premier League champion has been forced to share minutes with France’s array of gifted young centre-backs in recent times, but injuries to William Saliba and Deschamps’s favourite, Dayot Upamecano, means Konaté should start both games this month.', 'CB: Lucas Hernandez—Key absence has opened the door for Hernandez to earn a rare starting berth. The PSG defender, who played 12 minutes of the Champions League final, hasn‘t played all that much for the national team since he tore his ACL at the 2022 World Cup.', 'LB: Lucas Digne—Good luck, Lucas. Yamal awaits.', 'CM: Aurélien Tchouaméni—He’ll be without Real Madrid buddy Eduardo Camavinga this month, but his teammate’s absence should allow him to start at the base of France’s midfield without much competition.', 'CM: Manu Koné—The midfielder shone at Roma in 2024–25 and has been introduced to Deschamps’s setup after claiming a silver medal with his country at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He could be rewarded for his impressive season via a start on Thursday.', 'CM: Adrien Rabiot—The manager’s ol’ reliable. Rabiot is always in Deschamps’s thinking, no matter how well he performs at club level.', 'RW: Michael Olise—France can afford to rest those who starred in the Champions League final due to their high-quality alternatives.

Lamine Yamal dazzles as Spain win goal-fest with France to set up Portugal final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/05/lamine-yamal-spain-goal-fest-france-portugal-final,"['Another day, another final. Another night to enjoy, and the promise that there may be many more to come. The European champions made their way to Munich where they will defend their Nations League title thanks to a 5-4 victory over France which left something more than just the result in Stuttgart.', 'It may not be so absurd to imagine that this Spain could match that one, although there are lessons to be learnt at the back. Just as it may not be so absurd to suggest that the 17-year-old in their team is not going to be the best, he already is. If this was an audition for the Ballon d’Or against Ousmane Dembélé and Kylian Mbappé, as many said, the award is Lamine Yamal’s.', 'Nor is Lamine Yamal alone. He scored two, his every touch a threat, but by the time he did Spain had already scored twice, through Nico Williams and Mikel Merino. And between his brace, Pedri, a player who does everything with a kind of ethereal ease, added a lovely fourth. Spain weren’t alone either: France played their part in making this so good, racking up 24 of the 40 shots and making a match of this. Down 5-1 after 67 minutes, a belter from Rayan Cherki, an own goal from Dani Vivian and a Randal Kolo Muani header on 79, 84, and 93 minutes respectively contributed to a special and sometimes silly occasion, infusing it with a tension no one had anticipated 20 minutes earlier.', 'That said, this wasn’t just a late flurry from nowhere; it had been fun from the very start, a game that was open and played at pace, the shot count rising almost as swiftly as the players were moving. Theo Hernández clipping the bar while Unai Simón and Mike Maignan both made saves, as if the teams were taking it in turns, before Spain took the lead on 22 minutes. They did so as France had begun briefly to assert themselves, the balance tilting their way, Désiré Doué and Adrien Rabiot both having decent shooting opportunities, and Pedri forced to shift deeper to wrest back some control.', 'In the first prolonged passage of Spanish possession the ball was worked to Lamine Yamal, who played in a crisp pass to Mikel Oyarzabal on the edge of the six-yard box. Back to goal, he held off Ibrahima Konaté and neatly nudged it to his right where Williams smashed it into the roof of the net. A superb second came three minutes later, beginning at Robin Le Normand’s feet. Again, Oyarzabal’s awareness and subtleness of touch was the pivot upon which it turned. Merino received, found Oyarzabal and spun; Oyarzabal returned it to him and he finished low into the net.', 'Spain’s lead was maintained by the strong hand of Simón, who saved from Doué, Mbappé and Dembélé. Then just before half-time it appeared to have been extended when a lovely free-kick routine, touched by Pedri, clipped in by Lamine Yamal and set up by Martín Zubimendi’s header ended with Dean Huijsen’s superb volley. The flag, though, was up. Almost immediately Dembélé escaped, only for his shot to be stopped by Simón.', 'On it went, two more French approaches within two minutes of the restart, low crosses flying through the six-yard box inviting a touch. On Spain went, too. And this is a such an incisive, such an inspired Spain, so quick to go for the throat, intent in everything they do. Williams robbed possession, sliding the pass into Lamine Yamal. Rabiot, who Lamine enjoyed silencing at last summer’s Euros', 'Sign up to Football Daily', ""Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football"", '', ', was invited in and his clumsy challenge left little doubt. Lamine gestured to the fans, then took the ball, and his moment, and rolled the penalty into the corner. Checkmate.', 'Only it wasn’t. Spain weren’t stopping there, they were enjoying it too much. A gorgeous touch from Pedri enabled him to glide into space, exchange passes with Williams and lift over Maignan. The superiority was striking now, even if Mbappé did win – now there’s a euphemism – and score a penalty soon after, even if Dembélé hit the post. Because there was Lamine Yamal again, running on to Pedro Porro’s neat volleyed layoff, easing away from Clément Lenglet and poking past Maignan. Now that really was checkmate, or so it seemed.', 'Still France weren’t finished, still the scoring wasn’t either, providing a wild ending if not quite a comeback and it was Lamine Yamal flashing a smile at the end, braces sparkling in the light.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXFRak5pVjNWaGRTMVhkRXBuVFJEMEFoalJBeWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

His rise has been meteoric over the past 12 months.', 'LB: Marc Cucurella—The Chelsea left-back has been ever so reliable for the national team, and he’s a shoo-in to start given that Alejandro Balde is still out of the squad.', 'CM: Pedri—Remarkably, Spain soared to Euro 2024 glory without the brilliant Pedri playing a major role. The midfielder has since enjoyed perhaps the best season of his career, and will certainly be in De la Fuente’s engine room on Thursday.', 'CM: Fabian Ruíz—The elegant operator was excellent again as PSG finished the job in Munich at the weekend. Ruíz is purring Paris and has been a consistent performer for Spain in recent times.', 'RW: Lamine Yamal—It was against France in last summer’s Euro 2024 semifinal when Yamal truly announced himself to the world. The teenager has since reached superstardom, and some might argue that he’s currently the best around.', 'AM: Dani Olmo—Yamal’s wonder strike stole the headlines in the aforementioned semifinal, but Olmo hurt France, too. He had an up-and-down year with Barcelona due to injuries, but he’s Spain’s best for this role when fit and firing.', 'LW: Nico Williams—Williams worked wonderfully in tandem with Yamal last summer, and France’s full-backs are in for a long evening on Thursday. The Athletic Club star doesn’t yet know where he’ll be playing his club football come the start of 2025–26.', 'ST: Alvaro Morata—Morata is no star, but he’s a selfless forward appreciated by his manager.

It was not straightforward at times for Luis de la Fuente’s side, but all that matters is the win. Here’s how the European champions fared in Stuttgart.', 'The Athletic Club goalkeeper may have conceded four times, but he was excellent. He kept Spain in control with a string of important saves throughout the 90 minutes in Germany.', 'It’s another underwhelming performance in a Spain jersey for Porro. He gave away the penalty that sparked France’s late resurgence.', 'Unspectacular performance from Le Normand, whose substitution in the 77th minute was followed by France scoring three times.', 'Very good first half performance from the new Real Madrid man, but he loses marks for being part of the defence that conceded four times.', 'Cucurella continues to establish himself as Spain’s best left-back. He faced off against Ousmane Dembele, and for the most part, he handled him well.', 'He was excellent in helping Spain control the first 65/70 minutes, proving once again that he is a more than capable backup to Rodri Hernandez.', 'Good performance from Merino, who scored Spain’s second of the evening. He was not afraid to break forward, and that is how he got his goal.', 'There is no doubt that Pedri is better in a deeper role, but it was still an accomplished performance from the 22-year-old, who was Spain’s most advanced midfielder. He scored a fine goal after good link-up play with Nico Williams.', 'What more can be said about Lamine Yamal? He produced another world class performance on the biggest stage, as he scored twice and also won a penalty. Once again, he walked the walk after talking the talk.', 'Nico was once again a big threat for Spain, and he scored a fine opener in Stuttgart.', 'The Real Sociedad captain looks to have established himself as Spain’s starting striker, which is deserved. He was excellent, setting up La Roja’s opening two goals for Nico and Merino.', 'Struggled to make an impact during his 30-minute cameo.', 'Did well enough after coming on, although he struggled to have the same impact as Pedri.', 'Luis de la Fuente’s decision to bring on Vivian almost cost Spain, as it unsettled the defence. He scored an own goal that brought the game back to 5-3.', 'Missed a big chance to score Spain’s sixth.

Spain Destroys France In The Nations League Semi-Final,https://www.stadiumrant.com/spain-destroys-france-in-the-nations-league-sf/,"['With the European seasons finished, the attention of all soccer fans turned to the national games. While there is no major competition taking place this summer, there are still games to be watched. On June 4th, Portugal won their game against Germany and became the first finalist of the Nations League. Only a day later, Spain and France met for a semi-final of their own.', 'The game began with both Spain and France creating opportunity after opportunity. The pace was quick from the very first minute. Even though both teams came into the game strong, it was France that dominated the field.', 'That was the case until the 22nd minute when the tides turned and Nico Williams put Spain in the lead. Lamine Yamal passed the ball perfectly to Mikel Oyarzabal, who, after a quick fight with France’s defence, directed it over to the well-placed Williams. Before the tricolored could react, it had already found its way into their net.', 'With a new wind underneath their wings, Spain attacked again, only a few minutes later. Once again, it was Oyarzabal who put the ball right where it needed to be. What was different was the man who scored the goal. Instead of Williams, the glory of securing Spain’s lead fell onto Mikel Merino. A bit more than halfway through the first half, the score stood at 2:0.', 'The rest of the first half was filled with France’s attempt to equalise the score. There were a few moments in which it seemed like a goal was imminent, but the ball could never make it all the way into Unai Simon’s goal.', 'Before the whistle could begin the break, Spain saw one more great chance to increase their lead. After a free kick, the young Dean Hujisen managed to score a beautiful goal. Unfortunately for him, the score remained 2:0, as he was slightly offside during the attack.', 'Spain began pressing as soon as the game was resumed. Before the first minute could finish, they managed to create a dangerous chance. Although nothing came of it, they very quickly followed it up with a second, even more dangerous one. The score hadn’t changed, but the message sent by the team was clear. The two-goal lead was not enough to satisfy their ambition.', 'In the 51st minute, Yamal found himself in a great spot to attempt an attack. As he ran towards the goal, he was stopped by Adrien Rabio. The problem for France was that Rabio’s intervention did not comply with the rules. A yellow card was given to the defender, and Yamal lined up for a penalty. He shot and he scored, giving Spain their third goal of the evening.', 'Spain seemed set to only shoot doubles. Pedri, who was slightly invisible in the first half, created another opportunity and passed the ball to Williams. He then ran towards France’s goal and, before long, was ready to take it back. Williams sent the ball toward the midfielder, and Pedri finished the action with a beautiful goal. All those who doubted his performance had no choice but to eat their words.', 'The excitement was not finished quite yet. Not long after Spain scored their 4th goal, France’s attack ended with Kylian Mbappe fouled by Pedro Porro inside the Spanish penalty box. The offense could only end with a penalty awarded to the French team. Despite Simon’s best efforts, converting it into a goal was no issue for Real Madrid’s striker.', 'Yamal is currently one of the frontrunners for the Ballon d’Or. With him and Ousman Dembele as the two names associated with the trophy, many people believed that this match could reveal the winner. Yamal was eager to show that, out of the two of them, he was the better candidate. His efforts paid off in the 67th minute when he scored Spain’s 5th goal of the evening.', 'France was determined not to get written off before the game was over. Despite Spain’s big lead, they began putting their opponents under pressure. They just barely missed a goal when the ball hit the post of Simon’s goal. In the 79th minute, they found the opportunity they were looking for. Lyon’s Rayan Cherki scored France’s first in-game goal and breathed some hope back into his team.', 'With Spain’s lead decreased, France kept on attacking. Only a few minutes after the score changed to 5:2, it changed again, this time to show 5:3. The tricoloured’s third goal wasn’t scored by any of the French players. It was added to Dani Vivian’s tally of own goals.', 'Just when it seemed like the game was all but over, France struck again. Kolo Muani scored the team’s 4th goal in the third minute of added time. Suddenly, only one goal separated France from equalising the score.', 'Try as hard as they might have, the French players did not manage to score again. The long, hard game ended with Spain moving through to the semi-finals.', 'The match kept all viewers on their toes and provided some great football for those who miss seeing their teams play week in and week out. Spain was the deserved winner, but France showed that, despite losing, they are not a team to be trifled with. The Spanish team will face Portugal on June 8th.', '', 'If you enjoyed this article, subscribe to our newsletter here. Check out Stadium Rant Original shows on our Youtube channel and subscribe!

'Genius' Yamal & all-time classic - why Spain are World Cup favourites,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9q0329d3xeo,"['Lamine Yamal (centre) has scored six goals for Spain with one more game to come before he turns 18', 'Spain and France played out a Nations League semi-final game for the ages with a scoreline that looks like it belongs in a penalty shootout.', 'The 5-4 win for Spain has everyone wondering if anyone can stop these attackers - although the less said about the defenders, the better.', ""Spain, who play Portugal in Sunday's final, are looking for a third Uefa tournament success in a row having won the last Nations League and Euro 2024."", 'And they are favourites for the World Cup coming up next summer, with France second on the list.', 'Spain showed why they will be tough to stop after one of the most exciting international games in memory.', 'A total of 40 shots, 17 on target, nine goals. Spain led 4-0 and 5-1 - and threatened to blow France away - before their rivals rallied.', 'If only every match was like this.', '""It was a crazy game,"" said Spain goalscorer Mikel Merino. ""Not the best game for the coaches - nobody wants to concede so many goals - but an amazing game for the fans.""', 'His boss Luis de la Fuente seemed to actually disagree with him.', '""I\'m happy. I enjoy suffering! I don\'t understand sport without suffering,"" he said.', '""When two great teams face off like today, it\'s normal every team makes the most of their moments.""', ""Lamine Yamal, who turns 18 later this summer, netted twice for Spain to cement his credentials as a Ballon d'Or contender."", 'He is up to six goals for his country now, to add to 25 for club side Barcelona.', ""Yamal impressed more than France's PSG stars - Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue - who were hyped up pre-game after phenomenal club seasons."", ""Les Bleus debutant Rayan Cherki help spark France's fightback after coming off the bench to show why he is being linked to Liverpool and Manchester City."", 'Yamal shines as Spain beat France in nine-goal thriller', ""Battle of Ballon d'Or favourites - Yamal v Dembele in Nations League"", 'It would almost take too long to address everything that happened in the game. But here goes.', ""Mikel Oyarzabal picked out Nico Williams to net Spain's opener, before also setting up Merino four minutes later."", 'It was almost 3-0 when Dean Huijsen had a goal disallowed for offside after a sensational free-kick routine.', '""That belongs in a musuem,"" said Prime Video summariser Karen Bardsley.', 'After the break Yamal was fouled and scored the resulting penalty, with Williams finding Pedri shortly after for their fourth.', 'Kylian Mbappe netted a penalty to pull one back, but Yamal bagged his second with a fine first touch and finish.', '""It\'s hard to argue with the genius that you see before you,"" said Bardsley on seeing Yamal poke home his second.', 'That was 5-1 but then France came back.', 'Dembele hit the post, before debutant Cherki volleyed in from the edge of the box.', ""Dani Vivian turned a cross into his own net and then Randal Kolo Muani nodded in from Cherki's good ball."", 'But they could not create another chance in the remaining two minutes of stoppage time to force the extra-time period every neutral wanted.', 'After 75 minutes it looked as if the story was going to be about Spain blowing France away to cement their place as favourites to win everything going.', 'They were the best side by some way at Euro 2024 and show no signs of slowing down.', 'Wingers Yamal, who seems to improve with every game - which is actually to be expected at the age of 17 - and Williams were electric.', 'Midfielders Merino and Pedri were on the scoresheet. Oyarzabal had two assists to his name.', 'Their oldest player was 28, and the team had an average age of 24.', 'But there will be question marks about a defence that let in four goals - and a team who almost blew a 5-1 lead.', 'Yamal said: ""When two great teams like this play, you sometimes see a lot of goals. They will make you suffer until the end but we went to the final despite the mistakes we made.""', 'Unai Simon had to make six saves, so this was far from a story of an opponent who scored every shot.', '""That was a typical Spain performance,"" said Spanish journalist Guillem Balague.', '""These players come out on the pitch with the feeling they can beat anyone.', '""The interesting thing is they are doing it, winning and creating magic within a structure.', '""Spain have been playing in a way that represents the predominant model of our times. Not only are these players intelligent, creative but they are committed as well. They work so hard to get the ball back.', '""Even though at the end Spain relaxed, when you do that you believe you belong to the right path.', '""You have special players all over the park and of course the feeling is more people are watching Spain because its really enjoyable and winning seems to be a habit.""', 'Kylian Mbappe plays his club football in Spain for Real Madrid', ""France's attackers were pretty decent."", 'Even when they were getting whacked by Spain before the hour-mark, they were still having plenty of chances.', 'They had more shots than Spain did in both halves - and more efforts on target in total.', 'Mbappe, speaking to RTVE, said: ""We had some bursts of play we haven\'t had for a long time. But in just 10 minutes of the first-half, we conceded two goals - and the same thing happened in the second half.', '""We weren\'t consistent throughout the 90 minutes, but we did improve. It\'s not all negative.""', ""PSG's two-goal Champions League final scorer Doue went close, team-mate and Ballon d'Or contender Dembele hit the post - and Mbappe had chances before scoring his penalty."", 'But 21-year-old Lyon attacker Cherki had a big role after coming on. His sweet volley from the edge of the box was probably the best goal of the game - and his cross for Kolo Muani to make it 5-4 was inch-perfect.', 'Again though, like Spain, it was the defending which was the issue. Juventus full-back Pierre Kalulu, making his debut on his 25th birthday, struggled. Clement Lenglet, winning his first cap since 2021, was caused problems too.', '""I\'m not here to point fingers but I have a backline who are used to working together,"" said boss Didier Deschamps.', '""[This was] about finding another line who aren\'t used to playing together. I\'m not going to give up on this defence. There were mitigating circumstances. But Spain have this capability to be very efficient. We were able to score goals too.""', '', 'Sulaimon Adelekan: This Spain side is so good and young, they could rule world football for the next six years with Yamal, Pedri, Gavi and Nico Williams still yet to peak. They are dismantling and destroying France.', ""Victor: With the way it's going, this Spanish team will easily win the next World Cup. There is simply no need traveling to USA."", ""Robbie: Spain are the best team in the world at moment and it's not even close."", ""Nick: Spain probably are currently the best team in the world, but a full-strength Germany (they were missing Rüdiger, Musiala and Havertz yesterday) are close - they were the only team that can really claim they should have beaten Spain at the Euros with the chances they created - and Argentina are strong, too. I feel like France will be incredible at the next World Cup - they just need to work out what their best XI is, because they've arguably got too many good players!"", 'Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast', ""'Genius' Yamal & all-time classic - why Spain are World Cup favourites"", ""The Queen of Clay's reign ends - but Swiatek 'will be back'"", ""'There is no crisis' before Euro 2025 - Wiegman"", 'Alison spends a revealing weekend with Jimmy Carr', ""Watchlist Add Alison Hammond's Big Weekend to your Watchlist in iPlayer"", 'Distilling the truth of a whiskey urban myth', 'Subscribe Add The Mystery Of... to My Sounds', 'Can Marie Antoinette survive her reign?', 'Watchlist Add Marie Antoinette to your Watchlist in iPlayer', ""Tom Grennan and Roman Kemp's weekly unfiltered catch up"", 'Subscribe Add You About? to My Sounds', 'How a chaotic 10 days unfolded for Lionesses as Euros loom', 'A De Bruyne replacement?
