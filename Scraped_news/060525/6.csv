Her son, Colin, is Da Silva's friend and both are teammates on the Milford High boys volleyball team."", ""Da Silva's parents and younger brother and sister won't leave the house, said Greco, gripped by fear that ICE agents could swoop down on them. The parents can't go to work and the children — ages 7 and 9 — can't go to school. Their lives literally halted by what happened to Da Silva."", '""Devastation"" is how Greco described the family\'s situation after ICE agents surrounded the car Da Silva was driving May 31 on his way to volleyball practice. Federal officials said they targeted the father, Joao Paulo Gomes-Pereira, who they claim is an undocumented immigrant from Brazil.', ""ICE said they didn't intend to take the 18-year-old Da Silva, but when agents realized it was him, not his father, who was driving the car, they had to detain him because he was living in the U.S. without legal status."", '""Collateral arrest"" is how ICE described Da Silva\'s detainment, noting that it\'s happening in Massachusetts because state and local authorities aren\'t collaborating with ICE investigations and releasing criminals from court without notifying federal agents.', ""The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2017 that court officials and law enforcement can't hold people charged with crimes so that ICE has the time to detain them and potentially start a deportation process."", 'Information from local authorities, said ICE, that Gomes-Pereira was a public danger by driving 100 mph in residential neighborhoods made him the target of their investigation.', 'The Trump administration has said its immigration policy is focused on violent criminals living in the U.S. illegally.

Four years after that he can apply for U.S. citizenship."", ""Nice explained that Da Silva entered the U.S. in 2013, one month after he turned 7, with a B-2 visitor visa that subsequently became an international student visa. That visa lapsed, said Nice, but she doesn't know when that happened because she's had limited access to Da Silva. She's only had one phone call with him since he was detained."", ""Since ICE officials have stated that Gomes-Pereira is their target, with Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons saying during a press conference in Boston June 2 that the father knows he's wanted and refuses to turn himself in, Greco revealed the family is worried about his safety."", ""ICE vehicles continue to circle the family's neighborhood, said Greco, as homeowners have video from their surveillance cameras that they believe identifies the cars.
