ESPN has an interesting proposal for a Trey Hendrickson trade with Commanders and Colts,https://www.cincyjungle.com/2025/6/4/24443179/trey-hendrickson-trade-commanders-bengals-jerzhan-johnny-newton-colts,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Would the Bengals consider this?', 'The gap between the Cincinnati Bengals’ offer and what star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson wants doesn’t seem to have lessened in size since his public comments a couple of weeks ago. Aside from a Hendrickson post on Instagram with what could be cryptic lyrics, there hasn’t been much movement.', 'The Bengals haven’t shown any inclination to trade the disgruntled star, but that doesn’t have to stop teams from making offers.', 'In a recent post, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler and Seth Walder shared interesting trade proposals that could land the Bengals a player they were linked to in a previous draft and two draft picks from the Washington Commanders or draft compensation from the Indianapolis Colts to reunite Hendrickson with Lou Anarumo.', 'In the first offer, Fowler has Hendrickson going to the Colts for two draft picks:', 'Jeremy Fowler’s offer:', 'Bengals get: 2026 second-round pick, 2027 fifth-round pick', 'Colts get: Hendrickson', 'Why this deal makes sense for both sides: This sort of urgent move from Indy general manager Chris Ballard would solidify the edge of new coordinator Lou Anarumo’s defense. Anarumo would gladly reunite with Hendrickson after they spent four seasons together in Cincinnati.', 'The Bengals were reportedly set on getting a first-round pick for Hendrickson, but that never happened. The longer this draws out, the less leverage the Bengals have in trade talks. Fowler touched on that as well:', 'It’s clear the Bengals aren’t getting a first-rounder for Hendrickson — or else a deal would have been done by now — but the elite pass rusher still has immense value. They would be smart to capitalize on a trade like this if they aren’t going to pay him what he wants. The Colts have around $20 million in cap space to orchestrate a new contract for Hendrickson.', 'In a suggestion for the Commanders, Walder has the Bengals getting Jer’Zhan Newton, a third-round pick, and a seventh-round pick in exchange for Hendrickson:', 'Bengals get: DT Jer’Zhan Newton, 2026 third-round pick, 2027 seventh-round pick', 'Commanders get: Hendrickson', 'Why this deal makes sense for both sides: Washington is in win-now mode, but Dorance Armstrong is its best edge rusher. Adding Hendrickson, who recorded the second-best pass rush win rate at edge last season (24%), would be a huge boost.', 'Losing Newton would make an old defense older, but the Commanders have strong veteran options on the interior defensive line in Daron Payne, Javon Kinlaw and Deatrich Wise Jr. (who can move inside if needed). By including Newton in the deal, the Commanders can put together a feasible package without a second-round pick — they lost their 2026 second-round selection as part of the trade for offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil. Newton would be appealing to the Bengals as immediate help.', 'There is no reason to believe the Bengals would entertain either of these trades, but if they did, getting a young defensive tackle and two draft picks seems more like the way they would go.', 'What do you think of these proposals?

Trey Hendrickson to Eagles? Tyreek Hill to Patriots? Seven trades we'd like to see during NFL offseason,https://www.nfl.com/news/trey-hendrickson-to-eagles-tyreek-hill-to-patriots-seven-trades-we-d-like-to-see-during-nfl-offseason,"['The roster-building process for NFL teams proceeds into the summer months. Earlier this week, the 49ers acquired edge rusher Bryce Huff in a trade with the Eagles. Which deal could come next? Well, a number of players have requested trades this offseason, including 2024 sack leader Trey Hendrickson and two-time Pro Bowl CB Jaire Alexander. With all of that in mind, we asked our analysts this question:', 'Which trade do you want to see before the 2025 NFL season begins?', 'Trey Hendrickson to the Philadelphia Eagles.', '', ""The Eagles dominated the Chiefs in the Super Bowl with a relentless pass rush, but Philadelphia has questions on that front heading into the 2025 campaign, given the loss of Josh Sweat, Nolan Smith's injury and the inherent need for young guys like Moro Ojomo (2023 seventh-round pick) and Jalyx Hunt (2024 third-rounder) to level up. General manager Howie Roseman hit big on the trade for wide receiver A.J. Brown in 2022. Trading for Hendrickson, who's in a contract standoff with the Bengals, could provide a similar effect for the defense. Plus, the Eagles just cleared more cap space by dealing Huff. This would be a case of the rich getting richer -- and a move I wouldn't put past Philly. "", 'Tyreek Hill to the New England Patriots.', '', ""Hill has been at the center of Dolphins headlines this offseason. It actually started when he voiced his frustrations at the end of a disappointing 2024 campaign in Miami, both for the Fins (who finished below .500 for the first time since 2019) and Hill (who missed the Pro Bowl for the first time in his nine-year career). The star receiver publicly expressed a desire to play elsewhere, an idea the Dolphins nixed and Hill himself quickly backtracked on. However, I'm not convinced Miami will keep him, considering his off-field issues and the fact that the franchise can save nearly $15 million by moving him, per Over The Cap. The Dolphins might be wary of trading within the division, but if not, the Patriots and Drake Maye certainly could use Hill's services in the passing attack. New England has admirably overhauled the offense this offseason, and Hill would continue that trend by giving Josh McDaniels a guy who can elevate his attack to the next level due to his speed and field-stretching ability."", 'Trey Hendrickson to the Washington Commanders.', '', ""This situation seems to be worsening by the day, which is a great reason why the Bengals should move Hendrickson before the season. He clearly could supply tremendous value to another team -- since he led the league with 17.5 sacks last year -- and Cincinnati needs to change a downward trajectory after missing the last two postseasons. Washington is a contender that could desperately use the pass-rush help and has the cap space to make this move happen with QB Jayden Daniels on a rookie deal. It’s also apparent Cincy isn't willing to pay Hendrickson what he wants in a hyper-inflated edge rusher market. The Bengals thought they could appease him, Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins with new deals when the offseason began. Two out of three ain’t bad."", 'Jalen Ramsey to the Los Angeles Rams.', '', ""Ramsey and the Dolphins have mutually agreed to explore trade options, and there's no doubt the Rams are a realistic landing spot. Even head coach Sean McVay has commented on the possibility of reuniting with the veteran cornerback in Los Angeles, where Ramsey helped the franchise win a Super Bowl in the 2021 season. He is still playing at a high level despite turning 30 years old last October and would add championship experience to the team's secondary. If the two sides can strike a deal, it could be a key move in Los Angeles' quest to get back to the Super Bowl."", 'Trey Hendrickson to the New England Patriots.', '', ""The Bengals are unlikely to be interested in moving Hendrickson, as that's not how they roll. However, if there is a divorce, New England is a good new partner. Mike Vrabel could use a legit No. 1 edge to anchor his defense, and the Pats still have cap space. Sure, they've shelled out a lot on D already this offseason, but they should continue to take big swings while Drake Maye is still on a rookie deal. Adding Hendrickson would get them a big stride closer to threatening the Bills' divisional dominance."", 'Mark Andrews to the New York Jets.', '', ""There has been some speculation this offseason about the Ravens moving their longtime tight end. He's been a very reliable player (minus that drop in the Divisional Round loss), but this is a business after all. Andrews is a free agent in 2026, and with Baltimore needing to allocate money elsewhere (SEE: renegotiating Lamar Jackson's contract), the team could save $11 million against the cap and gain future draft capital by trading him. In come the Jets, who are in the middle of a rebuild and need more pieces to help Justin Fields jump-start the offense. New York did draft Mason Taylor in the second round, but bringing in Andrews for a year to aid this unit and mentor the rookie makes sense."", 'Beaux Limmer to the Detroit Lions.', '', 'As we head into summer, this is the time of year when sudden personnel losses spur action. Well, Detroit suffered a crushing blow this week with the abrupt retirement of Pro Bowler Frank Ragnow. What if the Lions replace one 6-foot-5 center out of Arkansas with another 6-foot-5 center out of Arkansas? Yes, Ragnow entered the league as a pedigreed first-rounder while Limmer didn’t come off the board until late in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Regardless, Limmer was immediately thrust into the lineup by injuries last season, and the rookie ultimately made 16 starts, including both Rams playoff games. Unfortunately, a couple tough snaps against Jalen Carter sealed Los Angeles’ fate in the Divisional Round loss at Philadelphia. And it was those kinds of pass-blocking breakdowns from the youngster that motivated the Rams to bring back old center Coleman Shelton in free agency, inherently sending Limmer to the bench. All in all, though, Limmer acquitted himself pretty well in Year 1, particularly as a run blocker. Detroit’s offensive line remains secure on the edges with Penei Sewell and Taylor Decker, but the interior is riddled with questions. The Lions just signed Trystan Colon, but I’d like to see them add more to the stew. Detroit’s rise has been fueled in a big way by a beastly offensive front, so the Lions can’t leave anything to chance with this unit. And Brad Holmes has already established a fruitful trading relationship with former boss Les Snead, so it’s not hard to imagine these two working out a deal here.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 NFL Enterprises LLC.

Always free!', 'As the Green Bay Packers bolstered the wide receiving corps during the 2025 NFL Draft, one veteran has seen his name frequently linked in potential trade conversations as training camp approaches. While Matthew Golden is likely to make a significant impact as a rookie, Jayden Reed might already be the Packers’ premier talent at the position, Dontayvion Wicks is a key contributor, and Savion Williams might carve out an immediate role as a possession receiver, it leaves some uncertainty surrounding Romeo Doubs. Why Romeo Doubs Could be Green Bay Packers’ Odd Man Out Doubs, entering the final year of his rookie contract, has pulled down 174 receptions for 1,700 yards and 15 touchdowns through his first three seasons, but the 2025 campaign may wind up being an audition. For his future with the Packers, and potentially for 31 other teams. Given that Doubs is entering the final year of his contract, the Packers will have a decision to make either by mid-season, or season’s end, if he isn’t traded well before then, whether to re-sign the 25-year-old or turn the keys over to the other young homegrown receivers the Packers have surrounded Love with across the past few draft classes. Over at Packers Wire, analyst Mark Oldacres suggests that Green Bay should let Doubs cash in elsewhere. “Doubs should have a strong market in free agency a year from now,” Odacres writes for PackersWire. “And be paid well, but barring a significant improvement in a host of areas this season, taking him from a slightly above average to difference-making wideout, it will not be Green Bay writing the check.” It remains to be seen just how robust Doubs’ market develops to be, but barring a breakout as a truly game-changing No. 1, Green Bay might be better off handing the keys to the passing game off to the other young receivers after this season, if not before.

The two are constantly seen goofing around with each other throughout the season. They have even joined each other for vacation, taking a trip to Mexico during the WNBA\'s Olympic break last July. Now, they have entered their second season together, starting off with a 3-4 record. However, Clark has been sidelined for the last three games due to a quad strain. But, just like in 2024, Hull seems to have more exciting plans for this Summer. On Thursday, she took to social media to announce the start date of her new basketball camp. ""I’m so excited to host my @SimpleTruth4U Basketball Camp this summer!"" Hull wrote on Instagram. ""We’ll work on all aspects of the game—skills, teamwork, confidence—and of course, HAVE FUN!"" Hull also noted that the event will take place on June 28 at Aletto Family Sports Center in Carmel, Indiana. Clark, as she often does, was left excited by Hull\'s new announcement, leaving a response in the comment section. ""Can\'t wait to attend,"" Clark said. ""Hoping we just do defensive slides all camp."" The camp is open to boys and girls in grades one through eight and costs $125 per participant. Hull will also be giving out memorabilia for each participant, including an autographed souvenir, a camp team photo with Hull and a limited-edition t-shirt. Through seven games in 2025, Hull is on her way to having the best season of her career. She is averaging 10.7 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game, while leading the WNBA in 3-point percentage at 55.6%. The Fever will have one game left until Clark can potentially return from injury, with a target date of June 10 against the Atlanta Dream. But for now, the focus will be Saturday\'s game against Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky.', 'The Chicago Blackhawks have done the thing where they surround a promising No. 1 pick with short-term veteran talent to show him the ropes. Now, the Blackhawks need to find long-term solutions to aid in the development of Connor Bedard and a team that needs to start winning again. New head coach Jeff Blashill and assistant coach Anders Sorensen like what the team has with its youth. But the Blackhawks must add savvy and experienced talent to start looking competent again. Blackhawks linked to veteran LW Shayna Goldman and Murat Ates of The Athletic wrote about potential landing spots for 29-year-old left winger Nikolaj Ehlers in free agency. They named the Blackhawks as a promising suitor for the veteran. “Chicago isn’t quite ready to (become a Stanley Cup contender) but has a lot of money to spend and a first-line, top-unit job alongside Connor Bedard on offer to this summer’s free agents,” they wrote. “Meanwhile, Ehlers is likely thinking long-term for his next contract — term that would buy Chicago time to continue its build. “If the 29-year-old Ehlers is willing to move from the Cup-contending Jets to the 31st-place Blackhawks — and wait — then Chicago should be able to put together a compelling package of ice time, opportunity and money. “For Chicago, the signing would be a clear indication to its market that the Blackhawks are on their way back — and motivation for fans to return the United Center to 100 percent capacity. Ehlers’ speed brings fans to their feet and he’s an easy sell in the community.” Ehlers would need a big bag from the Blackhawks Ehlers has been with the Winnipeg Jets since they drafted him with the No. 9 pick in the 2014 draft. He’s appeared in 674 games, recording 225 goals and 295 assists for 520 total points. The left-handed shooter scored five goals in eight playoff games this spring. Ehlers would be a great get for general manager Kyle Davidson this offseason. But money would have to be the main driver for the Blackhawks to land him, as Chicago isn’t ready for the success Ehlers has enjoyed with the Jets recently. In 15 games as a visitor to the United Center with the Jets, Ehlers has scored four goals and recorded four assists.', 'The Kansas City Chiefs\' run game last season with Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt left a lot to be desired. Averaging just 101.2 yards per game (ranked 26th), Patrick Mahomes didn\'t get much help from the ground, although Hunt was good at picking up the tough yards, but there was no threat of a breakaway out of the backfield. That might change now with the addition of running back Elijah Mitchell, who has speed to burn, but is coming off an injury that kept him out of the 2024 season. For NFL Network\'s Steve Wyche, he thinks that Mitchell, if he can stay healthy, could be the difference-maker in the backfield the Chiefs have been looking for. ""The Chiefs\' running game has to step up,"" Wyche said. ""I think a player to look out for is Elijah Mitchell, who has not been able to stay healthy, but he was killing it before the first knee issue. This is somebody, the competition in the running back room and he stays healthy, I think he can make it very interesting because running back, they need explosive play."" Mitchell, in his rookie season, showed what kind of talent he has, rushing for 963 yards and five touchdowns for the San Francisco 49ers in 2021, but injuries have since derailed his progress and that led to Christian McCaffrey signing with the NFC West team with just 16 games played in the last two seasons for Mitchell. Now a Chief, he will hopefully bring a speed element to the run game, and that is something the offense has missed in the past couple of seasons. Hunt and Pacheco are servicable backs, but they don\'t possess the home-run threat that Mitchell does. Of course, as Wyche mentioned, health will play a major role in how effective Mitchell can be. But if, and that\'s a big if, he can avoid the treatment room, he might just be the ace up Andy Reid\'s sleeve in 2025.', 'Join hundreds of thousands of readers who start their day with The Morning Bark, the best newsletter in sports.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNDVaa05TTVZka2MwaFpTV1o1VFJDUUF4ai1CU2dLTWdzQmtJWWh3MlFIN0NrVmJB=-w280-h168-p-df

Solak also notes that the Lions have plenty of salary cap space to offer Hendrickson an extension—something the veteran has been very vocal about during his past two offseasons. A deal in the range of three years, $90 million, could be enough to keep him in Detroit, according to Bengals beat writer Ben Baby.', 'From the Bengals’ perspective, the proposed trade offers solid long-term value. Baby praised Solak’s proposal, calling it a “very good” deal for Cincinnati.', '“Let’s say the Lions give Hendrickson a three-year deal worth $90 million. It is less than what the Texans gave Danielle Hunter… which would be a bargain for Detroit if Hendrickson continues his All-Pro form,” Baby said about the possible terms of an extension.', 'Another benefit of trading Hendrickson to an NFC team like Detroit is that it avoids strengthening a potential AFC playoff rival, and the future draft picks would give Cincinnati more roster flexibility as they look to build around Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins—all of whom are inked to massive contracts through 2028.', 'While this is far from the first time we’ve heard of someone pairing an All-Pro edge rusher with Hutchinson, Hendrickson’s age and highly publicized contract dispute does give this rumor more legs than the Myles Garrett and Maxx Crosby rumors of yesteryear.

Likely Price To Acquire Trey Hendrickson Has Been Revealed,https://www.sportsmockery.com/chicago-bears/likely-price-to-acquire-trey-hendrickson-has-been-revealed/,"['-', 'The Chicago Bears did an admirable job addressing their roster needs this offseason. Through a mix of trades, free agency, and the draft, they feel like a team that upgraded at some important spots. That is especially true on offense, where they found three new starters for the offensive line and two highly talented playmakers: Colston Loveland and Luther Burden. Still, many fear one area is too much of a question mark. That is the pass rush. Dayo Odeyingbo and Grady Jarrett should help, but neither comes across as a true sack specialist. This is why many still wonder if the Bears could make a late play for Trey Hendrickson.', 'He is everything the team needs, having led the NFL with 17.5 sacks last season. Though in his 30s, there is no reason to think he’s in danger of declining. Not only that, but he also has ties to defensive coordinator Dennis Allen from their time together in New Orleans. The problem is the price tag. Nobody knows what it would cost to get him. ESPN finally provided some clarity on that in a recent column.', 'JEREMY FOWLER’S OFFER:', 'BENGALS GET: 2026 SECOND-ROUND PICK, 2027 FIFTH-ROUND PICK', 'COLTS GET: HENDRICKSON', 'DAN GRAZIANO’S OFFER:', 'BENGALS GET: 2026 SECOND-ROUND PICK', 'BILLS GET: HENDRICKSON', 'BEN SOLAK’S OFFER:', 'BENGALS GET: 2026 SECOND-ROUND PICK, 2027 FOURTH-ROUND PICK (CAN BECOME A THIRD-ROUNDER WITH PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS)', 'LIONS GET: HENDRICKSON, 2026 FIFTH-ROUND PICK', 'That and a significant contract extension, which is the reason he’s holding out in the first place. Are the Bears prepared to pay that price tag? GM Ryan Poles has already shown a willingness to swing trades like this. He sent a 2nd round pick to Washington for Montez Sweat in 2023 before handing him a lucrative extension. The key difference is that Sweat was a few years younger and didn’t cost as much money annually. Trading for Trey Hendrickson would be a clear signal from the Bears that they feel they’re one piece away from a deep playoff run. There is no doubt a Sweat-Hendrickson combo would be hard to contain. The issue would be how expensive it’d be and how long they can stay productive.', 'Nope. I could see sniffing at Za’Darious Smith for one year maybe till we draft our new DE. No 3 year deal for Hendrickson no matter how good he HAS BEEN.', 'I don’t see the Bears throwing big money out anymore. I think they build through the draft.', 'Apparently the Bengals offered him $28M for next season and he declined it wanting more money and more years. It’s been said that he wants a 3 year contract averaging $35M/year which is what Maxx Crosby got. While I would love to have Hendrickson in the team, I can’t justify that type of contract for him at the age he’s at. The Bears would need to restructure a few contracts fitting him on the roster which means future dead cap. Poles finally got the dead cap to 0 after Ryan Pace racked it up for several years. There will be… Read more »', 'I’m looking forward to the 2026 and 2027 NFL Drafts to be Superbowl conscious. It might take two more drafts to cleanse the Bears of Poles’ mediocre talent and dead weight players. Just keep the Re-Rebuild going. Perhaps by that time the new stadium will be built. If not, the Bears can play their home games in London and St. Louis.', 'The Bills are last in the league in cap space, IIRC. Gesicki is the Bengals starting TE, and I’d try to work Kmet into the trade, or Stevenson, Braxton, Brisker…', '34sweetness, in an ideal world with good team health, we could peak in the playoffs and win a few games, especially adding fangs to our pass rush.

The Lions are still legitimate Super Bowl contenders and should behave as such with aggressive veteran trades.

First it was Myles Garrett, then it was Maxx Crosby, and now it's Trey Hendrickson. Just do something, guys – we're not picky. I have no idea if it's going to work, but the Finally Pulling Off The Big One is the NFL's time-honored way of announcing to the league that you will, in fact, be making a Super Bowl run this year.

While Matthew Golden is likely to make a significant impact as a rookie, Jayden Reed might already be the Packers’ premier talent at the position, Dontayvion Wicks is a key contributor, and Savion Williams might carve out an immediate role as a possession receiver, it leaves some uncertainty surrounding Romeo Doubs. Why Romeo Doubs Could be Green Bay Packers’ Odd Man Out Doubs, entering the final year of his rookie contract, has pulled down 174 receptions for 1,700 yards and 15 touchdowns through his first three seasons, but the 2025 campaign may wind up being an audition. For his future with the Packers, and potentially for 31 other teams. Given that Doubs is entering the final year of his contract, the Packers will have a decision to make either by mid-season, or season’s end, if he isn’t traded well before then, whether to re-sign the 25-year-old or turn the keys over to the other young homegrown receivers the Packers have surrounded Love with across the past few draft classes. Over at Packers Wire, analyst Mark Oldacres suggests that Green Bay should let Doubs cash in elsewhere. “Doubs should have a strong market in free agency a year from now,” Odacres writes for PackersWire. “And be paid well, but barring a significant improvement in a host of areas this season, taking him from a slightly above average to difference-making wideout, it will not be Green Bay writing the check.” It remains to be seen just how robust Doubs’ market develops to be, but barring a breakout as a truly game-changing No. 1, Green Bay might be better off handing the keys to the passing game off to the other young receivers after this season, if not before.

The two are constantly seen goofing around with each other throughout the season. They have even joined each other for vacation, taking a trip to Mexico during the WNBA\'s Olympic break last July. Now, they have entered their second season together, starting off with a 3-4 record. However, Clark has been sidelined for the last three games due to a quad strain. But, just like in 2024, Hull seems to have more exciting plans for this Summer. On Thursday, she took to social media to announce the start date of her new basketball camp. ""I’m so excited to host my @SimpleTruth4U Basketball Camp this summer!"" Hull wrote on Instagram. ""We’ll work on all aspects of the game—skills, teamwork, confidence—and of course, HAVE FUN!"" Hull also noted that the event will take place on June 28 at Aletto Family Sports Center in Carmel, Indiana. Clark, as she often does, was left excited by Hull\'s new announcement, leaving a response in the comment section. ""Can\'t wait to attend,"" Clark said. ""Hoping we just do defensive slides all camp."" The camp is open to boys and girls in grades one through eight and costs $125 per participant. Hull will also be giving out memorabilia for each participant, including an autographed souvenir, a camp team photo with Hull and a limited-edition t-shirt. Through seven games in 2025, Hull is on her way to having the best season of her career. She is averaging 10.7 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game, while leading the WNBA in 3-point percentage at 55.6%. The Fever will have one game left until Clark can potentially return from injury, with a target date of June 10 against the Atlanta Dream. But for now, the focus will be Saturday\'s game against Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky.', 'The Chicago Blackhawks have done the thing where they surround a promising No. 1 pick with short-term veteran talent to show him the ropes. Now, the Blackhawks need to find long-term solutions to aid in the development of Connor Bedard and a team that needs to start winning again. New head coach Jeff Blashill and assistant coach Anders Sorensen like what the team has with its youth. But the Blackhawks must add savvy and experienced talent to start looking competent again. Blackhawks linked to veteran LW Shayna Goldman and Murat Ates of The Athletic wrote about potential landing spots for 29-year-old left winger Nikolaj Ehlers in free agency. They named the Blackhawks as a promising suitor for the veteran. “Chicago isn’t quite ready to (become a Stanley Cup contender) but has a lot of money to spend and a first-line, top-unit job alongside Connor Bedard on offer to this summer’s free agents,” they wrote. “Meanwhile, Ehlers is likely thinking long-term for his next contract — term that would buy Chicago time to continue its build. “If the 29-year-old Ehlers is willing to move from the Cup-contending Jets to the 31st-place Blackhawks — and wait — then Chicago should be able to put together a compelling package of ice time, opportunity and money. “For Chicago, the signing would be a clear indication to its market that the Blackhawks are on their way back — and motivation for fans to return the United Center to 100 percent capacity. Ehlers’ speed brings fans to their feet and he’s an easy sell in the community.” Ehlers would need a big bag from the Blackhawks Ehlers has been with the Winnipeg Jets since they drafted him with the No. 9 pick in the 2014 draft. He’s appeared in 674 games, recording 225 goals and 295 assists for 520 total points. The left-handed shooter scored five goals in eight playoff games this spring. Ehlers would be a great get for general manager Kyle Davidson this offseason. But money would have to be the main driver for the Blackhawks to land him, as Chicago isn’t ready for the success Ehlers has enjoyed with the Jets recently. In 15 games as a visitor to the United Center with the Jets, Ehlers has scored four goals and recorded four assists.', 'The Kansas City Chiefs\' run game last season with Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt left a lot to be desired. Averaging just 101.2 yards per game (ranked 26th), Patrick Mahomes didn\'t get much help from the ground, although Hunt was good at picking up the tough yards, but there was no threat of a breakaway out of the backfield. That might change now with the addition of running back Elijah Mitchell, who has speed to burn, but is coming off an injury that kept him out of the 2024 season. For NFL Network\'s Steve Wyche, he thinks that Mitchell, if he can stay healthy, could be the difference-maker in the backfield the Chiefs have been looking for. ""The Chiefs\' running game has to step up,"" Wyche said. ""I think a player to look out for is Elijah Mitchell, who has not been able to stay healthy, but he was killing it before the first knee issue. This is somebody, the competition in the running back room and he stays healthy, I think he can make it very interesting because running back, they need explosive play."" Mitchell, in his rookie season, showed what kind of talent he has, rushing for 963 yards and five touchdowns for the San Francisco 49ers in 2021, but injuries have since derailed his progress and that led to Christian McCaffrey signing with the NFC West team with just 16 games played in the last two seasons for Mitchell. Now a Chief, he will hopefully bring a speed element to the run game, and that is something the offense has missed in the past couple of seasons. Hunt and Pacheco are servicable backs, but they don\'t possess the home-run threat that Mitchell does. Of course, as Wyche mentioned, health will play a major role in how effective Mitchell can be. But if, and that\'s a big if, he can avoid the treatment room, he might just be the ace up Andy Reid\'s sleeve in 2025.', 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.

Blockbuster Trade Idea Brings All-Pro Edge to Colts,https://www.si.com/nfl/colts/news/colts-blockbuster-trade-all-pro-trey-hendrickson,"[""The Indianapolis Colts are in the thick of the NFL offseason as teams across the league are beginning OTAs. The 2025 season will be decisive for the Colts, who may clean house if results aren't up to standard once again."", ""The Colts already parted ways with defensive coordinator Gus Bradley at the end of last season following a string of disappointing performances. The worst of the bunch was a 45-33 loss to the three-win New York Giants, which ended Indianapolis' hopes of making the postseason."", ""Blame can be passed around, but the bottom line is the defense wasn't good enough. In an effort to solve the issue, the Colts hired former Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, a coach who's known for his creative schemes."", 'Anarumo immediately brought in cornerback Charvarius Ward and safety Cam Bynum to repair the secondary, but the defensive line could still use some help. Throughout the offseason, the Colts have been linked to Bengals pass rusher Trey Hendrickson, who has close ties to Anarumo.', 'A new mock trade from Jeremy Fowler at ESPN sends Hendrickson to the Colts in exchange for a couple of picks.', '""This sort of urgent move from Indy general manager Chris Ballard would solidify the edge of new coordinator Lou Anarumo\'s defense,"" wrote Fowler. ""Anarumo would gladly reunite with Hendrickson after they spent four seasons together in Cincinnati. It\'s clear the Bengals aren\'t getting a first-rounder for Hendrickson -- or else a deal would have been done by now -- but the elite pass rusher still has immense value. They would be smart to capitalize on a trade like this if they aren\'t going to pay him what he wants. The Colts have around $20 million in cap space to orchestrate a new contract for Hendrickson.""', ""What happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!"", ""In reality, sending a second-round pick and a fifth-round pick in exchange for one of the league's best rushers would be a steal. Unfortunately, Hendrickson is also looking for a lucrative contract extension that might not fit the Colts' remaining cap space."", ""Cap aside, the deal would instantly boost Indianapolis' pass rush. Since Hendrickson signed with the Bengals in 2021, he's racked up 57 sacks over four seasons. He's tallied 17.5 sacks in each of the last two years, numbers that are only comparable to Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt."", ""Hendrickson thrived in Anarumo's scheme in Cincinnati, making him a prime candidate to pack his bags and follow his coach to a fresh start. Before this year's NFL draft, it was reported that the Bengals wanted at least a first-round pick for Hendrickson. That hasn't happened, making it almost guaranteed that the final purchase will be less costly."", ""With only $20 million in cap space, it's unrealistic to expect the Colts to pay upward of $35 million annually for an edge rusher unless they're completely set on him being the truth. On his current contract, Hendrickson will have a cap hit of just under $20 million, the perfect number for Indianapolis."", 'The Colts and general manager Chris Ballard have a few more months to decide if they want to make a splash for one of the best quarterback threats in football.', 'Recommended Articles', 'Sean Ackerman is a staff writer and broadcaster covering the NBA and NFL for three On SI publications.', ""© 2025\nABG-SI LLC\n- SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

Lions trade proposal for Bengals' Trey Hendrickson picked as winning bid by ESPN,https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2025/06/04/lions-nfl-trey-hendrickson-trade-bengals/84032154007/,"[""Trey Hendrickson traded to the Detroit Lions.

Both sides just need to look to us writers for a fair trade."", ""At least, that's what ESPN.com concluded after four writers proposed four trades between the Cincinnati Bengals for four different teams. The best offer?"", ""That's right, it was the Lions with the winning bid for the NFL's reigning sack leader. (He has 17½ sacks each of the past two seasons.)"", 'The offer came from ESPN writer Ben Solak, who proposed an exchange of three draft picks and Hendrickson, 30.', 'Solak writes the Lions should behave like a legitimate Super Bowl contender, which they are, and make an aggressive trade for a proven player. He notes they have ""plenty of cap space to extend Hendrickson,"" who has one year remaining on his deal and wants a new deal, which is the impetus for his trade demand. The Lions have the third-most cap space remaining for 2025.', ""Ben Baby, ESPN's Bengals reporter, chose the Lions' offer over ones pitched for the Indianapolis Colts, Buffalo Bills and Washington Commanders, and believes it's a realistic offer that could get a deal done."", '""By acquiring picks in 2026 and 2027, the value of the trade would be prolonged for the Bengals over the course of those players\' respective rookie deals,"" Baby writes, mentioning that sending Hendrickson to the NFC instead of a rival AFC contender like the Bills is a bonus.', ""The Lions do not have a feared pass rusher outside of Hutchinson, who is coming off a gruesome leg injury last October that required emergency surgery. He missed the Lions' final 13 games including their playoff loss."", 'The Lions also have top defensive tackle Alim McNeill coming off a torn ACL in December, likely setting him up to miss the start to the 2025 season.', ""Hendrickson, named an All-Pro last season, would give the Lions perhaps the most dangerous pairing of edge rushers in the NFL. Even though he's not the run stopper the Lions have prioritized under Holmes and coach Dan Campbell, Hendrickson's track record hunting the quarterback is top tier."", 'He also played his first four seasons in New Orleans while Campbell was a Saints assistant, so the familiarity is there.', ""We know Lions fans would love it: When asked in early March which big move they'd most like to see the Lions make this offseason, 42% of 3,111 responses said a Hendrickson trade. That was more than double the next most popular move."", ""But will it happen? It's very unlikely, according to our Lions beat writer Dave Birkett."", '""I haven\'t gotten any indication the Lions are serious players to add Hendrickson. In fact, all signs point to the opposite,"" Birkett wrote recently in response to a mailbag question. ""Hendrickson wants a contract that makes him one of the highest-paid edge rushers in the NFL, and that price point — $35 million annually? — doesn\'t jibe with how the Lions are operating financially.""', 'Of course, that could change at training camp or, more likely, the trade deadline. The Lions have previously inquired about Maxx Crosby and Myles Garrett, but the more likely move, Birkett wrote, is adding a veteran edge player on a one-year contract to add depth. ', 'Hendrickson wants a new contract with his current one set to expire after the 2025 season. Pro Bowl-caliber players do not like to risk playing on an expiring contract due to the high rate of injury, especially one like Hendrickson who turns 31 in December. In 2023, he signed a one-year extension with an $8 million signing bonus.', ""He requested a trade in the 2024 offseason while seeking a long-term deal, but the Bengals declined. He eventually played out the season, and now says he won't play for the team without a long-term deal."", ""As for the price tag of an extension for Hendrickson, it won't be cheap. Garrett, 29, recently got a new deal from the Cleveland Browns worth $40 million per year, but Hendrickson will likely not reach that number. Danielle Hunter, 30, signed an extension with the Houston Texans in March that will see him make $55.1 million over the next two years, which could be in the ballpark of where Hendrickson is looking to get paid."", ""Cincinnati, which sees itself as a Super Bowl contender, agreed to let him and his representatives seek out a trade, but clearly the compensation in return has not met the Bengals' asking price.

And even then, they likely would have required a pass rusher in return, not knowing how the draft would play out for them.', 'The Bengals have a long-standing philosophy that they view all seasons as equal and don’t have any interest in sacrificing one year for another.', 'That usually refences the “all-in” philosophy of mortgaging the future to go after a title in the current season.', 'In this case, the Bengals wouldn’t exactly be punting on 2025 by dealing Hendrickson, but it would be a bad look and a bad decision, no matter how disillusioned he is with head coach Zac Taylor and the front office or how dug-in he is on the idea of not playing this year on his current contract.', 'They own the majority of the leverage here, and there is just no way they are going to trade Hendrickson for anything less than some sort of asset that helps them win games in 2025.', 'The only one of the four proposals that include a player in return was made by Seth Walder, who has the Washington Commanders sending the Bengals defensive tackle Jer’Zhan Newton, a third-round pick in 2026 and a seventh-round pick in 2027 for Hendrickson.', 'Newton isn’t going to come anywhere close to matching the 17.5 sacks Hendrickson recorded each of the last two seasons (he had two sacks in 16 games last year).', 'But he plays a position of need, and he was a second-round pick last year, which means the Bengals would have him on a rookie contract for three seasons.', 'Plus he plays a position of need that surprisingly wasn’t addressed in this year’s draft.', 'Still, this type of deal would be a shocking departure from the way the Bengals operate and would have a far greater chance of being one of the worst trades in team history than it would of it going down as one of the best.', 'Jeremy Fowler’s proposal had the Indianapolis Colts sending the Bengals a 2026 second-round pick and 2027 fifth for Hendrickson.', 'Dan Graziano’s proposal had the Buffalo Bills sending the Bengals a 2026 second-round pick for Hendrickson.', 'And Ben Solak’s proposal had the Detroit Lions sending the Bengals a 2026 second-round pick and a 2027 fourth that could become a third with performance conditions for Hendrickson and a 2026 fifth-round pick.', 'You can read the full list and details of the ESPN trade proposals here.', 'Jay Morrison covers the Cincinnati Bengals for Bengals On SI.

""Hendrickson may not be the sort of war daddy pass rusher such as Myles Garrett and Nick Bosa, who both demanded market-changing deals.
