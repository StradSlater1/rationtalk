I believe that these systems could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off.‚Äù', 'Amodei added, ‚ÄúWithout a clear plan for a federal response, a moratorium would give us the worst of both worlds ‚Äî no ability for states to act, and no national policy as a backstop.‚Äù', 'The tech executive outlined some of the risks that his company, as well as others, have discovered during experimental stress tests of AI systems.', 'He described a scenario in which a person tells a bot it will soon be replaced with a newer model.

He said his company publishes results of studies voluntarily but called on the federal government to make these steps mandatory.', '‚ÄúAt the federal level, instead of a moratorium, the White House and Congress should work together on a transparency standard for A.I. companies, so that emerging risks are made clear to the American people,‚Äù Amodei wrote.', 'He also noted the standard should require AI developers to adopt policies for testing models and publicly disclose them, as well as require that they outline steps they plan to take to mitigate risk. The companies, the executive continued, would ‚Äúhave to be upfront‚Äù about steps taken after test results to make sure models were safe.', '‚ÄúHaving this national transparency standard would help not only the public but also Congress understand how the technology is developing, so that lawmakers can decide whether further government action is needed,‚Äù he added.', 'Amodei also suggested state laws should follow a similar model that is ‚Äúnarrowly focused on transparency and not overly prescriptive or burdensome.‚Äù Those laws could then be superseded if a national transparency standard is adopted, Amodei said.', 'He noted the issue is not a partisan one, praising steps Trump has taken to support domestic development of AI systems.', '‚ÄúThis is not about partisan politics. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have long raised concerns about A.I. and about the risks of abdicating our responsibility to steward it well,‚Äù the executive wrote. ‚ÄúI support what the Trump administration has done to clamp down on the export of A.I. chips to China and to make it easier to build A.I. infrastructure here in the United States.‚Äù', '‚ÄúThis is about responding in a wise and balanced way to extraordinary times,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúFaced with a revolutionary technology of uncertain benefits and risks, our government should be able to ensure we make rapid progress, beat China and build A.I. that is safe and trustworthy.

What would that mean for privacy and transparency?', 'OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testifies on Capitol Hill about artificial intelligence policy this month.', 'Congress would slam the brakes on any state rules and laws around artificial intelligence under language in the big federal spending bill now before the US Senate. Proponents say such a move would help the industry grow and compete with AI developers in China, while critics say it would limit the power of anyone but the federal government to put guardrails around a technology that is quickly becoming a major part of our lives.', 'The proposal says no state or political subdivision ""may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems or automated decision systems"" for 10 years. In May, the House of Representatives narrowly voted to approve the full budget bill, which also includes the extension of the 2017 federal tax cuts and cuts to services like Medicaid and SNAP.', ""AI developers and some lawmakers have said federal action is necessary to keep states from creating a patchwork of different rules and regulations across the US that could slow the technology's growth. The rapid growth in generative AI since OpenAI's ChatGPT exploded on the scene in late 2022 has led companies to fit the technology in as many spaces as possible. The economic implications are significant, as the US and China race to see which country's tech will predominate, but generative AI poses privacy, transparency and other risks for consumers that lawmakers have sought to temper."", '""We need, as an industry and as a country, one clear federal standard, whatever it may be,"" Alexandr Wang, founder and CEO of the data company Scale AI, told lawmakers during an April hearing. ""But we need one, we need clarity as to one federal standard and have preemption to prevent this outcome where you have 50 different standards.""', 'Not all AI companies are backing a moratorium, however. In a New York Times op-ed, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei called it ""far too blunt an instrument,"" saying the federal government should create transparency standards for AI companies instead. ""Having this national transparency standard would help not only the public but also Congress understand how the technology is developing, so that lawmakers can decide whether further government action is needed.""', 'Efforts to limit the ability of states to regulate artificial intelligence could mean fewer consumer protections around a technology that is increasingly seeping into every aspect of American life. ""There have been a lot of discussions at the state level, and I would think that it\'s important for us to approach this problem at multiple levels,"" said Anjana Susarla, a professor at Michigan State University who studies AI. ""We could approach it at the national level. We can approach it at the state level too. I think we need both.""', 'The proposed language would bar states from enforcing any regulation, including those already on the books. The exceptions are rules and laws that make things easier for AI development and those that apply the same standards to non-AI models and systems that do similar things. These kinds of regulations are already starting to pop up. The biggest focus is not in the US, but in Europe, where the European Union has already implemented standards for AI. But states are starting to get in on the action.', 'Colorado passed a set of consumer protections last year, set to go into effect in 2026. California adopted more than a dozen AI-related laws last year. Other states have laws and regulations that often deal with specific issues such as deepfakes or require AI developers to publish information about their training data. At the local level, some regulations also address potential employment discrimination if AI systems are used in hiring.', '""States are all over the map when it comes to what they want to regulate in AI,"" said Arsen Kourinian, a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown. So far in 2025, state lawmakers have introduced at least 550 proposals around AI, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the House committee hearing last month, Rep. Jay Obernolte, a Republican from California, signaled a desire to get ahead of more state-level regulation. ""We have a limited amount of legislative runway to be able to get that problem solved before the states get too far ahead,"" he said.', 'While some states have laws on the books, not all of them have gone into effect or seen any enforcement. That limits the potential short-term impact of a moratorium, said Cobun Zweifel-Keegan, managing director in Washington for the International Association of Privacy Professionals. ""There isn\'t really any enforcement yet."" ', 'A moratorium would likely deter state legislators and policymakers from developing and proposing new regulations, Zweifel-Keegan said. ""The federal government would become the primary and potentially sole regulator around AI systems,"" he said.', 'AI developers have asked for any guardrails placed on their work to be consistent and streamlined. During a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, that an EU-style regulatory system ""would be disastrous"" for the industry. Altman suggested instead that the industry develop its own standards.', 'Asked by Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, if industry self-regulation is enough at the moment, Altman said he thought some guardrails would be good, but ""It\'s easy for it to go too far. As I have learned more about how the world works, I am more afraid that it could go too far and have really bad consequences."" (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, parent company of CNET, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)', 'Concerns from companies, both the developers that create AI systems and the ""deployers"" who use them in interactions with consumers, often stem from fears that states will mandate significant work such as impact assessments or transparency notices before a product is released, Kourinian said. Consumer advocates have said more regulations are needed, and hampering the ability of states could hurt the privacy and safety of users.', '""AI is being used widely to make decisions about people\'s lives without transparency, accountability or recourse -- it\'s also facilitating chilling fraud, impersonation and surveillance,"" Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement. ""A 10-year pause would lead to more discrimination, more deception and less control -- simply put, it\'s siding with tech companies over the people they impact.""', 'A moratorium on specific state rules and laws could result in more consumer protection issues being dealt with in court or by state attorneys general, Kourinian said. Existing laws around unfair and deceptive practices that are not specific to AI would still apply. ""Time will tell how judges will interpret those issues,"" he said.', 'Susarla said the pervasiveness of AI across industries means states might be able to regulate issues like privacy and transparency more broadly, without focusing on the technology. But a moratorium on AI regulation could lead to such policies being tied up in lawsuits. ""It has to be some kind of balance between \'we don\'t want to stop innovation,\' but on the other hand, we also need to recognize that there can be real consequences,"" she said.', 'Much policy around the governance of AI systems does happen because of those so-called technology-agnostic rules and laws, Zweifel-Keegan said. ""It\'s worth also remembering that there are a lot of existing laws and there is a potential to make new laws that don\'t trigger the moratorium but do apply to AI systems as long as they apply to other systems,"" he said.', 'A proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI laws is now in the hands of the Senate, where the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee has already held hearings on artificial intelligence. ', 'With the bill now in the hands of the US Senate -- and with more people becoming aware of the proposal -- debate over the moratorium has picked up. Senators of both parties, including Republican Sens. Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn, have voiced their concerns. In the Senate, the measure could be stripped out of the budget because of the so-called Byrd Rule, which prohibits anything that is not a budgetary issue from being included in a reconciliation bill. ', 'Whatever bill the Senate approves will then also have to be accepted by the House, where it passed by the narrowest of margins. Even some House members who voted for the bill have said they don\'t like the moratorium, namely Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a key ally of President Trump. The Georgia Republican posted on X this week that she is ""adamantly OPPOSED"" to the moratorium and that she would not vote for the bill with the moratorium included.

The bill currently calls for ‚Äú$500,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2034, to modernize and secure Federal information technology systems through the deployment of commercial artificial intelligence.‚Äù', 'Under the bill, a whopping $124 million will be earmarked to ‚ÄúTest Resource Management Center artificial intelligence capabilities,‚Äù while another $145 million would go into the development of ‚Äúartificial intelligence to enable one-way attack unmanned aerial systems and naval systems.‚Äù', 'For those that don‚Äôt speak bureaucrat, that means money for AI-powered human resources management and more money to build suicide drones.', 'Most notably, the bill will include a 10-year period barring states from passing any new legislation that would affect the development of AI technologies. The move would essentially make the federal government the sole authority when it comes to regulation of artificial intelligence.', 'The bill also includes $685 million for ‚Äúmilitary cryptographic modernization activities‚Äù and $250 million that would be spent on the Quantum Benchmarcking Initiative.', 'On the surface, the numbers themselves may seem mind-boggling to those unfamiliar with the U.S. government budget, but as the old saying goes: a billion here, a billion there, eventually it all starts to add up.', 'The bill and the overall government budget have been subject to criticism. Senate Democrats have sought protections for the Cyber Security Review Board (CSRB), the agency that oversees reviews on cyberattacks and data breach incidents.', 'Critics have suggested that, by not committing to funding the organization, key checks and reviews of organizations that expose customer data to threat actors will no longer be possible.', 'Legislators, including House Republicans, have expressed concern that the Trump administration‚Äôs proposed budget could bring about as much as a 20% cut in funding for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and cuts to critical defenses against foreign threat actors.', ""Similarly, there is concern among critics that the bill and the Trump administration's agenda neglects security concerns, including to vulnerability records the cybersecurity industry depends on. The future of MITRE‚Äôs CVE database was thrown into doubt. While the CVE database was ultimately funded for another year, the long-term outlook for the organization and its database remains in doubt."", 'Not surprisingly, the One Big Beautiful Bill has come under some scrutiny and criticism, though not from a source most people would have expected. Trump advisor and financial-backer Elon Musk appears to have some buyer‚Äôs remorse and is now lamenting the bill and the associated increase in debt that will be created.', 'There is, however, some portions of the bill that could be good news for IT vendors and enterprises. The Big Beautiful Bill‚Äôs provisions for AI could provide some much-needed guidance on how AI could be managed.', 'Dustin Sachs, a cybersecurity expert and chief technologist for the CyberRisk Collaborative, told SC Media that by taking responsibility for AI policy, the federal government can clarify policy that would otherwise vary from state to state.', '‚ÄúOne of the complaints we have had about data privacy has been that there hasn‚Äôt been a federal response,‚Äù Sachs said.', '‚ÄúFrom an enterprise standpoint, there is an advantage to have the federal government involved and not the states.‚Äù', 'Additionally, Sachs noted that the introduction of AI might not necessarily mean a lapse in accountability and vigilance for federal agencies.', '‚ÄúThere has been talk about the need for modernization for years‚Äù the analyst noted. ‚ÄúThere is a misnomer that it is about replacing human decision-making, it is about easing human decision-making.‚Äù', 'Satyam Sinha, CEO of AI security provider Acuvity similarly noted the need for a unified policy regarding AI management.', '""AI is incredibly transformative as a technology which can make incredible progress for a nation or for that matter in businesses becoming more efficient,"" Sinha told SC Media.', '""It\'s in the nascent stages and fragmented regulations the way they are can stifle the growth, which can be a setback. If we look at innovation in the biometrics area, it becomes very hard for businesses to apply fragmented rules.""', 'Not everyone is sold on the plans for AI management. Virginia Sen. Mark Warren told SC Media that by putting AI regulations in the hands of Congress instead of the states, the Trump administration could be preventing much-needed oversight of the market.', '""The underlying technology behind ChatGPT and most of the frontier models has been out since 2017 and it has been nearly three years since ChatGPT‚Äôs release captured the attention of Americans ‚Äî both for its positive applications and also its many obvious misuses.
