Watch 'superorganism' created by tiny worms — the first time it's ever been spotted in the wild,https://www.livescience.com/animals/watch-superorganism-created-by-tiny-worms-the-first-time-its-ever-been-spotted-in-the-wild,"['The bizarre behavior had previously been observed in experimental settings and was thought to be a competitive attempt to escape from the rest of the group. But new research suggests a more cooperative motivation.', '', 'Nematodes have been spotted forming writhing towers of tiny worms in the wild for the first time, according to a report in the journal Current Biology.', 'The bizarre behavior had previously only been observed in experimental settings, thought to be a competitive attempt to escape from the rest of the group. However, new images of these towers forming in the wild hint at a more mutually-beneficial motivation.', 'The footage was captured by researchers in Konstanz, Germany, on fallen apples and pears at local orchards. The team from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (MPI-AB) and the University of Konstanz were then able to combine these images with follow-up laboratory experiments to demonstrate that the “towering” behavior happens naturally, and that the worms engage in such behaviour as a means of mass transit.', '“I was ecstatic when I saw these natural towers for the first time,” said senior author Serena Ding, group leader at the MPI-AB, describing the moment when co-author Ryan Greenway, a biologist at the University of Konstanz, sent her a video recording from the field. “For so long natural worm towers existed only in our imaginations. But with the right equipment and lots of curiosity, we found them hiding in plain sight.”', 'That curiosity also revealed some interesting aspects of worm cooperation. While the researchers observed many nematode species crawling inside the fruit, only a single species in the same developmental period — a tough larval stage known as a “dauer” — participated in tower building. That level of species specificity in worm tower “construction” hinted that there might be more driving the behavior than a seemingly random creature cluster.', 'Related: Nematode resurrected from Siberian permafrost lay dormant for 46,000 years', '“A nematode tower is not just a pile of worms,” said study first author Daniela Perez, a postdoctoral researcher at MPI-AB. “It’s a coordinated structure, a superorganism in motion.”', 'The paper suggested these observations could serve as a “missing link” into behavior of similar organisms. Such towering behavior has previously been observed in slime molds, fire ants and spider mites, but it is still relatively rare in nature.', 'To see if other kinds of worms could also form such a “superorganism”, researchers created conditions to coach the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans into assembling into similar structures. C. elegans is a model organism that is widely studied for both its behavior and biology.', 'Perez stuck a toothbrush bristle into a food-free agar plate to act as a sort scaffold — then unleashed the worms. Within two hours, the C. elegans formed a tower using the bristle as its spine. Some smaller clusters of worms reached out exploratory “arms,” while others bridged gaps between spaces. And when researchers tapped the top of the tower with a glass pick, the worms wriggled toward that stimulus.', '“The towers are actively sensing and growing,” says Perez. “When we touched them, they responded immediately, growing toward the stimulus and attaching to it.”', '—Why do worms come out in the rain?', ""—Australian 'trash parrots' have now developed a local 'drinking tradition'"", '—Wandering salamander: The tree‑climbing amphibian with a blood‑powered grip', 'The researchers also wondered if there was some sort of worm hierarchy driving this activity. Did younger worms have to do all the work? Stronger ones? Smaller, weaker ones?', 'It turns out that the roundworms were remarkably egalitarian in their efforts. Unlike the orchard-based nematodes, the laboratory-bound C. elegans represented a range of life stages, from larval to adult — but they all pitched in. That suggests “towering” may be a more generalized strategy for group movement than previously thought.', '“Our study opens up a whole new system for exploring how and why animals move together,” says Ding.', 'Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.', 'Paul Smaglik has written about science, medicine and technology for over 25 years.

Worm towers are all around us,https://www.yahoo.com/news/worm-towers-around-us-150000259.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Biologists estimate that four out of five animals on Earth are nematodes (AKA roundworms).The tiny, wriggling, transparent invertebrates are the most abundant creatures on the planet and are found nearly everywhere–from permafrost to the deep ocean. More than one million species make up this ubiquitous group, which includes parasites, decomposers, predators, and more.', '“They’re not about to take over the world, because they already did,” says Serena Ding, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany tells Popular Science. “Global worming has already happened.”  ', 'Yet despite their ubiquity in the environment and in research labs (where the nematode C. elegans is a common model organism), a new discovery highlights that there’s still a lot left to learn about these worms.', 'Humble roundworms put cheerleaders’ pyramid-building skills to shame. In order to disperse and explore their environment, wild nematodes self-assemble into tower-shaped superorganisms, according to a new study led by Ding and published June 5 in the journal Current Biology. Together, groups of the one-millimeter long worms can act as hyper-coordinated construction squads, with their living bodies providing the raw material for functional, temporary structures. It’s a biological feat that even humans struggle to accomplish.', 'This is also the first time that scientists have formally documented the nematode phenomenon occurring in nature. Worm towers– sometimes called swarms– “were kind of just whispered about in the worm community,” says Ding. Previously, there were anecdotal reports and documented observations of these multi-nematode assemblages in labs and other artificial settings, but it wasn’t certain if the formations happened naturally. Now, it’s clear that nematodes do, indeed, form towers without artificial interference.\n\n“They do exist at high densities, they’re interacting, and they’re doing something together.” says Ding, who studies collective behavior. “This was the most exciting thing for me.”', 'One tower can contain thousands of worms in a single aggregation, which looks like a cohesive drop of wiggly gelatin. The impressive team effort enables nematodes to hitch rides on passing insects to more favorable habitats and bridge otherwise untraversable gaps, Ding and her co-authors suggest. Studying this behavior could offer insights into the evolution of social animals and how group decision making unfolds.', 'Only a handful of organisms are known to form collective assemblages for the purpose of dispersing, similar to the nematode towers. “It’s actually super rare,” says Ding, noting that there are just three other, well-documented examples. Slime molds, which are technically single-celled amoebas, often take on multicellular forms, aggregating to make fruiting bodies that send out spores or moving from place to place in a group. Fire ants are known to form rafts with their bodies to get through flood waters, and arrange themselves into towers and bridges to navigate the landscape. Groups of spider mites weave themselves up with silk into a ball that can be carried to distant frontiers on the wind.', 'With the new findings, nematodes gain membership to an exclusive group of evolutionary odd-balls. But though superorganism behavior is uncommon across the tree of life, worm towers themselves are surprisingly commonplace.', 'To track them down in the wild, the researchers didn’t have to travel far. They started by looking at fallen fruit beneath trees on their university campus with a digital microscope. On rotting apples and pears, they found dozens of nematode towers wiggling at the edges and points of the fruits’ fleshy topography. The scientists also documented the behavior among nematodes found at a mushroom farm. Then, they devised a method of reliably recreating it in the lab.', 'Here’s their recipe for encouraging worm towers: place a few thousand nematodes on a food-free petri dish that’s flat except for a single tooth brush bristle pointing upwards. Then, wait for a couple of hours. It’s that simple. In hundreds of trials, the worms clustered into their writhing tower formation around the bristle more than 90 percent of the time. The longest towers in these experiments were well over a centimeter long (more than 10x a nematode’s body length). Prior observations have noted towers about five centimeters–or almost two inches–high.', 'In additional experiments with fruit flies and with a plastic probe, the researchers showed that worm towers strategically move towards any object that touches them or brushes by. The quick collective action allows the towers to shift fast enough to glom onto the leg of a passing insect. Previous research has documented individual nematodes hitchhiking on insects. However, through tower building, it seems that hundreds of worms can grab a ride at once, making the unwitting bug more akin to a subway train than a single passenger vehicle. The scientists also recorded two instances of the towers probing around and forming bridges to reach new locations, like the petri dish lid. Both observations support the leading hypothesis that nematodes build towers to access new, more suitable habitats.', 'Using worms tagged with a fluorescent protein, Ding and her colleagues further found that nematodes building a tower all tend to orient themselves in the same direction. The worms point their heads upwards, and their bodies undulate in time with one another. Yet how they coordinate this intricate collaboration remains unclear.', 'Many of the new observations prompt more confusion than clarity. For instance, in the wild groups, towers were exclusively made up of larvae. In the lab, nematodes of all ages collaborated to build. What accounts for the age difference is unknown. Ding and her colleagues didn’t note any apparent competition for the top spots at the tip of the tower, where a worm is most likely to catch a ride. But it’s unclear if a less genetically homogenous group of worms might be more competitive. The researchers also don’t yet understand why the worms opt to disperse collectively instead of solo. Nor do they know how worms decide to begin forming a tower or the neural or sensory mechanisms that enable it. The basic physics of how thousands of tiny, slimy bodies manage to form something so coordinated and solid remains unresolved as well.', '“There are the sorts of questions that we want to address,” says Ding. Ultimately, she hopes to use nematode towers to better understand animal cooperation across species.', 'For so long in science, nematodes have been seen as little more than a microbiology model system, allowing researchers to test genetic modifications, understand cells, and map neurons. But, in looking so closely at the worms, generations of scientists may have missed the bigger picture. Nematodes have complex behaviors that are the product of millions of years of evolution. Learning more about what they do could shed light on how animals large and small work together, says Ding. “It pays a lot to think about them as real animals,” she adds. “They’re everywhere, they’re important, and they do things.”']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVBhVTFyTjBWR1ptTlZWWFl4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
Nematodes Form “Living Towers of Worms” to Move as One,https://www.mentalfloss.com/animals/invertebrates/nematode-towers,"['If you’re the outdoorsy type, you may have occasionally stumbled upon a colony of ants assembling itself into a tower-like structure to avoid being swept away by incoming rainfall. This type of non-random, coordinated movement in which multiple individuals coalesce into a kind of “superorganism” is incredibly rare among animals. In addition to fire ants, the behavior has been observed only in certain species of spider mites, slime molds, and now, nematodes. ', 'Nematodes are mostly tiny, non-segmented, often parasitic worms in the phylum Nematoda. They range in size from less than one-tenth of a millimeter (0.04 inches) to about 29 feet in the case of one species, Placentonema gigantissima, which parasitizes the digestive tracts of sperm whales. The worms can be found in just about any biome, from forests and oceans to swamps, deserts, the plains of Antarctica, and even the human gut. They’re also the most common creature on the face of the Earth, making up an estimated 80 percent of all animal life. ', 'Because they’re usually extremely small, they have a hard time moving from point A to point B over gaps in terrain. To solve the problem, some species of nematodes have been known to assemble into bridge-like towers, but it’s been seen only in controlled laboratory environments. This year, however, researchers from the University of Konstanz and the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, both located in Germany, were excited to discover that nematode towering—known scientifically as “dispersal behavior”—occurs in nature as well. ', 'In a new paper published in the journal Current Biology, the researchers describe how they recorded video evidence of nematode towering in rotting apples and pears collected from nearby orchards. “I was ecstatic,” senior author Dr. Serena Ding said in a statement. “For so long natural worm towers existed only in our imaginations. But with the right equipment and lots of curiosity, we found them hiding in plain sight.”', 'Through close observation and experimentation, the researchers were able to better understand the mechanics and purpose of nematode towering. They found that, while towering in the lab was observed in a variety of nematode species, towering in nature was observed only on one species and only in its larval, or “dauer,” stage. ', 'The researchers also found that, when towering, the nematodes behaved as though they were a single individual. Whether they responded to touch or attached themselves to surfaces and objects, they did so in unison—a hallmark of dispersal behavior.', '“A nematode tower is not just a pile of worms,” first author Dr. Daniela Perez said in the statement. “It’s a coordinated structure, a superorganism in motion.” ', 'Some towers were able to stand for more than 12 hours and generate “exploratory arms” to survey the surrounding space. As with ants, mites, and slime molds, nematode towers could be formed for a variety of purposes, including to evade danger, reach new food sources, or “hitchhike” en masse to different environments by latching on to other organisms passing by. ', ""Unlike in ants, whose dispersal behavior depends on the individual ants' roles within the colony, nematode towers that the researchers created in their lab did not appear to be organized according to individual specialization. Each worm, whether located at the top of the tower or at the bottom, exhibited similar behaviors, though this may be because the researchers were studying clonal (a.k.a genetically indistinguishable) populations."", 'Evidence that nematodes form living towers of worms in the wild hints at an important turning point in evolution of life on Earth—the point at which organisms learned to overcome challenges by working together. “Collective dispersal,” the authors write, “raises interesting questions about kin selection, cooperation, and social conflicts” in other animals, including humans.

However, new images of these towers forming in the wild hint at a more mutually-beneficial motivation.', 'The footage was captured by researchers in Konstanz, Germany, on fallen apples and pears at local orchards. The team from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (MPI-AB) and the University of Konstanz were then able to combine these images with follow-up laboratory experiments to demonstrate that the “towering” behavior happens naturally, and that the worms engage in such behaviour as a means of mass transit.', '“I was ecstatic when I saw these natural towers for the first time,” said senior author Serena Ding, group leader at the MPI-AB, describing the moment when co-author Ryan Greenway, a biologist at the University of Konstanz, sent her a video recording from the field. “For so long natural worm towers existed only in our imaginations. But with the right equipment and lots of curiosity, we found them hiding in plain sight.”', 'That curiosity also revealed some interesting aspects of worm cooperation. While the researchers observed many nematode species crawling inside the fruit, only a single species in the same developmental period — a tough larval stage known as a “dauer” — participated in tower building. That level of species specificity in worm tower “construction” hinted that there might be more driving the behavior than a seemingly random creature cluster.', 'Related: Nematode resurrected from Siberian permafrost lay dormant for 46,000 years', '“A nematode tower is not just a pile of worms,” said study first author Daniela Perez, a postdoctoral researcher at MPI-AB. “It’s a coordinated structure, a superorganism in motion.”', 'The paper suggested these observations could serve as a “missing link” into behavior of similar organisms. Such towering behavior has previously been observed in slime molds, fire ants and spider mites, but it is still relatively rare in nature.', 'To see if other kinds of worms could also form such a “superorganism”, researchers created conditions to coach the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans into assembling into similar structures. C. elegans is a model organism that is widely studied for both its behavior and biology.', 'Perez stuck a toothbrush bristle into a food-free agar plate to act as a sort scaffold — then unleashed the worms. Within two hours, the C. elegans formed a tower using the bristle as its spine. Some smaller clusters of worms reached out exploratory “arms,” while others bridged gaps between spaces. And when researchers tapped the top of the tower with a glass pick, the worms wriggled toward that stimulus.', '“The towers are actively sensing and growing,” says Perez. “When we touched them, they responded immediately, growing toward the stimulus and attaching to it.”', 'RELATED STORIES', '—Why do worms come out in the rain?', ""—Australian 'trash parrots' have now developed a local 'drinking tradition'"", '—Wandering salamander: The tree‑climbing amphibian with a blood‑powered grip', 'The researchers also wondered if there was some sort of worm hierarchy driving this activity. Did younger worms have to do all the work? Stronger ones? Smaller, weaker ones?', 'It turns out that the roundworms were remarkably egalitarian in their efforts. Unlike the orchard-based nematodes, the laboratory-bound C. elegans represented a range of life stages, from larval to adult — but they all pitched in. That suggests “towering” may be a more generalized strategy for group movement than previously thought.', '“Our study opens up a whole new system for exploring how and why animals move together,” says Ding.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVBhVTFyTjBWR1ptTlZWWFl4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Worm towers are all around us,https://www.popsci.com/environment/nematode-worm-towers/,"['BY LAUREN LEFFER', 'PUBLISHED JUN 5, 2025 11:00 AM EDT', 'CREDIT: PEREZ ET AL. (2025) CURRENT BIOLOGY.', 'Get the Popular Science daily newsletter💡', 'Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.', 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'Biologists estimate that four out of five animals on Earth are nematodes (AKA roundworms).The tiny, wriggling, transparent invertebrates are the most abundant creatures on the planet and are found nearly everywhere–from permafrost to the deep ocean. More than one million species make up this ubiquitous group, which includes parasites, decomposers, predators, and more.', '“They’re not about to take over the world, because they already did,” says Serena Ding, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany tells Popular Science. “Global worming has already happened.”  ', 'Yet despite their ubiquity in the environment and in research labs (where the nematode C. elegans is a common model organism), a new discovery highlights that there’s still a lot left to learn about these worms. ', 'Humble roundworms put cheerleaders’ pyramid-building skills to shame. In order to disperse and explore their environment, wild nematodes self-assemble into tower-shaped superorganisms, according to a new study led by Ding and published June 5 in the journal Current Biology. Together, groups of the one-millimeter long worms can act as hyper-coordinated construction squads, with their living bodies providing the raw material for functional, temporary structures. It’s a biological feat that even humans struggle to accomplish. ', 'This is also the first time that scientists have formally documented the nematode phenomenon occurring in nature. Worm towers– sometimes called swarms– “were kind of just whispered about in the worm community,” says Ding. Previously, there were anecdotal reports and documented observations of these multi-nematode assemblages in labs and other artificial settings, but it wasn’t certain if the formations happened naturally. Now, it’s clear that nematodes do, indeed, form towers without artificial interference.\n\n“They do exist at high densities, they’re interacting, and they’re doing something together.” says Ding, who studies collective behavior. “This was the most exciting thing for me.” ', 'One tower can contain thousands of worms in a single aggregation, which looks like a cohesive drop of wiggly gelatin. The impressive team effort enables nematodes to hitch rides on passing insects to more favorable habitats and bridge otherwise untraversable gaps, Ding and her co-authors suggest. Studying this behavior could offer insights into the evolution of social animals and how group decision making unfolds.', 'Only a handful of organisms are known to form collective assemblages for the purpose of dispersing, similar to the nematode towers. “It’s actually super rare,” says Ding, noting that there are just three other, well-documented examples. Slime molds, which are technically single-celled amoebas, often take on multicellular forms, aggregating to make fruiting bodies that send out spores or moving from place to place in a group. Fire ants are known to form rafts with their bodies to get through flood waters, and arrange themselves into towers and bridges to navigate the landscape. Groups of spider mites weave themselves up with silk into a ball that can be carried to distant frontiers on the wind. ', 'With the new findings, nematodes gain membership to an exclusive group of evolutionary odd-balls. But though superorganism behavior is uncommon across the tree of life, worm towers themselves are surprisingly commonplace. ', 'To track them down in the wild, the researchers didn’t have to travel far. They started by looking at fallen fruit beneath trees on their university campus with a digital microscope. On rotting apples and pears, they found dozens of nematode towers wiggling at the edges and points of the fruits’ fleshy topography. The scientists also documented the behavior among nematodes found at a mushroom farm. Then, they devised a method of reliably recreating it in the lab.', 'Here’s their recipe for encouraging worm towers: place a few thousand nematodes on a food-free petri dish that’s flat except for a single tooth brush bristle pointing upwards. Then, wait for a couple of hours. It’s that simple. In hundreds of trials, the worms clustered into their writhing tower formation around the bristle more than 90 percent of the time. The longest towers in these experiments were well over a centimeter long (more than 10x a nematode’s body length). Prior observations have noted towers about five centimeters–or almost two inches–high. ', 'In additional experiments with fruit flies and with a plastic probe, the researchers showed that worm towers strategically move towards any object that touches them or brushes by. The quick collective action allows the towers to shift fast enough to glom onto the leg of a passing insect. Previous research has documented individual nematodes hitchhiking on insects. However, through tower building, it seems that hundreds of worms can grab a ride at once, making the unwitting bug more akin to a subway train than a single passenger vehicle. The scientists also recorded two instances of the towers probing around and forming bridges to reach new locations, like the petri dish lid. Both observations support the leading hypothesis that nematodes build towers to access new, more suitable habitats. ', 'Using worms tagged with a fluorescent protein, Ding and her colleagues further found that nematodes building a tower all tend to orient themselves in the same direction. The worms point their heads upwards, and their bodies undulate in time with one another. Yet how they coordinate this intricate collaboration remains unclear. ', 'Many of the new observations prompt more confusion than clarity. For instance, in the wild groups, towers were exclusively made up of larvae. In the lab, nematodes of all ages collaborated to build. What accounts for the age difference is unknown. Ding and her colleagues didn’t note any apparent competition for the top spots at the tip of the tower, where a worm is most likely to catch a ride. But it’s unclear if a less genetically homogenous group of worms might be more competitive. The researchers also don’t yet understand why the worms opt to disperse collectively instead of solo. Nor do they know how worms decide to begin forming a tower or the neural or sensory mechanisms that enable it. The basic physics of how thousands of tiny, slimy bodies manage to form something so coordinated and solid remains unresolved as well. ', '“There are the sorts of questions that we want to address,” says Ding. Ultimately, she hopes to use nematode towers to better understand animal cooperation across species. ', 'For so long in science, nematodes have been seen as little more than a microbiology model system, allowing researchers to test genetic modifications, understand cells, and map neurons. But, in looking so closely at the worms, generations of scientists may have missed the bigger picture. Nematodes have complex behaviors that are the product of millions of years of evolution. Learning more about what they do could shed light on how animals large and small work together, says Ding. “It pays a lot to think about them as real animals,” she adds. “They’re everywhere, they’re important, and they do things.” ', 'More deals, reviews, and buying guides', 'POPULAR SCIENCE TEAM', 'POPULAR SCIENCE TEAM', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'LAUREN LEFFER', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'TOM HAWKING', 'LAUREN LEFFER', 'JOCELYN SOLIS-MOREIRA', 'MICHAEL SCHULSON/UNDARK', 'POPULAR SCIENCE TEAM', 'KATE BAGGALEY', 'KATE BAGGALEY', 'STAN HORACZEK', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'DEBBIE WOLFE', 'TERRI WILLIAMS', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'LAURA BAISAS', 'MARGHERITA BASSI', 'MARGHERITA BASSI', 'Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'Articles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service.\n\n© 2025 Recurrent.

It could easily die on the way there, or be eaten by a predator,” Perez explained.

Each worm from the base to the top of the structure was equally mobile and strong, indicating no competition was at play.
