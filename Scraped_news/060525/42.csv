Tony Awards: Predicting the Winners Using Just Math,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/tony-awards-prediction-winners-2025-math-zauzmer-1236253818/,"['', '', ""This year's category-by-category look at which musicals and plays have the best chance of claiming honors during the June 8 telecast on CBS, based on a model built on historical data."", 'BY BEN ZAUZMER', '', 'The world will descend on New York on Sunday night, by way of the 78th Tony Awards. Shows set in the U.S., the U.K., Cuba, Italy, and Iran all make their way to the nominees circle. Not to mention a show from South Korea projected to win more Tonys than any other production, potentially the first one ever to premiere in Asia and win best musical.', 'And when I say “projected,” I mean that mathematically. Every year, I run a statistical model based on precursor awards, which categories a show is nominated in, blended critic predictions, and betting markets to project the odds that each nominee will emerge victorious in every category. After another wonderful year on Broadway, with 42 new shows opening and 29 of them receiving nominations, it’s time to get excited for the big night with a data-based forecast at who might triumph at Radio City Music Hall on June 8 on CBS (and Paramount+).', '', 'Maybe Happy Ending is both the name of the show and a surprisingly apt description for how its night at the Tonys will conclude. Emphasis on “maybe”: the model is higher on Dead Outlaw than one might suspect, since it takes into account that show’s multiple honors for its off-Broadway run a year ago.', 'Best play is much closer than best musical, with three productions above a 1-in-5 chance to win. The Drama League has a remarkable streak in this category, predicting every Tony winner since Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike (2013), so that’s enough to put this year’s Drama League pick of Oh, Mary! over the top.', 'The original run of Sunset Boulevard won best musical in 1995, but that was an odd year: only two original musicals opened that season (the other being Smokey Joe’s Café), so the competition wasn’t as stiff as usual. The Sunset Boulevard revival will have a tougher path to the podium with three opponents to beat, Gypsy in particular.', 'Yellow Face is an extremely popular pick here, and could very well win. For one thing, it earned an Outer Critics Circle nod that Eureka Day missed. But when the two went head-to-head at the Drama Desk and Drama League Awards, Eureka Day went 2-for-2.', 'Nine actors have won lead actor in a musical twice, and no one has won more than twice. Not only could Jonathan Groff (Just in Time) become the tenth man on that list, but he could become the first ever to do it in consecutive years after his Merrily We Roll Along win a year ago. The model has him at 19.2 percent, a not-insurmountable 20 percentage points the leader, Darren Criss (Maybe Happy Ending).', '', 'At some point I’ll run out of trivia facts to post about Audra McDonald. She’s already set the all-time record for the most Tony acting wins, with six, and is favored to win her seventh for Gypsy. But Nicole Scherzinger (Sunset Boulevard) is a popular pick as well in what’s shaping up to be both a great race in its own right and a precursor of the musical revival category.', 'Cole Escola is performing double-duty, as both the writer and star of Oh, Mary! and is the clear favorite according to the mathematical model, with Jon Michael Hill in Purpose at a distant runner up.', 'Sarah Snook stars as Dorian Gray – and every other role – and has a 42.8 percent chance to win the Tony for the one-woman show. But close behind her is Laura Donnelly (The Hills of California) at 33.2 percent.', 'Jak Malone (Operation Mincemeat) stands out as not only the favorite in this category, but as the most likely winner across all eight acting categories. Operation Mincemeat is up for four Tonys, but it’s projected to lose each of the other three to Maybe Happy Ending (not nominated in this race), making this category its best chance at a victory.', 'There’s probably a good debate to be had on whether Natalie Venetia Belcon (Buena Vista Social Club) belonged in the leading or featured category. But regardless of which category she slots into, no one is debating that this was a Tony-worthy performance as Cuban singer Omara Portuondo.', 'That tension you’re feeling is the symptom of just a 3.8 percentage-point gap between Conrad Ricamora (Oh, Mary!) and Francis Jue (Yellow Face). Oh, Mary! appears to be the more beloved production overall – projected to win five categories – so that might be enough to tip the scales in Ricamora’s favor.', 'Only Judith Light (Other Desert Cities, The Assembled Parties) has won featured actress in a play twice in a row. Kara Young, fresh off her win for Purlie Victorious, could be the second, but she’ll have to get past Jessica Hecht (Eureka Day) first.', ' It feels like this happens in so many years: The directors of the best musical and best musical revival frontrunners going head-to-head as the top two candidates in this category. Michael Arden (Maybe Happy Ending) holds a narrow 5.6 percentage-point lead over Jamie Lloyd (Sunset Boulevard).', 'Danya Taymor (John Proctor Is the Villain) could join Trevor Nunn, Jerry Zaks, Joe Mantello, and Jack O’Brien as the only people to win best direction of a musical and best direction of a play in consecutive years. But to accomplish that, she’ll need to take down the slight frontrunner, Sam Pinkleton (Oh, Mary!).', 'Boy does Death Becomes Her need a win for Paul Tazewell here. Otherwise, with no other categories it’s currently favored in, it risks becoming just the ninth show in Tony history to walk away with zero wins on ten or more nominations.', '', 'Holly Pierson (Oh, Mary!) does an excellent job threading the needle – apologies for the pun – between faithfully recreating 19th century styles and mirroring the inherent silliness of the show’s concept. None of these shows won a Drama Desk or an Outer Critics Circle honor for their costumes, so it’s a less informed prediction than most.', 'The original run of Sunset Boulevard won seven Tonys, but this is the only category it won that its successor is also favored to win. The first time around, it was Andrew Bridge winning his second Tony, after a first for The Phantom of the Opera. This time, it’s lighting designer Jack Knowles looking to win his first.', 'This is the first of three consecutive play design categories that Stranger Things: The First Shadow holds the highest percentage on. And that’s actually underselling how honored this production might be, since it’s also due to receive a Special Tony Award for its illusions and technical effects.', 'In a category that typically nominates solo artists, Dane Laffrey and George Reeve (Maybe Happy Ending) are teaming up. Franne and Eugene Lee (Candide in 1974) are currently the only pair of individuals to share this award for a single musical.', 'The prior paragraph notwithstanding, 59 Productions breaks the dichotomy between individuals and duos. This design studio already has a win on the musical side from An American in Paris, and is now looking to notch its first victory for a play for Stranger Things: The First Shadow, in conjunction with four-time nominee Miriam Buether.', 'We now arrive at the single closest category of the year, according to my model. Just 0.8 percent separates Buena Vista Social Club and Sunset Boulevard for sound design of a musical. If you’re entering a Tony pool, you may as well flip a coin.', 'Paul Arditti’s nomination here for Stranger Things: The First Shadow marks the single most likely winner of any nominee in any category this year. Not sure if this is the category you expected to hear that stat in, but when the critics and the precursor awards are unanimous, that’s what happens.', 'In the order of this article, this marks the fifth projected win for Maybe Happy Ending. Should every prediction included here come true (a highly unlikely event), Maybe Happy Ending and Oh, Mary! would become the tenth pair of best musical/best play winners in the same season to each win 5+ Tonys. The most recent occurrence was The Band’s Visit and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.', 'It might feel like the same show always wins the trio of best musical, book, and score. But in recent years, that’s far from true: Kimberly Akimbo is the only show to pull off that trifecta since 2019. Maybe Happy Ending is now hoping to become the second in that timespan.', 'Jerry Mitchell has been widely praised for his choreography for Boop!, and could certainly conclude this awards season with a Tony. But, a key factor in the model is which other categories a show is nominated in, and only two other shows in the past 50 years (Swan Lake, Bandstand) managed to win this award without either a best musical or musical revival nomination.', '', 'I don’t know if the Tonys tipped their hand here or not, but Marco Paguia has technically already won a Tony for Buena Vista Social Club, as he and the rest of the band received a Special Tony Award this year. He’s got a 56.2 percent to add a competitive win to that trophy case.', '***', 'These blurbs alongside each chart cover but a small fraction of the talent from around the world involved in making this Broadway season happen. Perhaps the same could be said of the Tony telecast itself, which will surely be a delightful three hours that simultaneously leaves us craving more time at the theater.', 'Ben Zauzmer (@BensOscarMath) uses data to write about awards shows for The Hollywood Reporter.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXNSelUzU204MWVsWjRTVE5MVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZbFJwVHNJUWc=-w280-h168-p-df
Competitive Tony Awards caps one of Broadway’s biggest years,https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/entertainment/theater/2025/06/04/broadway-season-ends-with-competitive-tony-awards-races/83980186007/,"['This year’s 78th annual Tony Award ceremony puts an exclamation point on what appears to be one of Broadway’s brightest seasons, both financially and artistically, and there will be some heated competition as the ceremony unfolds beginning at 8 p.m. June 8 on CBS and Paramount+.', 'The Broadway League, which represents theater producers, reported that all Broadway shows combined grossed a record $1.89 billion during the season that ran from May 20, 2024 to May 25, 2025, up 23% from the previous season (which had one less week), and topped the previous, pre-COVID pandemic record of $1.83 billion in the 2018-19 season. Just accounting for the first 52 weeks of the season, the gross was still a record $1.85 million.', 'But attendance declined slightly, by about 3%, indicating that the record was achieved by higher ticket prices. A revival of Shakespeare’s “Othello” starring Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhall has been selling some premium seats for $921, while George Clooney’s Broadway debut in “Good Night, And Good Luck” about Edward R. Murrow was selling premium seats for  $825 before its scheduled closing June 8.', 'Just a few weeks ago it had a weekly gross of $4.2 million, an almost unheard of total for a non-musical, topping the record $4,041,493 set by “Hamilton” in one week in 2018. ', 'But they were hardly the only non-musicals to sell well. Cole Escola’s hilarious “Oh, Mary,” which started off-Broadway, became the unexpected hit of the season, selling out most performances. The season also brought a top-selling revival of “Romeo + Juliet,” starring Kit Conner (of “Heartstoppers”) and Rachel Zegler (of the film “West Side Story”); “Succession” star Sarah Snook in a one-woman version of “The Picture of Dorian Gray”; and a revival of David Mamet’s “Glengarry Glen Ross,” which stars Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and comedian Bill Burr.', 'Those top premium tickets have led to some concerns in the theater industry that potential patrons might be turned off because they can’t afford nearly $1,000 per seat, but the League reported that the average ticket price for all shows was a more reasonable $129.12, up about $5.25 from the previous year.', 'And while plays were showing they can still attract large audiences (particularly with a starry cast), long-running hits like “Wicked,” “Hamilton” and “The Lion King” are still selling out, and some of this year’s Tony nominees are finding box office success, including “Maybe Happy Ending,” “Buena Vista Social Club” and “Death Becomes Her.” A few others, like “Real Women Have Curves” and “Boop! The Musical” are hoping for any kind of bounce they might get after the Tony broadcast.', 'This year’s ceremony will be hosted by Tony winner and Academy Award-nominee Cynthia Erivo. Darren Criss, a Tony nominee for “Maybe Happy Ending” and Tony winner Renée Elise Goldsberry will host “The Tony Awards: Act One,” which will present some of the creative awards before the main ceremony starting at 6:40 p.m. on Pluto TV.', 'It comes amid a lot of backstage drama involving legendary Tony Award winner Patti LuPone, who has apologized for unkind remarks made in a New Yorker interview about two other Tony winners, Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald.', 'Erivo will lead a broadcast that will feature numbers from the nominated best musical and best musical revival nominees, and mark the 10th anniversary of “Hamilton” by bringing together the original cast, including creator Lin Manuel-Miranda and Tony winners Goldsberry, Leslie Odom Jr., and Daveed Diggs.', 'In many years, the Tony Award winners seem like a foregone conclusion (there was no question that “Hamilton” or “The Producers” would win boatloads of awards in their years). But that’s hardly the case for this year’s ceremony.', 'Escola, who wrote and stars in the acclaimed comedy “Oh, Mary!” may be considered a favorite for best play and best actor in a play. Escola, who uses they/them pronouns, plays Mary Todd Lincoln who tries to convince her husband Abe to support her dream of becoming a cabaret performer while he’s busy fighting the Civil War. The other nominees are Sanaz Toossi’s “English,” Jez Butterworth’s “The Hills of California,” Kimberly Bellflower’s “John Proctor is the Villain” (which was presented earlier in the season at the FSU/Asolo Conservatory) and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ “Purpose.”', 'Among the other nominees for best actor in a play are Daniel Dae Kim (for “Yellow Face”) and Clooney for “Good Night, and Good Luck,” which he also adapted from the film.', 'According to the website goldderby.com, the Best Musical category is tilting toward “Maybe Happy Ending,” about two helper-bots who discover the possibilities of life beyond what they were built for. And Criss is favored to win best actor in a musical for that show.', 'But there are some strong challengers in the best musical category, including “Dead Outlaw,” about a man whose dead body was showcased for years in carnivals, amusement parks and such, and “Death Becomes Her,” which put some new twists on the Goldie Hawn-Meryl Streep movie about the long time rivalry between two former friends. The other nominees are “Buena Vista Social Club,” which has been selling out, and the British musical “Operation Mincemeat.”', 'Among the musicians of “Buena Vista Social Club” is Sarasota’s Renesito Avich, who makes his Broadway debut in the show, and shares in a special Tony Award given to the musical ensemble.', 'Criss’ competition for best actor includes audience favorites Jeremy Jordan in “Floyd Collins,” and Jonathan Groff celebrating Bobby Darin in “Just in Time,” along with Tom Francis as a jaded writer in the reimagined Andrew Lloyd Webber musical “Sunset Blvd.,” Andrew Durand as that dead outlaw and James Monroe Iglehart who played Louis Armstrong in the short-lived “A Wonderful World.”', 'Jordan starred at Asolo Repertory Theatre in the musical “Bonnie & Clyde” before the show went to Broadway. And another nominee has ties to Asolo Rep: Julia Knitel, who played Carole King in Asolo Rep’s “Beautiful” last fall, is up for best featured actress in a musical for her role in “Dead Outlaw.”', 'Could this be the year that Audra McDonald wins her seventh Tony? She already has six in both play and musical categories, but she could win again for her performance as Rose in a new revival of “Gypsy.” (I hope that LuPone dust-up doesn’t impact the voting.)', 'But many expect the award to go to former Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, as the faded film star Norma Desmond in “Sunset Blvd.” Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard, the two stars of “Death Becomes Her,” could well cancel each other out. Also nominated is Jasmine Amy Rogers who received glorious notices for her Broadway debut in the title role of “Boop! The Musical.”', '“Sunset” also is favored to win for best musical revival over “Gypsy,” “Floyd Collins” and the reinvented Gilbert and Sullivan operetta “Pirates! The Penzance Musical.”', '“Yellow Face” may have an edge for best play revival against “Eureka Day,” “Our Town” and “Romeo + Juliet.”', 'Snook, best known for playing Shiv in the hit HBO series “Succession,” is favored to win best actress in a play for her performance in a multi-media production of “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” She is in a category that features Sadie Sink (a star from the Netflix series “Stranger Things”) in “John Proctor is the Villain,” LaTanya Richardson Jackson in “Purpose,” Laura Donnelly in “The Hills of California” and Mia Farrow making a return to Broadway in “The Roommate.”', 'Here is a look at the nominees in major categories:', '“Buena Vista Social Club,” Book by Marco Ramirez, music by Buena Vista Social Club', '“Dead Outlaw,” Music and lyrics by David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna, book by Itamar Moses', '“Death Becomes Her,” Music and lyrics by Julia Mattison and Noel Carey, book by Marco Pennette', '“Maybe Happy Ending,” Music by Will Aronson, book and lyrics by Aronson and Hue Park.', '“Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical,” Book, music and lyrics by David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zöe Roberts', '“English” by Sanaz Toosi', '“The Hills of California” by Jez Butterworth', '“John Proctor is the Villain” by Kimberly Belflower', '“Oh, Mary!” by Cole Escola', '“Purpose” by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins', '“Eureka Day” by  Jonathan Spector', '“Romeo + Juliet” by William Shakespeare', '“Our Town” by Thornton Wilder', '“Yellow Face“ by David Henry Hwang', '“Floyd Collins” ', '“Gypsy”', '“Pirates!

Tony Awards Predictions 2025: Who Will Win and Who Should Win,https://www.elle.com/culture/theater/a64745629/tony-awards-predictions-2025/,"['ELLE’s theater super fan gives his predictions for the ceremony, airing on CBS June 8.', 'As another Broadway season comes to a close, I once again find myself stressing out over one of the hardest tasks I face year after year: Predicting the winners for the Tony Awards. In yet another highly competitive season, the divas were out, the revivals were dazzling, and the new shows brought a refreshing charm. With 14 new musicals, 14 new plays, seven musical revivals, and seven play revivals, this season, in sheer numbers, blew last year out of the water.', 'Standing at the top of the pack for the musicals with 10 nominations each are Buena Vista Social Club, Death Becomes Her, and Maybe Happy Ending; and leading the plays are The Hills of California and John Proctor Is the Villain. However. But it seems to be anyone’s game, as other shows like Dead Outlaw, Sunset Boulevard, and Oh, Mary! have been fan favorites.', 'Below, find my selects for the season. These are based upon my personal opinion (who should win), and who likely will win based on the odds and Broadway chatter. As always, if those choices differ, it’s due to my personal taste, and the “will win” is still wildly deserving. All of these shows have earned their rightful flowers.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Maybe Happy Ending', 'Should Win: Maybe Happy Ending', 'As one of the world’s biggest softies, it’s unsurprising Maybe Happy Ending is my pick for Best Musical. With direction by Michael Arden, the bite-sized one act is a visual feast. There are drones, projections that are actually effective and not gratuitous, strong costumes, and so much more. Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen are also compelling as the two leads, vocalizing in perfect harmony and telling the story of two retired “helperbots” who are nearing the end of their respective lives. The concept originally seems zany, however the show is everything a new Broadway musical should be. If all is right in the world, Maybe Happy Ending should take home the grand prize.', 'Possible Upset: Dead Outlaw has been well received, has a fascinating plot, and is inventive in its storytelling. It is truly an excellent production, and it could take home this prize as well.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Oh, Mary!', 'Expect Oh, Mary! to say “Oh, Tony!” on awards night. Cole Escola’s play sent shockwaves through the theater community, so much that the downtown production was able to transfer to Broadway. Many were skeptical if the off-Broadway blockbuster would work in a larger venue at first, but those skeptics are now eating their words. Escola’s masterpiece, which tells the story of a disgruntled Mary Todd Lincoln who just wants to be a cabaret star, is an unequivocal hit. It is one of the most creative stories Broadway has seen in recent memory, and it’s cultural impact likely will not be ignored.', 'Should Win: John Proctor is the Villain', 'Personally, John Proctor is the Villain is my favorite show of the Broadway season. From the first Lorde track that plays (“Team” for wondering minds), I was completely enamored. Set in a small, Georgia town during the #MeToo era in 2018, the play examines The Crucible from a new lens, one that does not place John Proctor as the hero he is often portrayed to be. Sadie Sink gives a career-high performance, and the show’s message feels relevant, even seven years later.', 'Possible Upset: This is a highly competitive category. The Hills of California stands as one of my early season favorites, and both Purpose and English have strong followings.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Sunset Boulevard', 'Sunset Boulevard has been a smash this Broadway season, and the Andrew Lloyd Weber musical will likely take home this prize. With direction by Jamie Lloyd and a career-defining performance by Nicole Scherzinger, Sunset Boulevard has been pleasing crowds since the fall (even earlier if you count its West End run). That said, it wasn’t my personal favorite; while the show has been the talk of the town, I left the theater feeling a little disappointed. Yes, this one will win, but perhaps it just wasn’t quite for me.', 'Should Win: Gypsy', 'On the other hand, Gypsy was for me. With incredible performances, it’s a Broadway revival at its best. Though it runs long at 2 hours and 40 minutes, Gypsy filled a big musical hole in my heart and had me in the palm of its hand from beginning to end. It’s also impossible to mention the show without mentioning Audra McDonald, who is transcendent in the role of Rose.', 'Possible Upset: This race has two horses, an upset seems unlikely.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Eureka Day', 'Should Win: Eureka Day', 'Eureka Day has emerged as the deserving frontrunner in this quiet category. With a message about vaccinations at college universities that is unfortunately relevant right now, it has the Tony on lock. Not even Kit Connor’s biceps and pull-ups in Romeo + Juliet could challenge this one.', 'Possible Upset: Eureka Day seems to have this category stitched up.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Darren Criss', 'Criss will likely finally get his flowers on Tony night for his compelling performance as a retired helperbot named Oliver in Maybe Happy Ending. Tony voters will likely award one of the show’s stars, especially after his co-lead Helen J. Shen was somehow snubbed from a nomination. It’s looking like Blaine Anderson will get that Tony Award.', 'Should Win: Jonathan Groff', 'Look, was Groff (or the producers) pandering to me when he picked me, out of everyone in the audience, to dance and twirl with at the top of the show? Perhaps. Did it work? Absolutely. Groff stars as Bobby Darin in Just in Time, an excellent musical that didn’t receive as many nominations as it should have. Because Groff just won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical last year for his performance in Merrily We Roll Along, it seems unlikely he’ll win a consecutive award. He is charming, looks amazing in a blue Speedo, and sings his damn heart out. If I were a Tony voter, last year aside, he would get my vote.', 'Possible Upset: Tom Francis demands your attention in Sunset Boulevard as Joe Gillis, and if the tides start turning in that direction on Tony night, Francis could go home with the award.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Audra McDonald', 'Should Win: Audra McDonald', 'About a week ago, I would have said Scherzinger would be taking home his award for her performance as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. It seemed as if she had the momentum, however I always believed McDonald gave the more compelling performance in Gypsy. While the race is still close, it seems as if the pendulum has swung for McDonald, especially after she has been a pinnacle of grace following Patti LuPone’s rude comments towards her (LuPone has since apologized). Controversy aside, I have never, in the many Broadway shows I have watched, seen such a masterclass performance. McDonald sings beautifully, acts with a dominant force, and is addictive as Rose. McDonald had nothing left to prove after winning a record six Tony Awards, but come Sunday night, expect her to extend her record, raking in number seven.', 'Possible Upset: If Scherzinger and McDonald split the votes, recent Drama Desk winner Jasmine Amy Rogers could rise to the top.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Cole Escola', 'Should Win: Cole Escola', 'Escola is hilarious in Oh, Mary!, and if all is right in the world, they should come home with this prize.Putting their whole body into their portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln, the actor delivered a kind of performance Broadway has never seen before. We should all thank Escola for making us belly-laugh for the last year.', 'Possible Upset: I won’t even entertain an upset here. My stomach couldn’t handle it.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Sarah Snook', 'Should Win: Sarah Snook', 'Snook, who comes to the Broadway stage after captivating audiences in Succession, acts with giant, pre-recorded versions of herself in this one-woman-show rendition of The Picture of Dorian Gray. It’s an impressive feat, and if she is off by one beat, the whole show could fall apart. (Spoiler: She never is.) Expect Snook to come home with her first Tony Award.', 'Possible Upset: This category seems like a lock for Snook, but I would personally be just as fine with Laura Donnelly or Sadie Sink winning.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Jak Malone', 'Should Win: Jak Malone', 'Malone has a standout moment as Hester Leggatt in Operation Mincemeat with the song “Dear Bill.” It stops the show in its tracks, bringing heart to the otherwise humorous story. I never thought I would cry in a British comedy musical about World War II, so Malone, I politely curse you for causing the waterworks.', 'Possible Upset: Danny Burstein is great in Gypsy, and Taylor Trensch is one of the best parts of Floyd Collins.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Natalie Venetia Belcon', 'In Buena Vista Social Club, Belcon offers an excellent depiction of singer Omara Portuondo. She drives the story forward in this jukebox musical and she sings her heart out through the show. Known for originating the role of Gary Coleman in Avenue Q, Belcon is back, stronger than ever, and it seems as if she may finally get her first Tony Award.', 'Should Win: Joy Woods', 'At just 25 years old, Woods has already built an impressive resumé. After making her Broadway debut as Catherine Parr in Six, she went viral on TikTok last year with her rendition of “My Days” from The Notebook, in which she played Middle Allie. She is a powerhouse, and her ability to hold her own and excel next to Broadway’s most awarded actor, McDonald, makes her my personal pick for this year.', 'Possible Upset: Julia Knitel covers a lot of ground in Dead Outlaw, and she could be awarded for being a pitch-perfect master of disguise.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Gabriel Ebert', 'Should Win: Gabriel Ebert', 'Fans of Ebert will remember him as originating the role of Mr. Wormwood in Matilda the Musical on Broadway, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Now, in John Proctor Is the Villain, Ebert shows his range as Mr. Smith, who is warm and kind, yet terrifying with a dark past. Ebert’s performance is compelling, meaningful, and spot on. He is beyond deserving of this award.', 'Possible Upset: Francis Jue could win for his role in Yellow Face, and Conrad Ricamora could snatch up an award for Oh, Mary!.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Jessica Hecht', 'With Eureka Day, Hecht racks up her third Tony nomination for her turn as Suzanne, and it’s looking like this time, she’ll win. A much beloved actress, she will be welcomed in to the winner’s circle with open arms.', 'Should Win: Fina Strazza', 'At just 19, Fina Strazza shines in John Proctor Is the Villain as the earnest Beth. She’s utterly convincing and often brings levity to the heavy production, and with this Tony nomination, she has a bright future ahead.', 'Possible Upset: Kara Young won this Tony Award last year, and with a much talked about performance in Purpose, she could win for a second consecutive year.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Michael Arden', 'Should Win: Michael Arden', 'Arden’s direction in Maybe Happy Ending is beautiful. With a jaw-dropping set, excellent use of space, and incredible character development, Maybe Happy Ending’s success should be much attributed to Arden. This would be Arden’s second Tony Award, after winning in 2023 for Parade.', 'Possible Upset: Jamie Lloyd gave new life to Sunset Boulevard, and his highly inventive angle could capture the Tony voters’ eyes.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Sam Pinkleton', 'Pinkleton is the perfect director for Oh, Mary!. While he’s mostly known for his work as a choreographer, the play is so unbelievably physical that the pairing just makes sense. Escola is bent almost every which way as Mary, meaning the show needed a master of movement. Pinkleton’s simple staging is effective and well done, more than enough to win him a Tony Award.', 'Should Win: Sam Mendes', 'While I think Pinkleton’s direction is excellent in Oh, Mary!, I found Mendes’s work in The Hills of California to be strong. Mendes, known for directing The Lehman Trilogy, The Ferryman, and Cabaret, is a veteran to the Broadway stage, and his use of age, turntables, and staircases in The Hills of California makes a resounding case for a third Tony Award.', 'Possible Upset: Danya Taymor won Best Director of a Musical last year, and this year, she could come home with Best Director of a play.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck', 'Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck’s choreography in Buena Vista Social Club soars so high that at my show, the company received a standing ovation following the second act’s opener. Their choreography fits the music, is smart, and could win Peck his second consecutive Tony Award in this category.', 'Should Win: Jerry Mitchell', 'At the top of the second act of Boop! The Musical, a perfect match of choreography and costumes makes for one of the best moments in the theater I saw this year, as half the cast is dressed in black and white, and the other half is in full technicolor. Using simple movements to create meaningful visuals is the sign of a strong choreographer, and Mitchell is just that.', 'Possible Upset: We’re either Boopin’ or at the Buena Vista Social Club come Tony Awards night.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Will Aronson and Hue Park', 'Should Win: Will Aronson and Hue Park', 'With one of the most heartwarming stories Broadway has even seen, it should come as no surprise that Aronson and Park are the frontrunners for this honor. They deserve it too, as the entire audience was sobbing by the end of the tight show.', 'Possible Upset: Itamar Moses wrote an excellent book for Dead Outlaw, telling a jaw-dropping story the outlaw Elmer McCurdy with incredible finesse.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Will Aronson and Hue Park', 'Expect Aronson and Park to clean up this year at the Tony Awards, and their lush score for Maybe Happy Ending will likely earn them this award as well. So rarely in the theater do I come out wishing there was a cast album, but I immediately rushed over to Spotify to check. This score immediately enters a list of musical theater staples.', 'Should Win: Erik Della Penna and David Yazbek', 'The music of Dead Outlaw serves as the beating heart of the show, with the band playing live onstage (and interacting with the characters). Della Penna and Yazbek wrote a score not frequently seen on Broadway with its folk and rock leanings, and for that, I believe the two should be awarded with a glittering trophy.', 'Possible Upset: None, give one of these two the crown.', 'The 78th Tony Awards, hosted by Cynthia Erivo, will air on CBS and Paramount+ on June 8.', '', 'Gloria Estefan on Representation in Theater', ""Meet the 'Stranger Things: The First Shadow' Cast"", ""Idina Menzel on Her Iconic Red 'Wicked' Jumpsuit"", 'All Your Favorite It Girls Are Off-Broadway', 'For One Night Only, It’s Trisha Paytas', '‘Wicked’ Casts First Black Full-Time Elphaba', 'What a Year to Be a Theater Kid', 'Barbie Ferreira Does What She Wants', 'Marisa Tomei’s True Love Is the Theater', 'Darren Criss & Helen J Shen on Robots and Broadway', 'Get Tickets to See Wicked on Broadway', ""Glindas and Elphabas Reflect on 'Wicked'"", 'A Part of Hearst Digital Media', 'We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.', '©2025 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

Who Will Win the 2025 Tony Awards?,https://www.vulture.com/article/tony-awards-predictions-2025.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'After a thrillingly packed Broadway season and an awards campaign that has involved more petitions than I ever expected, the Tonys are coming up on Sunday night. There’s a lot to unpack this year with the incursion of Hollywood stars and franchises onto the Great White Way alongside the rise of some local theater darlings. There are races with obvious favorites as well as races in which the consensus is so fragile it could be tousled by a gust of wind. Which is to say, as always, that all our predictions are 100 percent accurate and you should bet all your money on our advice; then you can go invest it in a musical, famously also a guaranteed way to make money.', 'Best Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club\nDead Outlaw\nDeath Becomes Her\nMaybe Happy Ending\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical', 'It has been a really good year for new musicals! I can pretty much imagine any of these shows beating the crop from last year (sorry, sad wet hunks of The Outsiders). But at this point, the race favors Maybe Happy Ending. While Dead Outlaw is a critics’ favorite — I love its dusty wit — I know more than a few people who (wrongly) found it hard to connect with. Death Becomes Her has the industrial support of its producer Universal, solid sales, and all those TikToks based on its line deliveries, but it’s likely a little down-the-middle to edge in. Maybe Happy Ending has the praise, the Cinderella box-office story, and the emotional sentiment baked into its robot love story to make voters connect with it.', 'Best Play\nEnglish\nThe Hills of California\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain\nOh, Mary!\nPurpose', 'I’ve found it fascinating to watch Oh, Mary! — a box-office hit that has dominated conversations in New York and been a Tony front-runner for a whole season — do sort of an underdog campaign for Best Play. A deranged queer comedy is not your typical winner, but there’s a lot of Mary enthusiasm and, considering Betty Gilpin’s and Tituss Burgess’s runs as Mary, proof that the show can go on with or without its creator, Cole Escola (imagine the stars of all genders who could actress out in it on tour). But there’s a case to be made that Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s family drama Purpose, which has picked up steam after a Pulitzer win, is more meat-and-potatoes Tony fare. There’s maybe an outside chance for the finely honed John Proctor Is the Villain, about teenage girls in Georgia confronting The Crucible. But Oh, Mary! somehow seems like the safe choice.', 'Best Revival of a Musical\nFloyd Collins\nGypsy\nPirates! The Penzance Musical\nSunset Blvd.', 'Jamie Lloyd’s Sunset revival cut out the original’s vowels, the sets, and a lot of the costumes from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s lumbering musical, then added a bunch of screens and a ferocious Nicole Scherzinger. His amendments aren’t universally loved but they’re striking, and with a revival, it’s often about how much you can see the work done on evolving the original piece. Enough was done here to make it a likely winner. The show’s main rival is Gypsy, though its director, George C. Wolfe, wasn’t nominated for his work on the musical, which may indicate voters are cooler on it as a whole.', 'Best Revival of a Play\nEureka Day\nRomeo + Juliet\nThornton Wilder’s Our Town\nYellow Face', 'The front-runner here is the most recent: Jonathan Spector’s dark comedy about a progressive California school debating its vaccination policies had an Off Broadway production in 2019, which means Manhattan Theatre Club’s version this spring qualifies as a revival. The play was well received, and voting for it gives the Tonys a chance to make a political statement, especially considering RFK Jr.’s appointment as HHS secretary. The other revivals don’t quite have that grip, though Yellow Face was excellent, and Romeo + Juliet has staged a rather bitchy campaign involving the dictionary definition of revival.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\nDarren Criss — Maybe Happy Ending\nAndrew Durand — Dead Outlaw\nTom Francis — Sunset Blvd.\nJonathan Groff — Just in Time\nJames Monroe Iglehart — A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical\nJeremy Jordan — Floyd Collins', 'There are six nominees in this category instead of the typical five thanks to an arcane rule about ties in the nomination voting process, but that’s just the beginning of the goofiness: Tom Francis’s campaign has involved getting into soda reviews, Andrew Durand stood in a coffin in random places in New York, and Darren Criss has emphasized the physical transformation of playing a robot. Meanwhile, Jonathan Groff is on The Tonight Show talking about getting into leather. So while Criss has a decent shot — and I wish Jeremy Jordan had gotten more attention for singing Collins’s gorgeous score — Groff has the momentum. Even though he won last year for Merrily We Roll Along, his whole show hangs on his personal fascination with mid-century crooner Bobby Darin, and somehow it’s both compelling and a hit.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\nMegan Hilty — Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald — Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers — Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger — Sunset Blvd.\nJennifer Simard — Death Becomes Her', 'Everyone’s favorite category is even more of a nail-biter than usual! Ever since Sunset and Gypsy were announced for the same season, we’ve been speculating about the race between Nicole (who won the Olivier in London) and Audra (who is six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald), and the race between them has fluctuated all season (remember the business about Russell Brand and the red hat?). Right now, momentum may be breaking toward McDonald. She just picked up a Drama Desk Award, and getting a broadside from Patti LuPone has given the community a reason to rally behind her.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\nGeorge Clooney — Good Night, and Good Luck\nCole Escola — Oh, Mary!\nJon Michael Hill — Purpose\nDaniel Dae Kim — Yellow Face\nHarry Lennix — Purpose\nLouis McCartney — Stranger Things, The First Shadow', 'Sure, George Clooney, you can sell 3 million bucks worth of tickets to a Broadway show in a week, but can you pull off a madcap medley in a billowing black dress? Cole Escola’s a hometown hero who has been hard at work downtown for years and is finally getting deserved adulation. I believe and hope they’ll win.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\nLaura Donnelly — The Hills of California\nMia Farrow — The Roommate\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson — Purpose\nSadie Sink — John Proctor Is the Villain\nSarah Snook — The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Sarah Snook’s performance in Dorian Gray shows the work in a way awards-show voters love to reward: She plays every character, and with the help of a dedicated film crew, performs to recorded versions of herself. Nobody else nominated gets that much business to do onstage, though Laura Donnelly’s double act as mother and daughter in a part tailor-made for her was impressive, Sadie Sink made a striking TV-to-theater turn, and it’s great to see how much fun Mia Farrow is having on the campaign trail.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\nBrooks Ashmanskas — SMASH\nJeb Brown — Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein — Gypsy\nJak Malone — Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical\nTaylor Trensch — Floyd Collins', 'Jak Malone has become the focal point of the campaign for Mincemeat, a British comedy about a wild bit of World War II history. The show dominated the West End but has gotten a cooler reception here (Americans like to turn up their noses at humor from across the pond), though Malone delivers its standout number in the first act from the perspective of a stoic secretary, which feels like something voters will reward. Still, keep an eye out for Danny Burstein, who has won before and is as menschy as ever in Gypsy.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical\nNatalie Venetia Belcon — Buena Vista Social Club\nJulia Knitel — Dead Outlaw\nGracie Lawrence — Just in Time\nJustina Machado — Real Women Have Curves: The Musical\nJoy Woods — Gypsy', 'Buena Vista is another show that popped up in a lot of categories but seems most likely to make headway for a featured performance. The musical based on the Cuban supergroup is getting a special Tony for its band, and it feels as though voters will also want to reward Natalie Venetia Belcon, who is imperial and striking as a diva who weathered the revolution and is pulled back into the recording studio (my God, her caftans!).', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play\nGlenn Davis — Purpose\nGabriel Ebert — John Proctor Is the Villain\nFrancis Jue — Yellow Face\nBob Odenkirk — Glengarry Glen Ross\nConrad Ricamora — Oh, Mary!', 'If we’re betting on Mary elsewhere, some of that shine must apply to her serious, very repressed husband, played by Conrad Ricamora, a Broadway vet who almost convinces you the show is a gay breakup drama. There’s also enthusiasm for Francis Jue, incredible as a version of Yellow Face playwright David Henry Hwang’s father (a part he has played before!). There’s also Glenn Davis, who multitasks by being in Purpose and co–artistic directing Steppenwolf, and Bob Odenkirk, though his production of Glengarry was shafted elsewhere.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play\nTala Ashe — English\nJessica Hecht — Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat — English\nFina Strazza — John Proctor Is the Villain\nKara Young — Purpose', 'How does Jessica Hecht not have a Tony? A stage regular with two previous nominations, she may finally get one for playing Eureka Day’s crunchy-granola vaccine skeptic of a mother. But maybe I’ll regret betting against Kara Young, who plays an interloper in the family drama of Purpose and, after winning for Purlie last year, continues a streak of four Featured Actress nominations in a row.', 'Best Direction of a Musical\nSaheem Ali — Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden — Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer — Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli — Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd — Sunset Blvd.', 'It gets fun when the Revival and New Musical categories combine. Voters have to measure their enthusiasm for new work against their appreciation for what was renovated in older work. Or, simply: Do people like the screens in Maybe Happy Ending or Sunset Blvd. more? I’m guessing they go for Jamie Lloyd, who has become a marquee name with a distinctive-tats and star-forward approach (he’s doing a Bill & Ted Waiting for Godot next) and hasn’t yet won a Tony. But there could be more than enough love for Michael Arden, who has championed Maybe Happy and quickly become a Broadway regular (he’s got two shows next season), even if he recently won for Parade.', 'Best Direction of a Play\nKnud Adams — English\nSam Mendes — The Hills of California\nSam Pinkleton — Oh, Mary!\nDanya Taymor — John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams — The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Are we just putting all our chips on Oh, Mary!? I guess so. Phylicia Rashad, who directed its Best Play rival Purpose, wasn’t nominated in the Director category. Kip Williams’s work on Dorian Gray is striking, though it has its detractors — people love Sarah Snook but have mixed feelings about Williams’s social-media-infused take on Wilde. Danya Taymor, an expert in dramas about high-school drama, just won last year for The Outsiders, and Sam Mendes’s and Knud Adams’s shows have already closed. Oh, Mary!’s outrageous farce runs with incredible precision, and that’s all Sam Pinkleton.', 'Best Book of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw — Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her — Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical — David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts', 'It’s hard to tell if we’re in a year like 2017, when The Band’s Visit won basically everything, or a year like the last one, when voters went for more variety. (Then Suffs won for its book and score, while The Outsiders got the big prize). My feeling is this category and the one below will split. Maybe Happy Ending’s jewel-box construction will put it over the edge here …', 'Best Original Score\nDead Outlaw — David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her — Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical — David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves: The Musical — Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', '… But Dead Outlaw’s garage-band rock may give it an edge as a score. (Never bet against David Yazbek.) My perspective is, yes, informed by listening on repeat to Thom Sesma’s hilarious solo from the perspective of a crooning coroner. And to do due diligence, maybe Tony voters have been inundated by so many clips of Death Becomes Her songs online they will be subliminally made to vote for it — but unlike me, I think they are blissfully unaware of TikTok.', 'Best Orchestrations\nJust in Time — Andrew Resnick and Michael Thurber\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson\nFloyd Collins — Bruce Coughlin\nBuena Vista Social Club — Marco Paguia\nSunset Blvd. — David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber', 'Okay, first of all, justice for the un-nominated Dead Outlaw orchestration. And second, what a wild group: Bobby Darin arrangements up against Collins’s bluegrass up against Maybe Happy Ending’s lovely chamber jazz up against Sir ALW’s face-lift on his own work. After a lot of listening, those MHE jazz arrangements stand out to me (such distinctive melodies in the strings!), but I could see enthusiasm for the neo-gothic Sunset or this being a place where voters want to further endorse the music of Buena Vista.', 'Best Choreography\nSMASH — Joshua Bergasse\nGypsy — Camille A. Brown\nDeath Becomes Her — Christopher Gattelli\nBoop! The Musical — Jerry Mitchell\nBuena Vista Social Club — Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck', 'Buena Vista may get another down-ballot win here given that Justin Peck is such a name as a choreographer (though known for ballet, he has won two Tonys already for Carousel and Illinoise) and there’s a fun narrative in his working with his wife. But hey, the kerfuffle over Boop! not getting a slot to perform on live TV may mean the Tony could go to Boop!', 'Best Scenic Design in a Musical\nSwept Away — Rachel Hauck\nMaybe Happy Ending — Dane Laffrey and George Reeve\nBuena Vista Social Club — Arnulfo Maldonado\nDeath Becomes Her — Derek McLane\nJust in Time — Derek McLane', 'In Seoul, where the musical originated, Maybe Happy Ending was performed in a far more minimal way than its American incarnation, which incorporates elaborate design elements to bring two robots (and one beloved potted plant) to life. That feels eye-catching enough to bring it a win here, though voters might also have been dazzled by Swept Away’s coupe de shipwreck or Death Becomes Her’s tumble-ready staircase.', 'Best Costume Design in a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Dede Ayite\nBoop! The Musical — Gregg Barnes\nMaybe Happy Ending — Clint Ramos\nDeath Becomes Her — Paul Tazewell\nJust in Time — Catherine Zuber', 'Paul Tazewell, who just won an Oscar for costume design on the film adaptation of Wicked, is primed to get another Tony (after a win for design for Hamilton) for those striking Death Becomes Her gowns that mimic the characters’ injuries. But I do love the lightly futuristic yet cozy aesthetics of Clint Ramos’s robotwear in Maybe Happy, which could continue a streak here, and voters may have Gregg Barnes’s half brightly colored and half black-and-white designs for Boop!’s Act Two opener seared into their retinas.', 'Best Lighting Design in a Musical\nSunset Blvd. — Jack Knowles\nBuena Vista Social Club — Tyler Micoleau\nFloyd Collins — Scott Zielinski and Ruey Horng Sun\nMaybe Happy Ending — Ben Stanton\nDeath Becomes Her — Justin Townsend', 'In craft categories, there’s an incentive to vote for what you remember, and voters may just have a strong sense memory of being “out there in the dark” of Jack Knowles’s work on Sunset. They could also remember the trickery of the illusions in Death Becomes Her or the darkness of Floyd’s cave or just continue along with love for Maybe Happy Ending (there’s a scene with fireflies that’s lit gorgeously).', 'Best Sound Design of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Jonathan Deans\nSunset Blvd. — Adam Fisher\nJust in Time — Peter Hylenski\nMaybe Happy Ending — Peter Hylenski\nFloyd Collins — Dan Moses Schreier', 'Sunset’s much-discussed Act Two opener sends Tom Francis tromping down the street, performing in sync with the orchestra. That’s the kind of attention grabber voters remember, even if I’ve heard some carping about the concert-level speaker-blowout design of Sunset. The rest all do sound impressively crisp, and if the love for the Buena Vista band really is stronger, that could be a spoiler.', 'Best Scenic Design in a Play\nEnglish — Marsha Ginsberg\nThe Hills of California — Rob Howell\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray — Marg Horwell and David Bergman\nStranger Things: The First Shadow — Miriam Buether and 59 Productions\nGood Night, and Good Luck — Scott Pask', 'I would personally like to announce that I thought the Stranger Things scares were neither good nor spooky, but yeah, there are a lot and they pretty much occupy the show’s entire focus. Stranger Things is already getting a special citation for its illusions and technical effects, but that wouldn’t stop voters from expressing further enthusiasm for the designs here. If not, there’s the screenwork of Dorian Gray or the old-fashioned “Let’s actually construct a whole space” designs of Good Night, and Good Luck and Hills of California.', 'Best Costume Design in a Play\nGood Night, and Good Luck — Brenda Abbandandolo\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray — Marg Horwell\nThe Hills of California — Rob Howell\nOh, Mary! — Holly Pierson\nStranger Things: The First Shadow — Brigitte Reiffenstuel', 'That hoopskirt is pretty much an above-the-title star, and don’t get me started on the Chaperone’s elaborate costumes. Unconventional as Oh, Mary! is as a Tony favorite, I see no reason for the love not to continue here — though, sure, Dorian supplies Sarah Snook with many personae via costume, Good Night evokes the ’60s via precision suiting, and I guess a Demogorgon suit is a costume?', 'Best Lighting Design in a Play\nThe Hills of California — Natasha Chivers\nStranger Things: The First Shadow — Jon Clark\nGood Night, and Good Luck — Heather Gilbert and David Bengali\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain — Natasha Katz and Hannah Wasileski\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray — Nick Schlieper', 'Ooo ooohhh, the demon’s gonna get ya.

"Tony Talk: Our final winner predictions in all 26 categories, including competitive Best Actress in a Musical and Best Play Revival",https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/tony-talk-final-winner-predictions-2025/,"['Welcome to Tony Talk, a column in which Gold Derby contributors Sam Eckmann and David Buchanan offer Tony Awards analysis. In the final week of the 2024-2025 Broadway season, we debate our winner predictions for the biggest prizes and in the most hotly contested categories for one last time. The Tony Awards air Sunday on CBS and Paramount+.', ""David Buchanan: We are now just days away from the Tony Awards, so it's time for us to offer our (nearly) final predictions! For such an incredible season on Broadway, it seems like a lot of the top categories have coalesced around one contender. I think we're both in agreement that Maybe Happy Ending is far and away the favorite for Best Musical. I know there has been growing support for Death Becomes Her in the past two weeks, but not enough to displace those beloved Helperbots, right?"", '', '', ""Sam Eckmann: Yes, I'm feeling super confident about Maybe Happy Ending taking Best Musical. Death Becomes Her has become a popular alternate, but with no actual guaranteed wins, it isn't favored enough to overcome the androids in one of the biggest Broadway success stories of the season. Speaking of unlikely successes, I'm also certain that Cole Escola's radically queer camp-fest Oh, Mary! will take Best Play. It's one of the strongest lineups we've ever seen in this category, but that's also why it's so hard for anything to surpass Mary Todd Lincoln here: voters are in love with them all and not coalescing around a single alternative. Do you think the revival races are as clear cut?"", '', '', ""Buchanan: I agree on Oh, Mary! for Best Play. There are two potential challengers — Purpose and John Proctor Is the Villain — and if voters go somewhere else, I think it would be for Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, who has been doing a lot of press in support of his Pulitzer Prize winner. But a zeitgeist-capturing show like Oh, Mary! is hard to beat. The revival races are a bit murkier. Of the two categories, I'm more confident in Best Musical Revival, where I have Sunset Boulevard out front. I've made this comparison before, but this year strikes me as similar to the Oklahoma! versus Kiss Me, Kate contest in 2019, where the more divisive, riskier production pulled off a victory over a more straightforward, conventional staging. Did Gypsy's win at the Drama Desk Awards change your prediction?"", '', '', ""Eckmann: I've spoken with voters who have returned for a second viewing of Gypsy this spring and found that many elements of the production have clicked into place in a way that they said didn't happen in the fall. So the show is experiencing an upswing. Still, I think George C. Wolfe's omission in the directing category plants Gypsy firmly in second place to Sunset Boulevard. Even those who aren't enamored with Jamie Lloyd's directorial concept say they respect the uniqueness of the show. The closer race is Eureka Day vs. Yellow Face for Best Play Revival. David Henry Hwang and company have certainly run the larger awards campaign, with countless voter screenings of the PBS video capture of Yellow Face. And yet, Eureka Day claimed the Drama League, Drama Desk, and Dorian Awards when both plays went head-to-head. It's likely due to the timeliness of its vaccine-mandate storyline as measles cases pop up across the country. I'm still going with Yellow Face, but I think this will be one of the closest races of the night."", 'Buchanan: I am similarly sticking with Yellow Face, though the awards run for Eureka Day has been impressive. Manhattan Theatre Club very astutely released video of the 16-minute Zoom scene from the latter production for voters to consider, and that is truly a standout moment of the Broadway season which could help the show pull off a victory. This is the one of the four production categories that I will be rethinking and updating until Tony night.', ""But there is no greater contest or closer race this year than Best Actress in a Musical. You and I have been firmly predicting Gypsy's Audra McDonald for the entire season, and the six-time Tony winner has been on an upswing with other theater awards, winning the Drama Desk and the Dorian Award. But for the first time since the Tony nominations, Sunset Boulevard's Nicole Scherzinger has taken the lead in Gold Derby's combined odds and has that coveted Drama League Award win. Plus, there's Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk victor Jasmine Amy Rogers from Boop! The Musical ready to surprise like some other newcomers in recent years. As I've expressed in earlier columns, McDonald's performance is far and away my favorite of the Broadway season and has emotionally walloped me all three times I've seen her, so I am not wavering in my prediction that she wins a historic seventh trophy. What is your final proclamation on this contest?"", '', '', 'Eckmann: Scherzinger had a slight edge in this battle after she won the Drama League, but the winds have shifted. The recent controversy stirred up by Patti LuPone, in which she spoke disparagingly about Kecia Lewis and McDonald, has earned the Gypsy star palpable good will in the theater community. That doesn’t mean this is a done deal for McDonald, however, as there is a massive surge for Rogers as Betty Boop. There are definitely voters hesitant to give McDonald a seventh trophy and are instead being won over by the “star is born” narrative for Rogers. McDonald won the Dorian Award, Rogers won the Outer Critics Circle Award, and they both shared a win at the Drama Desks. All three actresses enter this final week with serious hardware in tow. I personally think our odds are off and Rogers has surpassed Scherzinger for second place behind McDonald. I’m still betting on this six-time winner to break her own Tony record, but it remains a nail-biter. Shall we move to Best Actor in a Musical, where I think the race has settled to a more manageable two-person heat?', ""Buchanan: I am predicting Darren Criss, as he is the face of Maybe Happy Ending and the musical should likely perform exceptionally well on Tony night. But I don't think this is a slam-dunk victory just yet. The contest could likely come down to his equal-parts technically precise and heartwarming performance versus the charismatic burst of energy from Jonathan Groff in Just in Time. I know historically there has never been a lead actor to win two consecutive trophies in this category, but I don't think Tony voters really know or care about those statistics like we do, and there's almost nobody as beloved or endearing as Groff in the industry right now. Just In Time also did well with nominations overall, and this could be the opportunity to reward it. Are those the two men you had in mind? I'd also flag Tom Francis of Sunset Boulevard, who is campaigning just as vociferously as the others, has the standout performance of the title song in Shubert Alley, and could possibly upset if his show exceeds our expectations."", '', '', 'Eckmann: Francis and Jeremy Jordan (Floyd Collins) both have ardent supporters, but I think the focus has narrowed to Criss and Groff. Regarding the stat about back-to-back victories, there has hardly been any meaningful opportunities in Tony history for consecutive winners in this category. So it’s a non-factor, really. Groff has the showier role and could absolutely win. But, I’m betting Criss takes it (by only a hair) because of the overall popularity of Maybe Happy Ending, and because his performance tugs at the heart more than any of his fellow nominees.', ""Buchanan: In contrast to these lead musical races, the contests for Best Actress in a Play and Best Actor in a Play appear pretty sewn up for Sarah Snook (The Picture of Dorian Gray) and Cole Escola (Oh, Mary!), don't they? There are other performers in these two categories who would make extremely deserving winners, but I'm not sensing any major changes in sentiment that would lead me to actually predict an upset."", '', '', ""Eckmann: Agreed on Escola and Snook. Though I will fangirl over Laura Donnelly in The Hills of California until the day I die. At least she got a Drama Desk win! Upsets are more likely elsewhere. Featured Actor in a Play has become a true coin toss between Conrad Ricamora of Oh, Mary! and Francis Jue of Yellow Face. I was previously thinking Jue, but have switched to Ricamora since he is in the more favored show, but I don't feel confident in it. Featured Actress in a Play remains a wild ride. The fact that presumed frontrunner Jessica Hecht wasn't even nominated at the Drama Desk, Drama League, or Outer Critics Circle for her amazing role in Eureka Day gives me pause. So I still have a crazy hunch that Dorian-winner Fina Strazza is going to pull off the biggest upset of the night as a way to reward John Proctor is the Villain. We all need one gutsy prediction right?"", ""Buchanan: My thinking in the featured races may evolve depending on where I land in Best Play Revival. Yellow Face doesn't need an acting win to pull off a victory, but if it does prevail, then I think Jue likely goes along for the ride for what I consider the best performance in that production. I'm tempted to go along with you and predict Strazza, but at this point in the Tony countdown, I'm going to stick with my instinct and predict Kara Young from Purpose to repeat. My belief in her was buoyed by her win at the Drama Desk Awards, not because these voting bodies have a lot of overlap, but because it is clear she continues to be cherished throughout the industry, and that sentiment sometimes propels you to consecutive prizes at the Tonys just as Judith Light and Laurie Metcalf experienced not so long ago. Fortunately, the Featured Actor in a Musical and Featured Actress in a Musical contests seem much steadier, as we're both still hanging onto Jak Malone from Operation Mincemeat and Natalie Venetia Belcon for Buena Vista Social Club. "", ""Let's pivot to some other confounding categories that we haven't discussed before! You and I both made a pretty big switch this week in Best Director of a Musical when we bumped Jamie Lloyd out of our first spot in favor of Michael Arden for Maybe Happy Ending. Are you getting a sense like I am that even if Sunset wins Best Revival, the production might be too different and too divisive to carry visionary Lloyd across the finish line, whereas few will quibble with Arden's work on the Best Musical frontrunner?"", '', '', 'SEE Tony Talk: Predicting the tricky musical acting categories including Audra McDonald vs. Nicole Scherzinger', ""Eckmann: As recently as one week ago I would have told you that Lloyd had director in the bag for Sunset Blvd. But Arden has completely overtaken the conversation this past week. Voters have been enamored with his pitch-perfect work in Maybe Happy Ending all season, but were hesitant to reward him so soon after his Parade victory two years ago. If you talk to any voters now though, they clearly overcame their hesitation. Arden has been a constant presence on the awards circuit and successfully snatched the momentum. He's won the Drama League, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Awards. I’d actually be shocked if anyone else took the Tony at this point. I also feel fairly confident that Sam Pinkleton will take Best Director of a Play for Oh, Mary! Danya Taymor will put up one hell of a fight for John Proctor Is the Villain, and would be the rare person to win consecutive trophies after her victory for The Outsiders last year. But voters have gotten the message that Pinkleton's work is just as essential to Oh, Mary! as Escola's script."", '', '', 'Buchanan: Since we now both predict Maybe Happy Ending to nab Directing, will it sweep and pick up wins for Best Original Score and Best Musical Book? Our current odds have it running the table and a lot of experts agree, but in such an exceptionally strong year for original musicals, I\'m keenly looking out for a surprise. I surmise we\'re diverging on these categories significantly because I\'m going against the grain on score and predicting Dead Outlaw. David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna have written the ear-worm of the season with ""Dead"" and delivered a true genre-spanning, Americana, rollicking collection of songs that infuse a lot of grit and heart into the true story of Elmer McCurdy. I also think folks underestimate how well-respected Yazbek is in the industry, and this is far and away his strongest offering since The Band\'s Visit, if not one of the best of his career. Our odds once had Pulitzer finalist Itamar Moses winning for Dead Outlaw\'s book but have recently switched to Maybe Happy Ending, and I made the move with them. Are we 0-for-2 matching each other\'s predictions here?', ""Eckmann: I understand your point about Yazbek, but I don't think everyone is unanimously in love with Dead Outlaw. I feel overly confident that Will Aronson and Hue Park have Score in the bag for their tuneful music in Maybe Happy Ending, which will pair well with its Best Musical win. Best Book of a Musical feels more rife for an upset. Moses brought the most unique concept to life, so he is certainly in the hunt. Comedic books can also land here, as was the case for Tootsie and Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder. So this could be a place where voters throw a bone to Death Becomes Her and Marco Pennette's hysterical reinvigoration of the classic movie. I'm waffling between the funny bone of Death Becomes Her and the bleeding heart of Maybe Happy Ending, likely choosing the latter. Speaking of waffling, can we dish on the design categories? Sunset Boulevard appears to be the likely winner for both Musical Lighting Design and Musical Sound Design, and Dane Laffrey will surely win Musical Scenic Design. But I can't seem to choose between Death Becomes Her or Boop! The Musical for costumes. Boop! has the potential to spoil the race in all three of its nominations! Where are you leaning?"", 'SEE Tony Talk: Sarah Snook and Cole Escola remain strong in lead, but upsets loom in the featured play races', '', '', 'Buchanan: That is an extraordinarily tough contest for Musical Costume Design between Gregg Barnes for Boop! and Paul Tazewell for Death Becomes Her! Both would make for deserving winners and Tazewell has had an extraordinary year with his historic Academy Award win for Wicked, but I have landed on Boop! for the upset win. My decision is mostly derived from the utterly brilliant work he did on the Act Two opener, ""Where Is Betty?,"" in which the entire ensemble wears half black-and-white and half technicolor costumes and alternatively turn 180 degrees to instantaneously transport the audience between Betty\'s cartoon world and New York City. It is the kind of old-school theatrical design sleight of hand that screams to be recognized. Despite the cleverness of that number and of the Boop! opening, ""A Little Versatility,"" where we see Betty perform in different short films, I\'m going with Buena Vista Social Club for Best Choreography. Justin Peck has been irresistible to Tony voters thus far and the work he and his wife Patricia Delgado did bringing these iconic Cuban songs to life on stage is pulse-pounding. Speaking of that indelible music, we\'re both aligned on it taking the prize for Best Orchestrations, too.', ""For the four play design categories, it looks like the technical marvel Stranger Things: The First Shadow will very likely gobble up three for Play Scenic Design, Play Lighting Design, and Play Sound Design, but how about that tricky Play Costume Design category? Will Mary Todd Lincoln's hoop skirts or Sarah Snook's two dozen different looks prevail?"", 'Eckmann: Stranger Things should indeed prevail in three of its four categories thanks to its monstrously impressive stagecraft. But the costume design race is a different story. Our odds favor Oh, Mary! and it certainly helps that the show is a wildly popular Best Play nominee. But I believe The Picture of Dorian Gray costumer Marg Horwell will handily buck our odds and place a Tony on her shelf next to the Olivier she won for the same show. Her outfits, and their ability to rapidly transform in front of the audience, are an essential piece of Sarah Snook’s 26-character magic trick. Now let’s see how smart, or foolish, we look when the winners are unveiled this Sunday.', 'SIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions', 'Your email address will not be published.

Here are our critics’ predictions for Best Directors of a Musical and a Play, Best Book of a Musical, Best Original Score, and Best Choreography.', 'Best Direction of a Musical\nSaheem Ali, Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden, Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer, Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd, Sunset Blvd.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Michael Arden\nShould win: David Cromer', 'David Cromer has long had the most sensitive eye for lighting among the small handful of directors who regularly work on Broadway, but his collaboration with designer Heather Gilbert is extraordinary, with the early scenes materializing in the dark spaces around the band, which is the engine that drives Dead Outlaw. It’s beautiful and understated, pointing the way for future production that won’t enjoy a Broadway budget. But Michael Arden is also doing some next-level work with Maybe Happy Ending, deploying eye-popping projections and a complicated set for a musical that feels simultaneously high-tech and old-fashioned. The Tony voters will appreciate that bridge-building and reward him for it.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Michael Arden\nShould win: Christopher Gattelli', 'Maybe Happy Ending came out of nowhere and surprised just about everyone who’s seen it with its intriguing set, endearing performances, and charming score. Those surprises don’t come by chance. Michael Arden shows us how you can take something simple and transform it into something extraordinary. But Christopher Gattelli takes something big and makes it even bigger in Death Becomes Her. I’m still laughing about the melee between Jennifer Simard and Megan Hilty that culminated in a slo-mo staircase tumble. Brilliant and hilarious.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Michael Arden\nShould win: Michael Arden', 'In a very un-British way, Sunset Boulevard director Jamie Lloyd is kissing every baby this season – he’s at event after event supporting the show and his nomination, despite being in rehearsals for a major revival of Evita in the West End at the same time. He must really want this one. But Michael Arden is going to win it for finding the heart in a pair of lonely, obsolete robots who fall in love while on a road trip across Korea.', 'Best Direction of a Play\nKnud Adams, English\nSam Mendes, The Hills of California\nSam Pinkleton, Oh, Mary!\nDanya Taymor, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams, The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Kip Williams\nShould win: Knud Adams', 'I suspect Tony voters will be wowed by the way Williams marshals so many moving parts in the solo adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, which uses live and recorded video so that Sarah Snook can play opposite herself. It’s impressive, but I was more astounded by the intricately layered performances Knud Adams was able to draw out of every cast member in English, a play that carved out a space on Broadway this season for quietly nuanced drama.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Sam Pinkleton\nShould win: Kip Williams', 'Kip Williams deserves this award for orchestrating the intricate series of technical maneuvers and camera angles that make Sarah Snook’s already breathtaking performance larger than life. But Sam Pinkleton does something equally impressive with a far less expensive set: He creates an outrageous atmosphere of camp and sustained laughter from Cole Escola’s ridiculously funny script. Comedy like that is hard, but Pinkleton makes it look easy.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Sam Pinkleton\nShould win: Sam Pinkleton', 'Dying is easy, comedy is hard. But in Oh, Mary!, everyone on stage makes getting a laugh look effortless. It’s all thanks to the finely tuned eye of Sam Pinkleton, who lets his actors be over the top will still managing to reign it in. He spreads his secret sauce all over Mary Todd Lincoln, and it’s perfect.', 'Best Book of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club, Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw, Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her, Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending, Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical, David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'In almost any other season, Itamar Moses would easily take this award for his brilliant dramatic autopsy of a true tale of American entrepreneurship and exploitation in Dead Outlaw. It’s both chilling and hilarious. But this year voters also have the option of awarding Will Aronson and Hue Park’s heartwarming book for Maybe Happy Ending, a love story between two retired robots that will have them thinking about their own marriages and mortality.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Itamar Moses for Dead Outlaw\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'Maybe Happy Ending is one of the most charming and original stories that a Broadway has seen in recent years. Having said that, Dead Outlaw is the most original. Who would have thought that a corpse would have such an entertaining musical in it! Itamar Moses did. That kind of vision along with terrific execution deserves the award.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts for Operation Mincemeat\nShould win: Itamar Moses for Dead Outlaw', 'In my mind, this is the only category (other than Featured Actor in a Musical) where Operation Mincemeat has the chance to win, so I think voters will spread the love its way accordingly. The most original book this season is Dead Outlaw, which Itamar Moses tells like a murder ballad and a ghost story all at the same time.', 'Best Original Score\nDead Outlaw, David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her, Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending, Will Aronson (music and lyrics) and Hue Park (lyrics)\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical, David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves: The Musical, Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'This is another category where the race comes down to two frontrunners: Dead Outlaw and Maybe Happy Ending. While Yazbek and Della Penna use a vast range of American musical styles (but most effectively rock) to tell their grim all-American story, Aronson and Park have set their futuristic musical to a jazz score that sound like old Broadway, even if the show is about South Korean robots. I predict the latter score, full of earworm melodies and clever lyrics, will take it by a hair.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'Operation Mincemeat‘s standout number is “Dear Bill,” but I found most of the other numbers forgettable. Dead Outlaw showcases some head-bobbing rock among other musical genres, making it by far the most eclectic score out of these nominees. But Maybe Happy Ending feels the most cohesive and well-crafted, with a roster of a couple dozens songs each of which tickle the ear and contribute to the story. It will edge out the others.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'This is a category filled with just ok scores. The jazzy tunes of Maybe Happy Ending are the most ok of them all, even if the album I’m playing over and over is Dead Outlaw.', 'Best Choreography\nJoshua Bergasse, SMASH\nCamille A. Brown, Gypsy\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJerry Mitchell, BOOP! The Musical\nPatricia Delgado and Justin Peck, Buena Vista Social Club', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck for Buena Vista Social Club\nShould win: Joshua Bergasse for SMASH', 'Justin Peck won this category last year for Illinoise, and it seems likely he’ll get a repeat with collaborator Patricia Delgado for the excellent dancing in Buena Vista Social Club. It’s one of the few categories this show has a fighting chance to win. But my heart is with Joshua Bergasse, whose imaginative choreography for SMASH was a loving tribute to old Broadway and its reigning queen, director Susan Stroman.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck for Buena Vista Social Club\nShould win: Jerry Mitchell for BOOP! The Musical', 'Buena Vista Social Club‘s choreography contributes to the storytelling as much as the score does, and it’s performed so energetically that it’s hard to not stand up in your seat and join in. But Jerry Mitchell created some equally exciting dance numbers in BOOP!, particularly an inspired Act 2 opener. I’d be just as happy to see this one win.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Jerry Mitchell for BOOP! The Musical\nShould win: Camille A. Brown for Gypsy', 'In this category, Camille A. Brown had the hardest job — choreographing all new moves for Gypsy, a musical that has relied on the Jerome Robbins strobes for 60 years. I’d like to see her finally get it, but I would never begrudge Jerry Mitchell, a lovely man and clever thinker who created one of the best production numbers ever in act-two opener “Where Is Betty?”', ""Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!"", 'Now available for unlimited viewings.', ""Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!"", 'By providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.', '©1999-2025 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

The other five are Tony-nom first-timers: Scherzinger, 46, formerly of the Pussycat Dolls; Criss, 38, Glee star and Emmy winner for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story; and Snook, 37, who shot to fame on Succession, for which she won an Emmy last year. Escola, 38, who uses they/them pronouns, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and McCartney, 21, making his professional stage debut, are the season’s breakouts.', 'The group was diverse in more ways than one. Criss, at one point, marveled: “We have a Gen Z from Belfast who’s playing an American [McCartney]. We have a Czech-Filipino-Hawaiian girl playing Norma Desmond [Scherzinger]. We have a non-binary person playing Mary Todd Lincoln [Escola], an Australian woman playing several Englishmen [Snook], a gay farm boy from Pennsylvania playing Bobby Darin [Groff], a Black girl from Fresno playing Rose [McDonald] and a white passing Asian-American as a robot [Criss himself]. Like, what the fuck is going on here? That’s incredible!”', '', 'You can watch the entire conversation — or read a transcript of it edited for clarity and brevity — below.', '00:00\n00:00', 'Before we dive into your shows, can you talk about a person who provided you with the tools to perform eight shows a week, at the level at which you are doing it, without losing your mind or body?', 'DARREN CRISS I think anybody here with kids has to give full unbridled credit to our partners, because it’s a Herculean task to be a parent — a present one — and to have the commitment that doing a Broadway show demands. To quote Wicked, because I’m a theater geek, “Magic is a demanderating mistress,” and it does not let up. I’d also like to shout out a movement professor I had at the University of Michigan, Malcolm Tulip. He helped to unlock my interest in physical theater. It was just a niche interest for me that I never thought would come up in any other realm in my life. Cut to 20 years later, I find myself in a situation where I call upon the skillsets that he introduced to me.', 'LOUIS MCCARTNEY One of our directors, Justin Martin. He’s been one of the people who stepped up when I moved away from home, as a director and being there for me as a bro, just hanging out and keeping me going through the hard times.', '', 'AUDRA MCDONALD Zoe Caldwell, who I did Master Class with in 1996. I didn’t know what I was doing and I was very frightened about working with her, because she was such grand lady and one of the greatest actresses of the theater. But she ended up becoming such a mentor that I named one of my daughters after her. I learned from Zoe by watching how disciplined she was about the preparation for each performance, about knowing everybody’s name at the theater, making sure that she was thanking everybody on a nightly basis. I have adopted a lot of her methods, one of which is making sure that I’m at the theater a good three hours before showtime. I don’t want the train to be about to take off and I’m just getting to the theater. I’m going to be the one to make sure that the train is ready to go.', 'JONATHAN GROFF Our choreographer, Shannon Lewis, is a prolific Broadway dancer, but Just in Time was her choreographic debut. I’ve never really danced before this, and she was, “I got you.” She gave me 10 weeks of dance lessons, three times a week, before the first day of rehearsal. She taught me this thirty-minute physical warm-up of five different songs that she has on a playlist, and I do it every day before doing the show.', 'COLE ESCOLA Darren’s wife. [laughs] Actually, there’s this great interview where Zoe Caldwell is telling this anecdote about when she stepped in for Anne Bancroft in The Devils, and she’s recalling a line off the cuff and turns her head and goes right into character. The lights don’t actually change, but you feel like there’s a lighting change and a temperature drop — I’m getting goosebumps now just thinking about it. But it reminded me, “Oh, it’s just about having immediate and free access to your imagination.” So, Darren’s wife and Zoe Caldwell.', '', 'SARAH SNOOK The vocal coach that I worked with in Australia, Geraldine Cook. I hadn’t done theater since 2016, and needed to get my instrument back into shape and to get the athleticism going for this particular show, with so many different characters and talking for two hours straight, yelling and speaking quietly and all of that. And she was really instrumental in being able to switch them on quickly, and to also know that I have something to go back on when, in the 10th week, you’re like, “My voice is shot. What am I going to do?”', 'NICOLE SCHERZINGER It’s not necessarily a person for me, it’s a higher power, because it’s so much bigger than me — as we all know, it is a lot. So I’d have to say a higher power, and my ancestors.', 'Cole, you’d been thinking about doing something about Mary Todd Lincoln for 15 years. Why her?', 'ESCOLA I had the idea, “What if Abraham Lincoln’s assassination was a good thing for Mary Todd?” [laughs] But it’s really a story about someone with a dream that everyone around her thinks is stupid — and that’s how I felt about this idea, so it’s very meta. It’s Mary’s story, and then it’s my story with the show—', 'SCHERZINGER And Norma’s story.', 'ESCOLA And Rose’s story. My deep fear is that I’m irredeemably annoying. So I thought, “Can you root for someone who’s completely annoying, with no redeeming qualities? Can you have the audience on her side by the end, even though she’s just id the whole time? That was my hope.”', 'Audra, at the age of 10, you were part of a production of Gypsy at a dinner theater in Fresno?', 'MCDONALD Yes, I was one of Uncle’s Jocko’s buddies. [laughs]', 'Over the years since, was it even an aspiration of yours to be a part of a Broadway production of it? Where did the idea come from?', '', 'MCDONALD Gavin Creel [the Tony-winning actor who died of cancer last year just 48], who was a wondrous friend to many of us here. He brought Sara Bareilles to Thanksgiving dinner at our house, and my older daughter was obsessed with Sara, so at one point Gavin said to her, “Why don’t you go talk to her?” And then, as I was nursing my younger daughter upstairs, I heard Sara at the piano and my older daughter, who plays the bass, playing “Who Made You King of Anything?” I ran downstairs to take pictures, and then Gavin said, “Oh, honey, I want to talk to you about something! Come here!” And he dragged me into the garage and told me his idea that I should play Rose in Gypsy.', 'SCHERZINGER Wow, that’s an amazing story!', 'MCDONALD So it’s a tribute to Gavin. He’s the one who put it in my head.', 'Jonathan, you portray Bobby Darin from around 19 to 31, and he died at 37. Your association with this project goes back to 2018?', 'GROFF Eight years ago, [producer] Ted Chapin asked me to do a night of Bobby Darin music at the 92nd Street Y. Sort of like you, Cole, part of my inspiration is watching clips of divas singing, so I went home and watched Bobby Darin performing on YouTube, and I had this reaction that I normally feel when I watch Barbra [Streisand] or Judy [Garland] or Beyoncé — it’s usually reserved for a female performer, but he was singing for his life. Then I started learning about him, that he was told that he was going to die by the time he was 16, so from 16 to 37 was all borrowed time for him, and is reflected in the primal way that he’s leaping, in these black and white clips, off of my computer screen. I read this quote that, “At the end of the day, he was a nightclub animal,” which is now a line at the end of our show. So at the Y, we started doing his music live, which was really fun, but then all of a sudden, in the space between audience and performer, it felt spiritual. For the last seven and a half years, we’ve been trying to make it happen [on Broadway]. And now we’re at Circle in the Square, finally getting to do it for an audience, and it’s like drugs. It’s great.', '', 'Nicole, the world first got to know you through the Pussycat Dolls — you ladies were together from 2003 through 2010 — but from what I understand, your interest in and involvement with theater predated that, and you’ve been on a quest to get back to it. In fact, I was invited to something at the Pendry Hotel in LA in 2022, and I wasn’t sure what was behind it, but I was thrilled to get to see you—', 'SCHERZINGER You went?!', 'Yes. This was an intimate performance that you gave, which sort of connects to Sunset Blvd., right?', 'SCHERZINGER I got my first job when I was about 14 at the Actors Theatre of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky — which, for Louisville, Kentucky, is big time, y’all — and I was in a youth performing arts high school. That’s where I found my tribe. I always felt, since I was a little girl, that I didn’t really fit in and didn’t really feel comfortable in my skin, but then I went to this performing arts school and I was like, “Oh my gosh, these humans are just like me!” I started out in voice and learned to read music and sang in the choir; and then I went to musical theater. Ms. Mateus cast me in Alice when I was 15—', 'ESCOLA Alice in Wonderland?', 'SCHERZINGER Alice in Wonderland.', 'ESCOLA Okay. It could have been Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. [laughs]', '', 'SCHERZINGER And that was big-time for me because back then people didn’t cast roles like that. I was like, “Yo, you’re casting a Hawaiian-Ukrainian-Filipina girl as Alice?!” So, that’s where my love affair began with musical theater. I went on to college and to do a lot more musical theater — summer stock in many different places around the country — so yes, this is over 30 years in the making. In the Dolls we have a song called “When I Grow Up [I Want to Be Famous],” and we were shooting that music video on Hollywood Blvd. in front of the Pantages, and there’s actually a video where I go, “I always thought I’d end up on that side of the street,” and it pans to the Pantages with Wicked. I was fortunate enough to do Rent at the Hollywood Bowl 10 years ago. Neil Patrick Harris directed it and it had a beautiful cast—', 'CRISS I saw that! It was fantastic. You smoked that.', 'SCHERZINGER Around 2017 or 2018, I was like, “Can I please audition for things?” And people wouldn’t even allow me to audition. So I created my own show and put it on in London, New York at the Django, and then in LA [at the Pendry]. I was like, “I’m just going to go put it on myself and invite people to come.” It was all the roles that I wanted to be cast in and all the songs that I wanted to sing. And that’s what you saw.', 'You obviously achieved your objective, because Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jamie Lloyd approached you about Sunset Blvd. — and I know you sort of thought at the time, “Is it a great compliment or insult to be asked to play Norma Desmond?” But I think the ultimate compliment came after Andrew Lloyd Webber later said that your performance is the best thing that he’s ever seen in anything that he’s been a part of, which is high praise.', 'ESCOLA He didn’t see me in Cats. [laughs]', 'Darren, Maybe Happy Ending is an original musical. How did it get on your radar and how did you wind up bringing it to Broadway?', '', 'CRISS I think all the best stories that we weren’t really prepared to hear — Batman or Star Wars are examples. If you were trying to elevator-pitch any of them, people would be like, “What the fuck are you talking about? That’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard.” So it is fun to be part of something so singular. I was telling Audra that I name-drop her every night when people come by to say hello. I say, “I don’t envy the Herculean task that Audra has. First, it’s over three hours of ripping your soul out vocally, emotionally, all these things. But because it’s such a known piece, people also come in with comparisons and expectations, which isn’t fair to her—', 'MCDONALD And singing along! [laughs]', 'CRISS Because I’ve done shows like Little Shop [of Horrors, Off Broadway] and Hedwig [and the Angry Inch, on Broadway] where people know the material, that can also be an obstacle and something that you have to overcome, for better or for worse. For me, I’ve never been a part of anything where audience has been completely unencumbered by expectation or experience. That in itself is an obstacle, because now I have to try and convince them that this is something somewhat worthwhile, but it is amazing to feel that the gasp of, “What is going on?!” But in short, this came to me in 2018, and it was just a matter of being available — the pandemic and then a strike and so many things that happened until finally the stars aligned in a way that I’m so grateful for.', 'Sarah, The Picture of Dorian Gray was never done for the stage until 2020, when it was first performed in Australia. How did you wind up attached to it?', '', 'SNOOK Kip [Williams, the playwright] and I had a conversation about it around March of 2023. I was about to go and shoot the final scenes in Barbados for season four of Succession. I went, “This is an amazing thing that’s about to end, and this is something else that I could go on to.” The question, first of all, was, “What’s the earliest you think you could do this? We have a theater we’re looking at in August.” [laughs] I was like, “I have a baby I’m currently cooking. She’s due in April. So there’s no way I can make August work. The earliest I could do it is this time next year.” And so they accommodated that.', 'You’re used to having to perform a lot of lines very quickly, between Sorkin’s with Steve Jobs and Succession, among other things, but doing so while also literally running from one character into another, as you do in Dorian Gray, is different.', 'SNOOK It’s different. And it’s prose that has been turned into dialogue and that has to be spoken in a way that the audience can receive it, to understand it, to be engaged with it — finding places to be incredibly swift with it, because we need to be moving on and get the audience leaning forward, and then also to allow them to sort of sit back for a second and enjoy the pretty pictures. And I think, ironically, that having a baby and doing this show was maybe a good choice because it means that you stay very straight and narrow. You’re not going out after the show to have a drink or wind down. It’s like, “No, I’ve got to go breastfeed in two hours, so I’m going to try to get another hour-and-a-half of sleep now, wake up and feed, and then go back to sleep.”', 'Louis, you’re only 21. What was going on in your life when you first heard about Stranger Things: The First Shadow? Were you already a watcher of Stranger Things?', '', 'MCCARTNEY I was just moving out of Dublin. My dad and I were doing our little YouTube channel, which is how they [the show’s producers] got wind of me, and how my agent got wind of me me as well. I was finishing up season three of Hope Street, which was the soap I did. And then I got wind of this “untitled Netflix play directed by Stephen Daldry,” and I did three to four months of auditions, and was flying back to Belfast, and finally we got word that it was Henry Creel, so all my focus then turned on Jamie Campbell Bower [who played the character on the TV show] and his performance in season four. I think he’s phenomenal — I wanted to emulate that, but also create my own line of Henry Creel because he’s a kid in the show, and we’re dealing with this idea, “What if he’s a good boy? What if he just wants to go to school and get a girlfriend?” At the start of the process, I judged him and thought that he was a bad kid, but now I think he’s a really good kid and it’s his conditioning and the people around him that shaped him. But that’s the question of our play. It’s quite a psychological Greek take on Stranger Things. You’ve got the mother archetype and you have the tragic hero, very Hamlet, and there’s lots of questions to the stars, “Why me and why am I like this?” But also keeping with the mythology of Stranger Things and honoring the fans.', 'It has now been 10 years since the opening on Broadway of a little show called Hamilton, which Mr. Groff here helped to bring to life. Jonathan, 10 years later, what do you believe is the greatest legacy of Hamilton?', '', 'GROFF That Lin-Manuel Miranda is a fucking genius and wrote an unparalleled work of art. I replaced Brian d’Arcy James in the show Off Broadway at the Public Theater. He originated the role of the King, so I got this really interesting experience with the show because I always felt outside of it and inside of it at the same time. Lin and I became friends when I was doing Spring Awakening and he was doing In The Heights, and we had stayed in touch, and then Brian had to leave and Lin texted me, “What are you doing next month? Can you come be in the show that I wrote for a couple months Off Broadway?” I was like, “Sure.” I went on a Friday and was in the show on Tuesday. When I saw it, I was like, “Oh my God!” I mean, we all had that experience seeing it. The King is only on stage for nine minutes; when we moved to Broadway to the Richard Rodgers, I would peek through the curtain, watching the show. Lin is such a brilliant performer, he has such an awareness of storytelling and audience, and he knew how to keep everyone’s attention for two-and-a-half, three hours. Even when I’m listening to the mashup that we’re doing on the Tonys I’m like, “Oh my God, Hamilton is so good!” Now it’s been around for a decade and you’re like, “Oh, yeah, it’s Hamilton” — it’s the poster and it’s “send all your friends to see it” and whatever. But every time I re-engage with the material, it’s just pure genius.', 'Audra, yours is the sixth Broadway incarnation of Gypsy, and you are the first person of color to play Rose. You’ve been navigating this conversation your whole life, or at least since you were 16 and playing Eva Perón in Evita. Also, you received your first Tony nomination for Carousel, for a part that had been played by white people. Can you take us into your experience with nontraditional casting?', 'MCDONALD I was very lucky growing up in Fresno, California, and having two parents who needed something for their very hyperactive, over-emotional, over-dramatic child who was struggling deeply. They found this dinner theater for me, and I went and auditioned and became a part of the little junior troupe. And once I was a part of that troupe, like when all of us kind of find theater, it was, “Oh, here I am!”', 'ESCOLA “Bye, everyone!”', '', 'MCDONALD “I know who I am now.” Or, “I know that there are a lot of people like me,” whether we know who we are or not. But in that theater in Fresno, I at one point was cast to play the Servant Girl in The Miracle Worker — I just ran out and auditioned for it and got the part — and my parents said, “Absolutely not. You will not be playing that part. We don’t need to have you out there perpetuating stereotypes. There are other roles for you.” From then on, it was, “What role do you think you can play? And make them say no to you.” So when the call came to audition for Carousel, I think that helped me. I’m trying to find who a person is, not what they look like; that’s a part of it, but, “Who are they? And is there something in my soul that can help illuminate who that character is?” And that’s what I feel about what’s happened with Rose. The main thing with me playing Rose as a Black woman is we are not shrinking away from it. We have not changed a single line. We have not changed any of the grammar. A lot of people come to this show and say, “Oh, well Rose is saying “that ain’t this” and “that ain’t that” — I’m like, “That’s what Arthur Laurents wrote!” I felt I just knew who she was, and why couldn’t it be a Black woman’s story? Why couldn’t it be an Asian woman’s story? It could be anybody’s story!', 'Cole, you’re a bit of a trailblazer yourself. Over the last few years, there have been a couple of non-binary performers who have been recognized, but not many. Some award shows have adopted gender-neutral awards. That is not the case obviously at the Tonys, so you had to weigh in on which of the existing categories you wanted to be eligible for, and selected best actor in a play. But how did you feel about having to make that call? And is that something that you hope changes?', 'ESCOLA I do hope it changes, yeah. I didn’t love having to make that choice. There are arguments, “Well, women are given so little, and that would take more away from them,” but at the Drama Desks last year, best performer went to Sarah Paulson and Jessica Lange; no men won, and I think the same thing happened in the supporting category. So I don’t know, it’s such a weird thing, it’s almost arbitrary — “Well, a man couldn’t play this same role that a woman can play.” Well, an eighty-year-old couldn’t play Juliet — well, I shouldn’t say that. An eighty-year-old could play Juliet. But where the lines are drawn, I guess, doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Best director is gender-neutral.', 'Every other category is.', 'ESCOLA Every other category.', 'MCDONALD It makes for a shorter night. [laughs]', '', 'ESCOLA It makes for a shorter night. I don’t know. I just want to do my show and be myself, and I don’t want to push people’s buttons — well, that’s not true. [laughs] I do want to push people’s buttons, but not those buttons.', 'Another topic of conversation in the community is the role that technology is playing. Sarah and Nicole have camera rigs on stage with large screens that give us a look into things that people never would’ve been able to see on Broadway until a few years ago. Louis, some of the effects in your show are unbelievable, and probably wouldn’t have been possible pre-Harry Potter and The Cursed Child, the effects of which were handled by some of the same people who worked on your show and are getting a special Tony for them. In the case of the three of your shows, the technology helps to connect the stories to the world of today, especially for younger audiences, wouldn’t you say?', 'SNOOK Yeah, absolutely. Technology is always going to advance — we invent things and we find ways to incorporate them into our lives. And we’ve always had theater — it’s an ancient art form. So inevitably you’re going to incorporate technological advancements into theater in some ways. And as long as it has a dramaturgical purpose and an active influence on the audience, I think there’s a place for it. This show wouldn’t be possible without the camerawork that the camerapeople do, and also the video they record, edits that we’ve created beforehand. And it’s amazing to work inside of that.', 'Nicole, how did you acclimate to acting while there are people with cameras running around you?', '', 'SCHERZINGER I guess I’m kind of used to cameras with singing, but I didn’t have a choice. It makes sense, obviously, because Norma is a film star, that he incorporated that. And we don’t have a set or props or anything, so we’re able to tell that story on stage and then to be a little bit more intimate when the camera is involved. But yeah, as pop star, this [points to the left side of her face] is my good side. I’m sitting on my bad side [points to the right side of her face] today. [laughs] So I’ve had to throw all that down the drain. He [director Jamie Lloyd] has taken me out of my comfort zone, but it’s what’s got me here today. It’s supposed to emanate from within, anyway.', 'We’ve established that unbelievable physicality is demanded of each of you in these roles. Audra, you’ve said that you’ve never played a more exhausting part. Darren, I don’t know how you don’t need a chiropractor walking around with you all day.', 'SCHERZINGER I have several good ones.', 'CRISS I’ve got to ask Nicole.', 'What do you do for yourself physically between performances?', 'CRISS I’m really militant about contrast therapy. It’s this ancient Norwegian stuff. It’s being in a hot bath and a cold plunge. I’ll do a sauna and a steam. I do this two, three times a week for about a half hour.', 'MCDONALD Do you have a sauna in your dressing room?!', 'SCHERZINGER And a cold plunge?!', 'CRISS I do not. I wish I did. I’ll go to a place that has a sauna. I’ll do a steam room for 15 minutes, a cold plunge for three minutes, and a sauna for 15. I’ll do it in-between shows. It’s a meditative thing. It’s good for my respiratory system, circulatory system and immune system, and that is how I keep my battery charged. It’s a reset. It’s my time to just relax. I feel I’m on a beach. I close my eyes and just drown out the world.', 'MCDONALD I would never come for the second show. [laughs]', 'CRISS Well, it’s that cold plunge at the very end, sitting in 45-degree water for three minutes. After that I’m like, “All right, let’s go, we’ve got another one!”', 'SNOOK I just sleep. I think it’s so important. I mean, for me, I need eight hours.', '', 'ESCOLA Between shows? [laughs]', 'SNOOK You’ve got to have the deep-sleep recovery because it heals your body.', 'SCHERZINGER That’s how I feel too. I have to tell myself, “It’s a new day, it’s a new performance.”', 'ESCOLA It’s reminding me of that Ethel Merman quote: “Warm up? That’s what the opening number’s for!” [laughs] I can’t rest between shows because then I wouldn’t get up.', 'MCDONALD I can’t either. Other shows I’ve been able to, but I can’t sleep in between this one.

Deciding how to vote for the Tony Awards will be harder than it has been in a long time: Even more than usual, this year's ballot requires Tony voters to make wrenching decisions among candidates who are manifestly deserving. That, in turn, makes it hard for Tony pundits to predict all the winners with confidence. Still, even so, nonetheless: We have studied the 2025 Tony nominations, kept an ear cocked for buzz and talked to a multitude of voters, and now we are ready to make our final calls. Remember: These are our predictions, not our choices, and we are fully prepared—in some cases, even hopeful!—for the possibility that we may be guessing wrong. Here’s who we think will win when Cynthia Erivo host Broadway’s biggest night on June 8, 2025."", 'RECOMMENDED: A full guide to the 2025 Tony Awards and in-depth interviews with select Tony nominees ', 'BEST MUSICAL', 'Buena Vista Social Club\nDead Outlaw\nDeath Becomes Her\nMaybe Happy Ending\nOperation Mincemeat', ""The race: The field of contenders for the Tony Awards' marquee prize was notably deep this year: 14 new musicals, most of them good. Several shows that might have been shoo-ins for nominations in other years, such as Real Women Have Curves, didn't end up making the cut. Of the five that did, three are intimately scaled—which is not necessarily a handicap in this category, which has trended in recent years toward smaller, artier musicals. Support this season appears to have consolidated behind the lovely and original android romance Maybe Happy Ending; while a happy ending for the production is not guaranteed, its odds put it closer to will be than maybe."", 'BEST PLAY', 'English by Sanaz Toossi\nThe Hills of California by Jez Butterworth\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain by Kimberly Belflower\nOh, Mary! by Cole Escola \nPurpose by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins', ""The race: Another embarassment of riches: Two of the nominees, Purpose and English, have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Of those two, the still-running Purpose has an edge. But the suprise hit of the year is Cole Escola's riotously funny Oh, Mary!, which has fancy credentials of its own—it was a runner-up to Purpose for the Pulitzer—and has generated huge buzz beyond the usual theater circles. Nothing like it has ever won Best Play, which tends to reward more serious fare; but on the other hand, the Best Play winner is strongly correlated to the winner of Best Director of a Play—they've gone together 17 out of 24 times in this century—and Purpose isn't nominated for the latter. (Only once in the 21st century has a new play whose director wasn't nominated beaten one whose director was; the winning play was 2002's The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?, Edward Albee's first new Broadway work since 1975 to run for more than two weeks.) We predict that the sheer joy of Escola's show will carry the day."", 'BEST REVIVAL OF A MUSICAL', 'Floyd Collins\nGypsy\nPirates! The Penzance Musical\nSunset Blvd.  ', ""The race: Recent momentum for Audra McDonald (see below) has helped Gypsy's chances, but this parade is still scheduled for Sunset Blvd. Gypsy is the better musical, but Jamie Lloyd's production of Sunset is the bolder reinvention. And the absence of Gypsy director George C. Wolfe from this category is a powerful indicator, too, albeit with an asterisk: In the years since awards for revivals were introduced in 1977, only one musical revival whose eligible director wasn't nominated has ever beaten one whose director was—but that one winning revival was Gypsy! Then again, that was in 1990, and neither of the show's two revivals since then wound up taking the prize. Sunset has the upper hand."", 'BEST REVIVAL OF A PLAY', 'Eureka Day\nOur Town\nRomeo + Juliet\nYellow Face', ""The race: The neck-and-neck race between David Henry Hwang's Yellow Face and Jonathan Spector's Eureka Day makes this one nearly impossible to call. Eureka Day has the advantages of being both newer (it premiered in 2018, so it feels more like an original play than a revival) and more recent, having closed in February versus Yellow Face's November. But Yellow Face was recorded for PBS and broadcast in May, which evens that field somewhat. It's a true coin toss of a category, but we predict that Yellow Face will win the day—or even that the race will yield a rare Tony tie.  "", 'BEST BOOK OF A MUSICAL', 'Buena Vista Social Club by Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw by Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her by Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending by Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat by David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', ""The race: For musicals, though not for plays, the Tonys draw a distinction between the sum of a production's parts (Best Musical) and its writing, both nonmusical (Best Book) and musical (Best Score). Not infrequently, especially when the big winner is large production, one or both writing awards will go elsewhere, as they did last year to Shaina Taub's Suffs. This year, though, we suspect that voters won't see as much need for distinction. Will Aronson and Hue Park's storytelling in Maybe Happy Ending is the most charming and emotionally resonant of the nominees; and while Dead Outlaw and Operation Mincemeat adopt less conventional narrative strategies, they are both inspired by historical events, which helps the entirely original Maybe Happy Ending stand out."", 'BEST SCORE ', 'Dead Outlaw by David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her by Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending by Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat by David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves by Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', ""The race: If Dead Outlaw picks up an award, it is most likely to be for David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna's smart and eclectic score, which not only suits the show perfectly but is also highly enjoyable as a cast recording. But the show—which tracks a corpse through decades of American history—is probably a skosh too weird for Tony voters. We think Maybe Happy Ending will add this award to its haul. "", 'BEST ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL ', ""Megan Hilty, Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald, Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers, Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger, Sunset Blvd.\nJennifer Simard, Death Becomes Her\n\nThe race: This has been the race to watch all year: a gladiator match of champions. This season was so flush with Best Actress contenders that Sutton Foster and Idina Menzel didn't even get nominated; neither did Maybe Happy Ending's adorable Helen J Shen. Since the fall, the assumption has been that the race would come down to a diva showdown between Audra's Mama Rose and Scherzinger's Norma Desmond, with the latter at a slight advantage because a) everyone agrees that Audra is acting the hell out of her part but not everyone thinks her voice always works for the part, and b) she has six Tonys already. But then came Jasmine Amy Rogers in Boop!, delivering the kind of starmaking performance that voters love to reward. (That doesn't leave much room for the wonderful co-stars of Death Becomes Her, who in a different year would be leading the pack.) As recently as two weeks ago, we would have predicted a Scherzinger win, with Rogers as a dark horse. But the fallout from LuPonedemonium, which reminded people not to take Audra for granted, has shifted the balance; to a lesser extent, so has sympathy over Boop!'s exclusion from the Tonys. What that means is that the night's most exciting race is back to being anyone's guess—and our guess, since we have to make one, is that Audra will need to find a bit more room on her mantel.

Both are very well-liked, and both are giving first-rate performances. If Groff hadn't won last year for Merrily We Roll Along, he would probably be the favorite for his splashier turn as Bobby Darin in Just in Time. But he did win last year, and back-to-back acting victories in the same category are extremely rare: Only Gwen Verdon (1958 and 1959) and Judith Light (2012 and 2013) have pulled it off.

Many people feel that Real Women Have Curves got a raw deal from the nominators, and this category is where voters have a chance to show it a little love by voting for Justina Machado, the comic dynamo who is the show's big, beating heart. "", 'BEST FEATURED ACTOR IN A MUSICAL', 'Brooks Ashmanskas, Smash\nJeb Brown, Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein, Gypsy\nJak Malone, Operation Mincemeat\nTaylor Trensch, Floyd Collins', ""The race: Jak Malone has the takeaway number in Operation Mincemeat—an oasis of sincerity in that show's hectic whirlwind—so he remains the odds-on favorite. But his support is a little soft; some voters admire the performance but think the song itself does a lot of the work. That opens up a possible window for the hilarious Brooks Ashmanskas, who brings gale force to a role that plays like a culmination of his decades of character comedy, or the widely adored Danny Burstein, who everyone agrees is perfect as Gypsy's long-suffering Herbie.  "", 'BEST FEATURED ACTRESS IN A PLAY ', 'Tala Ashe, English\nJessica Hecht, Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat, English\nFina Strazza, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKara Young, Purpose', ""The race: This is another of the night's closest races, and it's Hecht and Young at the finish line. Young is spectacularly gifted; she's been nominated in this category for four straight seasons, and won it just last year. If any actor can pull off back-to-back wins, she's a good candidate, and it doesn't hurt that a win for Young would also be a win for Purpose, which might come up empty in other races. But Hecht is a pillar of New York theater whose big scene at the end of Eureka Day was unforgettable, and who has somehow never won a Tony.

Who Will Win at the 2025 Tony Awards?,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/little-gold-men-tony-predictions-2025,"['Get unlimited access to Vanity Fair, plus a free tote!', 'The 78th Tony Awards ceremony will take place on Sunday, June 8, honoring the best and brightest of the 2024-2025 Broadway season. It’s been a wild and woolly year on the Great White Way, dominated by movie-star-laden, but otherwise lackluster, productions of classics old and new (Othello, Glengarry Glen Ross), as well as buzzy musical transfers (Sunset Blvd.) and revivals (Gypsy). Money has been made, stars have been born, and a few scrappy upstarts (Oh, Mary!, Maybe Happy Ending) have managed to break through the noise.', 'So, who will receive a shiny trophy for their theatrical troubles on Sunday? On this week’s Little Gold Men podcast, cohost Richard Lawson assembles a panel of Broadway experts—Vanity Fair’s Chris Murphy, Vulture theater critic Jackson McHenry, and entertainment writer Esther Zuckerman—to break down the major categories and make some semi-confident predictions.', 'Perhaps the biggest title bout of the evening will be found—as it often is—in the lead actress in a musical category, where six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald will stare down former Pussycat Doll turned lauded stage performer Nicole Scherzinger. McDonald’s long awaited turn in Gypsy has been ballyhooed by some, pooh-poohed by others. Scherzinger has received near unanimous praise for her cracked, decidedly modern version of Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd., but her campaign could be marred by some offstage controversy involving a red hat. We’re giving the narrowest of edges to Scherzinger, but one should never count out Audra McDonald. If she wins, she will break her own record as the most Tony-awarded actor of all time.', 'Our panelists were all in agreement that the brilliant Cole Escola should win best lead actor in a play for their delightfully gonzo turn as a delightfully gonzo Mary Todd Lincoln in Oh, Mary! But it’s possible that Escola—a Brooklyn alt-comedy legend finally enjoying mainstream success—could lose out to a big name like George Clooney, whose Good Night, and Good Luck was respectfully received when it opened this spring. (The same cannot be said for Clooney’s dye job.) The Tonys have long found it difficult to resist giving big celebrities awards—though that tide has turned some of late, a fact perhaps best evidenced this year by the absence of Othello star Denzel Washington on the nominees list.', 'Another young upstart is challenging some high-profile names in the lead actor in a musical category. Tom Francis, the 20-something British hunk who commandingly leads Sunset Blvd., is squaring off against Emmy winner Darren Criss (who plays a lovelorn robot in Maybe Happy Ending) and Broadway royalty Jonathan Groff (who plays Bobby Darin in Just In Time). We suspect one of the flashier names will prevail over Francis—Groff could quite possibly repeat his win from last year—though we think Escola will beat Mr. Clooney. Oh, Mary! is one of the sensations of the season, embodying the kind of downtown-to-Midtown Cinderella narrative the Tony voters love.', 'You can hear the case for those predictions and more on this week’s episode, along with some commentary on the merit (or lack thereof) of the Stranger Things play, a debate about new musical Dead Outlaw, and some passion picks for who should win in the featured actor categories. Happy Tonys season to those who celebrate! Which is to say, happy Pride.', 'An Exclusive First Look at Wicked: For Good', 'The Dizzying Rise of MAHA Warrior Calley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man', 'The Unsinkable Kathy Bates', 'From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide to the Kennedy Family', 'All the Cast Members That Might Leave SNL This Fall', 'Rick Steves on Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad', 'Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

Predicting the Tony Awards – and trying to fill out a ballot,https://www.amny.com/entertainment/broadway/predicting-tony-awards-2025/,"['Tackle the city, with our help.', '', '', '', 'Predicting the winners of the Tony Awards, which will be held on Sunday night, June 8, and broadcast on CBS and Paramount+, is especially challenging this year for the best of all possible reasons.', 'It was a strong season for Broadway both artistically and commercially, and the best one overall since Broadway reopened following the devastating pandemic shutdown.', 'The theater industry still faces considerable challenges, including the escalating costs of producing a show (which, in turn, leads to higher ticket prices), the difficulty of presenting new work (rather than limited-run revivals with stars), unpredictable levels of tourism, an oversaturated media environment, pedestrian safety in Times Square, the effect of congestion pricing, and perhaps even a neighboring casino.', 'Nevertheless, this is an encouraging moment.', 'The excellent productions from the past season (some of which got overlooked by nominators) included new musicals (“Maybe Happy Ending,” “Dead Outlaw”); musical revivals (“Gypsy,” “Sunset Boulevard,” “Floyd Collins,” “Once Upon a Mattress,” “Pirates! The Penzance Musical”); new plays (“The Hills of California,” “John Proctor is the Villain,” “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” “Oh, Mary!,” “English,” “Good Night, and Good Luck”); and play revivals (“Eureka Day,” “Yellow Face,” “Our Town”) – and that’s on top of celebrated shows such as “Purpose,” “Operation Mincemeat,” “Just in Time,” and “Buena Vista Social Club.”', 'Numerous acclaimed performers received nominations, including Nicole Scherzinger and Tom Francis (“Sunset Boulevard”), Audra McDonald and Danny Burstein (“Gypsy”), Darren Criss (“Maybe Happy Ending”), Andrew Durand and Julia Knitel (“Dead Outlaw”), Jonathan Groff (“Just in Time”), Cole Escola and Conrad Ricamora (“Oh, Mary!”), Jak Malone (“Operation Mincemeat”), Laura Donnelly (“The Hills of California”), Sarah Snook (“The Picture of Dorian Gray”), Sadie Sink and Gabriel Ebert (“John Proctor is the Villain”), Daniel Dae Kim and Francis Jue (“Yellow Face”), Jessica Hecht (“Eureka Day”), and Marjan Neshat and Tala Ashe (“English”).', 'I suspect that “Sunset Boulevard” will win Best Musical Revival over “Gypsy” given that it is a sold-out smash and Jamie Lloyd’s thrilling, media-saturated production is superior to the original 1994 production, while “Gypsy” has already received multiple acclaimed revivals.', 'Best Musical is a tough contest this year. Traditional thinking suggests that the musical comedy “Death Becomes Her” will win because it is a traditional musical comedy that has done reasonably well at the box office and is expected to tour, while the four other shows (each of which has its admirers) could divide up the other voters. If any other show can win, it is “Maybe Happy Ending,” an intimate, beautiful, original work with international roots that has slowly become a surprise hit through positive word of mouth and will also tour (which is important to “road voters” who represent theaters across the country).', 'Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ Pulitzer Prize-winning family drama “Purpose” has its admirers, and Kimberly Belflower’s “John Proctor is the Villain” is a smart, youthful, and timely work, but the winner will likely be Cole Escola’s anarchic camp comedy “Oh, Mary!,” which has become an unlikely phenomenon.  ', 'The most interesting category is Best Leading Actress in a Musical.', 'How can one rationally decide whether Nicole Scherzinger should win a Tony Award for her spooky, sexy, singular turn as Norma Desmond in “Sunset Boulevard” over Audra McDonald for her all-out, fearless performance as Rose in “Gypsy”? I would put my money on Scherzinger, if only because this is Scherzinger’s Broadway debut and breakout moment, while McDonald already has six Tony Awards.', 'Then again, Scherzinger has received pushback for some of her social media posts, while McDonald is a beloved figure who is now the first African-American female to play Rose on Broadway, and who was just subjected to offensive comments by a certain outspoken diva.', 'Below is a complete list of my predictions and who I plan to vote for:', 'Best Play: I predict and plan to vote for “Oh, Mary!”', 'Best Musical: I predict “Maybe Happy Ending” but plan to vote for “Dead Outlaw.”', 'Best Revival of a Play: I predict “Eureka Day” but plan to vote for “Yellow Face.”', 'Best Revival of a Musical: I predict and plan to vote for “Sunset Boulevard.”', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play: I predict and plan to vote for Cole Escola (“Oh, Mary!”).', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play: I predict Sarah Snook (“The Picture of Dorian Gray”) but plan to vote for Laura Donnelly (“The Hills of California”).', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical: I predict and plan to vote for Tom Francis (“Sunset Boulevard”).', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical: I predict Nicole Scherzinger (“Sunset Boulevard”) but plan to vote for Audra McDonald (“Gypsy”).', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play: I predict Conrad Ricamora (“Oh, Mary!”) but plan to vote for Francis Jue (“Yellow Face”).', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play: I predict and plan to vote for Jessica Hecht (“Eureka Day”).', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical: I predict Jak Malone (“Operation Mincemeat”) but I am still undecided over who to vote for among the five terrific nominees.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical: I predict Natalie Venetia Belcon (“Buena Vista Social Club”) but plan to vote for Julia Knitel (“Dead Outlaw”).', 'Best Direction of a Play: I predict and plan to vote for Sam Pinkleton (“Oh, Mary!”).', 'Best Direction of a Musical: I predict Jamie Lloyd (“Sunset Boulevard”) but plan to vote for David Cromer (“Dead Outlaw”).', 'Best Book of a Musical: I predict “Maybe Happy Ending” but plan to vote for “Dead Outlaw.”', 'Best Original Score: I predict “Maybe Happy Ending” but plan to vote for “Dead Outlaw.”', 'Best Scenic Design of a Play: I predict “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” but plan to vote for “Good Night, and Good Luck.”', 'Best Scenic Design of a Musical: I predict and plan to vote for “Maybe Happy Ending.”', 'Best Costume Design of a Play: I predict and plan to vote for “Oh, Mary!”', 'Best Costume Design of a Musical: I predict “Death Becomes Her” but plan to vote for “Boop!

Tony Awards 2025: Gazing Beyond the Stars,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/tony-awards-2025-gazing-beyond-the-stars-101748942740211.html,"['', '', '', 'With these productions and the star-bedecked revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross” leading the way, the season as a whole became the most financially robust ever, with grosses totaling almost $1.9 billion. A primary reason for that powerhouse number was, unsurprisingly, the prices being charged for tickets, up to $800 or $900 a seat for “Othello” and “Good Night, and Good Luck.” These eye-watering figures proved that, increasingly, Broadway has become a marketplace catering to the elite. The Metropolitan Opera, where there are even good seats for under $100, seems a populist playground by comparison.', 'But if it’s easy to hand-wring over the seeming celebrity money-grab, it’s also pointless. Broadway producers are not philanthropists (although given that most shows never recoup their investments, which can be used as tax write-offs, they come close), and if people are willing to shell out more than a mortgage payment to be sprinkled in stardust, that’s their choice. Savvy theatergoers know there are many mechanisms in place to buy cheaper tickets even to the scalding-hot shows.', 'The more heartening story of the season was the wealth and variety of productions on offer. Broadway is often derided as a marketplace where innovation is rare and formulas reign supreme: Proven brands—a movie, a pop catalog—are repurposed for the stage. But as this year’s sometimes startlingly strange breadth of offerings proved, that’s increasingly not the whole story.', 'Consider this peculiar bit of trivia: Two shows in contention for the best musical Tony featured corpses in leading roles. In the appealingly loopy “Dead Outlaw,” Andrew Durand, a worthy nominee, spent roughly half the show encased in an open coffin, his character—a hapless criminal—having been killed midway through the musical. And while the dead guy isn’t really a notable presence in “Operation Mincemeat,” this jolly British import revolved around the bizarre but true tale of a World War II espionage plot in which a corpse bearing false documents was dumped overboard near Spain to divert attention from an Allied maneuver. If you include the glossy “Death Becomes Her,” in which the principal female characters essentially die midway through, having secured an eternal afterlife, that makes three Tony-nominated musicals with the queasy subject of mortality at center stage.', 'The musical that’s all but guaranteed to take home the top prize, with good reason, also had a novel plot. The bewitching “Maybe Happy Ending” depicts a romance between robots who have been put out to pasture to wait for their batteries to die. Directed with ingenuity by Michael Arden (who should win his second Tony in three years, after the revival of “Parade”), the show is a moving exploration of the difficulty—and necessity—of committing to love. (The most egregious Tony omission is the lack of a best actress nomination for Helen J Shen, although that category is the most hotly contested, with Audra McDonald potentially winning a seventh Tony for “Gypsy,” facing stiff competition from the luminous Nicole Scherzinger in “Sunset Blvd.,” and the highly praised Jasmine Amy Rogers of “Boop!” possibly playing the spoiler.)', 'The best-play nominees also illustrate how Broadway has become increasingly open to fresh voices and unlikely subjects. Exhibit triple-A would be “Oh, Mary!” Written by and starring Cole Escola, whose fierce and funny performance as a deranged (and decidedly ahistorical) Mary Todd Lincoln will surely win a Tony, this exuberantly vulgar romp became the season’s most unlikely smash, and has a strong chance of taking home the play prize, which would make the playwright and performer the owner of very fancy bookends.', 'The other nominees also cover a wide range of subjects. Most conventional is Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s powerful if prolix Pulitzer Prize winner “Purpose,” in the time-hallowed American tradition of fractious-family plays, and probably the chief competitor to “Oh, Mary!” But the other three works nominated would also be worthy winners: Sanaz Toossi’s Pulitzer-winning “English,” about a class of adults learning the titular language in Iran; Kimberly Belflower’s “John Proctor Is the Villain,” a sharp, funny dive into the troubled, inquisitive minds of high-school students critiquing Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible”; and Jez Butterworth’s mournful “The Hills of California.” (Further encouraging evidence that the Tonys aren’t just rubber-stamping branded vehicles: the omission of the dreary stage spinoff of “Stranger Things” from the category.)', 'Taking in the entirety of the nominees in all categories, I was struck by how few, if any, I could possibly quibble with. (A critic without quibbles? Show me a unicorn.) Given the superb work presented on Broadway this season, that sugary cliché—it’s an honor just to be nominated!—rings true.

Unlikely.', ""But let's give it go."", '""English,"" Sanaz Toossi', '""The Hills of California,"" Jez Butterworth', '""John Proctor is the Villain,"" Kimberly Belflower', '""Oh, Mary!,"" Cole Escola', '""Purpose,"" Branden Jacobs-Jenkins', 'Ilana Keller: So many good choices. Jacobs-Jenkins\' ""Purpose,"" about the twisted dynamics of an upper middle class Black family, just won the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. ""Oh, Mary!"" a raucous retelling of Mary Todd Lincoln\'s life, was a finalist this year. ""English"" and ""John Proctor is the Villain"" tackle issues that could not be more in the forefront of today\'s society, while ""The Hills of California"" is another family saga that examines complicated relationships — and it was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Play before transferring to Broadway from the West End. Like this year\'s Pulitzers (I can compare myself to the Pulitzers, right?), I have to give the nod to ""Purpose,"" but I would not be super upset with any of the choices here.', 'Bill Canacci: I think this comes down to ""English,"" ""John Proctor"" and ""Purpose."" I\'m taking ""English,"" winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Taking place in a a classroom in Iran, adult students prepare for the TOEFL: Test of English as a Foreign Language. While learning the language will certainly open doors, the students find themselves thinking about their native language and culture. While the audience is thinking about what they say, it is also reflecting on our culture, our country and the state of the world. So, Ilana, two Pulitzer Prize winners take each other on.

We've been quite lucky with the caliber of creation these last few seasons."", '""Buena Vista Social Club""', '""Dead Outlaw""', '""Death Becomes Her""', '""Maybe Happy Ending""', '""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical""', 'BC: So the last two years, Ilana, have not been great for me in this category. Both ""Some Like it Hot"" and ""Illinoise"" lost to shows that I think were not nearly as good. And I fear that\'s going to happen again. While I liked ""Maybe Happy Ending,"" I did not love it as much as ""Buena Vista Social Club,"" which like the robots, has been nominated for 10 Tonys. It\'s been criticized for a weak book, but I would disagree. And the music, the choreography, the band, are first-rate. There\'s not much to be said about the other shows. ""Dead Outlaw"" received a lot of buzz off-Broadway last year, but I was unimpressed. ""Operation Mincemeat"" takes awhile to get going, but is a fun night at the theater. I\'ll let you tell me why you think ""Death Becomes Her"" belongs in this category.', 'IK: You often seem unimpressed with a lot of my work, and I happen to think it\'s usually very good, soooo ... Anyway, I agree that ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is really something special. The way the show\'s elements melded together onstage formed something rare, a seamless blend of all-consuming storytelling. ""Maybe Happy Ending"" managed to perfect the art of small, wowing with feeling rather than spectacle — although when it does bring in the spectacle, it\'s pretty special. ""Dead Outlaw"" is unlike anything else out there — and its strangest element just may be the truth to its story. ""Operation: Mincemeat"" is another West End gem that Broadway audiences are lucky enough to share in. And ""Death Becomes Her""? Why do I need to explain that joy, laughter and stagecraft are good things? And it was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, too! That said, I give this one to ""Maybe Happy Ending.""', '""Eureka Day""', '""Romeo + Juliet""', '""Thornton Wilder\'s Our Town""', '""Yellow Face""', 'IK: Fun fact: Both ""Eureka Day"" and ""Yellow Face"" are nominated in the Best Revival category, despite never having appeared on Broadway previously. That is thanks to the so-called ""classics"" rule, which means that a show is considered part of the theater canon (in the historical or popular repertoire) even though it has not been on Broadway before. ""Yellow Face,"" which examines cultural appropriation, first appeared off-Broadway in 2007, while the vaccine debate of ""Eureka Day"" played off-Broadway in 2019. Last year\'s Best Revival of a Play winner, Jacobs-Jenkins\' \'""Appropriate,"" also appeared in the category thanks to the classics rule. Now that that\'s out of the way, I\'m going to have to go with credit for re-imagining here, and give this one to the bold (and quasi-musical) ""Romeo + Juliet,"" though all entrants were more than worthy of their nominations, giving audiences something to chew on long after they left the theater.', 'BC: As much as I enjoyed ""Romeo + Juliet,"" this production of ""Our Town"" was the best I\'ve ever seen. And yes, Jim Parsons was amazing, but the rest of the cast was excellent, the staging was beautiful. It\'s one to remember.', 'IK: Do I lose my Broadway card if I reveal that (SOMEHOW?!) this was the first full production of ""Our Town"" I\'ve seen live?', ""BC: You do. I'll finish this on my own."", '""Floyd Collins""', '""Gypsy""', '""Pirates! The Penzance Musical""', '""Sunset Blvd.""', 'BC: I enjoyed each of these shows, but I think ""Gypsy"" should win. Audra McDonald is amazing as always, but the rest of the cast is very good. My No. 2 would be ""Sunset Blvd."" Is it good theater? No. But it is great entertainment and lots of fun. ""Floyd Collins"" is striking, but a friend said it best: It would be better as an opera. ""Pirates"" is a great way to forget your troubles and just have a good time.', 'IK: So shockingly, our thought process is nearly opposite here. That never happens, right? Each of these revivals is incredible in its own right, but I have to give ""Pirates"" an edge for its complete reimagining of time and place. 1880s New Orleans just works, and it\'s pretty wonderful that a 150-year-old piece can feel so new and so fun, without any major changes to its storyline or music.', 'BC: I see you are still taking part.', '""Buena Vista Social Club,"" Marco Ramirez', '""Dead Outlaw,"" Itamar Moses', '""Death Becomes Her,"" Marco Pennette', '""Maybe Happy Ending,"" Will Aronson and Hue Park', '""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical,"" David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', 'IK: ""Maybe Happy Ending"" is original and clever, and again, the amount of feeling infused into and created by robots, of all things, is pretty remarkable. That said, I wouldn\'t be surprised by some stiff (sorry!) competition from ""Dead Outlaw"" or ""Operation Mincemeat.""', 'BC: Oh, Ilana. You just can\'t resist. I\'ll give this one to ""Maybe Happy Ending,"" just because it\'s surprising how robots manage to make you think about friendship, relationships, even childhood.', '""Dead Outlaw,"" David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna', '""Death Becomes Her,"" Julia Mattison and Noel Carey', '""Maybe Happy Ending,"" Music: Will Aronson, Lyrics: Will Aronson and Hue Park', '""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical,"" Music & Lyrics: David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', '""Real Women Have Curves: The Musical,"" Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', 'BC: Ilana, can I pick ""Buena Vista Social Club"" for this?', 'IK: I mean, you COULD, but....', 'BC: Well, as much as I enjoyed ""Real Women Have Curves"" I think ""Maybe Happy Ending"" deserves it.', 'IK: I would also love to see ""Real Women Have Curves"" take this home, but I agree. Ack, we agree.', 'Laura Donnelly, ""The Hills of California""', 'Mia Farrow, ""The Roommate""', 'LaTanya Richardson Jackson, ""Purpose""', 'Sadie Sink, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Sarah Snook, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'IK: I can\'t tell you how many times I have seen people coming out of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" remarking not only on the job being done by Sarah Snook, but on the fact that she does it eight times a week. A solo show is its own kind of Everest, nevermind one where the actor is playing more than two dozen Oscar Wilde characters.', 'BC: This one is a no-brainer. Snook is incredible.', 'George Clooney, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""', 'Cole Escola, ""Oh, Mary!""', 'Jon Michael Hill, ""Purpose""', 'Daniel Dae Kim, ""Yellow Face""', 'Harry Lennix, ""Purpose""', 'Louis McCartney, ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow""', 'BC: ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" made Broadway history recently with an eight-performance gross of $4,238,813, breaking the $4,041,493 record set by ""Hamilton"" in 2018, according to Deadline. The average ticket price for ""Good Night"" was $337.59, with premium seats going for $825. And it\'s certainly worth seeing. But as good as Clooney is, I\'m giving this to Louis McCartney. He goes from an introverted teenager to a monster, shaking and convulsing and terrifying along the way. We see Henry battling the demon inside, trying to stay, well, human.', 'IK: I think we agree. Again. Let\'s not make a habit of it. But ""Stranger Things"" is like nothing else on Broadway, and helming it masterfully, with all of its technical aspects — in addition to the character arc — would be a challenge for any seasoned stage actor.

Becoming a believable robot, without turning in a stiff performance, isn\'t easy. Yes, my second stiff pun of this piece. You\'re welcome. Puns aside, Iglehart may be a bit of a wild card, but his Armstrong was something to behold. A Tony winner for ""Aladdin\'s"" Genie, his range is astronomical and it\'s always a treat when he returns to the stage.', 'BC: All good performances here. I admit I did not consider Criss. OK, I\'ve thought some more and I\'m going to take Francis. It says a lot that I remembered him as much as the diva in ""Sunset Blvd."" And he leads the opening of Act II, which is one of the best moments of the season.

This is incredibly her fourth-straight year of being nominated in this category, and she took home the Tony last year for ""Purlie Victorious."" I\'d love to see her walk away with it again, though Strazza will put up a fight.', ""BC: Young is so talented. In fact, I think she is too talented for this role.

Ilana, can I pass?', 'IK: Francis Jue made his return to Broadway in ""Yellow Face"" after nearly two decades, and he was part of the off-Broadway run of the show in the same role 17 years ago. He was able to imbue his lived experience into the role, adding an important voice to an important subject. I think that bled into his performance here, and would love to see him take home the Tony.', 'BC: I\'ll give it to Conrad Ricamora, who I thought was the best part of ""Oh, Mary!""

I have to go with Justina Machado. ""Real Woman Have Curves"" is such a delight, and in many ways, Machado plays against the flow in her character arc. It\'s certainly no easy feat. But these are all unforgettable performances, and it\'s another case of honestly seeing any of these women pull off a deserved win.', ""BC: I would be very happy for just about all of these nominees.

And if he wins, I hope he says something nice about the late Gavin Creel. The two of them starred in the sensational 2017 revival of ""Hello, Dolly!"" It would be a nice moment.', 'IK: I think Jak Malone takes this one.', 'BC: Malone changes the show after his performance of ""Dear Bill."" It\'s tender and sweet and sad and beautiful.

Tony Awards 2025: Who Will Win and Who Should Win,https://www.thewrap.com/tony-awards-2025-who-will-win-and-who-should-win/,"['Audra McDonald would walk away with a “Gypsy” win if she weren’t the Meryl Streep of Broadway, and Cole Escola will have a big night for “Oh, Mary!”', 'Let’s begin with the biggest question mark of this year’s Tony Awards: Which playwright is going to win the prize for Best Play?', 'On paper, before the 2024-25 season barely got started, it looked like it would be either Sanaz Toossi for her play “English,” which had won a 2023 Pulitzer Prize, or Jez Butterworth, who was returning to Broadway with his most recent West End hit, “The Hills of California.”', 'Now, Toossi and Butterworth look the least likely to win, and not because their respective plays have already closed. The Cinderella story of this theater season is Kimberly Belflower and her Broadway debut play, “John Proctor Is the Villain,” which panders to the liberal choir even more than Toossi’s “English.”', 'Tony voters may feel that it’s enough that Belflower, an educator from Appalachian Georgia, simply got nominated, and the contest is more between Cole Escola and the wild farce “Oh, Mary!” and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and his wild family comedy “Purpose.” Jacobs-Jenkins might be a shoo-in if not for the fact that his play “Appropriate” won last year for Best Revival of a Play. Escola might be seen to be a shoo-in if not for the fact that they are also nominated this season for Best Actor in a Play. “Purpose,” however, has the distinct advantage of being trashed by the chief theater critic at the New York Times, despite the play winning a 2025 Pulitzer Prize and being praised by most critics. The Tony voters like nothing better than giving the finger to the Old Gray Lady. My prediction is that Jacobs-Jenkins will win for Best Play and Escola for Best Actor, and both deservedly so.', 'Big winner of the night looks to be “Maybe Happy Ending,” which could easily take home the Tonys for not only Best Musical but also Best Actor in a Musical (Darren Criss), Best Director of a Musical (Michael Arden), Best Book and Best Score (Hue Park and Will Aronson). For me, this contest quality-wise is a toss-up between “Maybe Happy Ending” and the equally great but very different “Dead Outlaw” and its writers Itamar Moses, David Yazbek and Erik Penna. The edge goes to Park and Aronson since their musical also marks their Broadway debuts.', 'As a member of the New York Drama Critics’ Circle, I get to vote on the Tonys, and my vote for Best Actor in a Musical will be going to Jeremy Jordan for his phenomenal turn in “Floyd Collins.” But my vote aside, this Tony is going to Criss.', 'Twenty-five of the critics who comprise the Critics’ Circle recently voted on the best of the 2024-25 theater season. Critics in other groups don’t get to vote, so their awards to performers mean a little less than whom the Circle recently honored. The Circle gave its Best Performance award to Andrew Scott for “Vanya,” but since that one-person show is staged Off-Broadway, he’s not eligible for a Tony. Runners-up for that Circle award were Escola (“Oh, Mary!”), Sarah Snook (“The Picture of Dorian Gray”) and, surprisingly, Jasmine Amy Rogers (“Boop!”).', 'Snook looks likely to win for Best Actress in a Play, although I’ll be voting for LaTanya Richardson Jackson in “Purpose.”', 'Rogers has a less secure lock on Best Actress in a Musical. Her biggest competition is Nicole Scherzinger from “Sunset Blvd.” Surprisingly, Scherzinger didn’t get that many votes from the Critics’ Circle, and her comment endorsing Russell Brand’s pro-MAGA Instagram post last fall will put off more than a few Tony voters. Audra McDonald deserves to win for her performance in “Gypsy,” but McDonald is the Meryl Streep of the Tonys. In other words, “Her again?” If this were McDonald’s first nomination, which it is for both Rogers and Scherzinger, and not her 11th, the “Gypsy” star would win hands-down.', 'The George Wolfe-directed “Gypsy” deserves to win for Best Revival of a Musical, but the Tonys have tipped their hat here by snubbing him for Best Director of a Musical and instead nominating Jamie Lloyd for his over-the-top direction of “Sunset Blvd.”', 'Sam Pinkleton of “Oh, Mary!” deserves to win for Best Director of a Play, and he will.', 'Ditto Natalie Venetia Belcon (“Buena Vista Social Club”) for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and the thrice-Tony-nominated Jessica Hecht (“Eureka Day”) for Best Featured Actress in a Play.', 'Jonathan Spector’s “Eureka Day” deserves the Tony for Best Revival of a Play, but will get major competition from David Henry Hwang’s “Yellow Face.”', 'Taylor Trensch from “Floyd Collins” should win for Best Featured Actor in a Musical, but Jak Malone from “Operation Mincemeat” will take home this Tony, because he gets to sing the show’s only memorable song, “Dear Bill.”', 'Glenn Davis in “Purpose” gives one of the season’s most subtle performances, but being understated doesn’t bring you the Tony for Best Featured Actor in a Play. The most acting, not the best, comes from Bob Odenkirk in “Glengarry Glen Ross,” and he will win.', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXNSelUzU204MWVsWjRTVE5MVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZbFJwVHNJUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

Our (Ill-Informed) Picks to Win the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.jezebel.com/our-ill-informed-picks-to-win-the-2025-tony-awards,"['On June 8, the 78th Tony Awards will convene a who’s who of Broadway, from a certain red hat lover to the many who’ve been victimized by one Patti LuPone. Hosted by Elphaba herself, the show will return to its former home of Radio City Music Hall and feature a myriad of special performances—including one from the original cast of Hamilton. You know what this means? We’re back with our ill-informed predictions as to who will take home the gold!', 'Between revelations like Oh, Mary!, Purpose, and Just in Time, and revivals like Gypsy, Sunset Blvd., and Yellow Face, this season’s talent was dense and decorated. Personally, I’d like to see Cynthia Erivo pull a Cady Heron and give all the nominees a piece of the Tony, but alas.', '', 'Like last year, there are a couple of nominees that seem like locks, and I’ve labeled them as such. I also took the liberty of adding my personal picks, despite my ill-informed yet very critical mind, as well as the dark horse contenders. I use the “ill-informed” descriptor because I’m not a performer. In fact, I couldn’t even get a chorus role in any of my high school’s productions. So, I settled for doing makeup and talking shit about the talent backstage. That is, in essence, what I’m doing here. And remember, I don’t have the pocketbook to go to every show, but I did get to go to most of the top contenders. So, here we go!', 'The Nominees:', 'Bet on: Maybe Happy Ending. Since it opened in October 2024, it’s been lauded as “an unlikely hit,” “heart-grabbing,” and “poignant, powerful, and probably prophetic.” Who knew an AI love story would be so resonant in the year 2025?!', 'Would love to see it: Death Becomes Her. If you’ve seen the 1992 movie, the show isn’t much different, except for fewer special effects and one extra offensive fat suit (thanks to one of its stars’ advocacy). And if you haven’t, it follows a pair of frenemies who make a Faustian bargain for eternal beauty and youth, only to find that immortality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Since it opened in November 2024, the show has been lauded by critics as “dazzling,” “comedy gold,” and “to die for.” It should say enough that not only did the ensemble’s Tiny Desk performance go viral but that its two stars, the exceptional Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard, are nominated for Best Actress. While it’s not possible for both to win that category, it is in this one.', 'Dark Horse: Buena Vista Social Club. From the book to the performances to that get-up-out-of-your-seat music, it’s a deserving musical to be sure. If you get to go, you’ll probably count it as one of the most fun shows you’ve ever been to. The only flaw? Marc Platt produced it. Sorry!

The 2025 Tonys: 'Give It Everything Or Die Trying',https://www.papermag.com/broadway-tonys-2025,"['The current batch of luminaries lighting up Broadway is making sky-high ticket pricing less of an issue; these stars are worth every penny! As the Tony Awards approach, this Sunday, June 8, we caught up with a stellar assemblage of such performers, all of whom richly deserve the lens — and the applause. With no fewer than 40 shows filling Broadway theaters right now, this is their stage door moment, and we’re there for a high five. And naturally, we dolled them up in designer drollery that we could all agree on and got photographic evidence that we were in the room with them. Kindly make some noise for...', '', '', 'Clothing: Vintage via Ebreo Vintage, Jewelry: Alexis', 'When producer Jeffrey Richards and director Michael Arden separately came to him with a robot musical called Maybe Happy Ending, Darren Criss knew it had to be something special. And he became enamored of it, seizing the chance to eventually step into a fully ready production and be part of the magic. In the one-act, lovely Korean musical — where fireflies represent life’s fleeting beauty — Criss and Helen J. Shen play Oliver and Claire, two helperbots in Korea who develop a poignant personal connection. Actor/singer Criss became widely known as openly gay alumnus Blaine Anderson on Glee and won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for playing Gianni Versace’s killer, Andrew Cunanan, on American Horror Story. Now he’s nabbed his first Tony nomination for his robot portrayal and he’s over the moon about the dazzlingly designed show’s across-the-boards success.', '“It’s the most accessible show I’ve ever been in,” gushes the affable Criss. “I’ve never been in a show that people come back for this many times. People want to bring people they love. It’s a show for people who know everything about theater. It’s a show for people who know nothing about theater. No matter who you are, this show should speak to you — and if not, maybe you’re a robot,” he says, laughing.', 'One of his favorite elements of MHE is the breakout performance of costar Shen, who, like him, is a graduate of the University of Michigan. “It’s a privilege to be present — to get a seat in the house — for a stunning debut for the books,” he says.', 'Criss will also be present on Sunday night, when he and Renée Elise Goldsberry host The Tony Awards: Act One, a live pre-show on Pluto TV from 6:40 to 8:00 PM. And then come the Tonys! And if that’s not enough on his plate, he and his wife — producer/entrepreneur Mia Swier — happen to have two adorable children, aged one and three.', 'As an actor, Criss wants to keep surprising the masses. “I enjoy confusing people,” he admits. “I hear stuff like, ‘Oh, you’re an actor?’ and ‘I didn’t realize you did music!’”', 'Coat and skirt: Marina Moscone, Shoes: Herbert Levine, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Coat and skirt: Shushu/tong, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', '“It’s been such a whirlwind,” says Helen J. Shen, who’s making her Broadway debut in the 10-times-Tony-nominated Maybe Happy Ending, after making her mark off-Broadway (Teeth) and elsewhere. “Broadway has always been a dream of mine, but it’s not something I could have manifested and predicted,” she enthuses. “The fact that it happened this quickly and on this scale is beyond my wildest dreams. Every day, I’m having another ‘pinch-me’ moment.”', 'New Jersey–born, via parents from Shanghai, Shen is a 25-year-old talent who went from playing classical piano in European competitions to starring in musical theater in America. She’s superb as the tender robot, and soars on “How To Be Not Alone,” where she starts entertaining the complex but worthwhile process of letting another being into your personal sphere. “I love that song,” she relates. “The writer pointed out that it’s not a romantic love song, so it’s not the time to be saccharine.”', 'Re: her fellow bot, Darren Criss: “He’s such a student. He’s always learning and trying to better himself. I love his youthful energy and willingness to be new at something. It’s his first cast album and first time originating a role. At times, he’s a mentor, and other times we share the newness.”', 'As Shen’s own newness starts to shed, what’s in her future? “What happens when your dream comes true so soon?” she wonders out loud. “Now what?” It will be rewarding to observe.', '(On Darren) Clothing: Vintage, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar (On Helen) Coat and skirt: Marina Moscone, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Dress and shoes: Michael Kors Collection, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Dress and shoes: Michael Kors Collection, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', '“I was uncomfortable,” Joy Woods admits, about her insecurity when she started playing the awkward Louise, who eventually becomes Gypsy Rose Lee, in the hit revival of Gypsy. “I hadn’t nailed the character and I didn’t have the confidence to know I was doing it justice. And I was with vets [Tony winners Audra McDonald as her domineering Mama Rose and Danny Burstein as fascinated manager Herbie] onstage.”', 'Perhaps adding to the performance pressure is that this is a landmark production spotlighting Black characters — and as Woods explains it, Josephine Baker’s aesthetics have been introduced into the proceedings (“She was the most prominent burlesque woman of color”). What the refreshingly humble Woods — a graduate of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in NYC — came to realize is that Louise simply wants to be seen and heard. She wants Mama to notice her.', 'And Woods (a Catherine Parr replacement in Six and Middle Allie in The Notebook) has arrived. “I’m getting my footing,” she contends. No kidding! She nails the stripping, the dramatics, and also the lighter moments — such as the song “Together,” with her, McDonald, and Burstein playfully camping it up. “We have so much fun,” she exults. “They’re delightful.”', 'As for getting Tony-nominated for Best Performance By an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical on her third Broadway outing? “It’s pretty surreal,” coos Woods. “I certainly didn’t expect it, especially with this extraordinary season.” Her future goals? “To learn. And grow up. Empathy is involved in what we do. Being a good actor is being a good person.”', 'Shirt: Ami, Pants: Vintage, Rings: Alexis Bittar', 'Operation Mincemeat is a hilarious British musical with a cast of five in multiple roles, telling the fascinating true story of how a repurposed corpse managed to stave off the Nazis and help us win WWII. Tony nominee Jak Malone is a standout as MI5 employee Hester Leggatt, and other characters. He says that the cast’s adrenalized, manic energy “comes from having no choice. You have to give 100% or go home. Give it everything you have or die trying.”', 'In Malone’s case, he ends up delivering “Dear Bill,” a potent ballad that stops the show (and which I won’t give away; everyone possible needs to experience this four-Tony-nominated romp in person). “I feel like I’m sitting on a secret,” he admits about the dramatic change of tone his song ultimately effects. “I’m thinking, ‘Enjoy this, everyone, because in a minute, I’m going to shatter your hearts with this tale of grief!’”', 'Malone’s own story is far more lighthearted. He grew up in Merseyside, England, loving Broadway cast albums and desperately wanting to perform on our stages. “Broadway was this beacon of joy to me,” he relates. “I thought, ‘I’d love to go there and find joy’ — and that’s what’s happened!”', 'Dress: Michael Kors Collection, Shoes: Jimmy Choo, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Best known for playing fashion blogger Haley Dunphy on Modern Family, Manhattan-born Sarah Hyland stepped into Broadway’s hit musical The Great Gatsby as shallow socialite Daisy Buchanan in February, and is loving it. As she puts it: “The story is still so relatable — so much has changed since the 1920s, but a lot has not, like the classism and misogyny. And for [creators] Kait Kerrigan, Jason Howland, and Nathan Tysen to turn it into this glitzy and glamorous musical and bring it to light and life, along with all the deceit, the betrayal, and the heartbreak, is so beautiful.” As for Daisy, Hyland acknowledges that a lot of people hate her, but she happens to be stuck in an abusive relationship and she’s also trapped in the 1920s. “She’s a survivor and she’s vulnerable,” says Hyland, “and I think her vulnerability makes her strong.” But of course, adds the actress, the only winner in this narrative is always going to be Daisy’s brutish husband Tom Buchanan, and him alone.', 'On a lighter note: Did Hyland learn ensemble acting from her time on Modern Family? “Yes! I’ve always felt I’m just an ensemble actor, and I think it’s a good thing. It means you’re not there for yourself. You’re there for everyone else.” But the best education of all, she says, laughing, “was singing show tunes in the corner with Jesse Tyler Ferguson!”', 'Blazer, trousers, shirt and cummerbund: Dunhill, Bow tie: Ralph Lauren', 'Andrew Durand lies still in a coffin for Act Two of Dead Outlaw, but don’t worry, he has plenty to do in the first half.', 'Georgia-born Durand plays Elmer McCurdy, the real-life title character who went from small-time crook to gawked-at corpse in carnival shows. And now, he’s nominated for Best Performance By an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical, and feels very much alive.', 'Durand will never be standard leading-man material, which is probably the best thing about him. He’s always shone in offbeat musicals like Head Over Heels, Shucked, and his current show, while steering clear of more commercial stuff, whether by choice or by instinct. He remembers auditioning as a replacement Christian in Moulin Rouge! The Musical and not being able to connect with the material. “I couldn’t find a specific point of view,” he admits, which wasn’t all that surprising. That tourist-driven “can-can” was better left to someone more mainstream to “do do.”', 'But playing McCurdy happens to provide the quirkiness he craves, and, even better, it’s not presented in a completely black-and-white manner. Durand likes the way glimmers of the character’s humanity are shown, where the future corpse might actually follow the path to success and decency. That he ultimately doesn’t is what provides the drama.', 'Durand’s own path started when he acted with the local Playhouse at age 10 and loved the experience — “Adults acting goofy onstage, and also letting me do stuff like paint sets and sell popcorn.” Well, the treats are a bit pricier now since Durand has started to carve out his own legend. Says he: “I’ve loved this community since I was 10. To have that reception reflected back at me feels really good. I walk through rooms of other Tony nominees and realize, ‘Oh, yes, I do belong here.’ I guess I’ve slowly and subtly worked my way up.”', ""Dress: Stylist's own, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar"", ""Dress; Stylist's own, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar"", 'One of the delights of Real Women Have Curves — about a factory of female immigrants in 1980s L.A. straining to make a 200-dress deadline — is the irresistible Justina Machado, the Chicago-born actress from Six Feet Under and many other TV/streaming credits. As Carmen Garcia,Machado has to not only stitch like a demon, she has to learn to sew up a problem involving her daughter (Ana, played by Tatianna Córdoba) needing the space to grow. “Carmen wants her to do great things,” says the ebullient Machado, “but the great things she wants her to do.”', '“Sounds like my mother,” I laughed, and she replied, “Mine too.”', '“I’m Puerto Rican from Chicago,” Tony-nominated Machado exulted with fire. “People forget that Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. It’s so disgusting what’s happening to immigrants in this country. Yes, the show is timely, but the situation has been a part of this community for a long time.”', 'Naturally, the show touches on that subject, along with some lighter themes. One highlight, the metaphorical song “Adios, Andrés,” has Machado wackily thinking she’s pregnant when in fact she’s experiencing menopause. (“Andrés, who comes every month, ain’t coming no more,” she is bluntly told by a co-worker.) Another showstopper is the title song, where all the factory women shed their outer garments and sing out with pride. Machado says they had an intimacy counselor work out the song with them in rehearsal, “so we felt safe.”', 'Interestingly, the actress played the daughter, Ana, in a nonmusical version of the same show, back in 1992. “But I don’t even remember Ana,” she exclaims. “That was 32 years ago!” That’s okay. Her Carmen is helping us through.', 'Suit: Tanner Fletcher, Brooch and rings: Alexis Bittar', 'Jennifer Simard has not only received acclaim for the year’s most purely enjoyable musical, Death Becomes Her — based on the 1992 film farce about warring ex-best-friends battling for longevity — but she’s trending on TikTok because of it. Her character’s mid-show statement — “That was rude. That was pretty fucking rude” (pronounced after she’s been shot by her rival) — has become popular on social media, and the wildest people have been adopting it. In fact, while many of us have spent our lives lip-syncing to Madonna, Madge herself posted a video of herself lip-syncing to Simard!', 'A deadpan scream as vengeful author Helen Sharp, New Hampshire–born Simard has bagged her third Tony nomination in the process. (Previous ones were for Disaster! and Company.) Accessing her ample comic gifts, Simard makes the character quirky and complicated — two words she approves of because they describe herself (“though I think I was quirkier in my youth”). In fact, more than just an actress, she’s studying psychology, readily quotes Walt Whitman (“I am large. I contain multitudes”), and has decided that “Age is a state of mind. You always have an opportunity to live your best life.” The nomination is obviously part of that, though Simard cracks, “If you ever want to see the most competitive category, look for Jennifer Simard’s name!” Aww. That’s pretty fucking rude of them, lol.', 'Was there any concern that — until plotlines resolve — DBH could be perceived as a musical about women hating each other? “[Costar] Megan Hilty and I talked about that,” says Simard, whose all-time icons are Madeline Kahn and Bernadette Peters. “But the show is a love story between two women. True hate is about indifference. They’re not indifferent to each other. They make each other alive.” Along with the help of a little potion, perhaps.', ""Tracksuit: Tanner Fletcher, Hankerchief: Stylist's own, Rings: Alexis Bittar"", 'We now know why Mary Todd Lincoln had such issues. It turns out hubby Abe Lincoln was diddling with guys the whole time, at least according to Cole Escola’s smash camp comedy, Oh, Mary! Tony-nominated Conrad Ricamora — who was Oliver Hampton in How To Get Away With Murder — is hilarious as the philandering president, with Escola a scream as the wacky wife, who has her own secret — she’s fantasizing about becoming a cabaret star.', 'Ricamora grew up in California, where his school didn’t have acting courses — just Speech and Debate. But in college he went to a drama class, “and I was hooked,” especially when a randomly assigned monologue from Lanford Wilson’s Lemon Sky tapped into his yearnings for his mom (who’d divorced dad when Conrad was a kid).', 'Ricamora says there’s plenty of evidence that, indeed, Honest Abe was gay or bi. Whenever Mary was away, Abe shared his bed with a soldier — and not for warmth, either. Ricamora credits director Sam Pinkleton for daring to cast him (part Filipino) in the role, whereas so many offers tend to be of the stereotypical King and I or Flower Drum Song persuasion.', ""He's also grateful for Escola — “the most alive and present person I’ve ever acted with. They’re never calculating their next choice or existing in their bubble.”"", 'Is it weird going up against his old Soft Power costar Francis Jue (Yellow Face) for the Tony? “I don’t have that mindset. I played competitive tennis growing up — that was different. But dramatizing Tony battles is for gay vloggers: ‘Let me tell you why she’s the best!’” He laughs, adding, “Though of course I’ll watch that!”', 'If he wins on Sunday, will he make a fiery gay activist speech? “Oh, no,” Ricamora deadpans. “I’m not gay or Asian anymore! Back in the closet!', 'Pants: Stella McCartney, Shoes: Sportmax', 'In Jamie Lloyd’s dramatic reimagination of Sunset Boulevard, aging diva Norma Desmond (Nicole Scherzinger) is pretty much batshit, whereas a younger woman — wannabe Hollywood hotshot Betty Schaefer — is more logically calculating, hoping to get her screenplays noticed, thanks to her association with pal Joe Gillis (Tom Francis). British actress Grace Hodgett Young makes her Broadway debut as Betty, and says she initially wasn’t aware of Lloyd’s avant-garde approach to the material, which ended up involving giant screens, smoke machines, and cell phones. “I had no idea what I was in for,” she says, smiling. “At the audition, he kept saying, ‘Make it smaller.’ Then I realized it was because we were going to be on camera.”', 'The result galvanized U.K. audiences, but Hodgett Young says American crowds have been even more vocal about it. “The audiences are much louder,” she says. “In the West End, they’re very British and polite.” Here, Scherzinger gets a standing ovation in the middle of every single performance. “She’s really the hardest working person I’ve ever worked with,” gushes Hodgett Young. “She is always seeking to learn.”', 'Top and jacket: Thom Browne, Shorts: Gucci, Shoes: Alaia, Socks: Free People', 'Top and jacket: Thom Browne, Shorts: Gucci, Shoes: Alaia, Socks: Free People', 'An explosive talent, Gracie Lawrence sings like Christina Aguilera crossed with Streisand, but with her own quirky style — and she features that talent in a soul pop band named Lawrence that also includes her brother, Clyde, and various friends since childhood. But she’s currently Tony-nominated for playing 1950s chart-topping belter Connie Francis in Just in Time, the Broadway musical where Jonathan Groff is Bobby Darin, the snazzy but doomed crooner Francis fell for, thanks to the slings and arrows of “Stupid Cupid.”', '“I try to capture the expressiveness of her voice,” says Lawrence. “I don’t want to do an impression because that might take away from honoring her, but I noticed a way she emotes. She holds a note, then lets it fall.” It’s the teardrop effect. And Francis was crying for a reason; she’s long been frank about having been devastated when her dad wouldn’t let her marry Darin, the absolute love of her life.', '“In that time,” says New York–born Lawrence, “she had to present as graceful, pure and sweet, while the reality she was living had a lot of struggle and darkness.” On the bright side, Francis’s old song “Pretty Little Baby” surprisingly shot to No.1 on the TikTok chart just recently. Perhaps buoyed by the Broadway show, the woman is hotter than ever.', 'Lawrence (whose father, Marc Lawrence, co-wrote Miss Congeniality) said she got the part because director/creator Alex Timbers is a fan of her band and flat out asked her to play it. She admires costar Groff because, “He does eight shows a week. He’s onstage the entire show. He’s always given a million percent to the show and to the people around him personally.” As she said this, I could have sworn I heard a teardrop in her voice.', 'Dress: Shao, Shoes: Jimmy Choo, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Dress: Shao, Shoes: Jimmy Choo, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'A phenomenon in the making, the magnetically talented Kara Young has nabbed her fourth Tony nomination in a row, for playing Aziza, a friend of the son of a dysfunctional family in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s Purpose. (She won last year for her wide-eyed Lutiebelle in Purlie Victorious.) The Harlem-born free spirit — a proxy for the audience — watches the dysfunctional goings on with a half smile and eyes popped open.', 'Young praises director Phylicia Rashad for planting ideas in her head that grew into helpful dollops of the character’s development. “I’m constantly looking for notes and direction,” she explains, “in continually trying to excavate or keep adding new ingredients to the gumbo of someone’s life.” She says the play’s themes involve reverence, legacy, and clocking the human spirit inside all of these people. One of the lines that haunts her the most is the matriarch character, Claudine (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), saying, “There was a time in this country, not too long ago, when the God-given right to family was considered a luxury for those who looked like us.” That the Jaspers still have a family, however crumbling, is a bona fide achievement.', 'But Young would like to amp up the dysfunction, apparently. She says she’d love to play the zany and macabre Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd — “I think about her pre-Sweeney and the transitioning to having a new man in the house” — though she admits that Aziza is already a dream role. “We’re different, but we’re both from Harlem and have connections. I wish I could be more like her.” Her spirit animal? “New York City! Whenever I spent time with cousins in New Jersey, it was too quiet!”', 'Dresses: Issey Miyake, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', ""Suit: Yves Saint Laurent, Gloves: Stylist's own"", 'BOOP! The Musical has cartoon flapper Betty Boop coming to life and winding up in present-day NYC, where she meets sleazy politician Raymond Demarest (Erich Bergen). That opportunistic character wants Betty as his running mate for mayor, but she scuttles that plan when she finds out that he’s terribly corrupt, boop-boop-a-doop. “Everyone walks out happy,” Bergen says, beaming, about the audience for the frothy show. “They all leave feeling goofy.”', 'Bergen hails from the Chelsea nabe in NYC, and says he can remember passing by the leather bar Rawhide when he was only three. As a kid, he was impressed by his parents’ trendiness (“They met in EST,” a 1970s self-help seminar), his Ma’s fancy art collection, and the sight of Keith Haring doodling in a subway. Bergen attended Stagedoor Manor theater camp, ultimately toured with Jersey Boys (as Four Seasons member Bob Gaudio), then landed in the 2014 Clint Eastwood–directed movie version. He found Eastwood respectful and knowledgeable, “but I had a smart person who saw an early cut and said, ‘You need to get a job, because once this comes out, you won’t be as hot as you are now.’” Bergen landed on Madam Secretary as President Téa Leoni’s personal secretary, Blake Moran, and his character’s coming out is still affecting young queers who catch it on Netflix.', 'Bergen doesn’t care if he writes, produces, or acts, as long as he’s involved. “I hate camp,” he declares. “I hate the term ‘guilty pleasure.’ I think if you love something, it matters to you.”', 'Photography: Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\n\nStyling (Erich, Darren, Grace H., Sarah, Natalie, Joy): Heidi Cannon\nStyling (Helen, Andrew, Jak, Jennifer): Alexa Levine\nStyling (Kara, Conrad, Justina): Joyce Esquenazi Mitrani\nStyling (Gracie): Jules Wettreich\nHair (Gracie): Netty Jordan\nTailoring (Gracie): Janelle Sando\nMakeup: Mollie Gloss', 'Styling assistants: Amanda Van Poznak, Christopher Contaldi, Mo Johnson\nMakeup assistants: Zane Chen, Tasia Mitropoulos\nProduction assistants: Rafael Flores, Dillon Camp', 'Special projects director: Mickey Boardman\nStory: Michael Musto\nPublisher: Brian Calle\n\nAll jewelry by Alexis Bittar']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXNSelUzU204MWVsWjRTVE5MVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZbFJwVHNJUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

Predictions: Which Actors Are Going to Win a Tony in 2025?,https://www.theatermania.com/news/predictions-which-actors-are-going-to-win-a-tony-in-2025_1780993/,"['Our critics predict the winners of the 2025 Tony Awards in acting categories.', 'David Gordon', 'Zachary Stewart', 'Pete Hempstead', 'June 3, 2025', 'The winners of the 2025 Tony Awards will be revealed in a televised ceremony on Sunday, June 8. Here’s who our critics think will win in the acting categories.', 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Musical ', 'THE NOMINEES\nBrooks Ashmanskas, SMASH\nJeb Brown, Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein, Gypsy\nJak Malone, Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical\nTaylor Trensch, Floyd Collins', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Jak Malone\nShould win: Jak Malone', 'Everyone in this category is a mensch. I’m glad to see Taylor Trench’s heartfelt performance recognized. Danny Burstein is as haimish a Herbie as you could want. Brooks Ashmanskas never met a line of dialogue he couldn’t chew up and spit out like Elaine Stritch. Jeb Brown is basically the lead of Dead Outlaw, so he shouldn’t be in this category, but he’s amazing nonetheless. It’s Jak Malone’s ability to make every stone-hearted Broadway audience member cry during “Dear Bill” that will seal the deal for him.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Brooks Ashmanskas\nShould win: Brooks Ashmanskas', 'A stalwart comedian who has been appearing on the Broadway stage since 1996, Brooks Ashmanskas is one of those faces you envision when you think of a Broadway community. He has also never won a Tony Award, but that will change this year when he wins this category for his performance as the lovably abrasive director Nigel Davies in the messy backstage musical Smash.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Jak Malone\nShould win: Jak Malone', 'I adored Brooks Ashmanskas in Smash. He lent the sparkle to what was for me an unexciting musical. Operation Mincemeat wasn’t my favorite of the year, either, but Jak Malone brought me to tears with the song “Dear Bill.” It was a performance that seemed to come out of nowhere and make the rest of the world go away, and I’ll never forget it. He deserves this one.', 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical ', 'THE NOMINEES\nNatalie Venetia Belcon, Buena Vista Social Club\nJulia Knitel, Dead Outlaw\nGracie Lawrence, Just in Time\nJustina Machado, Real Women Have Curves: The Musical\nJoy Woods, Gypsy', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Natalie Venetia Belcon\nShould win: Julia Knitel', 'Gracie Lawrence as Connie Francis in Just in Time is a real discovery—I’m excited to see what she does next. Justina Machado delivers her lines with a maternal sharpness and a veteran’s panache. There’s just something so delightfully peculiar about Julia Knitel’s performances as a variety of women in Dead Outlaw that I’d love to see her eek it out. But Natalie Venetia Belcon in Buena Vista Social Club — that is presence.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Justina Machado\nShould win: Justina Machado', 'I really loved Real Women Have Curves, an old-fashioned feel-good musical that has unfortunately received scant regard in such a crowded season. But this category offers voters the best opportunity to recognize by awarding Machado for her dynamic performance as Carmen, a Mexican-American mom whose tough love regularly crosses the line into nastiness. It created an uncomfortably relatable mother-daughter dynamic for many women in the audience.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Julia Knitel\nShould win: Justina Machado', 'Like Zach, I really enjoyed Real Women and wish it had gotten more love this season. Justina Machado is a revelation in that musical and I would love to see her recognized. I give an edge to Julia Knitel, however, for bringing an ease to her offbeat roles in Dead Outlaw that made a really odd musical seem, well, a little less odd.', 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical ', 'THE NOMINEES\nDarren Criss, Maybe Happy Ending\nAndrew Durand, Dead Outlaw\nTom Francis, Sunset Blvd.\nJonathan Groff, Just in Time\nJames Monroe Iglehart, A Wonderful World\nJeremy Jordan, Floyd Collins', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Jonathan Groff\nShould win: Andrew Durand', 'Andrew Durand amazes me every time I see his performance in Dead Outlaw. He just stands there in a coffin for like 45 minutes and doesn’t even blink. How does he do it? That’s the magic of theater. There’s something equally magical about Jonathan Groff’s showmanship in Just in Time. You hang on his every word, and that’s why he’s going to take it for the second year in a row.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Darren Criss\nShould win: Jeremy Jordan', 'Jordan has built up a lot of equity as a consistently excellent performer who is not consistently recognized. He was not even nominated for The Great Gatsby last year, and that sets him up for a correction a la Whoopi Goldberg (who lost an Oscar for The Color Purple in 1986 but won five years later for a much less impressive performance in Ghost). The truth is, Jordan is giving the greatest performance of his career (so far) in Floyd Collins, but that still won’t be enough to overcome the wave of enthusiasm for Maybe Happy Ending that Darren Criss, who is giving the greatest stage performance of his career (so far), will ride to his first Tony Award.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Jeremy Jordan\nShould win: James Monroe Iglehart', 'I am really torn by this category. All are strong enough for me to be in my “Should Win.” Groff is a sweaty powerhouse in Just in Time. Durand sings furiously one minute, and stands stiff as board the next in Dead Outlaw. Criss charmed my socks off in Maybe Happy Ending. But I keep returning to Iglehart’s convincing portrayal of Louis Armstrong. He not only had the speaking voice, but the singing voice of Satchmo, and to sustain that for eight shows a week is no small feat. The show’s early closing, though, may have made him distant enough from voters’ minds so that another might step in. Jeremy Jordan, with his gorgeous performance of Adam Guettel’s difficult score, could be the one.', 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical ', 'THE NOMINEES\nMegan Hilty, Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald, Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers, Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger, Sunset Blvd.\nJennifer Simard, Death Becomes Her', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Jasmine Amy Rogers\nShould win: Audra McDonald', 'Everyone thought this was a contest between Audra McDonald and Nicole Scherzinger. Then Jasmine Amy Rogers’s big-hearted and sincere Betty Boop won the Outer Critics Circle Award (and tied with Audra for the Drama Desk; Nicole won neither), and I think the wind shifted a little bit. Audra caught a wave of good will in the last week of voting following the recent one-sided Patti LuPone dust-up, but this is going to be another year where David beats Goliath (even though my heart lies with Audra).', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Jasmine Amy Rogers\nShould win: Jasmine Amy Rogers', 'Audra is great, but this isn’t her greatest performance—at least not vocally. It certainly doesn’t merit a seventh Tony Award. Much like last year, the voters will use this category to boost the career of a shiny newcomer. Jasmine Amy Rogers is making the most memorable Broadway debut of the season in Boop!, and that should be commemorated with a Tony.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Jasmine Amy Rogers\nShould win: Jasmine Amy Rogers', 'After I saw Gypsy, I was certain that Audra McDonald was heading for her seventh Tony. Then I saw Nicole Scherzinger in Sunset Blvd. and knew for a fact this year’s award would go to her. Then I saw Jasmine Amy Rogers and I was completely won over. My opinion has not changed since. Rogers deserves this one, and she’ll get it.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play', 'THE NOMINEES\nGlenn Davis, Purpose\nGabriel Ebert, John Proctor Is the Villain\nFrancis Jue, Yellow Face\nBob Odenkirk, Glengarry Glen Ross\nConrad Ricamora, Oh, Mary!', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Conrad Ricamora\nShould win: Francis Jue', 'Francis Jue was so heartfelt, so raw, as a man defeated by the American dream in Yellow Face. He’s a beloved Broadway veteran, and I still think he could take it. But Conrad Ricamora’s angry, befuddled Abe Lincoln is a perfect complement to Cole Escola’s riotous Mary Todd Lincoln. They’re the double-act of the season, and that’s why Conrad is going to win.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Gabriel Ebert\nShould win: Gabriel Ebert', 'I know, I know…it’s ironic that a play about women taking back the narrative is likely to receive only one Tony Award, and it will go to a man. But Ebert charms an audience of hundreds every night as cool teacher Mr. Smith, perfectly setting us up for the most shocking reveal of the night (which is not so shocking, upon reflection). It’s a master stroke, and worthy of a second Tony for Ebert.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Conrad Ricamora\nShould win: Glenn Davis', 'Bob Odenkirk is the reason to see this year’s otherwise lackluster production of Glengarry Glen Ross, and I was taken with Glenn Davis’s nuanced portrayal of a man with mental illness. But I think voters will probably lean toward the actor who played a homosexual Abe Lincoln in Oh, Mary!, Conrad Ricamora. He made the icon-shattering comedic role look easier than it was, and he’ll be rewarded for it.', 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Play ', 'THE NOMINEES\nTala Ashe, English\nJessica Hecht, Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat, English\nFina Strazza, John Proctor is the Villain\nKara Young, Purpose', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Jessica Hecht\nShould win: Jessica Hecht', 'A category where everyone did first-rate work. Jessica Hecht is the beloved veteran who’s never won of this group, and her performance did the impossible for me. In Eureka Day, she made me feel sympathy for a person whose views are the antithesis of my own. It didn’t change my mind, but it made me look at things differently. To me, that is a truly extraordinary feat.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Kara Young\nShould win: Tala Ashe', 'Closed shows face a severe disadvantage at the Tonys, and I suspect not enough voters will recall Tala Ashe’s extraordinary performance in English. Instead, they will give this award to Kara Young for the second year in a row for her thoughtful and uncomfortably relatable performance in Purpose. I recently went back and couldn’t help but notice her restless legs during that incredibly awkward dinner scene.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Jessica Hecht\nShould win: Kara Young', 'Kara Young is exceptional in every role I’ve seen her in. She is one of the stage greats of our time, and I would be overjoyed to see her win for Purpose. Jessica Hecht, however, executed her role as a closeted anti-vaxxer with such precision (and sympathy) that I left the theater looking closer at my own beliefs. Good theater and good acting does that. A Hecht win would be well deserved.', 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play ', 'THE NOMINEES\nGeorge Clooney, Good Night, and Good Luck\nCole Escola, Oh, Mary!\nJon Michael Hill, Purpose\nDaniel Dae Kim, Yellow Face\nHarry Lennix, Purpose\nLouis McCartney, Stranger Things: The First Shadow', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Cole Escola\nShould win: Cole Escola', 'I knew this would be Cole Escola’s from the moment the show announced a Broadway transfer. George Clooney is just lucky to be in Cole’s orbit.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Cole Escola\nShould win: Cole Escola', 'I have predicted Escola’s win over the Hollywood A-list in this category since last year. What I didn’t predict was that so few of the big names would actually be nominated. With Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Robert Downey Jr. out, George Clooney is Escola’s biggest competition. But voters are likely to reward the downtown cabaret star who came out of nowhere to inject so much excitement into the season with a laugh-out-loud comedy that has been playing at the Lyceum since last summer.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Cole Escola\nShould win: Cole Escola', 'I saw Oh, Mary back in August and pegged Escola for the winner then. I’ve been a fan of Jon Michael Hill for years, ever since Pass Over, and his performance in Purpose is masterful. Louis McCartney wowed me for the sheer number of calories he expends in Stranger Things. Escola’s demented Mary Todd Lincoln, though, has remained my favorite performance. This is Escola’s year.', 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play ', 'THE NOMINEES\nLaura Donnelly, The Hills of California\nMia Farrow, The Roommate\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson, Purpose\nSadie Sink, John Proctor Is the Villain\nSarah Snook, The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Sarah Snook\nShould win: Laura Donnelly', 'Sarah Snook is tireless in Dorian Gray, but she’s on screen so much that it just lost my interest. I’d love to see Laura Donnelly take it, for her two roles in The Hills of California, a relentless mother for the first half, and her mother’s traumatized adult daughter in the second. You don’t even realize it’s her—but we’re keenly aware that we’re watching Sarah Snook the whole time.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Sarah Snook\nShould win: Laura Donnelly', 'In addition to being a showcase of the cutting-edge of video technology, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a vehicle for Sarah Snook’s acting chops. She has them, and the voter will reward her for it. But if they dig back in their memories, they might recall Laura Donnelly being almost unrecognizable in two different roles in The Hills of California. It’s the superior performance, but closed shows like Hills always face an uphill battle.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Sarah Snook\nShould win: Sarah Snook', 'This is Sarah Snook’s to lose. She has given the performance of a lifetime, and she deserves to win, hands down.', 'Save on select performances', 'TheaterMania is pleased to share its coverage of the 2025 Tony Awards, including nominations, predictions, and other news.
