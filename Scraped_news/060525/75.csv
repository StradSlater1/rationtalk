The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a strong recommendation urging people to avoid flying unless they are vaccinated against measles, highlighting the rapid spread of cases both domestically and internationally.', 'The latest CDC advisory comes as global cases of measles continue to climb. Crowded areas like airports, train stations, airplanes, and public events are all potential hotspots for transmission. Denver International Airport was recently identified as one of these hotspots after officials confirmed three travelers, including a child under five, contracted measles on the same flight.', 'According to recent reports, there have been over 1,100 confirmed measles cases across 33 U.S. states, with West Texas remaining the outbreak’s epicenter.

In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the US due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only 85 cases were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.', 'The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.', 'At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.', '“Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”', 'The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.', 'Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.', '“That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.', 'But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”', 'Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.', 'Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.', 'The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.', 'Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”', 'Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.', 'Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.', 'Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”', 'This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.', 'Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.', 'Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.', 'If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.', 'Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical travel guidance such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.', 'Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.', 'Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”', 'The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.', '“In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury.

', 'While experts can’t say for sure how these flare-ups started, many U.S. measles outbreaks trace back to international travel — when a partially vaccinated or unvaccinated person journeys to a country where the disease is still common, catches the virus, and returns home to a community with low vaccination rates. ', '“Measles has been historically eliminated from the U.S.,” said infectious disease specialist Nathan Lo, MD PhD, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University. “That means that outbreaks in the U.S. (and in Texas) start with a travel-associated ‘imported case.’”', 'This travel season, health officials stress extra caution to protect yourself, your family, and your community.', 'Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world. The virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can survive on a surface for up to two hours. If you’re unvaccinated and around someone with measles, chances are very high — 90% — that you’ll catch it, too. ', 'Fever, headache, and a couple hundred itchy blisters will let you know you have it. Kids under 15 get it most often – but adults get it, too, and their symptoms can be worse. A chickenpox vaccine is the best way to prevent it. Serious cases can lead to dehydration, pneumonia, and even brain infections, so call your doctor if you think you might have the chickenpox.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Medically Reviewed by Poonam Sachdev on July 04, 2024', 'Countries with ongoing measles outbreaks include Romania, Ireland, Austria, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and many others. But even if you’re traveling to an outbreak-free area, you can still be exposed.', '“Airports and airplanes are easy places to get infected,” said Paulo H. Verardi, PhD, professor of virology and vaccinology at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.', 'There are only two ways to be fully protected against measles when you travel: through vaccination or natural immunity. ', 'Just about everyone should get two doses of a measles vaccine -- either the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) or the MMRV vaccine, which combines the MMR vaccine with the varicella (chickenpox) shot. The second shot should occur at least two weeks before travel, according to the CDC. Exceptions include children under 6 months old, who are not eligible for the vaccine. Those whose mothers are vaccinated receive some protection passed during pregnancy, but it doesn’t long — typically waning at about six months. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Measles is a contagious virus that mainly affects babies and young children. Learn about how it spreads, dangerous complications, and the vaccine.', 'Babies between 6 and 11 months should get one dose at least two weeks before they travel. Important: This early dose doesn’t count toward the standard two-shot series — the child will still need to get two more doses later (at 12 to 15 months, and again at 4 to 6 years). ', 'If you were born before 1957, then you’re considered protected through natural immunity. Prior to the vaccine, nearly everyone got measles — because, again, it’s incredibly contagious — and measles infection triggers an immune response that continues to protect you decades later.', 'Patients with weakened immune systems — like if you’ve had an organ transplant or are undergoing treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy — might not be able to receive the vaccine. If that’s you, then a conversation with your doctor belongs on your pretravel to-do list, said David M. Higgins, MD, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado and Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora. \n\nIf you or your child can’t get the measles vaccine, traveling — especially abroad and to parts of the U.S. with outbreaks — can carry serious risks. This is particularly true for children under 5, who are more vulnerable to severe complications from measles. Deciding whether to travel in this situation is deeply personal. “There are many different degrees of immunocompromised, so it’s really an individual decision,” Higgins said. Your health care provider can help you weigh the risks and explore options. ', 'If vaccination isn’t possible and you decide to travel, take extra precautions. Make sure that everyone traveling with you is fully vaccinated. Stick to commonsense hygiene practices like washing hands often, avoiding high-touch surfaces, and wearing a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces.', 'Also talk to your health care provider about what to do if there’s a chance you’ve been exposed to measles. Post-exposure treatments like immunoglobulin may be given within six days of exposure — it won’t replace the vaccine, but it could offer some protection or reduce symptoms.', 'Go ahead and get the jab. Experts say it’s perfectly safe to get a booster, even if you’ve already had two shots. You can also ask your doctor to order an antibody test to check your immunity status, but these tests aren’t always accurate and are not routinely recommended.', '“For practical purposes, it’s often easier to simply get vaccinated again rather than try to track down medical records,” Higgins said. ', 'If you think you were exposed or start having symptoms, either abroad or back home, contact a health care provider immediately. The provider might recommend a measles test and ask whether you’ve been vaccinated. ', ""Measles can have a long incubation period — it could take up to two weeks after exposure for symptoms to show up. Early signs like fever, runny nose, cough, and red, watery eyes can feel like an ordinary virus, but eventually you’ll see the telltale red bumpy rash and possibly tiny white dots with red rims in your mouth (Koplik's spots). "", '“There’s typical management of the condition but also prevention of transmission, which means that a person needs to be isolated,” said Wassim Ballan, MD, division chief of infectious disease and associate director of the infection prevention program for Phoenix Children’s in Phoenix, Arizona. Patients should isolate for as long as they are considered contagious — for four days before the rash appears and continuing until four days after it’s gone.

More measles exposures are happening at airports and tourist destinations. Here's what travelers need to know,https://www.wral.com/story/more-measles-exposures-are-happening-at-airports-and-tourist-destinations-here-s-what-travelers-need-to-know/22039081/,"['(CNN) — More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor’s offices — but also at a Shakira concert in New Jersey, at a mall in Minnesota, at a Buc-ee’s store in Texas and in airports and planes in several states.', '“Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a recently updated travel notice. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”', 'It’s a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the US due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only 85 cases were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.', 'The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.', 'At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.', '“Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”', 'Some changes to vaccine guidance', 'The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.', 'Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.', '“That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.', 'But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”', 'Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.', 'Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.', 'The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.', 'Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”', 'Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.', 'What else should travelers do?', 'Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.', 'Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”', 'This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.', 'Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.', 'Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.', 'If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.', 'Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical travel guidance such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.', 'Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.', 'Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”', 'The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.', '“In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We’ve had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”', 'The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CDC Issues Urgent Warning to Travelers,https://www.smartertravel.com/cdc-issues-urgent-warning-to-travelers/,"['', '', 'As the busy summer travel season ramps up, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an urgent advisory warning Americans about the rising risk of measles exposure during international travel.\n\nThe highly contagious virus, which spreads easily through the air, is making a global comeback. Infected travelers are bringing measles into airports and onto airplanes, raising public health concerns.\n\nThe CDC updated its Measles Global Travel Health Notice on May 27, expanding its guidance recommending that travelers be vaccinated against Measles for any international travel, not just countries with known outbreaks. ""From January 1 to May 26, 2025, CDC received 62 reports of travelers who were infectious with measles while traveling on an airplane,"" a CDC spokesperson told SmarterTravel.', 'The CDC strongly urges all travelers to verify their measles vaccination status before leaving the country. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations are highly effective, with two doses providing approximately 97% protection against infection.\n\nThe CDC’s warning reflects growing concerns about the ease with which measles can spread in shared airspace and crowded public areas. Recent incidents, including an outbreak in May that was linked to a Turkish Airlines flight to Denver, have raised alarms.\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has passed through a space. If someone with an active measles infection was sitting at your airport gate before your flight, the virus could still be present when you arrive. According to the CDC, “If one person has measles, 9 out of 10 people around that person will also become infected if they are not protected.”\n\nCommon symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a characteristic rash. However, measles can also lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. Adding to the risk, people with measles can be contagious up to four days before the rash appears, meaning they may be spreading the virus before they even realize they’re sick. The best defense against measles is vaccination, and the CDC recommends being fully vaccinated against measles at least two weeks before you depart for international travel.', 'Stay up to date with the latest news, announcements, and articles.', '', ""SmarterTravel's experts guide travelers with unbiased information on the best deals, destinations, and money-saving tips.

However, medical providers are urging travelers to exercise caution as measles cases continue to rise.', 'Amid a spike in cases nationwide and globally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an updated travel advisory last week, warning: “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.”', '“Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune,” the advisory continued. “CDC recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to any international destination.”', 'The risk is currently listed at Level 1 out of four, which means Americans are advised to “practice usual precautions,” including getting vaccinated before travel. The advisory noted that people who are not up to date on their measles shots should make an appointment at least six weeks before traveling to give themselves enough time for full vaccination.', 'Monday, June 2, officials at Barkley Regional Airport in West Paducah said they were aware of the advisory. Airport spokeswoman Kat Byars said the airport works hard to remain proactive and keep the airport clean. Byars said passengers are asked to be cautious as well.', '“We have people working around the clock to make this as inviting and safe a place as possible. Just for the everyday traveler, keep your stuff clean, and we’ll do our part. Keep our stuff clean,” Byars said.', 'Although practicing good hygiene and keeping items sanitary is important while traveling, Dr. John Cecil with Baptist Health Medical Group in Paducah said vaccination is the most effective way to avoid contracting measles.', 'He recalled treating measles cases in 1982, describing it as a “bad illness” that he does not like seeing “reappear.” Cecil attributed the rise in cases to people opting out of vaccinating their children.', '“People have got the mistrust of vaccines. The COVID vaccine…certainly sent everybody to Dr. Google and the internet, and they’ve all become experts. They hear stories. They don’t look at research studies. They read stories of other people. And you know, that is not the way to get the information. You get it from your physician,” Cecil said.', 'As of May 29, 1,088 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. this year. The CDC said 96% of those patients were unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination status.', 'Cecil said the risks posed by the illness are not to be taken lightly.', '“Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases out there,” he explained, saying it can be particularly serious for young children, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant individuals. For those who are pregnant, highlighted that the measles virus “can go into the embryo, and the baby can be either miscarried or born with some severe birth defects.”', 'Welcome!

In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the US due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only 85 cases were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.', 'The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.', 'At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.', '“Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”', 'The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.', 'Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.', '“That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.', 'But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”', 'Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.', 'Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.', 'The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.', 'Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”', 'Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.', 'Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.', 'Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”', 'This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.', 'Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.', 'Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.', 'If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.', 'Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical travel guidance such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.', 'Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.', 'Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”', 'The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.', '“In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We’ve had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”', 'The-CNN-Wire', '™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.
