After being part of the high-profile deal that sent Mikko Rantanen out of Colorado, Necas may already be eyeing the exit himself. According to multiple reports, including from NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the talented Czech forward isn‚Äôt feeling settled in Denver. ""There was a sense Necas wasn‚Äôt overly thrilled with his experience in Colorado and that he wants to explore other options,"" Friedman noted during a recent segment. His comments came on the heels of Colorado‚Äôs decision to ship Rantanen to the Hurricanes, only to flip him to Dallas in a sign-and-trade. That deal brought back Jack Drury and Necas ‚Äî but the Avalanche may not be finished dealing. Bruins already linked to Rantanen, could Necas be next? Boston had reportedly kept tabs on Rantanen before he was moved. Although they missed out on the star winger, Necas might give them a second shot at a top-line Czech forward, and this time, it could be an even better fit. Necas and Bruins star David Pastrnak already have history. They played together during the IIHF World Championship and sparked instant chemistry, feeding off each other‚Äôs speed and puck instincts. He‚Äôs played with Pastrnak/Zacha at the Worlds and is a speedy, consistent scorer. Sweeney needs to be aggressive for Bruins to return to contention With the Bruins in transition following the trades of Brad Marchand and Charlie Coyle, GM Don Sweeney is under pressure to retool the roster. Scoring depth is a concern, and Necas, at 25 years old, fits both the short- and long-term needs of a team looking to stay competitive. He‚Äôs fast, skilled and comfortable on either wing. More importantly, he doesn‚Äôt shy away from big moments, something Boston has lacked in the postseason since Patrice Bergeron‚Äôs retirement. If the Avalanche truly sense hesitation in contract talks, Sweeney should pounce. Colorado has already shown a willingness to move top-six talent to avoid drawn-out negotiations. A potential top-line trio waiting to be unlocked Necas tallied 24 goals and 53 points last season with Carolina. His time in Colorado hasn‚Äôt gained traction, not yet, but that could change in Boston. Placing him alongside Pastrnak and Pavel Zacha, two fellow Czechs he‚Äôs played with before, could form one of the league‚Äôs most cohesive lines. There‚Äôs a familiarity and rhythm between them that doesn‚Äôt need much time to develop. And in a league where speed, timing and chemistry are everything, that matters more than ever.', 'The Chicago Blackhawks have done the thing where they surround a promising No. 1 pick with short-term veteran talent to show him the ropes. Now, the Blackhawks need to find long-term solutions to aid in the development of Connor Bedard and a team that needs to start winning again. New head coach Jeff Blashill and assistant coach Anders Sorensen like what the team has with its youth. But the Blackhawks must add savvy and experienced talent to start looking competent again. Blackhawks linked to veteran LW Shayna Goldman and Murat Ates of The Athletic wrote about potential landing spots for 29-year-old left winger Nikolaj Ehlers in free agency. They named the Blackhawks as a promising suitor for the veteran. ‚ÄúChicago isn‚Äôt quite ready to (become a Stanley Cup contender) but has a lot of money to spend and a first-line, top-unit job alongside Connor Bedard on offer to this summer‚Äôs free agents,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, Ehlers is likely thinking long-term for his next contract ‚Äî term that would buy Chicago time to continue its build. ‚ÄúIf the 29-year-old Ehlers is willing to move from the Cup-contending Jets to the 31st-place Blackhawks ‚Äî and wait ‚Äî then Chicago should be able to put together a compelling package of ice time, opportunity and money. ‚ÄúFor Chicago, the signing would be a clear indication to its market that the Blackhawks are on their way back ‚Äî and motivation for fans to return the United Center to 100 percent capacity. Ehlers‚Äô speed brings fans to their feet and he‚Äôs an easy sell in the community.‚Äù Ehlers would need a big bag from the Blackhawks Ehlers has been with the Winnipeg Jets since they drafted him with the No. 9 pick in the 2014 draft. He‚Äôs appeared in 674 games, recording 225 goals and 295 assists for 520 total points. The left-handed shooter scored five goals in eight playoff games this spring. Ehlers would be a great get for general manager Kyle Davidson this offseason. But money would have to be the main driver for the Blackhawks to land him, as Chicago isn‚Äôt ready for the success Ehlers has enjoyed with the Jets recently. In 15 games as a visitor to the United Center with the Jets, Ehlers has scored four goals and recorded four assists.', 'The Braves are shaking up their bullpen after a heartbreaking loss. David O‚ÄôBrien of The Athletic reports that the club is going to select right-hander Craig Kimbrel and recall left-hander Dylan Dodd. In corresponding moves, right-hander Daysbel Hern√°ndez will land on the 15-day injured list, while righty Scott Blewett will be designated for assignment. The Kimbrel move was reported earlier Thursday. Blewett unfortunately lived up to his name, leading to a deluge of social media jokes at his expense. Atlanta was leading Thursday afternoon‚Äôs game against Arizona 9-3 through seven innings. Blewett was put into the game in the eighth and allowed one run, making it 9-4. Atlanta got that run back in the bottom of the eighth, making it 10-4. Blewett was sent back out for the ninth with a six-run lead to protect and three outs to get. He struck out the first batter he faced but the next four reached. With the score having narrowed to 10-7, Atlanta went to closer Raisel Iglesias to get the final two outs. Unfortunately, he allowed Arizona to take an 11-10 lead before getting out of the inning. Atlanta couldn‚Äôt score in the bottom of the ninth to stay alive. It was a heartbreaking loss in what has already been a rough stretch for the club. It was their fourth straight L and they are now 3-11 in their past 14 contests. Their overall record is 27-34, putting them behind all the other National League contenders in the standings. Blewett was charged with five earned runs in an inning and a third in today‚Äôs dagger. Blewett, 29, is out of options. That‚Äôs led him to bounce around the league. He started the season with the Twins on a minor league deal and was added to that club‚Äôs roster for a few days in April before getting designated for assignment. He was then claimed off waivers by the Orioles, though that club also designated him for assignment a few days later. That led him to Atlanta on a cash deal. He had a pretty decent run prior to today‚Äôs unpleasantness. Between those three clubs, he came into today with 24 innings and a 2.25 earned run average. His 22.8% strikeout rate and 8.9% walk rate were both around league average while his 58.5% ground ball rate was quite strong. The ERA climbed to 3.91 after today‚Äôs game but it‚Äôs been a solid season overall. But since he‚Äôs out of options and the club is looking to shake things up by adding Kimbrel, a 40-man roster spot was needed, so Blewett heads into DFA limbo. That can last as long as a week but the waiver process takes 48 hours, meaning Atlanta could take as long as five days to explore trade interest. Though he‚Äôs out of options, he‚Äôs still in his pre-arbitration seasons, meaning he‚Äôs cheap. As mentioned, he‚Äôs been having a good year, today‚Äôs results notwithstanding. As for Hern√°ndez, it‚Äôs unclear exactly what his injury is but he departed yesterday‚Äôs game and appeared to be in discomfort. More information should be revealed when he is officially placed on the injured list.', 'After another early playoff exit, the Toronto Maple Leafs are entering an intriguing offseason. Toronto has a few key players who are entering free agency, and the team could look very different next season because of it. The front office has plenty of decisions to make in the coming weeks, and the shape of the roster is likely to change. Star Mitch Marner is expected to bolt the organization in free agency, and if he does, it would leave a massive hole in offensive production. But the Maple Leafs could look to replace his production by trading for another All-Star talent. Lyle Richardson of Bleacher Report listed the Maple Leafs as a potential trade spot for veteran Jonathan Marchessault of the Nashville Predators. Nashville has been rumored to be looking into moving the veteran, and Toronto could make sense as a landing spot. The biggest concern about a deal between the two sides is the lack of quality draft picks and prospects that could be offered to the Predators in a deal. ""Marchessault\'s contract could be worrisome, but the Leafs are in ""win now"" mode and desperate to end their 58-year Stanley Cup drought. Given his previous playoff success and postseason MVP credentials, they could take that risk if they can get him at a reduced salary."", Richardson wrote. Marchessault saw a down first year with Nashville, and it could lead to him being available for a cheaper-than-normal price. The veteran put up 21 goals and 35 points for the Predators over 78 games played. Toronto could look to replace Marner with Marchessault, while betting that he can get back to form. Marchessault has exceeded 20 goals eight times over his 12-season NHL career, and could be a solid option for the Maple Leafs to at least consider.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHlSMlp0TlRWYVNUSjJNWHBPVFJDckF4aUFCU2dLTWdZWmM1SkxMUWM=-w280-h168-p-df
