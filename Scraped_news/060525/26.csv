The company behind USDC has managed to raise over $1,05 billion ahead of its IPO and is preparing to go live on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” ', 'Circle has now achieved a $7.2 billion valuation, demonstrating growing investor confidence in its business model and positioning itself as a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While this is excellent news for all crypto traders, those seeking the crypto to buy are focusing on Best Wallet Token. This revolutionary crypto wallet is poised to have a massive impact on digital currency management. Let’s delve into these tectonic market shifts and explore how they will transform the crypto markets forever.', 'The situation surrounding Circle’s massive IPO has investors excited about the future of the crypto market. The company already sold over 34 million shares at $31 each, signaling strong investor demand. The value of the IPO has surprised many, and after it goes live on the New York Stock Exchange, it will solidify USDC’s place as the second-largest stablecoin in the crypto market. ', 'However, that is not the most critical implication of Circle’s IPO. The real power behind the IPO lies in the growing recognition of digital currencies in the traditional financial markets. It is just one step toward broader crypto adoption, which will drive massive amounts of investments into digital currencies. ', 'Circle’s IPO is proof that stablecoins are making their way into traditional finance, and the $7.2B IPO is a clear sign that investors are confident in a business that bridges crypto and fiat. This will have a positive impact on large institutional investors, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and others, leading to a substantial influx of capital. ', 'Of course, that will likely spark more stablecoin regulations, which would put Circle ahead of other less-transparent rivals. Furthermore, the positive reaction to Circle’s IPO is likely to be followed by more initial public offerings (IPOs), including those of Kraken, Ripple, and others, which will solidify the role of digital currencies in traditional finance. ', 'This is excellent news for crypto traders worldwide and for many established cryptocurrencies, which could finally gain recognition from regular users and financial companies. The implications will likely result in long-term growth in crypto adoption, which brings us to a revolutionary crypto wallet called Best Wallet Token. It is the ideal choice for future cryptocurrency management and an innovative presale to consider.', '', 'As you may already know, there are dozens of different blockchains on the market, and each of them offers various features, cryptocurrencies, and possibilities. Many of them operate very differently from one another, so crypto traders are forced to manage multiple wallets to trade cryptocurrencies on multiple blockchains.', 'The Best Wallet Token is a crypto investment because it integrates over 60 different blockchains, enabling users to seamlessly buy, sell, and swap currencies across these blockchains. In turn, the wallet eliminates the need for multiple wallets and simplifies digital currency management, revolutionizing the way we interact with digital markets.', 'The wallet token holder will gain access to advanced features that make crypto management much more straightforward. Here are some of the features that make $BEST the exciting crypto presale. ', '', 'The project has just surpassed the massive $13 million milestone and is accelerating with every passing minute. These numbers show growing investor support, making Best Wallet Token an emerging project. $BEST tokens are available for only $0.025135, but their price will continue to increase with every subsequent presale stage.', 'Lastly, early investors can stake their $BEST tokens to earn an annual percentage yield of 108%, getting daily rewards over the next 3 years. The project will launch on DEX, followed by Tier 1 CEX listings in the future. ', 'If you’re looking for the a token presale to watch, Best Wallet Token should be on top of your investing priority list. Like Circle, it will help bring crypto adoption and management to a new level, with positive implications moving forward.

"Six things to know about the Circle crypto IPO, happening this week",https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/06/six-things-to-know-about-the-circle-crypto-ipo-happening-this-week.html,"['This week marks a major milestone for the Boston cryptocurrency scene: a crypto company founded here, Circle Internet, will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange.', 'The company was hatched in 2013 in the Harvard Square offices of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm, and it now manages a widely used “digital dollar” called USDC. Cryptocurrency users had put more than $60 billion into Circle’s USDC currency, as of last month.', 'Demand seems strong for Circle’s stock. On Monday, the company expanded the number of shares it will offer to public market investors. And the Trump administration has been signaling its support for the cryptocurrency industry, loosening regulatory oversight and dropping lawsuits against crypto companies such as Coinbase and Gemini.', 'When it starts trading, Circle could be worth more than $7 billion. The initial public offering will also be a win for General Catalyst, the Cambridge firm that was among Circle’s first investors; it still owns more than 12% of the company.', 'But what exactly does Circle do, and why did it decide to move its headquarters from downtown Boston to lower Manhattan late last year? Here are six things to understand about Circle, based on interviews with crypto experts who are not connected with the company.', 'Circle manages a kind of “digital dollar,” USDC, that is also known as a stablecoin. What’s stable about it? Ideally, it maintains a one-to-one relationship with actual U.S. dollars, so that a buck put into USDC will be worth a buck when taken out. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to hold a constant value, and they are backed by conservative assets such as U.S. Treasury-issued securities or cash held in a U.S. bank.', 'Drew Volpe, founder of Cambridge-based First Star Ventures, an investment firm, said Circle’s business is simple: “They’ve got sixty billion or so in those dollars. They put them in short-term Treasuries …and they collect the interest.” So while you get your USDC turned back into a U.S. dollar whenever you want, Circle has collected interest on it for whatever period it was held in USDC.', 'USDC is primarily used for two things: accessing U.S. dollars in places where the banking system is unreliable, and enabling fast, low-cost digital payments. As Matt Walsh, a founder of the Boston investment firm Castle Island Ventures, explains, it is used by “people who want access to U.S. dollars that otherwise would have a difficult time getting access to dollars, particularly internationally.”', 'For example, someone in a country like Argentina or Venezuela worried about currency devaluation might buy USDC through a local cryptocurrency exchange to preserve their income or savings in dollars.', 'Another important use is payments, particularly international remittances.', '“With stablecoins, you just send $1 peer to peer in a millisecond,” Walsh says. This can simplify and cut the costs of international money transfers, compared to traditional money movement systems such ACH or SWIFT.', 'Although Circle was founded in Cambridge, and multiple sources say CEO Jeremy Allaire still resides in the area, the company announced that it would move its headquarters from Boston’s Financial District to Manhattan in early 2025.', 'Circle leased the entire 87th floor at One World Trade Center, a skyscraper built next to the site of the twin towers. In a press release issued last September, Allaire said the company was “privileged to join New York’s thriving community of innovators, technologists and financial leaders.” However, the company, with nearly 1,000 employees, said that it has a “remote-first” culture, and that the new office would be primarily a “convening space” for meetings, as opposed to requiring employees to show up five days a week there.', 'Walsh noted that “New York is clearly the leader [in cryptocurrency] …as opposed to in Boston, where we have the foremost antagonist to this technology, [U.S. Senator] Elizabeth Warren.”', 'Volpe echoed that the move aligned with New York becoming a hub for regulated crypto activity.', 'Joshua Deems, a Boston-based executive at Figment, a provider of blockchain infrastructure, called Circle “a pretty distributed company,” suggesting the new HQ in New York is symbolic as much as strategic.', 'Among Circle’s top executives, a handful like Allaire, Senior Vice President of Engineering Michael Tsui, Chief Business Officer Kash Razzaghi and Chief Strategic Engagement Officer Elisabeth Carpenter still list Boston as their location on LinkedIn. But other top Circle leaders are based in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, according to LinkedIn.', 'Circle is a case study in how tough it is these days to say exactly where a company is “based,” and Circle, like most companies, doesn’t provide a breakdown of where its employees are located.', 'Since Circle’s core business is capturing the spread between what its assets (mostly Treasuries) earn and the $1 it returns to holders when USDC is redeemed, “When interest rates are up, their revenues are up,” according to Carlos Mercado, a senior data scientist at the Boston analytics firm Flipside Crypto, which focuses on digital assets and the underlying blockchain technology. However, this also means Circle’s financial performance will fluctuate based on the macroeconomic environment — like President Trump’s current push for lower interest rates.', 'While USDC is backed by real assets, it is not insured like bank deposits. Deems said that USDC is also vulnerable to “a de-peg,” where the token could potentially trade below $1. Mercado recounted a real example: “USDC was not trading at $1 in March of 2023″… It was trading at 92 cents, 89 cents.”', 'That occurred the weekend after a run on Silicon Valley Bank, which had custody of roughly 8% of Circle’s assets. That event briefly shook USDC holders’ confidence in the token’s value. But Mercado said that Circle now uses more diversified and secure banking partners — banks generally considered “too big to fail” by the U.S. government.', 'The company’s IPO filing lists twenty risks the business could face, including that Circle is “subject to an extensive and highly evolving regulatory landscape,” and that “our products and services may be exploited by our customers, employees, service providers, and other third parties to facilitate illegal activity.”', 'Another stablecoin, Tether (known as USDT), remains the global leader in stablecoin circulation, with about $150 billion in value. Tether has “some first-mover advantage” in regions like Africa, Walsh said. The company recently moved its headquarters from the U.S. Virgin Islands to El Salvador.', 'It “was kind of like the cowboy, Wild West stablecoin,” Volpe said. And Mercado noted that Tether backs its stablecoin with some amount of Bitcoin, which is subject to fluctuations.', 'More concerning for investors in Circle’s stock, Volpe said, is Circle’s reliance on distribution partners like Coinbase, a big San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange.', 'Coinbase keeps “100% of the [interest] revenue from USDC kept on [its] exchange, and even 50% of revenue from USDC held on other platforms,” raising questions about Circle’s margins and control of its own ecosystem, Volpe explained.', 'Other companies, like PayPal, have already launched their own stablecoins, and traditional players in the payment industry such as Visa and Mastercard could follow suit at some point, he said.', 'The experts with whom I spoke consistently described Circle as the “buttoned-down” alternative to more freewheeling, offshore crypto firms.', '“Jeremy [Allaire] and the Circle team have really embraced … trying to be open, trying to work with regulators,” Volpe said.', 'Walsh argued that stablecoins are “really important to the future of the dollar,” and Allaire has been a consistent advocate for creating a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoin regulation.', 'In his June 13, 2023, testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Allaire said, “As a nation, we need to ensure that the dollar is the most competitive currency on the internet, and that there can be universal access to the safest and most secure digital dollars possible. The stakes are simply too high to ignore.” (In May, Allaire was included as one of MassLive’s 12 innovation leaders to watch in 2025.)', 'Despite common perceptions about cryptocurrencies being used for black market transactions, USDC is probably more traceable than paper money. While there are concerns about digital currencies’ usefulness for money laundering, or funding terrorism or other criminal activities, as Deems puts it, “criminals who use blockchains to launder money are probably the dumbest criminals out there,” because “every transaction is fully traceable.”', 'Platforms like Coinbase require users to undergo so-called Know Your Customer (KYC) checks — providing ID and social security numbers — before they can acquire USDC, and blockchain records allow law enforcement to trace the full history of every token. By contrast, cash is holding onto its reputation as “the best way to launder money,” in Deems’ words.', 'Will Circle as a stock be a better investment than cash or a USDC coin?

Circle skyrockets 168% in largest-ever pop for a billion-dollar IPO,https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/111369/Circle-skyrockets-168-percent-in-largest-ever-pop-for-a-billion-dollar-IPO,"['Circle Internet Group (CRCL) made a historic entrance to public markets on Thursday, jumping 168% from the offer price in its NYSE debut. That is the biggest first-day pop for a billion-dollar US IPO in our 30+ year records.\n\nSign up for a free trial of IPO Pro, the platform that gives you all of the IPO information you need, all in one place.\n\nCircle\'s initial performance will undoubtedly encourage more IPOs in the cryptocurrency space, but it is also the latest in a series of well-received VC-backed IPOs over the past month (e.g. HNGE, MNTN, ETOR).\n\nThe world\'s #2 stablecoin issuer had originally planned to raise $600 million by offering 24 million shares at a range of $24 to $26, but immense demand led it to raise $1.05 billion by offering 34 million shares at $31 per share. The stock began trading on Thursday at $69, or 123% above its offer price, and finished the day at $83.23 (168%). That gave it a fully diluted market cap of about $21.5 billion at the close, compared to $7.9 billion at pricing, or the proposed $9 billion valuation of its abandoned SPAC merger in 2022.\n\nBillion-dollar IPOs rarely double on day one, even when they operate in a hot space, in part because there is not the same share-supply imbalance seen with smaller IPOs. Over the past 30 years, the roughly 200 billion-dollar US IPOs have averaged a first-day return of about 16%. Of that group, only five other companies have risen at least 100% on the first day. High-flying billion-dollar IPOs over the past five years do not have a good track record after the first-day close, though this is partly due to the excessive valuations of 2020-2021. Of the 10 billion-dollar IPOs with the biggest first-day pops of the past five years, all but one (DASH) trade below the first-day close, and four (RLX, BEKE, ARRY, BMBL) trade below offer.\n\nCircle represents a unique play on the digital asset industry, with stablecoins serving as the plumbing of what it calls the ""new internet financial system."" Outside of Coinbase (2021 direct listing), public investors don\'t have many options when it comes to sizable pure-play cryptocurrency stocks. The company went public with the wind at its back: While the amount of its USDC stablecoin in circulation has fluctuated dramatically over the past five years, it ended the first quarter at an all-time high of about $60 billion. It also benefits from a more crypto-friendly US administration.

Currently these are the two dominant players, but they have very different market positions.

Apart from issuing its stablecoins on numerous blockchains, it provides a wallet solution and more recently launched the Circle Payments Network, aiming to provide banking on- and off-ramps, FX and currency liquidity. It’s a big step toward vertical integration. We can expect the company to use its newly listed stock as a means to flesh out that strategy.', 'While Circle positions itself for growth, the IPO has crystallized substantial personal wealth for its leadership team.', 'The company operates with two share classes, with Class B shares carrying special voting rights that account for 30% of all votes.
