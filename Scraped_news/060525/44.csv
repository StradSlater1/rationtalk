Why Summer House Needs a Valley-Style Spinoff,https://www.realitytea.com/2025/05/27/why-summer-house-needs-valley-style-spinoff/,"[""BY JENNIFER O'BRIEN"", 'Rumors are that the Summer House cast will get one more summer in their shared rental out in Montauk. The beloved series has had a hell of a run, but even Peter Pan had to grow up at some point. But this is why the current cast needs to be given a The Valley-like spinoff of their own. Viewers still love the OGs and aren‚Äôt totally ready to see them disappear.  ', 'I don‚Äôt think most Bravo fans had faith that The Valley would do well. Many viewers were concerned it would be the hot mess express. But the series did great. Currently, Season 2 is showing the downfall of Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright‚Äôs marriage. As well as Nia Booko and Danny Booko trying to protect their relationship at all costs. So when I think of a spinoff for Summer House, I can‚Äôt help but think the network already has some great blueprints. ', 'The possible spinoff could showcase Amanda Batula and Kyle Cooke as the married couple. They would undoubtedly provide some pretty good arguments. And Kyle would eventually be the new Danny as he mutters, ‚ÄúSummer used to be fun, but now I have three under three.‚Äù Then you‚Äôd have the friend who, in this case, would be played by Carl Radke. Watching him try to launch Soft Bar would be a great storyline, especially since his backup plan if it fails is bankruptcy. ', 'I don‚Äôt know about you, but Summer House is modern-day Sex and the City. The women are working hard for their money and are bada*ss. You got your Carrie in Paige DeSorbo, who loves fashion and the city. Your Samantha is Lindsay Hubbard. Amanda is your Charlotte, as she wants traditional things out of life and comes off as a sensitive girl who has trouble finding her voice. And Miranda is perfectly embraced by Ciara Miller, who is tomboyish, smart, and sometimes cynical. My friends have always been huge fans of SATC, and I understand a bit more about why. The series showcased trials and tribulations that were relatable. And Summer House seems to be the weekend version of the popular HBO show, as it highlights what it is like to be a working professional in the Big Apple.   ', 'Nothing is off limits for this group. The women (and men) of Summer House talk openly about the sexcapades. Recently, fans watched as a threesome went down in the house. There are also bonding moments, like all the girls taking shots of Lindsay‚Äôs breast milk. It would be something to see the ladies on their day-to-day journey through the working week. I imagine they‚Äôd meet up at a rooftop bar and try to right the world.  ', 'Who knew Lindsay and Paige would walk out of the Summer House as best friends? In the early seasons, Paige had to write Lindsay off because she didn‚Äôt know how to be a good friend. But she evolved. Now Paige is obsessed with Lindsay, and their friendship has really blossomed. Both have also had fantastic storylines that could only lead to more. Over the last three seasons, fans have watched Lindsay go from dating Carl, to being engaged, to being dumped right before the walk down the aisle. But she has pulled herself up by her bootstraps and kept on going.', 'Meanwhile Paige has been working her butt off to achieve her dreams. She finally landed a podcast tour and shed about 180 pounds of dead weight in her relationship with Craig Conover. Summer House fans have watched as she dealt with anxiety attacks and being gaslit. Finally, she made the ultimate decision to cut Craig loose. As Season 9 winds down, fans are being given more insight into why the relationship didn‚Äôt work. Honestly, who wouldn‚Äôt want to see these two single in the city and running their boss b*tch empires.  ', 'Summer House is available to stream on Peacock and Hayu in the UK and Ireland.', 'TELL US ‚Äì WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A SUMMER HOUSE SPINOFF?', 'Jennifer O\'Brien has been a fan of reality TV ever since Jessica Simpson asked, ""Is this chicken or fish?"" Jennifer\'s favorite shows consist of everything Bravo, including the \'Real Housewives\' franchises, \'Below Deck\' franchises, and \'Southern Charm.\' Without a doubt, Jennifer\'s passion for reality TV shines through as she often tries to get to the bottom of major plot lines like Vanderpump Rules\' ""Scandoval.""', 'SHARE ARTICLE', 'RealityTea is a property of Evolve Media Holdings, LLC. ¬© 2024 All Rights Reserved. | Affiliate Disclosure: Evolve Media Holdings, LLC, and its owned and operated subsidiaries may receive a small commission from the proceeds of any product(s) sold through affiliate and direct partner links.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXRSM2hyTjBSbE16WnFXV2RCVFJES0FoaktBaWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

I see my brain working overtime, and I can tell by how my eyes look that I‚Äôm psychoanalyzing every single thing I‚Äôm feeling, saying, and doing,‚Äù she said. ""I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve been able to be this vulnerable in this stage of my life had I not been on a reality show for seven years. I‚Äôm very proud of myself, because what you see is authentically who I was this summer.‚Äù', 'When the 32-year-old Bravo personality split from her longtime boyfriend and spoke openly about anxiety and fertility, she became a figurehead for young women choosing themselves.
