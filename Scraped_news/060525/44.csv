DeSorbo was a resident Summer House cast member from season three through season nine and has appeared in two seasons of the spinoff show Winter House.', 'In 2020, DeSorbo and Berner launched the Giggly Squad podcast together. DeSorbo’s burgeoning career eventually became a factor in her breakup with her Bravolebrity boyfriend, Southern Charm’s Craig Conover, who wasn’t thrilled at the prospect of her giggling on the road for a 60-city podcast tour in fall 2024. “If any 32-year-old man said, ‘You know what? Actually, I’m going to focus on my career for a couple more years.’ The response would be, ‘He’s got a good head on his shoulders. He really knows what he’s doing,’” DeSorbo said during season nine. “But when it’s a woman, they’re like, ‘That’s scary.’” Since then, she has released a book with Berner and launched her own loungewear line named Daphne, after her daughter cat.

Why Summer House Needs a Valley-Style Spinoff,https://www.realitytea.com/2025/05/27/why-summer-house-needs-valley-style-spinoff/,"[""BY JENNIFER O'BRIEN"", 'Rumors are that the Summer House cast will get one more summer in their shared rental out in Montauk. The beloved series has had a hell of a run, but even Peter Pan had to grow up at some point. But this is why the current cast needs to be given a The Valley-like spinoff of their own. Viewers still love the OGs and aren’t totally ready to see them disappear.  ', 'I don’t think most Bravo fans had faith that The Valley would do well. Many viewers were concerned it would be the hot mess express. But the series did great. Currently, Season 2 is showing the downfall of Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright’s marriage. As well as Nia Booko and Danny Booko trying to protect their relationship at all costs. So when I think of a spinoff for Summer House, I can’t help but think the network already has some great blueprints. ', 'The possible spinoff could showcase Amanda Batula and Kyle Cooke as the married couple. They would undoubtedly provide some pretty good arguments. And Kyle would eventually be the new Danny as he mutters, “Summer used to be fun, but now I have three under three.” Then you’d have the friend who, in this case, would be played by Carl Radke. Watching him try to launch Soft Bar would be a great storyline, especially since his backup plan if it fails is bankruptcy. ', 'I don’t know about you, but Summer House is modern-day Sex and the City. The women are working hard for their money and are bada*ss. You got your Carrie in Paige DeSorbo, who loves fashion and the city. Your Samantha is Lindsay Hubbard. Amanda is your Charlotte, as she wants traditional things out of life and comes off as a sensitive girl who has trouble finding her voice. And Miranda is perfectly embraced by Ciara Miller, who is tomboyish, smart, and sometimes cynical. My friends have always been huge fans of SATC, and I understand a bit more about why. The series showcased trials and tribulations that were relatable. And Summer House seems to be the weekend version of the popular HBO show, as it highlights what it is like to be a working professional in the Big Apple.   ', 'Nothing is off limits for this group. The women (and men) of Summer House talk openly about the sexcapades. Recently, fans watched as a threesome went down in the house. There are also bonding moments, like all the girls taking shots of Lindsay’s breast milk. It would be something to see the ladies on their day-to-day journey through the working week. I imagine they’d meet up at a rooftop bar and try to right the world.  ', 'Who knew Lindsay and Paige would walk out of the Summer House as best friends? In the early seasons, Paige had to write Lindsay off because she didn’t know how to be a good friend. But she evolved. Now Paige is obsessed with Lindsay, and their friendship has really blossomed. Both have also had fantastic storylines that could only lead to more. Over the last three seasons, fans have watched Lindsay go from dating Carl, to being engaged, to being dumped right before the walk down the aisle. But she has pulled herself up by her bootstraps and kept on going.', 'Meanwhile Paige has been working her butt off to achieve her dreams. She finally landed a podcast tour and shed about 180 pounds of dead weight in her relationship with Craig Conover. Summer House fans have watched as she dealt with anxiety attacks and being gaslit. Finally, she made the ultimate decision to cut Craig loose. As Season 9 winds down, fans are being given more insight into why the relationship didn’t work. Honestly, who wouldn’t want to see these two single in the city and running their boss b*tch empires.  ', 'Summer House is available to stream on Peacock and Hayu in the UK and Ireland.', 'TELL US – WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A SUMMER HOUSE SPINOFF?', 'Jennifer O\'Brien has been a fan of reality TV ever since Jessica Simpson asked, ""Is this chicken or fish?"" Jennifer\'s favorite shows consist of everything Bravo, including the \'Real Housewives\' franchises, \'Below Deck\' franchises, and \'Southern Charm.\' Without a doubt, Jennifer\'s passion for reality TV shines through as she often tries to get to the bottom of major plot lines like Vanderpump Rules\' ""Scandoval.""', 'SHARE ARTICLE', 'RealityTea is a property of Evolve Media Holdings, LLC. © 2024 All Rights Reserved. | Affiliate Disclosure: Evolve Media Holdings, LLC, and its owned and operated subsidiaries may receive a small commission from the proceeds of any product(s) sold through affiliate and direct partner links.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXRSM2hyTjBSbE16WnFXV2RCVFJES0FoaktBaWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

But like all good things (and some bad decisions), it’s time for this chapter to close.”', 'DeSorbo joined the show in season three, which aired in spring-summer 2019. Since that time, the 32-year-old reality TV star became a fan favorite on the series, graduating from Bravo-lebrity to full-on household name thanks to some key moments on the Bravo series; her viral podcast, Giggly Squad, with former cast member Hannah Berner; and her very public breakup with Craig Conover in 2024.', 'Lately, DeSorbo and Berner’s fame has skyrocketed with a 60-city tour and a New York Times bestseller, How to Giggle. On June 5, DeSorbo even announced her own sleepwear line, Daphne, which is named after her cat.', 'In her Instagram Stories post, DeSorbo promised even more to come. “To my castmates, the fans, and my NBCU family: thank you.

So much more to do together, but for now you know you can always find me and Daphne in my bed.”', 'Though this announcement may come as a shock to fans, Paige DeSorbo teased an “end date” for her reality TV journey in recent interview with Glamour.', '“There’s an end date for me at some point. With the lifestyle of Summer House specifically, I’m probably not fitting into the original show idea anymore,” she said in April. “Whenever I see a comment that’s like, ‘She’s a little too old to be on this,’ I’m like, Yeah, I kind of am. I’m probably not as fun to party with as a 25-year-old, and I get that.”', 'Of the lifestyle, she continued, “I would stay on reality TV, but it’s only fun and real if it’s your lifestyle, and as I get older, I am straying away more and more from partying every weekend. I really can’t drink two nights in a row; I will pass away. I was actually nervous for this season to come out because I felt like I didn’t do anything this summer because I was so tired from working.”', 'Even so, she said, she was “proud” to watch herself this season, even when it was “hard.”', '“Watching it back is definitely hard, because I didn’t realize how emotional I actually was this summer. I see my brain working overtime, and I can tell by how my eyes look that I’m psychoanalyzing every single thing I’m feeling, saying, and doing,” she said. ""I don’t think I would’ve been able to be this vulnerable in this stage of my life had I not been on a reality show for seven years. I’m very proud of myself, because what you see is authentically who I was this summer.”', 'When the 32-year-old Bravo personality split from her longtime boyfriend and spoke openly about anxiety and fertility, she became a figurehead for young women choosing themselves. And—with a successful podcast, a new book, and a top-secret fashion line on the way—it’s paying off.', 'MORE FROM GLAMOUR', 'SEE MORE STORIES & GUIDES', '© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.
