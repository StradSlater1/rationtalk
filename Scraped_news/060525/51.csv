Stern, the New York‚Äìborn ex-NBA commissioner, who once (allegedly) steered Patrick Ewing to the Knicks, who once (actually) declared his preferred Finals matchup to be ‚ÄúLakers vs. Lakers,‚Äù would have cringed at a matchup between two of the league‚Äôs smallest markets, or so the commentary went. ‚ÄúTotal bulls---,‚Äù says a longtime team exec. ‚ÄúDavid would have loved this.‚Äù ', 'Indeed, as the NBA prepares to crown a new champion for the seventh consecutive season, it‚Äôs worth noting it was Stern who got this ball rolling. In 2011, Stern, determined to whittle down players‚Äô share of basketball-related income and put in place a more constraining salary cap, locked the players out, forcing a 161-day work stoppage. The NBA, Stern said, needed a structure that ‚Äú30 teams, if well managed, have an opportunity both to compete and to make a profit.‚Äù The league lost 16 games off the ‚Äô11‚Äì12 season. It gained a collective bargaining agreement that put it on a path to parity. ', 'In a way, these Finals are Stern‚Äôs crowning achievement. Indiana (the NBA‚Äôs ninth-smallest media market) has never won an NBA championship. The Thunder‚Äôs roots trace back to Seattle, where they won the 1979 title. In Oklahoma City (third-smallest media market), the team has never won. ', 'One will claim the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Trophy, for the exact reasons Stern envisioned. They are well-run, well-managed franchises who built championship-level rosters through smart drafting, shrewd trades and timely free agent signings. After 14 years, two more CBAs, a commissioner change (Adam Silver, Stern‚Äôs longtime deputy commissioner, succeeded Stern in 2014) and a cap spike, the NBA has created a landscape where half the teams in the playoff field believe they can win a championship. And the other half think they are a piece or two away from joining them. ', '‚ÄúI understand that dynasties are something that fans will get behind,‚Äù Silver said last year. ‚ÄúAt the same time what you hear from fans is they want those teams to be created the right way. So people aren‚Äôt that interested in seeing teams buy championships, so to speak.‚Äù', 'For the NBA, the dream has been realized. Parity has been achieved. It‚Äôs the era of merit-based success, with the two Finals teams offering blueprints for how to achieve it. ', 'In the spring of 2019, Oklahoma City officials geared up for an aggressive offseason. The ‚Äô18‚Äì19 season had been a disappointment, ending in a humiliating first-round loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. Still, the Thunder believed the core of the team, headlined by Russell Westbrook and Paul George, had one more run in them, and the Sam Presti‚Äìled front office was determined to add pieces that could help them do it. ', 'Then, on the eve of free agency, George requested to be traded. ', 'Instead of retooling, Oklahoma City was forced to rebuild. George went first, shipped to the Los Angeles Clippers for one of the largest packages of players and picks in NBA history. Three unprotected first-round picks from the Clippers. Two more, via the Miami Heat. A pair of pick swaps. And a young, 20-year-old guard named Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. ', 'Westbrook was next. The Houston Rockets, eager for a new backcourt mate for James Harden, shipped Chris Paul, two first-round picks and two swaps to Oklahoma City for Westbrook. Totaled, the haul was historic: Seven first-round picks and four swaps. ', 'Thunder brass celebrated. But they knew what was coming. Auctioning off stars was easy. Now Oklahoma City would have to play without them. They staved off disaster in the first year, racking up 44 wins in the COVID-19‚Äìshortened 2019‚Äì20 season, with Paul, Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder leading the way. That summer, the Thunder flipped Paul to the Phoenix Suns, collecting another first-round pick. That‚Äôs when the bottom fell out.', 'Oklahoma City won 22 games in the 2020‚Äì21 season. The Thunder won 24 the next season. The losing streaks were demoralizing. A 14-game skid in ‚Äô20‚Äì21. A nine-game winless stretch right after. In ‚Äô21‚Äì22, they had losing streaks of seven, eight and 10. ', 'Those years, though, offered opportunity. ‚ÄúIt was a blank piece of paper,‚Äù Mark Daigneault said. A Thunder assistant under Billy Donovan, Daigneault was promoted to head coach after Donovan left in 2020. While Presti used the early years to identify players, Daigneault used them to build out a system. ‚ÄúHow we were going to play on both ends of the floor,‚Äù Daigneault said. ‚ÄúThe fundamentals, refining that over time, building our mettle through the adversities of losing more games than we win by a large margin.‚Äù', 'Losing was difficult. ‚ÄúHumbling,‚Äù Gilgeous-Alexander said. Still, like Daigneault, Gilgeous-Alexander saw the advantages of playing in a pressure-free environment. ‚ÄúThose days were very important,‚Äù Gilgeous-Alexander said. ‚ÄúBuilding habits, building the things you don‚Äôt really see every night, things that don‚Äôt really show up in the stat sheet. Coach has always been really good on his standard of how we play and the things that matter, no matter who‚Äôs on the team, no matter what our record is.‚Äù', 'For Lu Dort, each loss was motivation. Dort was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2019, eventually working his way into Oklahoma City‚Äôs rotation. ‚ÄúIt was not fun to go out there and lose by 20,‚Äù Dort said. Each loss, Dort added, was memory-holed as an experience he never wanted again. ‚ÄúIt was more fuel and motivation,‚Äù Dort said. ‚ÄúAnd honestly knowing that this is not where we want to be in the league. We want to try our best to win the most games that we can win.‚Äù', 'In the front office, Presti looked for players to help them do it. In 2012, Oklahoma City‚Äôs trip to the Finals was powered by singular talents. Kevin Durant‚Äôs dynamic scoring. Westbrook‚Äôs explosiveness. Harden‚Äôs polished playmaking. As Presti built out the new Thunder, versatility was coveted. Some of Presti‚Äôs swings hit (Josh Giddey, Jalen Williams). Others missed (Darius Bazley, Aleksej Pokusevski). ', '‚ÄúThe beauty of Sam is that Sam has this biological clock in his brain when he knows when you have to move on from somebody,‚Äù says Bobby Marks, an ESPN analyst and former assistant general manager with the Brooklyn Nets. And, Marks adds, they don‚Äôt panic when things don‚Äôt work out. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt operate like that, man,‚Äù Marks says. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have these blinders on. They kind of know who fits with this group.‚Äù', 'Internally, the Thunder began to note improvements, ‚Äúflickers,‚Äù said Daigneault, of what was to come. Trades were strategic. In 2020, Oklahoma City acquired Al Horford, in part to collect another first-round pick, but in part to see how Gilgeous-Alexander played alongside a floor-spacing big. The losses continued to pile up, but they began to get more competitive.', '‚ÄúThere was a competitive spirit that the team had where they were competing independent of the outcomes of the games,‚Äù Daigneault said. ‚ÄúWhich I thought was very encouraging. And we were doing that on a pretty consistent basis. I think if you‚Äôre a hardcore Thunder fan, you were following those teams. Those teams on a lot of nights were punching above their weight, and I thought showed some signs of feistiness and competitiveness that have certainly flowered as time‚Äôs gone on.‚Äù ', 'In 2022‚Äì23, Oklahoma City won 40 games. In ‚Äô23‚Äì24, it jumped to 57. Gilgeous-Alexander blossomed from promising guard to MVP candidate. Chet Holmgren emerged as a dynamic frontcourt partner. Williams showed flashes of becoming a reliable third scorer. The versatility of its roster, said Daigneault, accelerated its development.', '‚ÄúHaving the versatility on the roster allows us to bend and adapt to the opponent, bend and adapt to our circumstances with injuries or roster,‚Äù Daigneault said. ‚ÄúAnd it also allows us to develop players because you can get a lot of guys out there and you‚Äôre not having to fit puzzle pieces into a very narrow thing.‚Äù', 'Last spring, Oklahoma City was bounced in the second round by the Dallas Mavericks. Some flaws‚Äîrebounding, wing depth‚Äîwere exposed. Once again, Presti set out to reinforce a potential contender. This time there would be no trade request to stop it. Isaiah Hartenstein was added to reinforce the frontcourt. Presti flipped Giddey for Alex Caruso, trading offense for more defense. The results were a 68-win season, the NBA‚Äôs top defense and the largest per game margin of victory (12.9 points) in league history. ', 'In the playoffs, Oklahoma City was tested. Down 2‚Äì1 to the Denver Nuggets, the Thunder rallied to win Game 4. In Game 7, they blew out a Nuggets team two years removed from a championship. Oklahoma City lost by 42 in Game 3 of the conference finals against Minnesota. They bounced back to win a nip-and-tuck Game 4 on the road. Questions about the Thunder‚Äôs readiness have quickly dissipated. ', '‚ÄúYou never know how many times you get to play for a team like this,‚Äù Gilgeous-Alexander said. ‚ÄúEspecially when basketball becomes a business and you‚Äôre not just a kid running around. So yeah, it‚Äôs special and you try to cherish these moments no matter what‚Äôs going on, wins or losses or you try to just embrace the journey and embrace the opportunity.‚Äù', 'Rick Carlisle has a story. In February 2022, after Indiana acquired Tyrese Haliburton from the Sacramento Kings, Carlisle took Haliburton to dinner. Carlisle knew the significance of the trade. To get Haliburton, the Pacers had to give up Domantas Sabonis, a budding big man with All-Star potential. For Indiana to win, Haliburton, a second-year guard, had to fit. ', 'At dinner, Carlisle‚Äôs message was simple: This is your team now. ‚ÄúI had a short conversation with him to tell him that we were basically giving him the ball,‚Äù Carlisle said. ‚ÄúI asked him if he was comfortable running the team, making play calls whenever we needed to make play calls and all those kinds of things. And his eyes lit up. He was really enthusiastic about that.‚Äù', 'For Haliburton, the conversation offered relief. The trade was devastating. Haliburton had a successful first year in Sacramento, finishing third in the Rookie of the Year vote. He started his second season started even better, bumping up his scoring and assist totals while shooting better than 40% from three. The Kings were immersed in a decades-long stretch of futility. Haliburton wanted to be part of the group that turned it around. ', 'What Haliburton wanted was to be part of building something. In Indiana, he became the centerpiece of it. With Haliburton on board, the Pacers set out to find players who complemented him. Haliburton is a unique talent. He won‚Äôt beat you in the post. He‚Äôs a good isolation player, but not a great one. What he is: a three-point shooting, flashy playmaking, open floor blur. Said Carlisle, ‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve put this group together around Tyrese, we‚Äôve had to make adjustments to develop a style that was effective for us.‚Äù', 'Movement was prioritized. Indiana was 17th in pace in the 2021‚Äì22 season. The next year, Haliburton‚Äôs first full season, they were fourth. In the playoffs, the Pacers crushed opponents in transition, often creating breaks off made baskets. Since 1990, only two teams have made the Finals playing faster than Indiana. The ‚Äô16‚Äì17 Warriors were one. The ‚Äô24‚Äì25 Thunder are the other. ', 'It isn‚Äôt just transition. In the half court, Indiana‚Äôs offense is in constant motion. The ball never stops moving. The Pacers averaged 330.5 passes per game in the regular season, per NBA.com, second-most in the NBA. They ranked in the top-five in assists, secondary assists and assist points created. They did it while ranking in the bottom five in turnovers per game. ', 'To play that way, Indiana needed the right personnel. It had some in place. Myles Turner, a fluid, three-point shooting big man, fit seamlessly. T.J. McConnell, a feisty defender who fit Carlisle‚Äôs pressing style. They drafted Andrew Nembhard, Bennedict Mathurin and Ben Sheppard. They traded for Aaron Nesmith and Obi Toppin, seldom-used players in Boston and New York, respectively, who have thrived in Indiana. ', 'In 2024, Indiana faced a decision. The Pacers were good, hovering in the top-six in the Eastern Conference, in position to make the playoffs for the first time since ‚Äô20. But they were missing something. A reliable perimeter scorer. Defensive versatility. When Toronto made Pascal Siakam available, the Pacers pounced, dealing away three first-round picks for the Raptors forward. ', 'The trade paid immediate dividends. Siakam averaged 21.3 points in 41 games that first season, shooting 38.6% from three, helping the Pacers advance to the conference finals. He was ‚Äúa big brother,‚Äù said Haliburton. Siakam played 78 games this season, averaging 20.2 points and earning his third All-Star berth. His performance in the conference finals (24.8 points, five rebounds) earned him conference finals MVP. ', '‚ÄúThe Siakam trade, oh my God,‚Äù Marks says. ‚ÄúWhat a difference-maker. That completed them. A team told me last year, and this was a year ago and it probably still holds true, they‚Äôre kind of the prototypical team. If there‚Äôs the gold standard on how to build a roster under these rules, it‚Äôs them. When you have two max guys and then you have everyone else under $20 million.‚Äù', 'With Haliburton leading it. If there‚Äôs been a breakout star in these playoffs, it‚Äôs been Haliburton, who has led historic comebacks, knocked down impossible shots and been the engine to Indiana‚Äôs first Finals appearance since 2000. After the final buzzer sounded in Game 6 against New York, Haliburton and Siakam shared a long embrace. ', '‚ÄúWhen we brought him here, we envisioned doing something like this, doing something special,‚Äù Haliburton said. ‚ÄúThis is a franchise that took a chance on me. Saw something that other people didn‚Äôt see in me. Sometimes I think they saw more in me than I saw in myself. I love being a Pacer. There‚Äôs nothing like it.‚Äù', 'Hanging over the Finals is a question: Will anybody watch? The push for parity has effectively zeroed out big-market superteams, creating opportunities for smaller markets to compete. Smaller markets, though, often mean smaller ratings. Neither Oklahoma City nor Indiana are in a top-20 media market, the first time ever the Finals has featured two teams outside the top 20.', 'Privately, NBA officials will acknowledge a likely ratings dip. The Western Conference finals averaged 5.6 million viewers, down 17% from the Wolves-Mavericks series a year earlier. The Game 5 clincher was the least-watched Game 5 in nearly two decades. Star power historically has helped boost ratings. LeBron James did it for years in Cleveland and Miami. The Thunder and Pacers have stars (Gilgeous-Alexander is the reigning MVP), but they have not yet broken through to a broader audience. ', 'The NBA insists it‚Äôs fine with it. There is no pressure on the league to deliver high ratings. Last summer, the league signed rights deals with ESPN/ABC, NBC and Amazon that will generate $75 billion over the next 11 seasons. Stars like Gilgeous-Alexander and Haliburton (not to mention Williams, Holmgren, Turner and Siakam) will benefit from Finals eyeballs. Long term, the NBA believes NFL-level parity will lead to broad growth in ratings. ', 'Critics will argue that the NBA needs dynasties. The league experienced its greatest growth in the ‚Äô80s, when the Celtics and Lakers were squaring off, and the ‚Äô90s, during the rise of the Bulls. Long-term growth, however, required more than just a handful of teams winning championships. Stern believed it. The Finals are his legacy, one shepherded expertly by Silver, that both believe will lead to a brighter future.

The 2025 NBA Finals Entrance Survey,https://www.theringer.com/2025/06/03/nba/nba-finals-2025-preview-oklahoma-city-thunder-indiana-pacers-predictions,"['The 2025 NBA Finals are here. Well, sort of. How about some predictions in the meantime?', 'The Oklahoma City Thunder will host the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 on Thursday night, tipping off one of the most unexpected Finals matchups in NBA history. While the Thunder ripped off a dominant 68-win regular season and cruised through two out of three series before their title clash, the Pacers are one of the most unlikely Finals participants ever. Indiana won just 50 games during the regular season and had to get past Giannis Antetokounmpo in the first round, the mighty Cleveland Cavaliers in the second, and their archrival the New York Knicks in the conference finals. Along the way, they pulled off some of the wildest comebacks in playoff history (including one all-time thriller) and became just the sixth no. 4 seed in NBA history to reach the Finals.', 'The Pacers‚Äô prize? A showdown with the historically strong Thunder, who needed only five games to dispatch the Minnesota Timberwolves in the conference finals. By any objective measure, Oklahoma City is the deeper, younger, more talented, and more versatile squad. They‚Äôre a staggering -750 to win the Finals, according to FanDuel. ', 'But the Pacers have been catching other teams off guard for weeks, which means that the Finals could be spicier than they would appear on the surface. To examine the matchup, The Ringer paneled its NBA staff to ask them for their predictions heading into Thunder-Pacers. Let‚Äôs dive in.', 'Howard Beck: To steal a line from intergalactic All-Star Leia Organa: It‚Äôs hope. Hope for small-market NBA franchises. Hope for fans in remote cold-weather outposts. Hope for anyone who doesn‚Äôt root for teams in L.A., San Francisco, New York, or Boston. We‚Äôre about to see a Finals featuring the nation‚Äôs 47th-ranked TV market (OKC) and the 25th-ranked market (Indianapolis), per Nielsen. Within the past four years, we‚Äôve seen champions in Milwaukee (38th) and Denver (17th). This is what true parity looks like, and this is what the NBA has been trying to orchestrate (via increasingly strict payroll rules) for the past 15 years. Is it good for Finals ratings? I don‚Äôt really care. Competitive balance‚Äîand a belief in every NBA market that their team has a real chance‚Äîis objectively good for the league. So bemoan the convergence of two small-market wonders, if you must. I‚Äôm celebrating it.', 'Michael Pina: I‚Äôm most curious to see how Tyrese Haliburton holds up against one of the best defenses in NBA history. Can he run a highly efficient offense that doesn‚Äôt turn the ball over, generates a ton of corner 3s, and consistently puts Oklahoma City in rotation? On the other end, how will the Thunder handle Haliburton? Will they pressure him full court with Lu Dort, Cason Wallace, and Alex Caruso, then deny him the ball once he gives it up? Will they switch pick-and-rolls, turn him into a scorer, and make him attack Chet Holmgren or Isaiah Hartenstein one-on-one over and over again? Haliburton needs to have a hyper-disciplined, impeccably precise out-of-body experience for Indy to win. Can he do it? ', 'More on the NBA Finals', '2025 NBA Finals Primer: The Thunder-Pacers Track Meet', 'The Unlikely Symmetry of SGA and Haliburton', 'How the Indiana Pacers Spun Style Into Substance', '', '', '', '', 'Danny Chau: As someone currently in the process of applying for Canadian citizenship, I‚Äôm very happy about the sheer amount of CanCon we‚Äôre getting in these Finals. Shout-out to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is about to put the finishing touches on an all-time season that will anoint him as the greatest Canadian basketball player ever. Shout-out to Andrew Nembhard, pride of Aurora, Ontario, and the Oak Ridges Moraine. Shout-out to Lu Dort, Bennedict Mathurin, and the richly embedded Haitian community in Montreal. Honorary shout-out to Pascal Siakam, who should be on anyone‚Äôs list of the top five Toronto Raptors of all time. These Finals, what a beauty.   ', '', '', 'Logan Murdock: The number of times St. Elmo‚Äôs will be referenced for no reason at all. ', 'Tyler Parker: Paul George is the most consequential player in this series‚Äîhonestly, the Thunder should invite him back for Game 1 as a thank-you‚Äîbut I‚Äôll go with James Johnson‚Äôs emotional return to Oklahoma City. ', 'Parker: There‚Äôs a path, but it‚Äôs treacherous, and at one point they will have to actually fly. But Haliburton‚Äôs properly sorcerous, and Indy‚Äôs got shooters. Rick Carlisle‚Äôs a great X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs coach, and the Pacers don‚Äôt turn the ball over. Short of employing Nikola Jokic, this offense, maybe more than any other offense in the league, has the tools to give the Thunder defense problems. When the wounds can come from anywhere, anything is possible. Is that a stupid line? That might be a stupid line. ', 'Chau: The Pacers have been by far the most efficient 3-point-shooting team of the entire postseason, and if the Thunder remain steadfast in their principle of denying drives into the middle, there will be plenty of opportunities to launch from deep. If Indiana can ramp up its long-ball attempts without succumbing to a monumental regression at the worst possible time, that could be enough. ', 'Murdock: Can the Pacers get Jesus or Caitlin Clark on a 10-day contract?', 'Beck: I expect the Thunder to win this series handily, for all the obvious reasons. But you never say never. The Pacers have defied odds and expectations all season, and they truly relish the role of spoiler. They‚Äôre capable of clamping down defensively and very capable of erasing big deficits. Haliburton seems to live for fourth quarters and crunch time. If Siakam can consistently win his battles with Holmgren, Jaylin Williams, et al., and if guys like Aaron Nesmith and Nembhard can make 3s at a high clip the way we‚Äôve seen at key moments this postseason, then maybe the Pacers can shock us all.', 'Pina: If the Pacers are able to maintain their offensive identity, curb live-ball turnovers, consistently catch Oklahoma City off guard with a few easy buckets immediately after the Thunder score, and make more than half of their corner 3s and midrange jumpers, then yes, there is a path. Checking off that many boxes against a team that boasts an overall record of 80-18 is, random injuries permitting, extremely unlikely. ', 'Pina: Jalen Williams will win Finals MVP. I know this almost definitely won‚Äôt happen, but part of me believes that it can if he wreaks absolute havoc on both ends against the Pacers, who could throw the kitchen sink at Gilgeous-Alexander. In reality, it‚Äôs so hard to imagine a scenario in which SGA isn‚Äôt OKC‚Äôs Finals MVP regardless of how his numbers look. But since voters typically focus on statistical production, there‚Äôs definitely a situation where Williams really explodes on offense while being one of the main reasons the Thunder blow up Indiana‚Äôs attack. ', 'Chau: Jaylin Williams will have a three-to-one minutes-played-to-charges-drawn ratio in the series. ', 'Murdock: Indy will catch OKC slipping and steal Game 1.', 'Beck: Haliburton‚Äîin the spirit of his Dame Time taunt and Reggie Miller ‚Äúchoke‚Äù reenactment‚Äîwill find a way to irritate the Thunder, perhaps by slyly mocking Gilgeous-Alexander‚Äôs, er, creative foul-drawing skills.', 'Parker: I can‚Äôt pick just one, so bear with me here: Bill Hader sits courtside for Game 5 in Oklahoma City. Aaron Wiggins scores 22 in Game 2. Pat McAfee takes the mic in Game 3 and announces a new line of tank tops. Gilgeous-Alexander wears his Reba T-shirt to Game 1. Garth Brooks descends from the rafters of the Paycom Center to sing the national anthem. He‚Äôs wearing all black. He‚Äôs punching the air. He‚Äôs screaming.', 'Chau: Thunder in six. OKC‚Äôs paradigm-shifting defense will ultimately win out, but not before getting sucked into the entropy of the Pacers‚Äô offense once or twice. Indiana‚Äôs miraculous run ends here, but not without a bang.  ', 'Pina: Thunder in five. I picture this series going exactly like this year‚Äôs Western Conference finals or last year‚Äôs NBA Finals. The Thunder will hoist the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Trophy after thoroughly dominating the series, save for one avalanche of a loss that doesn‚Äôt mean anything. ', 'Beck: Thunder in five. Although it brings me no joy to say so. I truly hope that the Pacers can make this a series. But OKC simply has too much talent and depth‚Äîand a seemingly endless supply of elite defenders to stifle Indiana‚Äôs beautiful offense.', 'Murdock: Thunder in five. It‚Äôll be an entertaining but short series. OKC is the best team in the league and will be the latest team to earn premature dynasty status by the end of June. ', 'Parker: Thunder in six. I really wanted to say Thunder in five, but I have too much respect for the Pacers offense to count on a short series.

Pacers vs Thunder Props & Best Bets for Thursday,https://www.covers.com/nba/finals/pacers-vs-thunder-props-best-bets-thursday-6-5-2025,"['', '', ""Douglas Farmer breaks down Game 1 of the NBA Finals and offers his best Pacers vs. Thunder props ahead of Thursday's clash."", 'When thinking about the NBA Finals, do not think about the TV ratings. Those numbers do not matter. Instead, think about which Indiana Pacers excel at shooting from the corner. Think about how gladly Oklahoma City Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will drive by 3-point closeouts. And think about who in this series has the most title experience.', 'Those are the focuses of my Pacers vs. Thunder props and NBA picks before Game 1 tips off at 8:30 ET on Thursday, June 5.', '', 'NBA\nPacers vs Thunder Predictions\nBy: Jason Logan', 'Obi Toppin 2+ threes (+220 at bet365)', 'Let‚Äôs start by laughing at what Obi Toppin‚Äôs 3-pointer Over/Under market is set at. Toppin is juiced all the way to -200 to clear 0.5 threes. Immediately, this +220 looks pretty good. To profit on Toppin hitting one 3-pointer, you have to bet two dollars to win just one. To profit from him hitting a second 3-pointer, you could make more than two dollars for every dollar you bet. This is an absurd uptick.', 'Sure, Toppin has hit multiple 3-pointers in only two games this postseason, while shooting just 28.6% from deep, but he is taking 2.6 threes per game. Furthermore, that number should climb.', 'The Oklahoma City Thunder bases its defense on allowing looks from the corners. As much as corner 3s have come to define much of the modern NBA, the Thunder bet on themselves closing out strongly enough to fluster those open shooters. And this has obviously worked, producing the best defense in the NBA.', 'But at 6-foot-9, Toppin will not be easily flustered by those closeouts. There is a reason he hit 45% of his corner 3s this season ‚Äî 54-of-120 ‚Äî while taking them on a full 20% of his field goal attempts. Only Ben Sheppard shot in the corner more often among Indiana‚Äôs rotation, but his postseason action has dwindled, particularly compared to Tobbin‚Äôs.', 'The Thunder will let Toppin get clean catch-and-shoot chances in the corner. They will close out on him, but that matters only so much.', 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Under 1.5 threes (-120 at bet365)', 'This has been a line parroted by yours truly for most of the postseason, with some success. This logic is why Indiana was a savvy bet at +400 to upset the Cavaliers in the second round. The Pacers are known for their offense, but their defense deserves more appreciation.', 'Specifically, Indiana focuses on defending the arc, somewhat a philosophical opposite of Oklahoma City. The Pacers ranked No. 3 in opponent 3-point attempt rate after the All-Star Break, opponents taking just 39.0% of their shots from deep. And they made only 34.5% of those, the fourth-lowest percentage in the NBA.', 'Those trends have effectively continued in the postseason.', 'Indiana will stick to its plan to start this series. Perhaps it backfires and Rick Carlisle needs to adjust, but initially, the Pacers will not give up open looks from deep.', 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will not mind that, given he is an atrocious 3-point shooter, hitting just 30.0% this postseason. He will appreciate the closeouts, using them to get an edge on defenders who should already be scrambling to prevent his drives.', 'Pascal Siakam Over 19.5 points (-115 at bet365)', 'Pascal Siakam and Alex Caruso have the most NBA Finals experience in this series, the former winning a title in 2019 with the Raptors and the latter doing so in the 2020 bubble with the Lakers.', 'Much as is the case now, Siakam was Toronto‚Äôs No. 2 player while Caruso was a rotation player for Los Angeles. In other words, Siakam should have the most applicable experience in putting up numbers on basketball‚Äôs biggest stage.', 'Siakam has shown that experience this postseason, scoring at least 20 points in eight of 16 games, including three of six in the Eastern Conference Finals to win ECF MVP.', 'For all of Oklahoma City‚Äôs excellent defenders, Siakam may still present a matchup problem. He is not as loose with his dribble as most players standing 6-foot-8, and if he can get into the midrange on drives, he will be comfortable hitting runners or pull-ups.', ""The Indiana Pacers' path to winning the NBA Finals will hinge on having two offensive initiators, Siakam joining Tyrese Haliburton. Logic says that has been emphasized this week in prep, and getting Siakam going early will be a Pacers focus."", 'Take advantage of the early win payout at bet365, where any pre-game NBA moneyline bet gets paid out as a winner if your team goes up by 20+ points!', ""Learn more about this feature, and all of bet365's offerings, with our comprehensive bet365 review."", '21+.

Around Philadelphia, sentiment has mostly formed around rooting for the underdog Pacers, in part because they play an entertaining up-tempo style and took down the rival Knicks, but also due to the presence of Timothy John McConnell. T.J. spent his first four NBA seasons as a Sixer and remains a beloved member of franchise lore, so seeing him complete the journey from undrafted player on the Summer Sixers to rotation player on an NBA champion would certainly be satisfying.', 'Still, Oklahoma City is a likable group as well, and many Sixers fans like to imagine the team would be in a similar situation to OKC if Sam Hinkie, like Thunder executive Sam Presti, had been allowed to marinate everything for a full decade without the league foisting a horde of Colangelos upon us. No judgment if you‚Äôre rooting for the Thunder to complete their own version of the Process with a title.

NBA Finals‚Äô 17 best players ranked for Thunder vs. Pacers series,https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2025/6/4/24442285/nba-finals-2025-every-player-ranked-thunder-vs-indiana-pacers,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Let‚Äôs rank the best players in the 2025 NBA Finals.', 'The 2025 NBA Finals is a classic matchup of an elite offense vs. a historic defense. The Indiana Pacers vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder might not be the series anyone would have expected at the start of the season, but it should provide a thrilling NBA Finals showdown anyway.', 'The Thunder were a popular preseason pick to win the West. OKC was the No. 1 seed in the conference last season before getting eliminated in round two by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks on their way to the NBA Finals. The Thunder took the next step this year with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander growing into the MVP, and young co-stars Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams blossoming as two-way forces. The Thunder have one of the best defenses in league history, and they‚Äôre ready to try to put the clamps on Indiana‚Äôs high-powered offense.', 'The Pacers live up to their name in every way. Indiana is one of the league leaders in pace, pushing the tempo to new heights with Tyrese Haliburton leading their attack. Haliburton‚Äôs ability to avoid turnovers while getting his team running hard every possessions is a unique skill that has fueled Indiana‚Äôs success. Pascal Siakam has become a perfect secondary star for this team with his relentless dedication to running the floor and crafty creation skills when the game slows down. The Pacers‚Äô role players like Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith have been a revelation on this run, and they will need to play better than ever for Indy to have a chance.', 'Our old friend Tom Ziller once ranked the best players in the 2016 NBA Finals on this site. (subscribe to Good Morning It‚Äôs Basketball). Let‚Äôs do it again for 2025. Here‚Äôs our ranking of the best players in Thunder vs. Pacers series.', 'Joe is the lone shooting specialist in the rotation for the Thunder. He was a masterful pickup off waivers from the Philadelphia 76ers back in 2022, and he‚Äôs lived up to his billing as a knockdown shooter by hitting 41.2 percent of his threes in 225 career regular season games with OKC. Joe has seen his minutes cut a bit in the playoffs, but if the Thunder find themselves in a shootout with Indy, his quick trigger and ability to maximize spacing around the ‚Äòbig three‚Äô could come in handy.', 'Mathurin was the first top-10 pick for the Pacers since 1989. It‚Äôs easy to see why he was so highly touted coming out of Arizona with an ideal mix of length, athletic explosiveness, and shooting for an off-guard. He‚Äôs developed into a solid bench scorer for Indiana this season, and he had a couple big performances in the Eastern Conference Finals to help get them here. Mathurin will need to improve his awareness on both ends of the court and his defensive intensity if he wants to take the next step in his career.', 'McConnell is a modern miracle. He‚Äôs carved out a long NBA career for himself despite being undersized (he‚Äôs listed at 6‚Äô1) and a non-shooter from deep. Now in his 10th season, McConnell has had some big-time moments in this playoff run with eight games where he scored in double-figures. He‚Äôs generally been a high-turnover guard throughout this career (18.7 career turnover rate), and he‚Äôll have to take care of the ball well to have any place in this series.', 'Wiggins was a true hidden gem for Thunder executive Sam Presti. Taken with one of the final selections in the second round of the 2021 draft, Wiggins developed into a solid defender before taking a bigger offensive leap this season. He‚Äôs a career 39 percent three-point shooter, and showed a new ability to attack off the bounce this year, leading to the first double-figures scoring season of his career. Wiggins hasn‚Äôt done much in the playoffs, but finding a two-way player on a cost-controlled contract (Presti locked him up on a descending $47 million deal) is another example of OKC‚Äôs masterful team-building.', 'Toppin parlayed his college stardom at Dayton into being the No. 8 pick in the 2020 draft by the Knicks. His arrival coincided with Julius Randle‚Äôs emergence, so he never really got a shot to show what he could do in New York. The Pacers picked up him up for two second round picks on the last year of his rookie deal, and turned him into one of the best bench forwards in the league. Toppin‚Äôs ability to run the floor makes him a perfect fit for Indiana‚Äôs high-octane offense, and he‚Äôs become a pretty good shooter, too. Having a player like Toppin off the bench is a big reason why the Pacers‚Äô depth is so well-regarded.', 'Wallace was a personal favorite of mine coming out of Kentucky in the 2023 draft, and he‚Äôs been a perfect fit on the Thunder to start his career. A strong 6‚Äô3 guard, Wallace is known for his physical on-ball defense, but he also has some shooting and playmaking skills. It would be fascinating to see what he could do with a bigger role, but for now Wallace is an overqualified role player who leaves a big imprint on winning.', 'Finding Nembhard with the first pick in the second round in the 2022 draft out of Gonzaga was a masterstroke by the Pacers. He‚Äôs remade himself from a pure point guard to a gritty defender, and he made Jalen Brunson work for everything he got in the Eastern Conference Finals. Nembhard has taken his game to a new level in the playoffs the last two seasons, particularly as a shooter. He‚Äôs a career 33 percent three-point shooter during the regular season, but that somehow goes up to 48 percent when he‚Äôs in the playoffs. Nembhard will draw the Gilgeous-Alexander assignment for long stretches in this series, and he‚Äôs got his work cut out for him.', 'Nesmith‚Äôs emergence into a legit 3-and-D wing is a big reason why the Pacers are in the Finals. Indiana plucked the former lottery pick out of Boston in the Malcolm Brogdon trade, and he immediately regained his outside shooting stroke and developed into a gritty defender against big guards and wings. The Pacers probably don‚Äôt make the Finals without Nesmith exploding for eight threes against the Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, including three in the final minute of the fourth quarter. He‚Äôs going to split his time between guarding SGA and Jalen Williams in this series, and Indiana better hope he‚Äôs no longer hobbled by an ankle sprain he suffered last round.', 'Hartenstein never puts up big numbers or plays heavy minutes, but he‚Äôs carved out a long and lucrative NBA career by doing all the little things to help his teams win. The Thunder were a terrible rebounding team until signing Hartenstein over the summer, and he immediately made an impact in that area. He was the best insurance policy possible when Chet Holmgren went down with a pelvic fracture, keeping the Thunder‚Äôs elite defense afloat with his paint protection and helping grease the wheels of the offense with his passing and play finishing. Hartenstein has already done his job by playing a crucial role in playoff series against the Nuggets and Timberwolves‚Äô physical front lines this year. He‚Äôll continue to be good in his role even if it isn‚Äôt quite as big against a smaller and faster Pacers team in the NBA Finals.', 'Dort earned All-Defense honors for the first time in his career this season, and it felt long overdue. The 6‚Äô5 wing is built like an NFL linebacker, and he plays with just as much physicality and intensity on the defensive end. Dort‚Äôs excellent on-ball defense will take on a starring role in the Finals as he draws the Tyrese Haliburton assignment. He does an amazing job walling off drivers, and refusing to cede an inch of ground when he‚Äôs locked in defensively. His offense can be a little hit or miss, but when his moon ball threes are falling, the Thunder look unbeatable.', 'Turner has had remarkable longevity with the Pacers for a player who has seen his name pop up in trade rumors ad nauseam since entering the league. He‚Äôs no longer a premier defensive center like he once was, but Turner has only gotten better as a shooter in recent years, which has unlocked Indiana‚Äôs five-out lineups. Turner‚Äôs 10 seasons with the Pacers only trails Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (Warriors), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Bucks), and Joel Embiid (76ers) among active players. It‚Äôs been wonderful to see Turner reinvent himself as the Pacers oriented around Haliburton. He‚Äôs about to be pushed to the extreme on both ends against OKC.', 'The Thunder committed highway robbery by prying Caruso away from the Chicago Bulls for only Josh Giddey. OKC knew it could keep Caruso on ice for most of the regular season, and that has kept him healthy for this playoff run. It was Caruso who slowed down Nikola Jokic in Game 7, and Caruso who guarded both Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards in the conference finals. He might be one of the best per-minute NBA defenders of all-time, and he‚Äôs in prime position to play a key role on a championship team for the second time in his career.', 'Williams‚Äô meteoric rise into one of the best wings in the NBA during his third season has helped make the Thunder a juggernaut. The 24-year-old wing is absolutely massive with a jacked frame and 7‚Äô2 wingspan, and he uses those tools to impose his will on both ends of the floor. Williams doesn‚Äôt have many holes in his game: he can burn the defense off the dribble, stroke spot-up threes, and take on a variety of defensive assignments while knowing when to gamble for a steal. If he plays at his best level offensively, the Thunder can‚Äôt be beat.', 'Holmgren is already one of the best bigs in the NBA, and he‚Äôs just starting to scratch the surface of his long-term potential. Holmgren might look skinny, but he‚Äôs a dominant rim protector with his length (7‚Äô6 wingspan) and impeccable hand-eye coordination. He might be the best three-point shooter of any dominant shot-blocker in the league with a 38 percent three-point stroke, and he‚Äôs always ready to pump fake and attack a closeout with power off the bounce. Holmgren is the backline of the Thunder‚Äôs historically good defense while also allowing them to play five-out on offense. The term ‚Äòunicorn‚Äô is overused, but Holmgren actually is one.', 'The third spot was the toughest to figure out in these rankings with Holmgren and Williams each having a strong case. Ultimately, I settled on Siakam for his ability to plug every hole for the Pacers while also accentuating their greatest strength. Siakam was a hand-in-glove fit in the Pacers‚Äô high-tempo offense, and he‚Äôs feasted on run outs throughout the playoffs. When the game settles down into the halfcourt, the veteran forward can also provide technical one-and-one scoring ability with his herky-jerky driving style and soft touch. The Pacers‚Äô defense improved dramatically upon his arrival, too. Siakam already has one championship ring from his days in the Toronto, and just getting to these NBA Finals stamps him as one of the truly great No. 2 options of this generation.', 'Haliburton has remade the Pacers in his image from the moment they acquired him in a brilliant trade with the Sacramento Kings. The 25-year-old point guard is single-handedly responsible for engineering an Indiana offense that pushes the tempo to the extreme while also rarely turning the ball over. Haliburton isn‚Äôt just one of the game‚Äôs most brilliant passers, he‚Äôs also a deadly pull-up shooter from three and one of the most clutch players in the league. His ability to throw crosscourt passes that don‚Äôt end in turnovers is a truly special skill, and it‚Äôs a big reason why he‚Äôs turned into an elite offensive engine fueling Indiana‚Äôs success.', 'Gilgeous-Alexander is the best guard in the NBA, and he‚Äôs just getting started on what has the potential to be a legendary run. The 26-year-old won NBA MVP this season after finishing second last season and fifth the year before that. He‚Äôs an impossibly talented offensive scorer with a relentless dedication to getting to his spots and the the size (6‚Äô6 with a 7-foot wingspan) to shoot over most defenders. SGA has the ball on a string as a handler, and he‚Äôs equally great at draining shots from mid-range or slithering all the way to the rim for a layup. He‚Äôs also one of the best foul drawers in the sport, and he‚Äôs good at preventing turnovers. This is one of the truly great isolation scorers of the last 25 years. SGA is putting up hyper-efficient 30+ point per game seasons every year at this point, all while being an active part of a historically great defense. The Pacers don‚Äôt have anyone who can slow down Gilgeous-Alexander, and that‚Äôs why the Thunder are a big favorite in this series.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

NBA DFS Showdown Picks Breakdown for the NBA Finals: Pacers vs. Thunder Game 1,https://www.fantasylabs.com/articles/nba-dfs-showdown-picks-breakdown-for-the-nba-finals-pacers-vs-thunder-game-1/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The NBA Finals officially get underway on Thursday. Game 1 will take place in Oklahoma City with the Thunder hosting the Pacers. OKC is listed as a massive 9.5-point favorite, while the total sits at 230.5.', 'Let‚Äôs dive into some of the top plays on the slate using the FantasyLabs Tools and metrics.', 'Don‚Äôt forget that for large-field tournaments, you can utilize our Lineup Optimizer to effortlessly create up to 150 lineups, or use our Lineup Builder if you like to hand-build your lineups. Also, make sure to check this article if you‚Äôre looking for a refresher on the single-game format.', 'Note: Projections and Leverage Scores/Ratings may change throughout the day after this article is posted. The NBA DFS landscape changes quickly. Consult the Player Models directly for any updates as we get closer to lock.', '', '', '', 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander stands out as the clear top option in this matchup. While he‚Äôs had to contend with guys like Nikola Jokic and Anthony Edwards in previous series, the Pacers don‚Äôt really have a superstar who is capable of rivaling him from a fantasy standpoint. That‚Äôs reflected in our projections. SGA has the top median projection by more than 12 points, and the gap is similar from a ceiling standpoint.', 'Gilgeous-Alexander has been extremely consistent all playoffs. He‚Äôs a scoring machine, leading the league with 32.7 points per game during the regular season, and he‚Äôs carried that into the postseason. He‚Äôs posted a positive Plus/Minus in all but two games, and both were blowouts where he played less than 28 minutes. In other words, he‚Äôs matched or exceeded value every time he‚Äôs played his usual workload during the playoffs.', 'SGA has scored at least 31 points in eight of his past nine games, and there‚Äôs no reason to expect anything different on Thursday. If anything, his scoring output could increase in this series. The Pacers are not a particularly strong defensive squad, ranking ninth in defensive efficiency during the postseason.', 'Ultimately, Gilgeous-Alexander has been the most productive player on a per-minute basis between these squads, and no one is projected for more than his 38 minutes in our NBA Models. It‚Äôs hard to beat that combination, and he leads all players in projected Plus/Minus. He should be a staple in nearly 100% of lineups, either at Captain or in a utility spot.', 'Tyrese Haliburton is the Pacers‚Äô stud option, and while he‚Äôs not quite on the same level as SGA, he‚Äôs not that far off, either. He‚Äôs had a tremendous postseason, putting together some monster performances through the first three rounds. His 84.5 DraftKings points in Game 4 vs. the Knicks was his magnum opus ‚Äì 32 points, 12 rebounds, 15 assists, four steals, zero turnovers ‚Äì but he has five other games with more than 55 DraftKings points during the playoffs. Overall, he‚Äôs actually increased his production to 1.29 DraftKings points per minute during the postseason, compared to just 1.25 during the regular season.', 'Unfortunately, the matchup vs. the Thunder is as tough as it gets. They were first in the league in defensive efficiency during the regular season, and they‚Äôve maintained that ranking in the playoffs. They have a host of bodies to throw at Haliburton defensively, and they‚Äôre capable of wreaking havoc on that end of the floor. The matchup results in an Opponent Plus/Minus of -7.51, and he averaged just 11.0 points, 5.5 assists, and 3.0 rebounds across 32 minutes per game in two contests vs. the Thunder during the regular season.', 'Ultimately, it‚Äôs hard to get too excited about Haliburton in this spot. OKC has made a living of shutting down opponents, so expectations with Haliburton should be lower than usual.', 'Don‚Äôt forget to check out our NBA SimLabs Lineup Generator to create advanced DFS lineups using the power of simulation:', '', 'Jalen Williams has blossomed into the No. 2 option for the Thunder, and when he plays well, they‚Äôre nearly impossible to beat. He experienced some growing pains in a tougher-than-expected series vs. the Nuggets, but he bounced back with some excellent performances vs. the Timberwolves. He posted a positive Plus/Minus in each game besides the Game 3 blowout, and he got to at least 47.0 DraftKings points in three of them.', 'When he‚Äôs at his best, Williams is capable of contributing in every category across the board. He can score, rebound, and distribute, and he‚Äôs also adept at picking up steals on defense. He hasn‚Äôt been quite as productive on a per-minute basis as he was during the regular season, but he‚Äôs still averaged a very respectable 1.14 DraftKings points per minute.', 'Only SGA is projected for more than Williams‚Äô 37 minutes on Thursday, while his $9,800 salary is very reasonable. If he puts together another strong showing, don‚Äôt be surprised if he cracks five figures for Game 2.', 'Pascal Siakam was instrumental in the Pacers‚Äô upset of the Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals, taking home MVP in the process. He carried the offense in Game 2, finishing with 39 points and 52.75 DraftKings points, and he also had at least 30 points in Games 4 and 6.', 'The biggest issue with Siakam is consistency. There are nights when it appears the Pacers forget how capable he is on offense, and his production can suffer in those spots. He‚Äôs already had five games with 27.5 DraftKings points or fewer in this series, which is more than you‚Äôd expect for someone in this price range.', 'Siakam‚Äôs price tag is also up to $9,400 for Game 1, which is as expensive as he‚Äôs been all playoffs. It‚Äôs hard to imagine him having the same impact vs. the Thunder that he did vs. the Knicks, making him an interesting sell-high candidate. Still, he clearly has some upside, and he‚Äôs projected for minimal ownership in our NBA Models.', 'Chet Holmgren remains an extremely productive fantasy player when on the court. The big question is, how often will he be on the court vs. the Pacers? His minutes have been volatile over the past two series, which has capped his upside.', 'That said, he‚Äôs managed to post a positive Plus/Minus in back-to-back games, scoring at least 37.75 DraftKings points in both contests. He played just 33.1 and 30.3 minutes in those outings, so he‚Äôs clearly capable of providing value in limited minutes. We have him projected for 31 minutes on Thursday, making him a high-risk, high-reward type of player.', 'Myles Turner is another player who can be tough to pin down. He was awesome in the series vs. the Cavaliers, but he lost a ton of playing time vs. the Knicks. He saw just 24.2 and 21.1 minutes in the final two contests, making him a bit of a question mark for Game 1.', 'We‚Äôre taking a bit of an optimistic approach to Turner‚Äôs minutes in our NBA Models, with him currently projected for 30. However, that‚Äôs still not enough to make him an appealing option at $8,000. He has the second-worst projected Plus/Minus in this tier, so the downside far outweighs the potential upside.', 'Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith have been huge for the Pacers all playoffs, and their development is a big reason why they‚Äôve made it to the NBA Finals. Nembhard was an absolute monster in their Game 6 win over the Knicks, finishing with 44.25 DraftKings points thanks in part to six steals, while Nesmith was the hero with eight 3-pointers in Game 1.', 'Both players should continue to play solid roles for the Pacers, but both have become a bit pricy. Nembhard checks in at $7,400 on this slate, while Nesmith is up to $7,000. Nesmith specifically was priced in the $5k range for most of the early playoffs, so there‚Äôs less value here than there was previously. They‚Äôre still capable of returning value at their elevated figures, but it‚Äôs going to take significantly more to do so.', 'Isaiah Hartenstein has seen fewer and fewer minutes for the Thunder as the playoffs have progressed. They‚Äôre opting for smaller lineups, and he‚Äôs paid the price from a playing time standpoint.', 'We‚Äôre expecting more of the same vs. the Pacers. He‚Äôs currently projected for 20 minutes in our NBA Models, and it‚Äôs going to be tough for him to return value with such minimal playing time. He‚Äôs failed to crack 21.75 DraftKings points in six straight games, so he‚Äôs overpriced at $6,400.', 'Hartenstein‚Äôs loss has been Alex Caruso‚Äôs gain. He‚Äôs seen a bump in minutes during the postseason after averaging just 19.3 minutes per game during the regular season. That hasn‚Äôt necessarily led to a huge spike in production, but he has put together a few ceiling performances.', 'Caruso is projected for another 25 minutes in Game 1, making him an interesting option. He‚Äôs averaged more than 20 DraftKings points per game with a comparable playing time projection as a member of the Thunder (per the Trends tool).', 'Pictured: SGA\nPhoto Credit: Imagn Image', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNDROMGRSVTI1MllWVkxNVXBxVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdrUkVwRDBsS3FwcFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df
"2025 NBA Finals: Pacers-Thunder predictions, key matchups to watch in roundtable preview",https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-pacers-thunder-predictions-key-matchups-to-watch-in-roundtable-preview,"['With Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers scheduled to tip off Thursday at 8:30 p.m. ET., we‚Äôve gathered Kurt Helin, Raphielle Johnson, and Noah Rubin to break down the important questions and the matchups to watch during the series, as well as their predictions on how the 2025 NBA Finals will play out.', '', 'Noah Rubin: Can they? Potentially. Will they? I‚Äôm not banking on it. To be clear, this isn‚Äôt a knock on Indiana‚Äôs offense, which has been incredible since Tyrese Haliburton was handed the keys to the offense. They play team basketball, and everyone is a threat. However, this is one of the best defenses in league history. They have multiple guards, multiple forwards and multiple bigs that can guard multiple positions. This is a defense that works and fits together, and there aren‚Äôt any weak links to pick on. If anyone can figure it out, it will probably be Rick Carlisle and Haliburton, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be enough to win this series.', 'Raphielle Johnson: The Pacers can potentially break through against the Thunder defense, but this will be a challenge unlike any they‚Äôve faced this postseason. In addition to their depth, the Thunder, for the most part, have looked extremely connected on that end of the floor. Luguentz Dort‚Äôs physicality will be a challenge for Tyrese Haliburton, and then Oklahoma City can call on Cason Wallace whenever he needs a break. What I‚Äôm also looking forward to is how the Thunder use Alex Caruso. In the conference finals, they were able to go small for long stretches due to his ability to handle a variety of assignments.', 'Kurt Helin: No. Or, at least not enough to win the series. The Pacers have a fantastic offense and Tyrese Haliburton deserves all the flowers coming his way in recent days, plus Indy has generally handled pressure defenses well (Game 5 vs. New York excluded). It‚Äôs just different with the quality of defenders the Thunder bring. Here‚Äôs the bigger issue: OKC may be the best switching defense in the league. The Pacers like to force a switch with a high pick early in the offense to get Haliburton matched up on the guy he wants to attack (sorry Brunson), and to get defenses in rotation when he does get downhill. The Thunder, however, can and will switch just about anything 1-5 and don‚Äôt have a weak defender on the floor, plus their rotations are sharper than anyone else‚Äôs.', '', 'Rubin: Jalen Williams vs. Aaron Nesmith. During the regular season, Andrew Nembhard took the SGA matchup on defense, and Nesmith guarded Williams, who had an excellent series against Minnesota. Williams wasn‚Äôt as effective against Denver, and the Nuggets were nearly able to win the series. The one game OKC dropped against the Timberwolves was Williams‚Äô worst performance of the series. Slowing down SGA is a tall task, but if Nesmith is able to take Williams out of the equation, the Pacers will have a better chance at winning this series.', 'Johnson: Myles Turner vs. Chet Holmgren. The Pacers won‚Äôt win this series without Turner consistently being one of the best players on the floor. He was not in the two regular-season meetings between these teams, and Holmgren did not play in either matchup due to his fractured hip. Turner brings a little more power to the table than the slender Holmgren, but he doesn‚Äôt always bring that physicality. He didn‚Äôt have the best conference finals, but the Pacers were good enough in other areas to compensate. They can‚Äôt afford for Turner to be anything but elite if they‚Äôre to win the title.', 'Helin: Luguentz Dort vs. Tyrese Haliburton. What we saw in Game 5 vs. New York is something we saw too much of from Haliburton early in the season, when Indiana got off to a slow start: Put a physical, athletic, ball-denying defender on Haliburton and he was too willing to go into a shell and let his teammates essentially play 4-on-4. That didn‚Äôt work, Haliburton stepped up his aggressiveness in those settings and the Pacers did a better job of off-ball picks and more to get Haliburton the rock. The Pacers‚Äô balanced offense doesn‚Äôt work if Haliburton isn‚Äôt conducting the orchestra. Nobody frustrates a point guard, and nobody in the league gets over picks as well as Dort, and if he is making Haliburton‚Äôs life miserable, then Indiana‚Äôs going to have a miserable, short, series.', '', 'Rubin: Pascal Siakam. Three-time All-Star. Two All-NBA appearances. The 2018-19 Most Improved Player. Now, Siakam could add a second ring to his collection, and after winning the Eastern Conference Finals MVP award, there is certainly a chance he wins Finals MVP, if they win the series. Basketball Reference currently has Siakam at a 2.1 percent chance of making the Hall of Fame, but will he have more of a case with another ring? I don‚Äôt think he would if he retired this summer, but his resume would certainly be strengthened.', 'Johnson: Sam Presti. He‚Äôs already regarded by many as the best lead executive in the NBA today, given what he‚Äôs done to build the Thunder into a juggernaut that is set up to last. There‚Äôs just one thing missing from his time in Oklahoma City, and that‚Äôs a championship. While the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù conversation focuses on the players, and rightfully so, the respective rotations are pretty young. That doesn‚Äôt guarantee them more shots at a championship, but I don‚Äôt think any player will have to deal with the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù chatter that a LeBron James, for example, did after he moved to Miami. So, I‚Äôll go with Presti as my answer.', 'Helin: Rick Carlisle. This run to the Finals may have done it anyway. Within league circles he was always considered one of the best Xs and Os guys out there ‚Äî going all the way back to his time on Chuck Daly‚Äôs Nets‚Äô staff ‚Äî but there was a sense among more casual fans that he was a coach who lucked into an NBA Finals win because of Dirk Nowitzki (the way that Frank Vogel‚Äôs title is viewed by many now, and some might even through Doc Rivers in that mix). It was never true, and Carlisle leading this team to the Finals in a very different style than his previous one shows his versatility and evolution as a coach.', '', 'Rubin: Thunder in five, with SGA taking the honors. If I was getting overly specific with my prediction, it would be that the Thunder win one game in a blowout, but the rest of the games in this series will be tight. I just don‚Äôt think the miraculous run from Indiana will result in a championship. SGA will be the best player on the floor, and the Thunder are deeper, which is saying a lot since the Pacers are also a deep team. Indiana may have a slight coaching advantage, but this is a matchup of two elite coaches. I think this will be a close, exciting series, but I just don‚Äôt think the Pacers will end up winning more than one game.', 'Johnson: I like the Thunder in six games, and Gilgeous-Alexander wins MVP. These have been the two best teams in the NBA since January 1, with Oklahoma City being the best throughout the season. They can match Indiana‚Äôs strengths, and I have my questions about how effective they‚Äôll be defending Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams. Indiana will put up a great fight and win a few games, but Oklahoma City has been the best team in the NBA all season long, and I expect them to get the title to back up that claim.', 'Helin: Thunder in five, and if there is one lock coming into these NBA Finals it would be SGA to win MVP. Indiana has a team built for the modern game and tax apron world, a fun style of play with Haliburton out in front but quality players perfect for their roles such as Siakam, Turner and Nembhard. The Pacers‚Äô problem is that they want to play a fast, chaotic game, and Oklahoma City does that better. Haliburton is brilliant but Gilgeous-Alexander is better. Turner is having a great playoff run (well-timed for a guy getting a new contract) but Chet Holmgren is better. Indiana‚Äôs defense is improved, the Thunder‚Äôs is suffocating. You get the idea. OKC is just a better version of what Indiana has become.', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Tonight it‚Äôs Rob Clay, a singer and pastor known locally as ‚ÄúBig Rob‚Äù is belting out The Star-Spangled Banner. And I can‚Äôt rate it because ESPN in the US did not carry it. So now I‚Äôm upset. It sounded like this though.', 'Meanwhile, there was a pregame Thunderstorm and a post-storm rainbow that smiled on OKC fans as they walked from big parking lots into the arena. Is that some sort of Harbinger? Here comes tip-off!', 'White Shirts', 'The crowd are all wearing complimentary white shirts, provided by the team to show unity! This is a change from last round when they alternated white shirts and blue shirts by section.', 'I hate this. It is so very lame! Who started this? I bet it was Miami! Don‚Äôt agree? You like the shirt set up? Fight me!', 'That said, I once spent two days in OKC. There were tornado warnings, a pretty good burger, and I got pressured into shooting a 12 gauge shotgun by a real honest-to-god cowboy. Talk about action.', 'Prediction', 'OK, I‚Äôve been hinting that my pick is Indy and I‚Äôm going to go through with it. I am making a big bet that Carlisle will out coach that 40-year-old whippersnapper Mark Daigneault and win in seven games. And I am willing to put my money where my mouth is. I am not really a gambling guy, but I am putting 1one US dollar on the Pacers to pull this thing off, so you know I‚Äôm in. What‚Äôs your prediction? Send it to david.lengel@theguardian.com and I will make you famous.', 'Update: I couldn‚Äôt get the app to work so I am not betting a dollar. But I still stand behind my prediction!', 'Fast Pace', 'This series will be marked by young, athletic teams that furiously push the ball and seek out as many possessions as possible. It‚Äôs this pace that Indiana used to confuse and unsettle New York again and again. Their running was relentless, and their ability to score in transition, chucking long passes for easy layups after Knicks made baskets was stunning. It‚Äôs a style that works very well for Indy. The problem is that OKC can actually play just as fast, and execute just as well. They have averaged 101 possessions per game these playoffs. Indy? 98. T', 'his is a real issue for Indy head coach Rick Carlisle because a key Indy strength is easily matched by Oklahoma. And this is why it‚Äôs so hard to imagine Indiana winning this series, and this is why Indy are +1200 to win the series in seven games. Also, don‚Äôt forget, no four seed has ever won an NBA title.', 'Again, I have to mention, Rick Carlisle coached Dallas to what is probably the second biggest NBA Finals upset of the 21st century, with Cleveland topping the charts by overcoming a 3-1 series deficit v the 73 win Warriors.', 'So I actually think Indy can figure out some crazy scheme to keep them in these basketball games. Personally, I can‚Äôt see Indy being completely blown away.', 'Adam Silver', 'The NBA‚Äôs commissioner is giving his pre-Finals presser. He mentioned the league in Africa the league helped set up in order to develop the game and talent, which is a work in progress but is a clear location for growth. ‚ÄúFive years from now over 40% of the youth in the world will live in Africa,‚Äù said Silver.', 'Silver also spoke of the possibility of starting a European league that would ‚Äúserve their fans better‚Äù. I am not sure what that means, the set up for European basketball is pretty good ‚Äì are the NBA going to try and upend that decades old system? We‚Äôll have to wait and see.', 'Silver has also admitted that he‚Äôs stood up on the podium with what he thought was a fix for the All-Star Game before, but that those fixes have not worked out. This year, the game will be in the afternoon, after and before NBC‚Äôs Olympic coverage, which could help ratings, at least in theory, but won‚Äôt help any of the players care or play defense. I think I‚Äôll pass.', 'A question has been asked about shrinking the schedule, which is something critics of the NBA have been talking about for years. Silver says that of course, less revenue from fewer games would be an obstacle. He also says there‚Äôs no real evidence that injuries would be impacted, and that more games gives fans more opportunity to see something in person that they want to see. In short, he‚Äôs not really interested in a smaller schedule.', 'Howdy folks and welcome to our live rolling overage of the NBA Finals. That‚Äôs right, the season that began way back in November has reached its conclusion: the Oklahoma City Thunder v the Indiana Pacers. Both teams are seeking their first legitimate NBA crown. OKC actually has one franchise title they won while located in Seattle, which does count officially but really, hell no! And the Pacers won three straight ABA titles, which count but, eh.', 'So this is a very big deal, and biggest for Oklahoma as they‚Äôre not only chasing a title but looking to embed themselves in a core group of the best NBA teams of all time. With 68 regular season wins, we‚Äôre talking serious company here: the 1995-1996-1997 Bulls 72 then 69 wins, the 1971-1972 Lakers, 69 wins. It‚Äôs the big time. What they do not want is to wind up like the Golden State Warriors that won a record 73 games and then lost the 2015-2016 NBA Finals to LeBron‚Äôs gang.', 'I wrote in the Guardian‚Äôs NBA playoff preview that most of the pressure was on the wide Canadian shoulders of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the now reigning MVP. Anything short of a title would fall on him ‚Äì he‚Äôs the leader ‚Äì and would be catastrophic. For a franchise, when you‚Äôre supposed to win, and you don‚Äôt, there‚Äôs no greater setback. So let‚Äôs be clear here ‚Äì OKC is meant to win. Their guard play combined with their furious, multi-pronged, deep defensive lineups pose a myriad of issues for their opponents, as do their wings.', 'The Thunder are as complete a team as you can get, this postseason, bulled their way through Memphis and Minnesota, and won in seven games v Denver. How did the Nuggets pull that off? In a word, Jokic. And that‚Äôs about it.', 'Indy do not have a Jokic, and so they‚Äôre deep dogs. Don‚Äôt take it from me, take it from their All-NBA point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who admits as much. How do they beat Oklahoma? That‚Äôs a question for Rick Carlisle, who engineered an upset finals win for the 2011 Mavericks over the Miami Heat, and who engineered a Eastern Conference Finals win over the favored Knicks just a few days ago. If anyone can figure this out, it‚Äôs Rick. Against New York, he employed a scrambling, unpredictable offense that had the Knicks off balance all series. Against Oklahoma Indy will need to go absolutely crazy from three-point-land, and try to get to the line as much as they can, which is something Haliburton just doesn‚Äôt do.', 'It‚Äôs an uphill battle for sure, but if Indiana are going to steal one on the road, Game 1 is a good place to start. OKC haven‚Äôt played since 29 May, so in theory, they should be a bit rusty. Honestly though, I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.', 'So, can Indiana figure out OKC and strut to a shock-the-world upset? If so a win in Game 1 would be super helpful, and you can read all about it here. We will have tip-off at 830 ET, 130 UK. We‚Äôll have more to come ‚Äì stick with us!', 'David will be here shortly. In the meantime here‚Äôs a look at our predictions for the NBA finals:', 'Thunder in five. They‚Äôve been utterly dominant all season. That‚Äôs mostly been the case for the playoffs too, allowing for some Jokiƒá magic in the second round. The Pacers have been a ton of fun to watch, have impressive depth and a rising star in Haliburton. But the Thunder are deeper, more talented and have the best player in the series ‚Äì that‚Äôs a recipe for a gentleman‚Äôs sweep. Ryan Baldi', 'Thunder in five. If the Pacers had drawn literally any other Western Conference foe, I would give them a better chance in this series. But unfortunately for Indiana, they drew, in my estimation, the far better version of themselves. Indiana is great at forcing turnovers: Oklahoma City do that better. Indiana take great care of the ball: OKC even moreso. The Thunder have the MVP, the better defense, the better bench. They have been the best team in the league at home this season, and they have home-court advantage in this series. While the Pacers‚Äô run to the finals has been impressive all the way, and I see them winning a game, I think the Thunder will make relatively quick work of them en route to a Larry O‚ÄôBrien. Claire De Lune', 'Pacers in seven. I picked the Thunder at the start of the playoffs (flex) and my inner Dean Oliver is still inclined to think their historically good metrics will see them through. But management wants someone to make the case for Indiana so here we go. The Pacers‚Äô blistering pace, surgical ball movement and deep rotation give them a real shot at disrupting Oklahoma City‚Äôs rhythm. Haliburton‚Äôs vision fuels an attractive, crowd-pleasing offense that doesn‚Äôt rely on isolation or volume threes. If they can turn it into a track meet while taking care of the ball like they have all year, Indiana‚Äôs chaos could outlast OKC‚Äôs control. Bryan Graham', 'Thunder in six. Again: they‚Äôre loaded, high-energy, extremely well-coached and hungry as hell. Denver needed the world‚Äôs best player to take OKC to seven games. While the Pacers have their virtues, and a bona fide go-to guy in Halliburton, they don‚Äôt have enough to stop a team that seems like it has been on an inexorable march toward a championship since the season tipped off in October. For me, the question isn‚Äôt if Thunder will win, but whether GM Sam Presti can keep this squad together long enough to make a dynastic run for the ages.

It's Indiana's first finals appearance since 2000, and only the second appearance in franchise history!"", 'The Pacers battled to overcome the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks to make it to the highest stage in the NBA. ', 'Now, they face a team that is widely believed to be the best in the NBA, and maybe one of the best in the history of the league. They are led by the league MVP and feature a killer offense and even better defense. ', ""Here's what you need to know about the Thunder, how they match up against the Pacers and how Indiana made history getting here. "", 'Very few people predicted the Pacers making it to the NBA Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics were the favorites to represent the Eastern Conference for the entire season. But the Celtics lost their star, Jayson Tatum, to an Achilles injury. The Cavs then ran into the Pacers. ', ""Many dismissed the Pacers' run to the Eastern Conference Finals last season as a fluke that came from playing injured Bucks and Knicks teams. "", ""This series, though, the Bucks had their star tandem of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard for much of the first round, and it didn't stop the Pacers from beating them in a 4-1 gentleman's sweep. "", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""The Cleveland Cavaliers were the number one seed in the East, and had only one injury (Darius Garland's toe sprain) heading into the series. But even when Garland came back, the Cavaliers were still caught off guard by the Pacers. The series was highlighted by Tyrese Haliburton's stunning buzzer beater off of his own missed free throw to beat the Cavs at home in Game 2. The Pacers then went on to win the series 4-1. "", 'The New York Knicks were the third seed heading into the ECF and favorites to beat the Pacers. Right off the bat though, Indiana stole Game 1 in a historic rally (or collapse, if you\'re a Knicks fan) that saw the Pacers erase a 14-point lead in less than three minutes to force overtime. Haliburton again hit a key shot and used Reggie Miller\'s infamous ""choke"" taunt in celebration. The Knicks went on to win one in Indiana and one at home, but ultimately lost the series in Game 6. ', 'Just as the Cavs and Celtics were favorites to win the ECF, the Thunder have been the favorites to win it all the entire season. ', 'The Thunder have gotten to the Finals with a season-long dominance built on a historic defense. The Thunder are the first team to hold opponents to under 80 points in three separate games. ', 'OKC is led by the league MVP, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (""SGA""), who was the league\'s leading scorer. The 26-year-old Canadian plays point guard and averaged 39 points per game in the two meetings between the Thunder and the Pacers this year.

He's not the threat that SGA is, but he averaged 17 points per game against Indiana this season, and shot more than 41% from behind the 3-point line.

Chet Holmgren is the starting power forward for OKC; he averaged 15 points and 8 rebounds per game in the regular season. ', ""Isaiah Hartenstein is a returning playoff villain for Pacers fans. He plays center for the Thunder, but last season, he played for the Knicks. He isn't a big scorer, but he averaged 10 rebounds per game in the regular season, an area where the Pacers have struggled. "", 'Indiana and Oklahoma City squared off twice during the regular season, with the Thunder winning both times.', 'On Dec. 26, SGA scored 45 points as the Thunder erased an early double-digit Pacers lead to win 120-114. Andrew Nembhard scored 23 for the Pacers, while Haliburton was held to a mere four points.', 'On March 29, SGA led in scoring again with 33 points as the Thunder picked up their ninth straight win, 132-111.

Although, the matchup isn't quite as lopsided as it may seem. "", 'After the All-Star break, the Thunder had a defensive rating of 110.4. That means for every 100 possessions, they gave up 110 points to opponents. In that same period, the Pacers had a defensive rating of 111.5, so they gave up just one more point per 100 possessions than the Thunder.

The Pacers shot 40.1% from three in the playoffs. That was the best in the league by a good amount, and much better than the 33.6% number the Thunder posted. ', ""In short? The Thunder have a very good defense that feasts on turnovers. The Pacers also have a very good defense and don't give up many points on turnovers. The Pacers have also been on fire from three, while the Thunder have struggled. "", 'The Thunder are still heavy favorites to win the championship, but Pacers certainly have a chance.

NBA Finals: Insiders break down the matchup between 'the two hardest-playing teams',https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nba/nba-finals-insiders-pacers-thunder-rcna211030,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'OKLAHOMA CITY ‚Äî There are many ways to describe the NBA Finals.', 'Some see Oklahoma City vs. Indiana as the small-market Finals. To others, it‚Äôs known as the fiscal Finals ‚Äî a rare championship matchup between non-luxury-tax-paying teams.', 'On the court, it is a showdown between two of the league‚Äôs best guards, Thunder MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton.', 'Yet how these teams reached this point, just four victories from a title, can also be captured in a different way.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the two hardest-playing teams in the NBA,‚Äù a Western Conference coach told NBC News.', ""Since Jan. 1, the Thunder own the NBA‚Äôs best record and the Pacers the second-best, in large part because of how each has blitzed the rest of the league through its frenetic pace and pressure. The Thunder's harassing defense has become one of the best in playoff history at forcing steals."", 'Indiana, meanwhile, plays as if driven to push the ball upcourt as fast as possible. It‚Äôs common for teams to play fast off opponents‚Äô turnovers and missed shots ‚Äî but the Pacers have lived up to their name by running hard even after made baskets, and in the process they have created flurries of scoring opportunities that have knocked off the Eastern Conference‚Äôs No. 1 (Cleveland) and No. 3 (New York) seeds en route to the team‚Äôs first Finals appearance in 25 years.', 'NBC News spoke with NBA insiders to help analyze the series, which begins with Thursday‚Äôs Game 1. All were afforded anonymity in exchange for their candor and analysis, which their teams don‚Äôt permit them to voice publicly.', 'The Pacers are ‚Äúorganized chaos,‚Äù said a scout for a Western Conference team. ‚ÄúThey suck you into their style of play, where it‚Äôs not going to be a lot of defense but they‚Äôre just going to race the ball up and down the court, spread you out, shoot 3s, get to the basket, try to turn you over and just get in a rat race type of game. If you can match up with teams that struggle to do that, like New York, then you‚Äôre going to have a good chance to win.', '‚ÄúThe problem with Oklahoma City is they can play multiple ways. They enjoy playing fast, but they also can slow it down and use Shai in the halfcourt. It‚Äôll be a chess match to see which style of play wins out. Who breaks first and wants to play one way and not the other?‚Äù', ""Oklahoma City, which won 68 regular-season games to earn the West‚Äôs top seed, was a heavy favorite to reach the Finals all season, even though it had the second-youngest roster ever to do so. The Thunder ranked No. 1 in defense during both the regular season and the postseason, owing to their phalanx of strong defenders. The challenge begins beyond the 3-point arc, where Lu Dort was successful during Oklahoma City's 2-0 record against Indiana during the regular season at limiting how often Haliburton touched the ball. The rim, meanwhile, is protected by Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren."", '‚ÄúI think OKC is so strong defensively that they can kind of take you away from your first and second options,‚Äù an Eastern Conference scout said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve found a way to identify players that fit the modern style of play, which is being able to defend and shoot, and then you have obviously a transcendent MVP who can create opportunities for others.‚Äù', 'The West scout said some teams construct defenses around a few excellent players, while others try to elevate five otherwise average defenders through a system that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.', '‚ÄúBut I think with OKC, you‚Äôre getting kind of both,‚Äù the West scout said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting great individual performance while also very well-connected with each other. And it shows in the off-the-court stuff with them, where they like being with each other, like playing for one another.‚Äù', 'Haliburton on Wednesday called the Thunder ‚Äúhistorically great on both sides of the ball.‚Äù', '‚ÄúThis is the best team in the NBA,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been the best team in the NBA all year. They‚Äôre well-coached. They just do everything so well. There‚Äôs no shortcuts to beating this team.‚Äù', 'Beating Indiana will require Oklahoma City to do the one thing no one has yet to do consistently ‚Äî force the Pacers to beat themselves. Indiana\'s preferred pace is fast, yet it rarely turns the ball over. In the postseason, Indiana has gone 6-2 on the road by owning the highest road assist-to-turnover ratio, and it has assisted on a playoff-high 65% of its baskets because it plays lineups often with five players capable of hitting 3-pointers, including center Myles Turner, whose ability to shoot ""always messes teams up from a matchup perspective,"" the West coach said.', ""That offensive depth makes the Pacers trickier to guard than Oklahoma City's past playoff opponents; it could focus its defensive efforts to take away Ja Morant of Memphis, Nikola Jokiƒá of Denver and Anthony Edwards of Minnesota. Though Oklahoma City is heavily favored to win the series, Indiana can't be underestimated, an executive for an Eastern team said."", '""They understand how they‚Äôre playing, and they‚Äôre very stubborn in their approach,"" he said. ""They kind of grind you with the way they play. They wear you down.""', 'Both franchises reflect the realities of the modern NBA, in which the league‚Äôs collective bargaining agreement with its players has instituted rules aimed at penalizing teams that build expensive rosters by making it harder to draft or make trades when their payrolls cross a certain threshold. Though Oklahoma City has a star in Gilgeous-Alexander and the Pacers claim Haliburton as their own, both have found success in building deep teams that can punish opponents by coming at them in waves of long arms and fresh legs.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs why the day of the aging superstar will be over in the next two years,‚Äù the West coach said. ‚ÄúIndiana‚Äôs best talent for the majority of their roster is how hard they play.

"NBA Finals Preview: Pacers-Thunder May Not Be a Long Series, But It Will be Entertaining",https://www.gq.com/story/nba-finals-preview-oklahoma-city-thunder-indiana-pacers,"['Trying to score on the Oklahoma City Thunder‚Äôs defense can be like trying to ram a feather through a brick wall. Trying to contain the Indiana Pacers‚Äô offense is similar to catching a gust of wind with an old sock. Both can border on impossible, and you need the right personnel to achieve either dream, which is what will make the 2025 NBA Finals such an alluring watch.', 'Please, for the love of basketball, spare us all your thoughts about the geographic locations of each team somehow being a detriment. While it is true that a coterie of expensive suits in Midtown Manhattan wanted, for rating purposes, something a little glitzier than Oklahoma City-Indianapolis‚Äîthe 20th and 16th most-populous cities in the US‚Äîyou, dear reader, are not the National Basketball Association. You are a person. And if you‚Äôre a fan of pedal-to-the-metal hoops, you should be excited about this series.', 'In boxing, they say that styles make fights. If these upcoming games were taking place in the ring, the canvas would resemble a Jackson Pollock painting. Among teams who have played at least 10 games this postseason, the Thunder and Pacers are the two who play at the fastest pace. These teams‚Äîand, blessedly, their young legs‚Äîlove to run, which makes for some of the most entertaining basketball there is. The antidote to the attention span crisis is an OKC-Indy matchup, because they won‚Äôt leave any time to take your eyes off the screen.', 'If there is any time during the Finals to quickly check your phone or, I don‚Äôt know, engage with your loved ones, it‚Äôll be when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is at the free throw line. Because believe me, he will be a frequent attendee. SGA‚Äîthe principal player in the series, and maybe, at least in the vacuum of this particular season, the entire league‚Äîhas averaged 9.2 foul shots per game during the Thunder‚Äôs playoff run. The measured take is that in order to be the type of heavyweight he wants to be, Gilgeous-Alexander has to draw these whistles. His style of play utilizes an endless supply of yo-yoing drives to the rim, the type that gets a player scratched and clawed with so much regularity that you could argue a foul happens more often than not. It‚Äôs just on the referee to call them.', 'The extremist, most-irritating-guy-at-the-bar take is that Shai is an indefensible foul baiter and free throw merchant who should be ashamed of his every dribble. These are all things loudly crowed by people who are willingly missing the forest for the trees. Getting to the line is a necessary part of any MVP‚Äôs game, and just because he gets a handful of ticky tack fouls every quarter doesn‚Äôt mean that Gilgeous-Alexander is a grifter who‚Äôs in bed with the officials. It means he understands his role‚Äîwhich, at the moment, is to be the brightest player on the NBA‚Äôs brightest stage. On a wider level, the free throw conversation is the odds-on favorite to be the dominant topic of these Finals. It‚Äôs nice to have a monocultural sports thing! ‚ÄúDoes Shai need to kick his flopping addiction?‚Äù is something you can discuss with a rando at the grocery store, your grandparents, or your friend‚Äôs kid in equal aptitude. That‚Äôs what these tentpole sporting events are all about, after all: grasping onto that increasingly fleeting feeling that we‚Äôre all watching the same thing and analyzing it in similar ways.', 'Speaking of which, get ready to hear all about the Pacers‚Äô three-point shooting, especially if they go cold in Oklahoma and drop the first two games, or catch a hot streak and steal one of them. Indiana owns the best three-point percentage and offensive rating of any team that logged at least 10 playoff games, and every member of their starting lineup is more than qualified from deep. Sweet shooting‚Äîparticularly the way the Pacers do it, which is often the product of swinging ball movement that gets someone wide open‚Äîis one of the more pleasurable things to watch on a basketball court. Don‚Äôt expect Aaron Nesmith to connect on 53% of his threes like he did in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Knicks. But that barrage, plus Conference Final MVP Pascal Siakam knocking in half of his attempts, and mustachioed role player Ben Sheppard draining 55%, does prove that Indiana is capable of snapping the nets. Lightning can strike twice, and when it does, it‚Äôs a powerful way to counteract the Thunder. (By the way, Tyrese Haliburton shot uncharacteristically poorly against New York. Some positive regression to the mean is almost surely coming his way.)', 'So, we‚Äôve got green, energetic, fresh faces going at it for a championship‚Äîprepare yourself for the first firmly Gen Z Finals MVP, by the way‚Äîbut we‚Äôve also got some guys who‚Äôve been around the block. The oldest player on the Thunder, a team so complete that they can‚Äôt possibly be this young, is 31-year-old icon Alex Caruso. He is, without question, one of the more annoying players in the NBA. What I mean by that is that playing against Alex Caruso looks about as enjoyable as wrestling in a pit of quicksand. With his pestilent defense and non-stop freneticism, Caruso shadows opposing ballhandlers better than almost anyone. While the task of guarding Haliburton will mostly fall to fellow defensive stopper Luguentz Dort, there will undoubtedly be some instances where Caruso is summoned off the bench with the sole directive of pissing Haliburton off.', 'Like Caruso, the Pacers have a player in their second unit who I imagine would be flattered by the ‚Äúannoying‚Äù label. T.J. McConnell‚Äîthe lazy fan would call him a gym rat, a scrappy veteran, or a shameless instigator; the educated ball knower would call him Edie Falco‚Äôs biggest opp‚Äîis playing in his first NBA Finals after 10 full years of trying. Undrafted like Caruso, and about four inches shorter, McConnell has never met a challenge he didn‚Äôt relish. Remember in the 2015 Finals, when little guy legend Matthew Dellavedova had to be hospitalized for severe cramping, needing an IV after chasing Steph Curry around? If McConnell senses a chance to disrupt Gilgeous-Alexander all the way to a monumental upset, don‚Äôt be surprised if the Pacers install a drip bag for him right there on the bench.', 'We could go on and on about the secondary and tertiary elements that will make this series compelling for both casuals and basketball nerds alike. The fact that the league will crown its seventh different champion in the last seven years is very cool in its own right, as is the chance for both franchises to earn their first ring. (I don‚Äôt care what the NBA‚Äôs official stance on this is, the Seattle SuperSonics‚Äô 1979 championship does not count for Oklahoma City.) A win for the Thunder will validate their player development prowess. Jalen Williams‚Äîa first-time All-Star and extremely ripe second banana to Gilgeous-Alexander‚Äîis all of 24 years old. Avid reader Chet Holmgren is 23. Rotation players Jaylin Williams and Cason Wallace are 22 and 21, respectively. Oklahoma City is the only organization all four of them have ever known, and bringing home a title this soon would leave no doubt as to which team is getting the most out of its puppies.', 'In the other corner, watching Myles Turner raise a banner after a decade of steady, quietly productive grinding in Indiana would be truly touching. The Pacers can‚Äôt claim the same style of draft-picks-to-diamonds construction that got Oklahoma City to the top, but their front office‚Äôs extremely shrewd trades for Haliburton, Siakam, and Nesmith also deserve a whole acre of flowers. The head coaches‚Äô 25-year age gap (Indiana‚Äôs Rick Carlisle, boomer, bald; Oklahoma City‚Äôs Mark Daigneault, millennial, coiffed) makes for a fun aesthetic wrinkle as well. And we haven‚Äôt even talked about the omnipresent ‚ÄúYes ‚ÄòCers‚Äù shirts!', 'Should you feel inclined to bet on this series‚Äîand, I say this grimly, statistically speaking I know a lot of you will‚ÄîI‚Äôd advise you to pick OKC ten out of ten times. They were the best team in the regular season, have remained the best team in the playoffs, and have the luxury of the best player in the Finals being on their roster. It‚Äôs likely that they‚Äôll make quick work of the Pacers, but that shouldn‚Äôt damage the entertainment value of each individual contest. Either way, when all is said and done, a city in what many would consider a flyover state will be hosting its first NBA championship parade. You can complain about that city not being in a large enough media market to truly stimulate the sports economy (like a mark), or you can sit back and watch a bunch of high-level games that will conceivably end in the 120s, ushering in a new tide of basketball supremacy.', 'Call it whatever you want‚Äîjust don‚Äôt call it boring.', 'Why the Algorithm Loves Gen Z‚Äôs ‚ÄòIt Couple‚Äô Livvy Dunne and Paul Skenes', 'Welcome to the Paige Bueckers Era of March Madness', 'Can Cowboy Fever Make Bull Riding the Next UFC?', 'Inside the New Private Mountain Clubs Where Billionaires Ski', 'Novak Djokovic Conquered Tennis.

2025 NBA Finals Primer: The Thunder-Pacers Track Meet,https://www.theringer.com/2025/06/02/nba/nba-finals-preview-2025-thunder-pacers-series,"['The Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers are, in so many ways, stylistic kindred spirits. They emphasize similar things, know their own identity, boast incredible depth, and refuse to deviate from the coaching staff‚Äôs game plan regardless of how poorly things are going in the first frame‚Äîa degree of stability that can‚Äôt happen without trust and a huge reason both teams have gotten this far. ', 'Whether it‚Äôs turnovers, pace, pick-and-roll coverages, or each team‚Äôs shot diet, so many of the topics covered in this NBA Finals preview are interconnected. The series features genuine star power‚ÄîShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Williams, and Pascal Siakam‚Äîleading A+ supporting pieces who understand and accept their purpose on both ends. Roles are maximized with indispensable performers on each side, whether it‚Äôs Alex Caruso and Andrew Nembhard knowing exactly where to be on defense before the offense can get there, or Aaron Nesmith and Lu Dort assuming impossible on-ball assignments every night before they knock down a few season-saving 3s. ', 'The big difference between the two? Well, OKC is way better. The gap between the Thunder‚Äôs no. 1 regular-season net rating and the 13th-ranked Pacers‚Äô was about the same between the latter and the Charlotte Hornets. Indiana enters the Finals with this postseason‚Äôs top true shooting percentage, though, at a number (61.7 percent) that eclipses what the league-best Cleveland Cavaliers produced during the regular season. Hope springs eternal. Here are a few subplots to keep an eye on throughout the series, as well as my prediction. ', 'More on the NBA Finals', 'There‚Äôs No Right Way to Build an NBA Contender Anymore', 'The Thrill of Watching the Thunder Grow Up', 'Indiana‚Äôs Finals Run, Knicks Summer Strategy, and ‚ÄòInside the NBA‚Äô', 'The Unlikely Symmetry of SGA and Haliburton', '', '', '', '', '', 'In myriad ways, speed will define these Finals. Can the Pacers turn every game into a track meet and catapult themselves from one baseline to the other off of made and missed shots? It‚Äôs a fascinating question against a stingy Thunder defense that does a great job of getting back in transition. According to Cleaning the Glass, OKC finished the regular season ranked second in opponent transition frequency and second in transition points added per 100 possessions. In the playoffs, they‚Äôve done an even better job of limiting those opportunities and have allowed the second-fewest fast-break points. ', 'Here‚Äôs where things get even more interesting: The only team that ranks ahead of OKC in most of those categories? The Pacers! This matters because no team, including zippy Indiana, has registered a quicker offensive pace than the Thunder. Sure, Indy thrives in chaos. But OKC was born in it. Molded by it. Pure velocity is its ally. ', 'It‚Äôs not entirely because of the Thunder‚Äôs elite defense, either. Name the situation‚Äîafter made field goals, made free throws, dead balls, missed midrange jumpers, etc.‚Äîand they‚Äôre flying out of it. The Thunder might be even more proficient than the Pacers at running their opponent into the ground. They average a playoff-best 142 points per 100 transition plays and are young, deep, and athletic enough to sustain that tempo until the other team wilts. ', 'Even though Indiana gets the ball past half court with 20 or more seconds on the shot clock on nearly 73.5 percent of its possessions‚Äîa substantial playoff high, per Sportradar‚Äîthat up-and-down pace isn‚Äôt the only type of hurry OKC needs to worry about. The Pacers averaged the fewest seconds and dribbles per touch during the regular season. In the playoffs, only the Golden State Warriors were more eager to share the ball. Even in the half court, Indy‚Äôs actions are a blur.  ', '', '', 'There are so many ripple effects when two teams are able and willing to run themselves ragged. How deep will each bench go? Will Rick Carlisle and Mark Daigneault fiddle with 10-man rotations in the NBA freaking Finals? And if it‚Äôs a long series, how exhausted will so many important players on both sides be as they near the end of the longest season they‚Äôve ever played? Do we get an Isaiah Joe or Jarace Walker game‚Äîassuming Walker‚Äôs healthy enough to play after injuring his ankle in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals‚Äîor [crosses fingers] will there be another unfortunate injury caused by all this haste that will tilt the outcome?', 'Will applying full-court pressure on Jalen Williams, Gilgeous-Alexander, and the rest of OKC‚Äôs ball handlers backfire against Indiana, or disrupt and wear down an offense that‚Äôs relatively ineffective in the muck? The Thunder are averaging 97.3 points per 100 half-court plays in the playoffs, which is very good but ranks fifth and is down from the 104.6 they generated during the regular season. (The Pacers rank first, at 105.7.)', 'Which team will do a better job of taking advantage of/limiting inevitable cross matches? OKC‚Äôs adaptability in real time is part of the reason it is so good in transition. That‚Äôs not ideal for Siakam, who dined on easy kick-ahead buckets in the conference finals. (In the regular season‚ÄîOKC was 2-0 against Indiana‚Äîthe Thunder were fine putting Williams on Myles Turner and Isaiah Hartenstein on Siakam; Chet Holmgren didn‚Äôt play in either game.) On the other end, Indy would rather get back than go to the offensive glass. But, still, how often can the Thunder catch poorer defenders like Haliburton, T.J. McConnell, or Obi Toppin with a mismatch in the open floor? ', 'Will Indy‚Äôs pace force the Thunder to downsize and play more lineups with Cason Wallace, Caruso, or Aaron Wiggins instead of two bigs? Does Daigneault change his starting lineup or begin second halves with Hartenstein on the bench (as he‚Äôs already done in these playoffs)? ', 'Regardless of how the answers to these questions shake out, the aesthetic highs in this Finals should be breathtaking. One way or another, many, many, many points will be scored. ', 'Both of these teams are diehard believers in the possession game. Both take care of the ball and do a tremendous job of capitalizing off the turnovers they force. This season, Oklahoma City was first in turnover rate‚Äîincluding a tight 6.4 percent in two games against the Pacers, its lowest mark against any opponent‚Äîwhile Indiana finished third. ', 'On the playoff leaderboard, Gilgeous-Alexander, Holmgren, and J-Dub all rank in the top 20 for turnover percentage. The Pacers, meanwhile, rank first in assist-to-turnover ratio. Siakam hardly ever coughs it up, and Haliburton might be the most trustworthy point guard in the league. ', 'On defense, the Thunder are obsessed with (and exceptional at) ending their opponent‚Äôs set with a fast break the other way. They have 30 more steals than any other team in the playoffs, and the runner-up, New York, played two more games. It‚Äôs a corrosive, corruptive, psyche-dismantling approach. Thunder defenders live in gaps, with opportunistic hawks like Williams, Wallace, and Caruso bobbing between their man, the paint, and the ball. As a collective, they don‚Äôt allow much airspace (Dort in particular) and do a tremendous job of applying pressure on the outside as elite rim protectors anchor the lane. Hands are everywhere. Arms are wide. Blow-bys are accounted for and snuffed out. Double-teams and help-the-helper rotations are perfectly timed, executed as if all five teammates share the same brain. ', 'OKC led the league in points off turnovers and fewest points allowed off turnovers. It also committed at least one fewer turnover than its opponent in a league-high 75 games this season. The only team in NBA history that sits above the Thunder here is the 1988 Denver Nuggets, at 76 games. (The Pacers ranked third this season, at 66 games.) Having an MVP who efficiently averaged well over 32 points a night is very cool and important, but the Thunder are a historically dominant team because they scrap and claw and maul their way to more bites at the apple than their opponent.', 'It sounds reductive to claim that whichever team makes fewer mistakes (and is best able to exploit the other team‚Äôs errors) will raise its franchise‚Äôs first championship banner, but when it‚Äôs all said and done, that may be what happens. And, because OKC has a significant defensive edge and makes every opponent forget how to dribble and/or pass for quarters at a time, it‚Äôs easy to see why Indy‚Äôs margin for error in this particular matchup barely fits inside a thimble.', 'Normally, the Pacers love to cram defenses in a nutribullet. They sprint the floor, identify a mismatch, force a rotation, then start popping the ball around until someone gets an open shot. It‚Äôs relentless, selfless, kaleidoscopic basketball deployed with a random flurry of drives, cuts, screens, and dribble handoffs. Can they sustain it with the degree of manipulation that got them here against one of the most suffocating, versatile, and aggressive defenses the league has ever seen? Plays like this, where the Thunder can switch everything off-ball, help if need be, and get Indy late in the shot clock, are exactly what the Pacers do not want to see:', 'Indy moves the ball a ton, but it does so with restraint, leveraging the confusion caused by all its screens and man movement to its advantage via low-risk passes that rarely appear premeditated. According to Sportradar, the Pacers average at least four passes in 22.5 percent of their possessions (a playoff high). Their turnover rate on these plays is 8.8 percent. For most teams in this situation, the vault is cracked open. The Pacers make you breach a second padlock. ', 'Can they deploy the style that got them here without unnecessarily getting their pockets picked half a dozen times? Or, can they shift even more responsibility onto Haliburton‚Äôs lap, apply pressure, and generate the same quality looks? If the answer to both questions is no, it‚Äôs almost impossible to picture Indiana keeping these Finals competitive, let alone pulling off the massive upset and winning it all. ', 'Everyone loves to talk about 3-point variance, and it‚Äôs irrefutably important for both teams to knock down quality looks when they appear. But 2-point jump shot variance is a thing, too! The Pacers are in the Finals because they feast from the midrange: 12.1 percent of their shots are 2-pointers outside the paint‚Äîan area of the floor most defenses are happy to concede‚Äîand they‚Äôre making 47.4 percent of them.', 'There are 21 players in the playoffs who‚Äôve taken at least 20 midrange shots; four of the five most accurate play for the Pacers: McConnell is at 75 percent, Haliburton is at 53.3, Turner is at 52.0, and Nembhard is at 49.0. Sixth on that list is SGA, at 47.9 percent on far more attempts than anybody else; J-Dub‚Äôs ability to snake a pick-and-roll and consistently pull up from a spot at which he‚Äôs comfortable is an unavoidable gut punch that makes the Thunder feel invincible every time it goes in (which is often). ', 'This isn‚Äôt a plea for the Pacers to seek out long 2s. Those attempts are yielding 0.94 points per shot right now, while 3s have earned them 1.23 (both marks lead the playoffs), but if Indiana is going to pierce OKC‚Äôs armor‚Äîan elite defense that can pack the paint and make 3-point shooters flinch‚Äîit‚Äôll need to convert the relatively inefficient looks that helped get it this far, whether open or contested. ', 'That means Turner needs to hit those bank shots out of a short roll when the Thunder put two on the ball. It means Siakam has to make the baseline fallaways and mid-post turnarounds when he‚Äôs guarded by a smaller defender. It means Haliburton and Nembhard have to cash out after they create space with a stepback. By and large, the Pacers aren‚Äôt uncomfortable with these shots. They‚Äôve made 23 more of them than any other playoff team after finishing fourth in total attempts and sixth in accuracy during the regular season. If they want to keep games within striking distance, they can‚Äôt afford to miss way more of them than they make over the next three weeks. ', 'Related ‚Ä¶', 'The Thunder allowed more corner 3s than any other defense during the regular season. This is a seemingly painful trade-off that spills down from their fundamental decision to regularly help off the perimeter and pack the paint. They swarm, blitz, double-team, show bodies, and then sprint out to contest shots with long, fast, smart defenders. ', 'In theory, this is a risk. In theory, an elite 3-point shooting team should be able to punish them for it. Indiana has as good a chance as anyone to be that team. The Pacers have been unconscious from the corner throughout these playoffs, nailing 46.9 percent of their shots while generating them at a decent clip. ', 'If this is something OKC is genuinely concerned about, the Thunder have enough flexibility to scrap their base scheme and still be a brick wall. They can switch across the board, stay home, and still bother drives at the basket without much help. But they won‚Äôt deprioritize the paint or tamp down their aggression along the perimeter until Indiana makes them. ', 'The Pacers shot 53.8 percent from the corners against OKC during the regular season and lost both games. When I say their margin for error is microscopic, this is what I mean. When the Thunder put two on the ball, Indy hit the roll man, forced a rotation, and then kicked it out for an open look. If there was any miscommunication or hesitation on the Thunder‚Äôs part‚Äîin the second play seen below, J-Dub doesn‚Äôt pressure the ball and Joe doesn‚Äôt immediately scram switch with Hartenstein out of the mismatch‚ÄîIndiana capitalized.', 'That level of precision must carry over for the entire series, both in the half court and when they find open shooters in transition. The open floor must be their best friend. The Pacers have now finished 11 playoff games with more assisted corner 3s than the other team. They‚Äôve won all of them. ', 'If Haliburton can‚Äôt be the Generation Z iteration of Steve Nash who just buzz-sawed through three straight teams with elite vision, rhythmic control, and three-level shot-making, Indiana is screwed. A lot of that will come down to his decisions out of the pick-and-roll. When these two teams squared off during the regular season, Oklahoma City mixed in different coverages while primarily switching the screener‚Äôs defender‚Äîoften Hartenstein‚Äîonto Haliburton: ', 'Ceding a mismatch is not OKC‚Äôs style, but the Thunder clearly didn‚Äôt want to put themselves in rotation and let Haliburton carve them up with his passing. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how often that strategy occurs in the Finals. Dort, Caruso, Wallace, and Williams have had immense success in these playoffs at the point of attack; if Hartenstein‚Äôs man sets a ball screen and they don‚Äôt want to change their matchup, they won‚Äôt. (OKC can also just move Hartenstein around‚Äîmaybe put him on Nesmith instead of Turner?‚Äîor simply utilize smaller lineups.)', 'There‚Äôs no obvious target for Haliburton to go after (assuming Joe‚Äôs minutes align with when Haliburton rests) in this series. Jalen Brunson, Darius Garland, and Damian Lillard aren‚Äôt walking through that door. But one wrinkle to keep an eye on is Holmgren, who, again, did not face Indiana in the regular season. It‚Äôll be interesting to see who Chet guards, how often Haliburton uses his man to set a screen, and how, tactically, it‚Äôs defended. Will the Thunder switch, blitz, drop back, or stay up to touch? Will they mix in some zone, as they did a little bit back in December? ', 'Generally, what do the Thunder even want to accomplish? Would they prefer Haliburton be forced to repeatedly attack one-on-one? Or would they rather see Nembhard, Siakam, or McConnell grab the steering wheel as Hali is removed from the equation as often as possible? ', 'The Pacers have a say in all this, of course. They can set screens closer to half court, run double drags, use Haliburton as the back screener in a stack pick-and-roll, and show why they‚Äôre one of the most creative offenses in the league. Creating good shots out of these actions, with their best player at the helm, is important in a series that feels lopsided heading in. For now, though, it doesn‚Äôt lack intrigue. ', 'The Pacers glide into the Finals on a magic carpet ride. They‚Äôre easy to root for and embrace a style of play that‚Äôs fulfilling, inexhaustible, and pleasing to the eye. Everything about their run is remarkable, and, if you don‚Äôt think Haliburton is a top-10 player, it‚Äôs virtually unprecedented in the modern era. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre about to run into a healthy, stacked, superior version of what they see in the mirror. ', 'According to recent NBA history, every champion who was expected to wear the crown for the foreseeable future‚Äîthe Lakers, Bucks, Nuggets, and Celtics‚Äîwere one-and-done instead. But the Thunder may have the ingredients‚Äîyouth, depth, foresight, talent, and luck‚Äîto buck that trend. Every so often a team comes along that‚Äôs special enough to bend every other aspirational franchise‚Äôs path to the top into a cul-de-sac. Oklahoma City appears to be that team.

The eventual winner will have the lowest average age of any NBA champion since 1980.', 'This isn‚Äôt pure coincidence. The league‚Äôs collective bargaining agreement dictates how much money players can earn at various points of their careers, and a\nsecond apron rule\nintroduced in the last\nCBA\ncomplicates dynastic ambitions for teams with veteran cores. The youth of the Thunder and Pacers is fundamental to their balance sheets.', 'Here are some key numbers about the Thunder and Pacers rosters:', '24.7 ‚Äì The average age of the Thunder, weighted by playoff minutes, according to Basketball Reference (ages are as of Feb. 1 for apples-to-apples comparisons across seasons). The 1977 Portland Trail Blazers were a tad younger at 24.5 years, but the only other champion since the NBA/ABA merger younger than the Thunder or 2025 Pacers (26.2) was the 1980 Los Angeles Lakers (25.7).', '', '$169.1 million ‚Äì The total payroll for the 2025 Pacers, per Spotrac, which ranked 18th in the NBA and below the luxury tax threshold of $170.8 million. The Thunder paid $165.6 million in salaries (25th) and also remained below the threshold.', 'Historically, teams have had to shell out more money to win. This is the first NBA Finals in the past two decades in which neither team paid the luxury tax, and 14 of the last 18 champions paid some tax, a much higher percentage than the roughly one-quarter of teams that pay it each season.', 'Both of this season‚Äôs finalists get major contributions from players on cheap rookie deals. Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams earned just $4.8 million this year. Fellow starter Chet Holmgren is also a bargain at $10.9 million. Andrew Nembhard, who was selected in the second round of the 2022 NBA Draft and is the third-leading Pacer in playoff minutes, was paid $2 million.', '$42.2 million ‚Äì The salary for Indiana‚Äôs Pascal Siakam and\nTyrese Haliburton\nthis season, who are tied as the highest-earners in this series but just the 19th-highest among all NBA players. NBA MVP\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\nof Oklahoma City made $35.9 million, having signed his rookie contract extension two summers prior to Haliburton.', 'SGA and Haliburton each signed for the maximum amount allowed by the league‚Äôs rules, which is 30% of the salary cap. Only players with at least 10 years of service can be paid up to 35% of the cap, except for players who meet certain awards criteria after their eighth or ninth season.', '', 'Haliburton and SGA are in their fifth and seventh seasons, respectively, allowing their franchises the financial flexibility to build robust rosters without an albatross contract gumming up the cap sheet. The Pacers, for instance, traded for Siakam during the 2023-24 season and then re-signed him as a free agent over the offseason. The Thunder were able to make a $29 million per year free agent offer to starting center Isaiah Hartenstein last summer.', 'The past two NBA champions were developed with similar timelines. The Denver Nuggets won the title in 2023, the year before Nikola Jokiƒá‚Äôs salary shot up to $47.6 million, and the Boston Celtics won in 2024, the year before Jaylen Brown‚Äôs cap hit rose to $49.2 million under his new supermax contract.

This is the first year going back to at least 1991 that the Finals featured two of the league‚Äôs 10 least valuable franchises, using Forbes‚Äô valuations for seasons prior to 2020.', 'Valuations are highly correlated with market size.
