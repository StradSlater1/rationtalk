I Played Switch 2's Launch Games: What to Look Forward to After June 5 Release Day,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/i-played-switch-2s-launch-games-what-to-look-forward-to-after-june-5-release-day/,"['', '', '', '', '', ""As Switch 2 launch day looms, here's what to expect from my experience previewing the launch games lineup."", 'Mario Kart World on the Switch 2: Enough to consider an upgrade?', ""The Nintendo Switch 2's launch date is still June 5, and despite earlier tariff-related concerns, the price is holding steady at $450 (or $500 bundled with Mario Kart World). Once you've secured a new console of your own, the next question is which games and accessories to pick up. After playing all the new titles at a special media preview event, I was surprised not just by the new offerings, but also by the new ways of interacting with them."", ""For example, pushing my hands around a fabric-covered table while holding two mouse controllers is surprisingly tiring. I was playing Drag x Drive, a new wheelchair sports game coming for the Nintendo Switch 2 that uses one of the console's new features: Joy-Cons, which work like computer mice. I felt vibrations under my hands as though I was spinning my wheels. But I wondered: Who will play the Switch 2 while seated at a table? I realized later that you can also rub them on your pants legs to make them work. So I did that, too. It was a little less tiring. "", ""This was just one weird part of a long day playing the Nintendo Switch 2, the $450 sequel to one of Nintendo's most popular game consoles ever, arriving June 5, with preorders opening April 24. I've loved playing games on the Switch, like many people. However, the Switch 2, while being a new console, feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own. "", 'Much like the case with PlayStation 5 or the Xbox Series X, Nintendo is betting that playing games that look a little better matters enough to upgrade. But the company is also laying down some side bets on new features that could make a difference: in-game voice chat with friends at the press of a button, a plug-in camera that can work with wacky party games and, yeah, new controllers that double as mice.', ""So here's the question: Is this more fun than the existing Switch and its games? I'd say the Switch 2 is a better piece of hardware, no doubt, but the upgrade proposition feels pretty uncertain until Nintendo shows many more games that make it worth it."", 'The Switch 2 feels big, for sure, but not that much bigger than the Switch OLED.', ""That said, the Switch 2, as a bigger, better version of the existing Switch, could make a lot of sense for folks who can afford it, especially because there's still nothing quite like it out there. At $450 (¬£395, AU$699), plus $70 or $80 for its two biggest launch-window games, Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, this is an expensive proposition for any family right now. A CNET survey recently found that affordability is the top concern for US gamers considering the purchase. Then again, as a handheld game console with its own included dock that can also play games in 4K on a TV, it's actually competitively priced versus the Steam Deck and Windows gaming handhelds. "", ""I played Mario Kart World. I played Donkey Kong Bananza. I played remastered versions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land. I played Cyberpunk 2077 and Split Fiction. And I played Mario Party Jamboree with new mouse-Joy-Con and camera-optional modes that projected me onto the TV. It was all fun, and the Switch 2 is the handheld I'd prefer to play my library of Switch games on. But I don't think it's a necessary upgrade for anyone right now. Still, your kids will probably ask for Mario Kart World and a Switch 2."", 'The 7.9-inch display is a welcome upgrade (for me).', ""The Switch 2 is big and feels dense. It's not that much bigger than the Switch OLED, to me, but that larger 7.9-inch screen feels welcome. I play on a large Steam Deck a lot lately and the Switch 2 feels sort of like that but actually thinner. It's about the same thickness as the Switch in casual holding-and-looking comparisons. "", ""The Switch 2 has an LCD, not OLED, like the last iteration of the Switch, which went on sale in 2021. But honestly, it looked great to me in the hours I tried it. The 1080p resolution, HDR capabilities and refresh rate that can go up to 120Hz, depending on the game, stood out while playing. I'd take this over the Switch OLED display right now."", ""The larger Joy-Cons now magnetically snap in and out but have little release buttons on the back. They snap in smoothly and then you eject them with the trigger release and remove them. It's a smooth action and a lot easier than pressing that small button on the current Switch Joy-Cons. The controllers, although feeling sturdy, have a surprisingly similar feel. The analog sticks felt like existing Joy-Cons and the buttons clicked similarly. I'm bummed that there's no analog rear trigger."", 'The Switch 2 Joy-Con, with its new C button.', ""Instead, these triggers click just like the older Switch -- something that the Switch 2's producers and directors, in a roundtable chat during my New York demo day, said was decided upon because they offer a more immediate response in games. I think it's a miss because every other console I've played has analog triggers and they work well. Putting analog triggers on a Switch 2 would have made previous Switch games feel different on the Switch 2, though, and maybe that's where the challenge lay."", 'The C button on the right Joy-Con launches Game Chat, a new mode that allows four-player audio chats with trusted Switch friends (that can be parent-approved). These chats can also become grainy video chats with an optional plug-in camera that can be used with the Switch when docked. Nintendo sells its own stand-like camera for $50 but you could also use a third-party camera (mileage may vary, according to Nintendo). ', 'The new Switch 2 camera plugs in and can be used for games or video chats.', ""I didn't get to try Game Chat during the demo day but I'm curious about how good the audio quality and noise cancellation are. Nintendo says it's good enough to filter around room noise while talking from across the room. The Switch 2 has a microphone but the Joy-Cons don't. A new $80 Switch 2 Pro Controller, which feels similar to the previous Switch Pro Controller with two added rear paddle buttons, does have a headphone jack that can be used to connect a microphone-enabled headset."", ""The new Switch 2 dock has its own fan system and looks chunky. It'll sit near a TV so you probably won't mind but it's a bigger unit than before and, like several accessories, won't work with the first-gen Switch. It enables 4K gaming modes on TVs, though, so that's the reason."", 'The Switch 2 kickstand is pretty flexible.', ""There's a new Switch 2 kickstand, which tilts at a wider range of angles. But it's made of plastic and feels a bit flimsier than I expected, although it holds its position well. And there are two USB-C ports now -- one on top, one on bottom -- but it turns out the top port won't do video-out. Nintendo's creative team told me at a developer roundtable that there are no plans to support plug-in display glasses such as the Xreal One, a trick the Steam Deck and Windows handhelds can pull off. "", ""I like the way the Switch 2 feels, though. It seems like it'll be easier to travel with than Windows handhelds and the Steam Deck, which have bulky side grips that add to the system's case size needs. The Switch 2 rides somewhat flat, although it's bigger and longer."", 'OK, at this point, you\'re probably saying, ""Scott, please, just talk about the games."" So, I played each game in roughly 20-minute sessions as we were shuttled around different stations in the New York exhibition space that will host the public Switch 2 Experience. It\'ll work similarly at other Switch 2 Experience locations, too.', ""I thought I won in Mario Kart, but I didn't."", 'I have no idea how big Mario Kart World is. I drove around freely for a few minutes before a race mode started and I madly rambled from a town to a farm to an arena to mountain roads, jumped on train tracks, hopped on a power line and rode it up in the air, knocked down a lot of fences and found some sinister Bowser-ish castle. The newest Mario Kart game, a Switch 2 exclusive and launch title, is clearly the ""game to get."" What I love is the sense that this racing game could be as full of surprises as an open-world Mario game.', ""It's Grand Theft Mario or Mario Horizon or whatever you want to call it. This open expanse game's real estate makes it far vaster than existing Mario Karts. But I played two races, mostly. I don't even remember exactly what the course looked like because I was so busy navigating against 23 other players. The 24-player gameplay is new and, combined with wider, more expansive-feeling tracks, it's a lot to take in. There are a lot of new characters to choose from -- I picked Luigi with a gondolier outfit and later a hamburger-hatted Toad and Donkey Kong with battle armor. There are bikes, cars and all sorts of other familiar vehicles."", ""A new knockout tournament mode has players racing across multiple tracks in a world-spanning rally to win. You're eliminated if you're in the bottom four. I thought I came in first and got way too excited but I was one lap short of the actual end. I came in 16th. Competitiveness in a field full of this many cars reaches total absurdity."", ""I want to play more. The game looks great and handles like classic Mario Kart but it's the extras that make me curious."", ""Nintendo doesn't have a new 3D Mario game for the Switch 2 yet but Donkey Kong Bananza looks like a solid replacement. It's the first open-world (sensing a theme here?) Donkey Kong game in years. It's also a Switch 2 exclusive, coming July 17. Nobody saw this game coming (well, almost nobody) and I liked what I tried."", ""The game's biggest mechanic is digging and destroying nearly everything. Donkey Kong can burrow through walls or the ground and, depending on the level, you can burrow far. I started digging into a wall in my first cave-like level, got lost in my tunneling, then burst out again. Some areas have you digging all the way down to new depths, almost like Tears of the Kingdom (but not really). Where does the madness end?"", ""Donkey Kong is full of goofy expressions and enemies look dynamic in a way that feels almost like Sony's Ratchet and Clank games. It's a loud and fun action adventure but I have no idea how long the game actually is. It did showcase a lot more particles of stuff flying around than the older Switch has pulled off and the graphics kept a crisp frame rate."", ""My 20 minutes or so with Metroid Prime 4 made me realize how good Switch 2 games could look. Running at 1080p and 120Hz on a big TV, it moved extremely smoothly and was as impressive a shooter as I've ever seen on a Nintendo console. From landing on a barren planet to firing through waves of creatures, rolling around in ball mode and losing a tough battle against a big ugly boss, it won me over."", 'I played on TV mode only, using the Joy-Cons in standard controller mode and then a mouse-and-controller mode. You can put one Joy-Con down at any time and make it a mouse for controlling movement, just like on a PC. I loved the fast reaction feel of it and I also liked that I could just lift my hand up and go back to analog stick controls if I changed my mind midstream.', ""I was expecting a dose of the weird at Nintendo's Switch 2 event but this wasn't it. Still, the idea of a Welcome Tour isn't bad. Much like Valve's Aperture Desk Job and the PlayStation 5's Astro's Playroom (or several tutorial apps for the Meta Quest), this looks like a guided tour of the Switch 2's features, complete with insights from Nintendo and mini-games. I played a few, some of which were more like glorified demos at best. "", 'I dodged asteroids using a Joy-Con in mouse mode, played the first level of Super Mario Bros. in pixel-accurate mode on a 4K TV setting to show how much screen real estate is available and played a guessing game for what frame rate a bouncing ball was moving at. One ""game"" showed me HDR on and off while launching fireworks. The problem is, this is a paid digital game, instead of the freebie it clearly should have been. I can\'t understand why this probably helpful system tutorial isn\'t just included on the Switch 2 and I never will.', 'We held and used Joy-Cons as mice during our game demos. Fun, but you need a table (unless you use them on your legs).', 'Somewhere between Arms and Rocket League, Drag x Drive is a Switch 2 exclusive that uses the Joy-Cons in mouse mode to control wheelchair-using players in an intense hoop-shooting sports game. Moving each wheel requires pushing one Joy-Con forward and backward. It gets intense fast. ', 'The feeling ends up being a bit like rowing and my arms tired out; you have to keep wheeling around and moving your arms rapidly, pretty much nonstop. One neat thing is you can feel rumbling haptic clicks beneath your controllers as you ""wheel,"" making it feel more convincing. Racing to the ball, hitting other players and shooting baskets felt as chaotic as a game of Rocket League. I\'m not sure if I\'ll ever find this game fun to play because of its seemingly high exertion requirements but I enjoyed trying it for a while.', 'Mario Party Jamboree uses the Switch 2 camera to project yourself into the game.', ""The most wacky stuff I tried were probably the new mini-games for the Switch 2 update of Mario Party Jamboree, which add mini-games that work with the Joy-Cons' new mouse features and a game mode that uses the optional plug-in camera."", 'Bridget Carey and I revved little wind-up cars by pulling back on the Joy-Con mouse and releasing it to launch forward, with vibrating haptics to add clicking feedback. We played air hockey by pushing our Mouse-Cons around the table to hit the Koopa shells flying back and forth. And then we screamed and danced and balanced shells on our heads in camera mini-games that made us look like we were transported into Mario Party, popping out of warp pipes.', ""The camera-based games were flashbacks to the days when the PlayStation had a TV camera and the Xbox had the Kinect, which both did similar things. It was definitely fun and it makes Mario Party Jamboree even better but I don't know how much I'd feel compelled to play the new modes long-term."", 'Playing Tears of the Kingdom on the Switch 2: better, by degrees.', 'I played a handful of games optimized for the Switch 2, which will be sold in Switch 2 Editions at a higher price or existing game owners can buy a digital upgrade. The upgrades can be free in some cases if you have the Nintendo Switch Online Plus membership, while others will cost you extra, regardless.', ""Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Switch's two epic Zeldas, both have Switch 2 upgrades I briefly played. For sure, they look better, with better frame rates. I'd prefer to play them this way but the difference wasn't massive. The Switch 2 versions also gain compatibility with a new phone app companion called Zelda Notes that we didn't get to demo. "", 'Kirby and the Forgotten Land has a new story mode and better-looking graphics on Switch 2. I had fun playing a bit of the new storyline, which involved a lot of freezing-up landscapes. Is it worth the upgrade price? Maybe, because it also has some DLC extras.', 'F-Zero GX on GameCube... (Make a new F-Zero, please.)', ""Nintendo is adding another bonus to the Switch 2 equation with a Nintendo GameCube virtual console library. It's part of the Switch Online Plus Expansion Pack subscription but Switch owners cannot play those GameCube games."", ""There are only a few GameCube games expected at the Switch 2 launch but I gave a few a quick play to remind myself of when I played them back in my own GameCube days: Wind Waker and F-Zero GX. Wind Waker is a classic Zelda and I loved F-Zero GX, which was co-developed by Sega. It still feels ridiculously fast. Nintendo's selling a GameCube wireless controller, which I also tried out. The buttons and sticks feel just like they used to."", ""Part of the Switch 2's appeal to other non-Nintendo gamers is its ability to play games that PC, Xbox and PlayStation folks could play but Switch owners couldn't. Elden Ring, Madden, Cyberpunk 2077 and Split Fiction are some of the biggest newcomers. The performance, from my quick early plays, was a mixed bag. Split Fiction is a hit co-op game that debuted this year and I love it on the Switch but the split-screen gameplay I tried had less than stellar frame rates and graphics quality. It was fun but didn't look beautiful. "", ""Cyberpunk 2077 shows off sprawling cityscapes but again, on a big TV, it was clearly not as good as what you could get from a PS5 or Xbox. Madden and Elden Ring weren't there."", ""I know what playing games like these feels like on handhelds, though. The Steam Deck already has Elden Ring, Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077 support. The Switch 2 looks like a strong competitor to the Steam Deck and current Windows gaming handhelds for a wave of third-party games that'll finally play decently. Still, I'm not sure how much it'll convince Steam Deck owners or Windows handheld owners as the whole appeal of those systems is they'll play PC games you already own."", ""It shows some promise for the Switch 2 being a step up for playing current-gen games but Nintendo didn't share any details on how powerful the Nvidia processor onboard is. It's capable of ray tracing and can upscale game graphics but what are the limits?"", ""I wanted more from the Switch 2. More surprises, more wow factor. It easily looks like the best Switch upgrade since 2017. And yet why do I feel like it's not a must-buy yet? Because the games, as fun as they were, weren't doing anything totally new. Because Nintendo raised prices for a lot of things, including more expensive games, Switch 2 Edition modes and even that tutorial game. And because, well, the world's not in a great economic place right now."", ""I still want one and want to play Nintendo's new games, though. Nintendo brings joy and unique experiences.

"After Living Through Overnight Stays To Get a Wii and OG Switch, Getting a Switch 2 This Morning Was Surprisingly Simple",https://www.vice.com/en/article/after-living-through-overnight-stays-to-get-a-wii-og-switch-getting-a-switch-2-this-morning-was-surprisingly-simple/,"['Newsletters', 'Getting a Nintendo Switch 2 was tremendously easier than I could have imagined it would be. I‚Äôm still in shock, to be honest.', 'By Shaun Cichacki', 'November 19, 2006. March 3, 2017. As a Nintendo fanboy, these two particular release dates were monumental. These days marked the release of the revolutionary Nintendo Wii and the sleek and stylish Nintendo Switch. But more importantly, they were some of the most terrifying days for those hoping to get their hands on the newest Nintendo consoles. Wiis were out of stock everywhere, even if you camped out overnight. Switches were going for double or triple their MSRP on eBay. That‚Äôs why I feared the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, a system I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to preorder.', 'Until I walked into a Target at roughly 11AM CST and just‚Ä¶ bought it off the shelf. I‚Äôve never had the luxury of getting a Nintendo console on the launch day before, but that changed today.', 'FOMO is one hell of a thing. As someone interested, but not necessarily needing a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, I watched my social media feed fill up with folks excitedly bragging about their new purchase. My TikTok feed was filling up with gameplay clips of Mario Kart World, and I finally broke. My will was shattered, and I started checking online to see if there were any in stock. GameStop? Nothing, except for a massively overpriced bundle that came with a lot of accessories I would never use. Walmart? No luck on my end, but kudos to those who got their deliveries nice and early, with a Coke and Pringles to snack on. Best Buy? Nada. But then, that little red Target came to mind.', 'I checked their website, once again disheartened to see that the Switch 2 was not available online. But a small glimmer of hope arose within me. I noticed, at a store roughly an hour away from me, they had them in stock. Five bundles of the Mario Kart World / Switch 2. I called the store to verify this and headed out. As you can see, I wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to snag one of the Mario Kart World bundles. Some of the locals must have gotten their hands on them first. Hopefully, genuine fans and not someone trying to make a quick buck. But regular consoles without the bundled game? They had dozens of them. I left, shopping bag, Switch 2, and a physical copy of Mario Kart World in hand, and my first successful Nintendo product launch in my pocket.', 'When the Nintendo Wii first launched, I was only 14 years old. While we didn‚Äôt have the funds to get one at launch, my Dad took me to, ironically enough, a Target to try and secure a console for me about a week after. We waited ‚Äî coffee in his hands, hot cocoa in mine ‚Äî in the cold Wisconsin weather for the store to open. We were assured that they had Wiis in stock, but they were moving fast. He waited in line in the electronics department, completely out of his element.', 'I was busy looking at the Wii games, particularly The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. As the line slowly moved forward, I heard the booming voice of my Dad yelling at someone. They were trying to purchase the last few Wii consoles that Target had in stock, and he was threatening to kick their ass if they did so. Needless to say, I left that day with a shiny new Nintendo Wii in hand, alongside my copy of Twilight Princess.', 'Similar to the Wii, my brother had scoured the internet in search of a Nintendo Switch shortly after launch. He wanted to get me one for my birthday, and after finding someone on eBay selling theirs for only $100 over MSRP, which was a steal at the time, I had my Nintendo Switch in hand on March 12, 2017. Today marks the start of a new era. Much like my original Nintendo Wii that my Dad almost fist-fought someone for, I‚Äôll hold onto my original Nintendo Switch for as long as I live.', 'It‚Äôs a cherished piece of my life, getting me through countless memories. While I have the new Nintendo Switch 2 in my life now, I‚Äôll still revisit this console as time goes on. Happy to relive the memories of a time that once was. Exactly as I do when I boot up Wii Sports to play with my family.', '', 'BY ANTHONY FRANKLIN II', 'BY SHAUN CICHACKI', 'BY VERONICA BOOTH', 'BY LUIS PRADA', 'BY SHAUN CICHACKI', 'BY LUIS PRADA', 'By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from VICE Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.', 'BY SHAUN CICHACKI', 'BY ANTHONY FRANKLIN II', 'BY SHAUN CICHACKI', 'BY LUIS PRADA']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHdlbWhsV0hSdU5YaFJZVkZ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZWmc0NXJ0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df

Neither did it explain why critics can‚Äôt be trusted to cover products with knowledge that additional functionality will be patched later, as they‚Äôre frequently used to.', 'How and when game creators decide to distribute their review products is, of course, their prerogative, and the media has no right to early samples. Game coverage has also changed drastically over the past decade, with more priority given to post-release coverage of today‚Äôs increasingly complex video games.', 'But a lack of coverage at or before release is bad for you, our readers. When Switch 2 arrives, there will have been no reviews of its software, no analysis of its hardware performance or battery life, or any testing of its key features, such as Game Chat, or how backwards compatible Switch 1 games perform. No hidden gems will be unearthed, and no potential dodgy ports highlighted, before you have a chance of spending your hard-earned money.', 'And when reviews do arrive, well after launch day, many critics will have been incentivized to rush through their games as quickly as possible, with Google and social media rewarding speed over quality.', 'For Nintendo, this won‚Äôt matter. Its launch allocation of Switch 2 consoles will almost certainly sell out to early adopters, who are not as concerned with the critical consensus as they might have been in years past. Publications like VGC will continue to cover the console anyway, after Switch 2 goes on sale.', 'For the media, of course, it‚Äôs disappointing. It‚Äôs a tough time for all independent publications, which is why we‚Äôre increasingly calling for readers to support us via Patreon, and with both GTA 6 and pre-launch Switch 2 review coverage now off the table, 2025 just got a bit tougher for everybody.', 'It also means that, like other sites ‚Äì including the very biggest ‚Äì we‚Äôll now need to juggle our Switch 2 review coverage with one of the biggest events of the year, Summer Game Fest, which takes place during this launch weekend, which Nintendo will have been well aware of.', 'But it‚Äôs not just the media that misses out: more than 20 Switch 2 launch games from third parties have now effectively been prevented from generating any day-one review coverage for their titles. Many publishers have reached out to sites like VGC asking for clarification around when the press would receive review units, and some even said they wished they‚Äôd chosen to release their games later, after it became clear they would not be able to secure authentic editorial coverage at all.', '‚ÄúWhen Switch 2 releases, there will have been no reviews of its software, no analysis of its hardware performance or battery life, or any sort of testing of its key features like Game Chat.‚Äù', 'Perhaps it really was a technical nightmare for Nintendo to provide pre-launch review access to press ‚Äì we‚Äôre already seeing, for example, that those who have somehow gained access to the console pre-launch, cannot use them at all until a future system update. And there‚Äôs certainly no precedent of Nintendo being adversarial with press reviews: in my experience, in fact, it‚Äôs historically been one of the most critic-friendly companies, often supplying software many weeks in advance.', 'And I don‚Äôt personally believe the decision to hold back reviews comes from a lack of confidence in its launch line-up either: my recent time playing Mario Kart World and Switch 2 Welcome Tour at Nintendo‚Äôs UK office was great fun and had me excited to spend more time with the games.', 'But consoles have launched with day one patches for over a decade, and the media are well used to covering unfinished products, so, in my opinion, this decision is more likely related to Nintendo‚Äôs paranoia around leaks as it is with any missing functionality before launch day ‚Äì those leaked videos of early consoles that can‚Äôt run games certainly strengthen that hypothesis.', 'No matter how integral Nintendo believes patched-in features like (potentially) Game Chat are to the overall experience, it‚Äôs difficult to believe that it couldn‚Äôt have found a way for reviewers to experience them pre-release.', 'It‚Äôs undoubtedly a bad look, especially following a number of decisions that many fans have received negatively. Switch 2 arrives at a time when its maker has spearheaded an unprecedented $80 price point for games, the prevalence of Game Key Cards is annoying preservationists, and the company regularly declines to disclose who is actually making its games.', 'History tells us, a lack of transparency with the press isn‚Äôt good for consumers. Cyberpunk 2077‚Äôs shocking console launch, let‚Äôs not forget, was only allowed to happen through a similar withholding of review code, which led to a nasty surprise for many players.', 'On the flip side, when Bethesda briefly implemented its no-pre-release-reviews policy a decade ago, Doom, Prey, and Dishonored 2 missed out on a tremendous amount of positive coverage from critics, with their sales curves suggesting many players wanted to hear from reviews before deciding on a purchase (Bethesda later reversed the policy).', 'Nintendo has made its decision, and on VGC we will be covering Switch 2 and its launch games comprehensively, as quickly as we‚Äôre able to while maintaining our editorial standards. Summer Game Fest means our reviews may sadly come later than we hoped, but we want to make sure we spend time delivering the right coverage for our readers and Patreon supporters.

Whilst I‚Äôm someone who pre ordered at the earliest opportunity there is a tiny part nagging away about early game or console issues which would be reported within games media. It‚Äôs interesting that you mention CP2077 as I also pre ordered it without much thought. Games journalism first and foremost (for me) has been a great way to inform purchases (especially in a time where we have less expendable income), so it‚Äôs never been more important to have reviews and thoughts about these products. I look forward to all of your thoughts and reviews as and when they come.', 'I‚Äôve been generally pretty forgiving to Nintendo about a lot of Switch 2 related decisions because they generally at least make business sense, but I will be loud about this. Not allowing press early access to help consumers make informed decisions is unacceptable. I stopped preordering Microsoft products on the same principle, when they acquired Bethesda and announced those games would no longer be sent to the press ahead of time.', 'So‚Ä¶although it‚Äôs too late to do anything about my Switch 2 preorder, I will no longer be preordering Nintendo products going forward! I hope that‚Äôs the end result they wanted!', 'Just clarifying my original statement that Bethesda actually implemented their review policy BEFORE they were acquired by Microsoft, as is pointed out by the article.

Game coverage is a job, and this decision by Nintendo makes that job objectively harder. Not even allowing access at a controlled pre-release event is to the detriment of everyone: the press, consumers and even Nintendo. The choice to also have it launching on the busiest news week for the gaming industry compounds this problem; now many Switch 2 launch games will have less and worsened coverage, as time is a finite resource.

Gamers brave the rain to line up outside Walker GameStop for Nintendo Switch 2,https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/release-nintendo-switch-2/69-bb080e36-2afb-4c93-83e7-83a3b8daa9c7,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'WALKER, Mich. ‚Äî Despite the drizzle, avid gamers lined the outside of a GameStop in Walker on Wednesday afternoon, eager to get their hands on the brand-new Nintendo Switch 2.

You get 12GB of RAM (up from 4GB on the original Switch), and most of that goes straight into powering games, not just background stuff.', 'The screen is still LCD, not OLED, but it‚Äôs bigger at 7.9in and has 1080p resolution. It supports HDR and a 120Hz refresh rate. Colours pop more and motion looks buttery-smooth in handheld mode. There‚Äôs also DLSS upscaling built in, so older games look better. Sadly, while it supports variable refresh rates, it doesn‚Äôt work when docked ‚Äì just in handheld mode.', 'The Nintendo Switch 2 on its own costs ¬£399.99, and the main bundle with Mario Kart World costs ¬£429.99. Buying the bundle saves you ¬£40 compared to picking up the game separately, so it‚Äôs the better value if you‚Äôre planning to grab it anyway.', 'No big discounts yet ‚Äì it‚Äôs launch day, after all ‚Äì but some retailers have larger, more expensive bundles.

"If you didn‚Äôt get a Switch 2 pre-order, don‚Äôt despair: it sounds like retailers will have unprecedented stock",https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603232/gamestop-best-buy-target-walmart-costco-switch-2-stock-no-pre-order,"['What to expect from Target, Best Buy, GameStop and Walmart when it comes to Switch 2 pre-order stock', 'BY PATRICIA HERNANDEZ', 'If you want to get new video game hardware at launch, you typically need a pre-order. Historically, most major brick and mortar retailers only get a set number of pre-orders and a much smaller number of first-come, first-serve stock that they can sell to walk-ins. When the PS5 was released, for example, many GameStops only got a handful of them to sell outside of pre-orders. For the Switch 2, however, it appears that Nintendo is gearing up to meet the incredible demand.', 'First, let‚Äôs make one thing abundantly clear: getting a console will not be a given. You should not assume that you can go to your closest local retailer on launch day without issue. You should also expect some wait times in line even if you have a pre-order, so plan accordingly.', 'With that said, there‚Äôs reason to be optimistic if you don‚Äôt have a pre-order, or if you‚Äôve been unlucky enough to see your existing pre-order canceled.', 'At Best Buy, the retailer says that ‚Äúnearly all‚Äù of its stores will hold midnight releases, and ‚Äúmost‚Äù stores will have additional inventory if you don‚Äôt have a pre-order. To be specific, stores will open at 12 p.m. ET, 11:01 p.m. CT, 10:01 p.m. MT, and 9:01 p.m. PT. Best Buy will also hand out commemorative tokens for those who do attend midnight releases. While your best bet is to call your store and inquire about stock, retail workers have shared images that seem promising. At one store, for example, they‚Äôve got 250 consoles; 200 are reserved while 50 are available for anyone to buy. Another report hailing from a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù store shared similar numbers. Stock will likely vary depending on the size of the store and the location; one retail worker located in a densely populated area shared pictures of their store receiving 350 units.', 'GameStop will also have midnight releases, but the festivities will technically begin a day before on June 4 at 3 p.m. local time. The retailer has not shared what, exactly, will be happening during this time beyond apparently giving out one can of Red Bull per customer. Though we don‚Äôt have stock estimates, it‚Äôs worth noting that GameStop is heavily marketing the Switch 2 release specifically to people who don‚Äôt have pre-orders, outright telling people to try their luck anyway.', 'At Target, there won‚Äôt be midnight releases but the company encourages people to line up before their store opens in a ‚Äúdesignated‚Äù area outside, where workers will dispense tickets. Tickets will be doled out ten minutes before the store opens, and customers will be limited to one console per person. Like any other retailer, stock will likely be impacted by location and size of the store, but retail workers are still sharing encouraging numbers. At one store, a Target employee claimed that their store will have 50 consoles and 60 bundles available to purchase. Another Target employee cautions customers that they expect their stock to be gone within the first 30 minutes of opening.', 'Walmart may be at the epicenter of the ruckus surrounding canceled pre-orders, but the retailer may also be your best chance at having some transparency for what you can expect at your local store. Some people are finding that the Walmart website shows exactly how many units their store will receive, with at least one location apparently slated to get 125 units of the Mario Kart World bundle.', 'Personally, I input my area code on the Walmart website and couldn‚Äôt see anything as of Tuesday. The screenshot displaying the stock count is from someone who had the Switch 2 in their cart, however, which might explain the discrepancy. Right now, since the Switch 2 is unavailable to pre-order, you can‚Äôt put it in your cart. Either way, numbers will likely differ from store to store ‚Äî one retail worker at Walmart says their location will only have nine units for sale outside of pre-orders. Another worker in that thread noted that their location will get around 77 units, but that 80% of them are reserved already. The OP does say that it‚Äôs typical for stores to get canceled orders or no-shows, which can increase the number of consoles available for purchase. The stores have to set those consoles aside at first to give people a chance to pick them up, though.', 'At Costco, things sound promising. For one, it‚Äôs the retailer least likely to see long lines, as you need a membership to shop there. And there‚Äôs no such thing as a pre-order at Costco, which means it‚Äôs a free-for-all. Numbers at stores sound similar to other retailers; one worker shared a picture of a store that received 50 units. Another reply in that thread notes their location has 48 units. Scalpers beware, though: Costco has a limit of one console per customer every seven days.', 'No matter where you decide to go, check in with your local retailer to see when you can start lining up if that‚Äôs your plan of attack. Make sure to bring snacks, a way to stay warm, and something to pass the time if you‚Äôre going at midnight. Be prepared to arrive at least couple of hours early if you don‚Äôt have a pre-order, if not more if you are located in a big city. Scope things out in person and make an assessment. While many major retailers appear to be slated to receive dozens of units, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to be the 100th person in line at GameStop. And don‚Äôt be afraid to try multiple locations in search of your bounty.', 'Nintendo‚Äôs expecting to sell millions of Switch 2 units, which requires them to ship millions of consoles. If all else fails, sit tight: you‚Äôll probably be able to buy a console at some point, even if it‚Äôs not exactly on launch day. Resist the FOMO! Games like Mario Kart World look fun, but much of what Switch 2 will have available at launch are upgraded games you might have already played.', 'The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.', '¬© 2025 VALNET INC.', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHdlbWhsV0hSdU5YaFJZVkZ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZWmc0NXJ0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df

Nintendo Switch 2 Review in Progress,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review,"['Over the last eight years, the Nintendo Switch has become one of the most successful and influential consoles of all time ‚Äì so it‚Äôs incredibly exciting that the Nintendo Switch 2 is magnetically snapping into our hands at long last. While I only got my Switch 2 at its global launch yesterday, I spent the entire day playing Mario Kart World, exploring Welcome Tour, revisiting updated games, and trying out its fancy new mouse controls in Cyberpunk 2077. While I have a lot more to test before my final review, including spending some quality time gaming on the go, I‚Äôve already got a good initial sense of what has (and hasn‚Äôt) impressed me so far.', '', 'Let‚Äôs start simple: The Switch 2 is bigger and better looking than its predecessor. Even compared to my trusty old OLED Switch, the new screen looks great, and the extra real estate is a noticeable improvement. I haven‚Äôt played a ton in handheld mode just yet, but whether I am playing docked or holding it in my own two hands, the higher framerate and resolution just make everything crisp and clean, especially when viewed side by side. None of that is breaking new ground in gaming overall, sure (the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X brought 4K gaming to consoles in 2016 and 2017, respectively) but it‚Äôs part of a handful of moments I‚Äôve had where it fully hit me just how dated the original Switch was getting. So while it may not be giving the PS5 Pro a run for its money or anything, the Switch 2 does at least feel distinctly modern again.', 'The physical device is also just a little bit sleeker and more reliable to use all around. The new kickstand is excellent, comparable to a slimmer version of the OLED‚Äôs when it comes to both its wide range of possible angles and the way it ‚Äústicks‚Äù where you want it ‚Äì and both it and the OLED put the original Switch kickstand to absolute shame if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve used. (You can finally charge while using the kickstand, too, thanks to a second USB-C port on the top of the system.) The new dock is easy to plop into and yank out of quickly, especially since the new magnetic attachments of the Joy-Con 2 controllers mean you can easily attach and pull them off the system with one hand apiece instead of one at a time.', 'Speaking of those magnets, I asked folk what their burning questions about the Switch 2 might be ahead of this review, and one of the most common questions was about this new attachment system. My initial reaction is that it works super well, and any shortcomings seem to be made up for by new conveniences. It‚Äôs easy to take them off the system in a flash when you want to, but at the same time they don‚Äôt feel like they would ever slip off by accident. The magnets aren‚Äôt strong enough to stop you from pulling a Joy-Con off without the release button if you really want to, but you‚Äôd have to be actively trying to do that.', 'That‚Äôs not the only trick these updated controllers have up their wrist straps, with the big new interactivity feature of the Switch 2 being the ability to use a Joy-Con as a mouse. Turn it on its side and your shoulder buttons become mouse buttons, theoretically ready for first-person shooters like Cyberpunk 2077 and strategy games like Civilization 7 alike. This idea has the potential to be a massive game changer, allowing for a more PC-like experience on the couch‚Ä¶ but my experience using it so far has made me a little skeptical about how often I will choose to do so if gamepad controls can get the job done.', 'The problems with mouse control are not quite what I expected them to be. The responsiveness and precision of the Joy-Con mouse is actually very impressive to me ‚Äì it‚Äôs not going to rival a high-quality PC gaming setup, so don‚Äôt expect any esports to make the jump to Switch 2-based live events, but it‚Äôs more than enough for your average player. As someone who primarily games on either PC or Switch, I felt like the aim I could get during firefights in Cyberpunk 2077 was far and away the best when using mouse controllers instead of a traditional joystick setup, or even motion-based assisted aiming. It really does work, and that absolutely rules.', 'It‚Äôs also more comfortable to use on my couch cushion while lazying around in a comfy position than I expected. I have a fairly flat couch, so maybe your mileage will vary, but it‚Äôs far from the nightmare scenario I was expecting of having to sit upright with my mouse hand on the coffee table in front of me to function. Even using it on your thigh (as Nintendo strangely recommends) is surprisingly workable, though I would only ever want to do that for quick menu selections or the like, not gunfights or more careful tasks. I am going to try it on a variety of surfaces such as flat books and the like to test out makeshift mousepads on my couch (something that has long eluded PC gaming peripheral makers hoping they will be the one to finally bring the mouse and keyboard to the living room), but once again, this does work pretty much as I‚Äôd hoped, which is great to discover.', 'No, the reason I might not look to play my mouse-based games while reclining on the couch going forward is much simpler, much more obvious: the Joy-Con is just not a comfortable mouse. Mice are shaped the way they are for a good reason, supporting your hand in specific spots and reducing strain wherever they can. In contrast, the Joy-Con 2 is a candy bar with triggers, and finding a comfortable way to hold it steady while having both movement precision and access to all the buttons you‚Äôll need is tricky. It‚Äôs doable, and in shorter bursts I would honestly still prefer to play Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 this way compared to any other option ‚Äì but after a two-hour play session yesterday, I am genuinely still feeling the strain in my hand and forearm today.', 'The other issue here I didn‚Äôt previously consider is that the introduction of a competent mouse does not mean an easy solution for the lack of a keyboard. Without extra buttons on the left Joy-Con to compensate, you still need to be able to hit all the buttons on the right Joy-Con as you‚Äôre swiping it around. I am used to using extra mouse buttons while gaming (my current PC mouse has three that I map to other actions), so that‚Äôs not new ‚Äì but when I‚Äôm already using my thumb to find some semblance of a good grip, asking me to remove it in order to press the A button to dodge or (God forbid) push in the right stick to crouch is pretty tricky. The positions of those buttons simply weren‚Äôt arranged with this application in mind.', 'Again, the mouse controls have still been pretty dang useful in short bursts or for games without as many complex interactions to manage (I still need to test out Civilization 7, which I‚Äôm hoping will be more contained to pointing and clicking). But it‚Äôs hard to imagine sitting down with Borderlands 4 later this year, for example, and playing an entire FPS campaign like this, which is a shame. That said, if Nintendo were to make an official wireless Mouse-Con or snap-on accessory with all the buttons that are needed and a physical shape that wouldn‚Äôt hurt my hand to hold I would pick it up in a heartbeat, so the potential for this control method to be truly great is here.', 'Certain games even allow you to plug in a USB mouse and use it as you would on PC, but that doesn‚Äôt appear to be supported in the Switch 2 menus and comes with its own limitations. For example, I was impressed to discover that Cyberpunk 2077 even has full mouse and keyboard support on Switch 2, working exactly as you‚Äôd hope as soon as I plugged them into the USB ports on the dock. But you can‚Äôt just use the mouse to replace the right Joy-Con and still use the left for movement without the UI swapping rapidly between the two input methods, and you can‚Äôt rebind any of the buttons on the mouse to replace the buttons you‚Äôve lost, so it‚Äôs not really a full-time solution. It‚Äôs all mouse and keyboard or all Joy-Con.', 'Another common question I got was about backwards compatibility and how Switch 1 games without explicit upgrade editions look on this more powerful system. We still need to do a lot of proper testing, so this is anecdotal at the moment, but I did hop into The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and didn‚Äôt see a hint of the framerate inconsistencies it often had when I reviewed it on the OLED Switch. That‚Äôs encouraging at the very least, and hopefully a sign of how other games with histories of rocky performance will fare as well.', 'The other big question mark blocks waiting to be punched for answers are things like battery life, handheld performance, and heat ‚Äì on that last point, I will say that it hasn‚Äôt gotten hot in my hands so far, but when I was playing Welcome Tour in 4K while docked, every time I had to pick it up for a handheld tech demo or minigame the system was shockingly warm. It wasn‚Äôt hot enough to burn me or anything, but it seems like the fan and other cooling tech Welcome Tour tells me is in the dock is truly non-optional. That will certainly complicate third-party dock options going forward.', 'I‚Äôve got a lot more to play, do, and see with the Switch 2 before my final, scored review. So far this sequel system is about what I was expecting: An iterative upgrade to an already excellent Nintendo console that modernizes many desperately out of date aspects, improves countless design elements in small but noticeable ways, and takes a swing on a genuinely impressive new control option that also doesn‚Äôt quite work as smoothly as I‚Äôd hoped. But if reading this has raised any more questions about the Switch 2 you‚Äôd like to see addressed, leave them in the comments below and I (or one of the other IGN folks currently getting familiar with it) will try to answer it in our coverage.', 'If you‚Äôre wondering why I am the one reviewing the Switch 2 for IGN, let me fill you in. My name is Tom, and I‚Äôm the Executive Reviews Editor for games at IGN. I‚Äôve been here for eight years next month and have reviewed quite a few Nintendo games in that time, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. I also served a stint as a regular on our Nintendo Voice Chat podcast. The keen-eyed among you may also notice that this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve reviewed a Switch, either: I did both our 2018 updated review of the base Switch, taking a look at the system after a year of regular use, as well as our review of the pocket-sized Switch Lite in 2019.', 'After all of that, I‚Äôm extremely familiar with Nintendo‚Äôs original hybrid system, and while I truly love that console, I‚Äôm also very aware of its shortcomings, from performance woes to joystick drift. Because the Switch 2 feels like more of an iterative successor that doesn‚Äôt set out to flip the table on what Nintendo was already doing, I am going to be taking an eye toward those longstanding issues and how well they have been addressed (although, for something like drift, we likely won‚Äôt have a clear answer for many months to come).', 'Alongside the system review and reviews of the two all-new launch games, Welcome Tour and Mario Kart World, we‚Äôre also planning check-ins on major games that are getting Switch 2 revisions. That includes Cyberpunk 2077, Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom, and Civilization 7, as well as games with less flashy updates like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. And, of course, you can look out for my final review of the system itself in the next week or two!', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHdlbWhsV0hSdU5YaFJZVkZ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZWmc0NXJ0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df

We've long known what the Switch 2 will look like, and when it'll arrive. We've told you how tariffs have affected Nintendo's launch plans, we've given you a step-by-step guide to pre-ordering and told you where to buy a Switch 2 on launch day. We gave you our first hands-on preview back in early April, told you how good of a first impression Mario Kart World makes and dug even deeper with our final preview earlier this week."", ""All that's left now is our full review, and reviews take time. While we put Nintendo's latest through its paces, you can catch up on everything you need to know about the Switch 2 below. If you want to follow the Engadget team's experiences with it on launch day, you can check out our Nintendo Switch 2 launch day live blog."", 'The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 1080p 7.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh and HDR compatibility. It also supports up to 4K output at 120Hz (with variable refresh rates) when docked.', ""The new Joy-Con 2 for Nintendo Switch 2 attaches magnetically with a button to release them. They have larger SL and SR buttons (the ones hidden when the Joy-Con are attached) to make playing multiplayer games on individual Joy-Cons more feasible. These buttons are also made of steel and attach to the Switch 2's magnets."", 'The analog sticks are no longer tiny nubs, and are closer in size to the ones you might find on a PS5 or Xbox controller. However, they do not have Hall effect sensors, the use of which can minimize the risk of the ""stick drift"" issue that plagued the original Joy-Cons.', 'The Joy-Con 2 have what Nintendo is calling ‚ÄúHD Rumble 2‚Äù built in, which seems to be a refinement of the original (and still very good) vibration function. Finally, each Joy-Con 2 has an optical sensor that allows you to use it as a mouse, and a C button, which we‚Äôll get to in a minute.', 'The new Pro Controller for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with everything you‚Äôd expect based on the refreshed Joy-Con 2: Namely HD Rumble 2 and the C button. There are also remappable GL/GR buttons around the back and a standard audio jack for connecting a headset.', 'Both options come with Amiibo support built in. The Switch 2 comes with two Joy-Con 2, as you‚Äôd expect, and additional pairs are priced at $95. The Pro Controller will cost $85.', 'The new C button is a dedicated way to enter a chat session with friends. As well as the standard features you‚Äôd expect from voice chat, Nintendo has built a Discord-like video-sharing feature, which lets you show your gameplay to others and see other people‚Äôs screens while you‚Äôre playing.', 'The GameChat function works with a mic built into the console, though headsets are also supported. Nintendo will also sell a $55 camera that plugs into the USB-C port on the top of the console, which will allow you to stream your face along with your game.', 'The Switch 2 will work with GameCube games via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The three titles available at launch will be F-Zero GX, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur II.', 'Perhaps the biggest feature, though, is one you can‚Äôt see: The Switch 2 has an all-new processor and GPU and significantly more storage (256GB vs 64GB in the Switch OLED), along with support for faster and more capacious microSD cards. This will obviously lead to better first-party games and upgraded Switch experiences, but more importantly it will mean multi-platform games that had to skip the original, underpowered Switch will be able to be ported over. With games like Cyberpunk 2077 coming to the Switch 2 at launch, it seems like far more ports will be feasible than on the original console.', ""Digital Foundry has been able to confirm a bunch of the details of the Switch 2's specs that Nintendo hasn't explained publicly, but the highlights are the consoles custom chip and faster storage. The Switch 2 uses a NVIDIA chip with eight ARM Cortex A78C cores, six of which are available to developers, and a GPU with the company's Ampere architecture. That's alongside 12GB of LPDDRX RAM and a custom FDE (file decompression engine) that decompresses game files without drawing power from the Switch 2's CPU."", ""Another major improvement comes in the form of networking ‚Äî the Switch 2 supports Wi-Fi 6, which will improve the original's often glacial download speeds. Similarly, the new dock sports an Ethernet port for a rock-solid connection."", 'Virtual Game Cards are Nintendo‚Äôs way of making digital games replicate the experience of physical copies. They let you lend digital games to friends and family, letting them enjoy the game on their system without buying a separate copy.', 'Of course, there are caveats. Much like a physical cartridge, only one system can play each Virtual Game Card at a time. You can only loan games to up to eight people, and each will need to be on the same Nintendo Family Account and local network. Finally, you can only share one game at a time, and the lending period lasts only two weeks. Although that‚Äôs a healthy list of limitations, the feature is still more than other consoles have offered ‚Äî and, if we‚Äôre lucky, it will be something Sony and Microsoft are pressured to adopt.', 'Perhaps best of all, the feature isn‚Äôt exclusive to the Switch 2. It‚Äôs already available for the first Switch.', 'Game-Key cards are physical Switch 2 games that only contain a portion of their game data. The first time you slot one in, your Switch 2 will download the rest of the game to your local storage and the Game-Key card becomes the ""key"" you need to use anytime you want to play it.', ""Nintendo says you'll have to have an internet connection the first time you boot up the game, but afterwards the card itself should be enough to let you play. You'll also be able to resell your Game-Key card in the same way you would a normal cartridge or disc."", ""This fusion of digital and physical has become fairly common on other consoles as the size of games has grown larger, but it's relatively novel for Nintendo. Since the Switch 2 is going to be running more demanding, high-fidelity games, though, it's a compromise that lets people still enjoy the common-sense benefits of physical game cards."", ""Nintendo gave the press a chance to check out the Switch 2 and a few of the games it highlighted. You can read our impressions of Mario Kart World as well as more general thoughts on how the Switch 2 feels in person. Right off the bat, Mario Kart World feels like an outstanding launch title, with more depth and better visuals than we've ever seen from a Mario Kart game. The core formula is intact, but there are a lot of new features and play styles to dig into."", 'As for the Switch 2 hardware, it feels like a major step forward from the original Switch ‚Äî it has grown up a lot and feels far more polished and refined. And while it may not have an OLED screen, the 7.9-inch LED display Nintendo did use is outstanding.', ""Nintendo scheduled its launch for June 5, 2025. From a US perspective, the first consoles reached gamers' hands on June 4, with Australians and New Zealanders sharing images online and some streaming their experiences on Twitch and YouTube."", 'Switch 2 pre-orders were initially set to begin on April 9, but the following week, Nintendo said it was suspending pre-order plans in the US ""indefinitely"" in reaction to a slate of tariffs imposed by President Trump.', 'Finally, when pre-orders opened on April 24, a hot mess ensued. Those who stayed up late trying to snag a Switch 2 were often left empty-handed as Walmart, Best Buy and Target‚Äôs websites weren‚Äôt fully equipped for the demand. Many customers were left with unmoving queues and error messages ‚Äî a familiar process for many who‚Äôve tried to pre-order a hot gaming or tech product in recent years. (Folks who pre-ordered a PS5 during the pandemic caught the nastiest case of deja vu.)', 'No retailers are currently taking Switch 2 pre-orders. Although there‚Äôs always the chance one will drop an unexpected stock refresh, your best option right now is to register your interest with Nintendo. That may not lead to a launch-day console, as Nintendo has warned, but it won‚Äôt likely be a crazy delay like those familiar to GPU buyers. And if your Nintendo cred ticks the right boxes (you have been subscribed to Switch Online for at least 12 months, have opted in to share gameplay data, and have at least 50 total gameplay hours), your odds will improve.', 'Costco is a dark-horse candidate for day-one availability. The retailer doesn‚Äôt appear to have taken any Switch 2 pre-orders, but a product listing claims it will have Mario Kart World console bundles in stock on launch day.', 'In any case, Nintendo says the console‚Äôs June 5 release date is unchanged.', 'In a somewhat disappointing update, Nintendo appears to be shipping ""sold out"" signs to retailers so that they can quickly let people know the Switch 2 isn\'t in stock. We can only read so much into that, but it seems likely that if you can\'t grab one on launch day from a retailer, you\'ll be waiting a while for them to come back in stock.', 'On April 2, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $450 standalone, or $500 with a bundled digital copy of the new Mario Kart game, Mario Kart World. That‚Äôs significantly more expensive than the original Switch, which launched at $300, and has remained at that price ever since. It‚Äôs also more expensive than the entry-level current-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft.', 'The comparison looks a little better up against Valve‚Äôs Steam Deck, which costs $400 for the LCD model or $550 for the basic OLED model. The Steam Deck is more affordable than most PC handhelds.', 'When Nintendo delayed the pre-orders from the original date of April 9, it said it was doing so ""in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions."" With heavy US tariffs levied on Nintendo\'s Asian production centers, the implication was that would have little choice but to pass at least some of those costs on to American consumers. But Trump\'s April 9 tariff pivot ‚Äî reverting to 10 percent across the board for 90 days for all countries except China, which now gets a triple-digit hit ‚Äî further muddied the waters. That\'s because it\'s unclear how much, if any, of the components and assembly of US-bound Switch 2 consoles will originate in China.', ""The administration exempted some electronics from reciprocal tariffs, but they'll soon be subject to new levies on semiconductors. Some analysts suggest that Nintendo will be selling consoles at a loss in the US with even a 10 percent tariff."", 'Nevertheless, the company is keeping the price of the Switch 2 at $450 and the Mario Kart World bundle at $500. However, it noted that it had to increase the prices of Switch 2 accessories ""due to changing market conditions"" and added that other price modifications may occur in the future for a similar reason.', ""When Nintendo announced the rescheduled Switch 2 pre-order date for the US and Canada, it confirmed price increases for many of the console's accessories. The current US prices for the accessories are as follows:"", 'Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller ‚Äî $85', 'Joy-Con 2 Pair ‚Äî $95', 'Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip ‚Äî $40', 'Joy-Con 2 Strap ‚Äî $14', 'Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set ‚Äî $25', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Camera ‚Äî $55', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set ‚Äî $120', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector ‚Äî $40', 'Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case ‚Äî $85', 'Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter ‚Äî $35', 'Samsung microSD Express Card ‚Äì 256GB for Nintendo Switch 2 ‚Äî $60', 'The price of the Joy-Con 2 strap has gone up by $1, but the prices of other products have risen by between $5 and $10, with the dock set getting the larger increase. Thankfully, your Nintendo Switch 2 will come with a dock. Nintendo also released a list of accessory prices for Canada.', 'Nintendo says that the Switch 2 will last between 2 and 6.5 hours on a single charge. This is similar to the original Switch, which was rated for 2.5-6.5 hours, though later revisions upped that figure significantly. The company cautions that ""this time is an estimate ... battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions.""', 'Based on video Nintendo shared in the Nintendo Today app, one way the Switch 2 will extend the longevity of its battery over time is with a new ""battery preservation mode."" When enabled, your Switch 2 will stop charging when it reaches 90 percent, saving its battery from the wear and tear of charging to 100 percent every time. This is a fairly common feature on smartphones, and it makes sense for a handheld console you charge every day.', ""A new battery mode won't change the Switch 2's estimated battery life, but it will slow the damage charging the console has, which keeps it usable for longer."", 'Nintendo confirmed in November 2024 that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible. It will also feature access to Nintendo Online, so users will be able to play all of those old retro titles.', 'In the initial Nintendo Switch 2 press release, Nintendo reiterated that physical and digital Switch games will work on the new system. However, it noted that ""certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2."" We now have more information on which games are working thanks to a guide Nintendo put together.', 'As of April 1, the vast majority of Switch 2 games are marked as compatible, but many popular games are said to have some issues. Nintendo has marked most of these as ‚Äúunder investigation,‚Äù suggesting a fix may be on the way in time for launch. Nintendo says it is manually testing every Switch game for compatibility.', 'Only one title is marked as incompatible: Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This was part of Nintendo‚Äôs Labo range of games that worked with Cardboard accessories, and is incompatible as the Switch 2 doesn‚Äôt physically fit in the VR headset.', ""The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run some of the late-generation software that's come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? That‚Äôs unclear. In an ‚ÄúAsk the Developer‚Äù page on its site, Nintendo says that old games are working through a real-time translation system, which sounds similar to how Rosetta allows modern Macs to run old software. With that said, the new and old Switch are much closer in hardware than that."", 'In the same developer interview, it‚Äôs said that in its testing of old games for compatibility, there were some occasions ‚Äúwhere loading times became faster, or game performance became more stable,‚Äù but we don‚Äôt have any detail beyond that.', 'As well as backward compatibility, Nintendo is also offering up premium ""Switch 2 Edition"" upgrades for a select few games. These have improved resolutions and frame rates, and (in some cases) bonus features and content. What exactly that means will vary, but Nintendo did confirm that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will have 4K/60 fps and 1080p/120 fps options on the Switch 2.', 'Games confirmed to have a Switch 2 Edition to date include:', 'Super Mario Party Jamboree', 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild', 'The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom', 'Kirby and the Forgotten Land', 'Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A', 'Metroid Prime 4: Beyond', 'In the case of the two mainline Zelda games, those upgrades will be included with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership or cost $10 each. Upgrades for the other games are also paid, but Nintendo has not said how much those will cost.', 'You may remember that the original Switch cartridges taste absolutely awful. This was on purpose, to discourage folks from putting the games in their mouth.', ""Similarly, the Switch 2 carts are also said to taste terrible, in large part to stop children or pets from accidentally ingesting them. It is not yet clear what substance Nintendo has coated the Switch 2 cartridges in to make them taste foul, but Nintendo's Takuhiro Dohta advised against licking them all the same."", '""We don\'t want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption,"" he told GameSpot.

‚ÄòSWITCH 2‚Äô IS NINTENDO (MOSTLY) ALL GROWN UP,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/nintendo-switch-2-review-1235350688/,"['By CHRISTOPHER CRUZ', 'After an eight-year gaming journey encompassing the longest console cycle Nintendo‚Äôs ever had, it‚Äôs finally time to turn the page with the launch of Switch 2. The new hybrid console, which works both as a handheld and home system just like its predecessor, has a lot to live up to.', 'Since its release in 2017, the original Switch has been a phenomenon, selling over 152 million units (making it the third highest-selling gaming device ever behind the Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2), and reinvigorating the Japanese company both with flush cash and cultural clout. Whereas 10 years ago, people might‚Äôve assumed Nintendo was a thing of the past, the success of the Switch has propelled the company into a new golden age. Now, it‚Äôs their crown to lose.', 'That might sound like a highly dramatic read of the situation for a video game console launch, but it rings true. As mobile gaming catapulted the pastime into ubiquity, the audience for video games is larger than ever. But despite a surge in popularity, the gaming industry has somewhat plateaued in its potential. While previous generational leaps felt earth-shattering ‚Äî going from pixelated bleep bloops in 1985 to fully rendered 3D worlds in the span of a decade ‚Äî progress is harder to come by these days. The best looking, feeling, and functioning games of 2025 aren‚Äôt really all that different than 10 (or even 20) years ago.', '', 'All that‚Äôs to say it isn‚Äôt enough to simply roll out new hardware with better specs and a solid sequel or two; there needs to be a real hook to pry people away from their phones and, especially, from the games they already have. That‚Äôs the mission of Switch 2: to grab hold of an ever-narrowing attention span, at home or on the go, and hopefully keep it for however long this cycle goes.', '', 'On that front, it‚Äôs hard to say whether Nintendo‚Äôs up to the task. In many ways, it feels like a safe bet that Switch 2 will be some kind of success; it‚Äôs better, faster, and stronger than its predecessor in every way. But the console (which retails at $449.99) also feels like a spiritual betrayal of Nintendo‚Äôs core ethos of innovation. As the first device in the company‚Äôs history to be slapped with a simple numerical sequel for a name, the messaging is clear: It‚Äôs more of that thing you already like, rather than something entirely new. Yet still, there‚Äôs a world where that might be enough.', '', 'Well, it‚Äôs in the name. The successor to the OG Switch looks a lot like the last one. It‚Äôs ostensibly a touchscreen tablet with two controllers that snap onto the sides. In handheld mode, it feels like a dream for anyone who grew up burning through batteries on a chunky monochromatic Game Boy. The screen is a massive 7.9 inch LCD display (up from its predecessor‚Äôs 6.2) that utilizes HDR (high dynamic range) and 1080p resolution to deliver high-definition gaming in the palm of your hand. The screen is also capable of 120 Hz VRR (variable refresh rate), which allows certain games to use the juiced-up GPU and CPU to run smoother in motion than any Nintendo device before.', 'We review the best portable speakers under $200, from Marshall to Bose, that wirelessly pair with Bluetooth to stream music and more.', 'Its controllers (called Joy-Con) are detachable, meaning that players can kick back and play with the device in kickstand mode, or hand off one to someone else for multiplayer gaming. Inside, the Joy-Con have all the bells and whistles modern gamers expect, from gyroscopes for motion controls to enhanced HD rumble for tactile feedback (a fancy version of rumble).', 'Placed in its dock, Switch 2 connects to a home display and increases its processing power to play games at an upscaled 4K resolution, bringing it inline with beefier consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at a fraction of the size. There‚Äôre still limitations; Switch 2 is a substantial upgrade from its predecessor, but its overall horsepower is closer to that of a PlayStation 4 (launched in 2013) than other current generation systems. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs weak ‚Äî far from it. With increased RAM and advancements in its architecture, the Switch 2 can run games like launch title Cyberpunk 2077, a game that famously shit the bed on PS4 and Xbox One. Playing as a hi-res facsimile of Keanu Reeves on a Nintendo feels kind of revelatory in that regard.', '', 'In short, it‚Äôs basically an upgraded Switch. But for what it lacks in flat-out gimmicks or quantum leaps in how people perceive video games ‚Äî as seen in the jumps from the SNES to Nintendo 64 or Wii ‚Äî it makes up for with subtle changes that do something new for Nintendo. Instead of making something people didn‚Äôt know they wanted, the Switch 2 delivers many of the things they did.', 'From a purely technical perspective, Switch 2 is a huge leap forward in terms of power. While Nintendo mostly conceded the corporate tug-of-war over graphical prowess back in 2006 with the Wii, the general plateau of visual enhancements over the last two generations means that games running on Switch 2 look pretty damned good even compared to more premium devices. Mario Kart World and the upgraded version of 2023‚Äôs Tears of the Kingdom look great, with the latter running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second, a far cry from the way the original version chugged along on the outdated Switch hardware.', 'But there was never really a question as to whether Nintendo‚Äôs first-party games would look good. Through clever art direction and intimate knowledge of their own technology, homegrown Nintendo games have always maximized the potential of their individual platforms. The greater potential here is for third-party developers to produce titles for Nintendo‚Äôs platform, after many previously absconded in the Switch era due to the limitations of that device.', 'Although no review copies were provided early enough to fully test from start to finish, in hands-on sessions, Rolling Stone was able to try Switch 2 versions of games like Capcom‚Äôs Street Fighter 6, EA‚Äôs Split Fiction, and most impressively, CD Projekt Red‚Äôs Cyberpunk 2077 ‚Äî all of which looked and felt impressively close to their original iterations on other consoles. While they mostly fall just short of the graphical fidelity offered elsewhere, with less textural detail and complex real-time lighting, every one of them worked, which itself is a feat given how comedically bad OG Switch versions of titles like Mortal Kombat 1 ended up.', 'They may not be the premier way to play these games, but Switch 2 versions are about as close as you can get to the desired experience, especially in handheld mode, without investing hundreds or thousands of dollars more for high end pro consoles and PCs.', '', 'The other changes are more subtle. The size of the console has increased without heavily impacting its weight, which is great news for lanky-fingered adults who previously struggled to comfortably play Switch or even the slightly larger 2021 OLED model. With a clean matte finish and magnetic connectors for the Joy-Con (versus the snap-in functionality of the older ones), everything about Switch 2 feels sturdier, cleaner, and more premium. Clearly taking some inspiration from handheld PCs like ASUS ROG Ally and Steam Deck, Switch 2 feels less like a toy and more like something an adult might want to play in public.', 'The Joy-Con themselves have new functionality, too, although there‚Äôs some omissions ‚Äî namely, the much-requested inclusion of Hall effect joysticks, which are more modern, reliable sticks that could‚Äôve solved the drifting issue that plagued the first Switch. HD rumble returns and is both stronger and subtler than before. In games like Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour (a glorified tech demo), tactile feedback can be used to detect minute vibrations in varying intensity. In Mario Kart World, engines hum beneath your fingers. Again, this is all stuff we‚Äôve seen before, and it‚Äôs not quite as impactful as the tactile experiences in devices like the PS5‚Äôs Dual Sense Edge controller, but it does feel great.', 'The biggest change to the Joy-Con is a bizarre one that has roots in Nintendo history. At any time, the controllers can be placed on a surface, like a table or (surprisingly) your knee, turning the controller into a point-and-click mouse. Nintendo has toyed with mouse controls as far back as the SNES, but here it serves multiple purposes. In games like Mario Party Jamboree, the mouse can be used for mini-games like air hockey or dragging items to stack in physics-based trials. In first-person shooter Metroid Prime 4, players can shift from analog stick controls to hyper-precise aiming reminiscent of hardcore PC games. Even just clicking around the console‚Äôs UI feels smoother, and you‚Äôll be surprised by how often the feature gets used (especially on a knee).', 'The last big feature is GameChat, and it could be a biggie. Essentially, GameChat allows players to connect with groups of up to four (for video) or 12 (for audio) people to talk and play together. Audio only requires the console‚Äôs built-in microphone, but with the additional purchase of a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera ($54.99), users can cast themselves virtually, even overlaying themselves on top of gameplay or in little boxes for their friends.', '', 'In practice, it‚Äôs almost like having a low-lift take on Twitch streaming, dropping players in front of a game for their friends to see without needing an expensive kit or green screen. Think of it like a playable Zoom call, with the ability for people to play the same or different games together, jumping in and out of sessions at will. There‚Äôs, of course, a one-click way to buy the game your friend is showing off to capitalize on FOMO. Unfortunately, the live feed itself is low-res, which is disappointing but fair considering that console is running its own game, direct feed from the camera, and pulling in three others simultaneously.', 'Compared to older console launches, Switch 2‚Äôs lineup is ultimately fine. From Nintendo‚Äôs own first-party teams, the killer app is clearly Mario Kart World. Bigger than any Mario Kart ever, it‚Äôs a perfect showcase for Switch 2‚Äôs increased power and social features and will be a guaranteed purchase just about everyone who buys the new console ‚Äî it‚Äôs even offered as the sole bundle available day one.', 'Other than that, it‚Äôs a mixed bag. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a $10 mini-game collection that tasks players with studiously learning and implementing every new feature in the system. In what obviously should‚Äôve been a pack-in title like PlayStation‚Äôs done with the Astro series at the launch of its new hardware, Welcome Tour makes for a fun distraction and a good way to test out all the new gizmos in the console. But it‚Äôs not a full meal.', 'Donkey Kong Bananza will arrive on July 17, positioned to scratch the post-launch itch with the first new 3D entry in the series since 1999‚Äôs Donkey Kong 64. But let‚Äôs face it, Donkey Kong is no Mario; and there isn‚Äôt even a murmur about when Nintendo‚Äôs most beloved figure will get a new game. You can, at least, play most older Switch titles on the new device, with many like Super Mario Party Jamboree and the Zelda games offering either paid or free upgrades to Switch 2 versions with new features like improved performance or camera/mouse integration. Switch 2 also brings back GameCube classics like The Wind Waker and F-Zero GX for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. But that‚Äôs kind of it.', 'Look, not every console launch comes with that game that will be remembered forever. In today‚Äôs landscape, most new systems are sold as cross-generational upgrades that have a handful of enticing new titles but mostly make existing games better. Without a Super Mario 64 or Breath of the Wild caliber title, that‚Äôs really what Nintendo is banking on.', '', 'Part of that strategy is the resurgence of third-party games, which could be the system‚Äôs saving grace. Day one, the offerings include ports of Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman World of Assassination, Street Fighter 6, Split Fiction, and Yakuza 0 ‚Äî all of which are fantastic in their previous forms. Down the road, games like Star Wars Outlaws, Elden Ring, and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade could make a splash, with the latter signifying the long-awaited return of the Final Fantasy series to Nintendo after infamously ditching their partnership for Sony. Switch 2 will also welcome Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 3+4 this year, so there‚Äôs no shortage of non-Nintendo games to look forward to.', 'Assuming Nintendo can continue luring third-party publishers back into the fray to either produce good enough ports or, ideally, entirely new games (like Bloodborne-like The Duskbloods), there should be a slow trickle of releases that prevent any serious droughts like the periods that plague the original Switch in between Nintendo-exclusives. On top that, Nintendo has fostered a massive platform for indie games that helped bolster its profile in recent years, even securing the incredible get of Hades II as a console exclusive for a limited time.', 'It‚Äôs the million-dollar question, but the answer is complicated. Although Switch 2 offers a better version of a familiar experience, there‚Äôs very little that feels revolutionary. What worked great before ‚Äî the seamless transition between portable and home play, smart implementation of its Joy-Con, and a likely future-classic library ‚Äî is all present. What remains to be seen if its new features like GameChat have lasting potential.', 'There‚Äôs also the issue of price and availability. Although not cheap, the first Switch and its later Lite model were cost-effective alternatives (at $300 and $200, respectively) for gamers looking to invest serious time without breaking the bank. Conversely, Switch 2 starts at $450 without any games. Bundled with Mario Kart World, it makes the price tag about $500; but individually, the games are also more expensive with some titles like Mario Kart World costing $80 on its own, while others like Donkey Kong Bananza will retail for $70.', '', 'Despite that, it may still end up being the most cost-effective way to continue playing new games. Due to multiple factors, from increased development costs and the recent threat of tariffs, video game prices are up across the board with Xbox Series X systems rising to $600 (and PlayStation 5 potentially soon to follow). It sucks to say, but Nintendo Switch 2 might still end up being kind of a deal ‚Äî especially with its GameShare feature, which allows players at home to share a single copy of a game between multiple Switch 2 and Switch devices to play all at once. For a full family of gamers, that could be a huge deal.', 'As it stands, Switch 2 is whatever you make it to be. Despite somewhat tempered hype around its launch, it‚Äôs still a new Nintendo console. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who‚Äôs insanely amped by Mario Kart, you‚Äôve probably already got a pre-order. For everyone else, it‚Äôs wait and see, although Nintendo knows you‚Äôre watching. Odds are, you‚Äôll break and buy it eventually.', 'We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation. ¬© 2025 Rolling Stone, LLC.

The Nintendo Switch 2 launches today. Here‚Äôs what to know,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/tech/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-what-to-know,"['Markets', '', 'Fear & Greed Index', 'Latest Market News', '', '', 'It‚Äôs a big day for Nintendo fans. The gaming giant‚Äôs new console, the Switch 2, arrives on store shelves globally after being announced in April ‚Äî marking Nintendo‚Äôs first major console launch since the original Switch arrived roughly eight years ago.', 'And fans have clearly been waiting; 2.2 million people applied for a lottery system to buy the Switch 2 in Japan, according to a translation of an X post from Nintendo in April. Nearly all US Best Buy stores opened just after midnight to accommodate eager fans.', 'The Switch 2, priced at $450 in the US, can be played in handheld mode, when propped up on a table; or on a TV when plugged in to its accompanying dock, like its predecessor. While the formula is the same as that of the original Switch, Nintendo has made significant upgrades to the hardware, including giving its new console a larger screen, upgraded versions of the Joy-Con controllers and new social features.', 'Nintendo‚Äôs decision to stick with a winning template for the Switch 2 is a testament to the original‚Äôs popularity ‚Äî but also a gamble that its success will endure for the better part of the next decade. While the 2017-era Switch introduced gamers to the concept of a home console that also serves as a portable game machine, the Switch 2 doubles down on that idea, amid growing competition from PC rivals like Valve and Lenovo that have emerged over the last three years.', 'But Nintendo‚Äôs catalogue of beloved characters and games could give it an edge against rivals. Gamers typically buy a Nintendo console because they want exclusive games, like ‚ÄúSuper Mario‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Legend of Zelda,‚Äù despite owning another gaming device.', '‚ÄúThe cross ownership rates historically between people that would own an Xbox or a PlayStation or a gaming PC, and who also own a Nintendo device, have always been pretty high compared to other systems,‚Äù Mat Piscatella, executive director for video game coverage at market research firm Circana, told CNN in April.', 'The Switch 2 iterates its predecessor with several new features, including a Game Chat function that lets gamers communicate with other players by tapping a button on the console. Up to 12 players can chat at the same time, and players can share their screen in real time even when playing other games. Nintendo will also allow users to share certain games with other Switch owners while playing in person even if the other player doesn‚Äôt own the title.', 'Nintendo is also bringing some of its signature quirkiness to the Switch 2‚Äôs social features; in addition to sharing their screen and video chatting with others, players‚Äô faces will pop up in a tiny bubble near their character in the Switch 2 edition of ‚ÄúSuper Mario Party: Jamboree‚Äù ‚Äî an effort to make it feel like players are part of the game itself. However, it requires Nintendo‚Äôs $55 camera that‚Äôs sold separately.', '‚ÄúBeing able to now take that (multiplayer) experience and virtually create it, we think, is something special, because we know more and more people are playing online,‚Äù Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CNN in April.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nNintendo is sticking with a winning formula for the Switch 2. But will it be enough?', 'The Switch 2‚Äôs Joy-Con controllers, which attach to the Switch when it‚Äôs being used as a handheld console or can be used separately, now support computer mouse-like functionality, unlike the previous version. That will allow players to drag the controllers across a surface ‚Äî whether it be a table or person‚Äôs lap ‚Äî to control gameplay on screen.', 'One new game called ‚ÄúDrag x Drive‚Äù is designed around this idea; players pilot characters in powered-up wheelchair-like vehicles across a basketball court to shoot hoops by sliding and dragging Nintendo‚Äôs new controllers. In the Switch 2 version of ‚ÄúMetroid Prime 4: Beyond,‚Äù players will be able to move the Joy-Con like a mouse for more precise aiming when shooting enemies.', '‚ÄúPeople who may play on a PC with a mouse and a keyboard, that‚Äôs an experience they can‚Äôt replicate,‚Äù Bowser said.', 'Nintendo has also given the console hardware a much-needed upgrade. The Switch 2 has a larger 7.9-inch display compared to the original Switch‚Äôs 6.2-inch screen, and the Joy-Cons now snap to the console magnetically, which should make them easier to attach or remove from the console. The console has eight times as much storage as its predecessor and the dock supports 4K resolution, two changes that should give players more room to store games and improve how they look when connected to a compatible TV.', 'Nintendo is pointing to these changes to justify the console‚Äôs higher price, which is significantly above the $300 original.', '‚ÄúAll of that lends itself to creating a price point that we think is a value to the consumer, because they‚Äôll see the benefit in all these features,‚Äù Bowser said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also, we think, a reasonable price based on what we‚Äôve been able to build into the device itself.‚Äù', 'Nintendo‚Äôs major launch title for the Switch 2 is ‚ÄúMario Kart World,‚Äù a new version of its popular cart racing game that lets players drive off-track to explore the world around them. Games coming later this year include ‚ÄúDonkey Kong Bonanza,‚Äù which arrives on July 17, ‚ÄúDrag x Drive,‚Äù ‚ÄúKirby Air Riders‚Äù and ‚ÄúHyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.‚Äù', 'The Switch 2 can also run games for the original Switch, although Nintendo says on its website that some games may not be fully compatible or supported. But Nintendo is launching Switch Edition 2 versions of existing games that enable those titles to take advantage of the Switch 2‚Äôs new hardware with improved visuals and new gameplay modes.', 'Switch 2 editions of ‚ÄúThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild‚Äù and ‚ÄúTears of the Kingdom‚Äù are available now, while ‚ÄúSuper Mario Party Jamboree,‚Äù ‚ÄúKirby and the Forgotten Land‚Äù and ‚ÄúPok√©mon Legends: Z-A‚Äù will get Switch 2 editions later this year.', 'Yes, Nintendo still sells previous Switch models including the $200 Switch Lite, $300 standard Switch and $350 Switch OLED.', 'That‚Äôs a benefit for shoppers who don‚Äôt want to shell out $450, but it could also eat into demand for Nintendo‚Äôs new system ‚Äî especially since many major new titles aren‚Äôt out yet.', '‚ÄúThe Switch being so successful is a double-edged sword,‚Äù Piscatella said ahead of the Switch 2 debut in April. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, a huge, great positive base to build on. On the other hand, a huge target to try to reach in terms of the same level of success.‚Äù', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Others stood in the line, which stretched several city blocks. A handful even dressed up as iconic Nintendo characters, including Luigi, the beloved brother and sidekick in the video game ‚ÄúSuper Mario.‚Äù', '‚ÄúReally, it‚Äôs just all about the community and sort of sharing that love of Nintendo with each other,‚Äù said Lauren Hyde, who has been in line since she traveled from Maryland on Monday.', 'The Japanese gaming giant is releasing the coveted console Thursday, eight years after the original version hit shelves. The first iteration of the Switch was a major hit for Nintendo, selling roughly 150 million units, according to the company, making it the third-best-selling console of all time, behind the PS2 and the Nintendo DS.', 'The hype for the Switch 2 has been building for months, with Nintendo teasing a brief first look at it in January. With a bigger screen, better graphics and larger controls, the next iteration of the console has drummed up enough enthusiasm among gamers that many showed up early at stores like Best Buy and GameStop to pick up their units at midnight.', '‚ÄúWe have a lot of wonderful products that create buzz,‚Äù said Jason Bonfig, Best Buy‚Äôs senior executive vice president in charge of customer offerings and fulfillment. ‚ÄúSwitch is very, very special. They‚Äôre a passionate community.‚Äù', 'Bonfig estimated that 70% of Best Buy‚Äôs customers indicated they wanted to pick up their Switch 2s in-store, ‚Äúand the vast majority of those customers will be there at midnight to do so.‚Äù', '‚ÄúSomething about consumer electronics in general with that instant gratification is really important,‚Äù he added.', 'Meanwhile, the Nintendo Store is selling units at midnight only to those who secured reservations on its website, meaning many lining up outside its New York City location were doing so mostly for fun.', 'Nintendo even warned in a message on its website that ‚Äúdelivery by June 5 is not guaranteed‚Äù for customers who had not already secured pre-order invitations.', 'Though consumers have been fatigued by high prices amid the ongoing global trade war, Nintendo said in April that it would not hike the price of the $449.99 device at launch.', 'There is also hope among some in the gaming world that the Switch 2 could spur the creation of new games and therefore new jobs.

The $450 console officially went up for sale at midnight ET on June 5, with numerous retailers offering the device both online and in-store. Predictably, online stock dried up fairly quickly and remains highly limited as of Thursday evening.', 'Broadly speaking, it appears people have had a bit more luck by heading to a physical retail store. There‚Äôs still no guarantee that you‚Äôll be able to snag one that way, but a couple of Engadget staffers managed to grab a Switch 2 on Thursday at their local Target and GameStop, even with no pre-order in place.', 'If you can‚Äôt find the device out in the wild, your next best chance to get the Switch 2 online looks to be via Target. The retailer says it‚Äôll resume selling the console online in the ‚Äúearly morning‚Äù on Friday, June 6, though it hasn‚Äôt confirmed an exact time beyond that.', 'To make things a little easier for those still on the hunt, we‚Äôre rounding up all of the information we can find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch and tracking any restocks that pop up.', ""Walmart opened up online purchases at midnight on June 5, but both the console alone and Nintendo's Mario Kart World bundle remain out of stock as of our latest update. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations. The company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location, but it's worth checking if any store near you still has devices available."", ""Target began selling the Switch 2 in stores on June 5. The retailer has warned that supply will be limited, but some stores still appear to have the console in stock as of Thursday evening, so it's worth looking into the locations closest to you. Anecdotally, Engadget's Billy Steele was able to pick up the device at a Target just outside of Greensboro, North Carolina as late as 4:15pm ET on Thursday."", 'The company says it\'ll restock its online inventory in the ""early morning"" on Friday, June 6, while supplies last. That may be the next best opportunity to secure the Switch 2 without going to a store.', ""GameStop held launch events on Wednesday and is advertising in-store availability, though again this will vary by location.

But considering Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing."", ""Nintendo, meanwhile, is still only selling the Switch 2 via an invite system.

The company cautions that ""this time is an estimate ... battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions.""', 'Based on video Nintendo shared in the Nintendo Today app, one way the Switch 2 will extend the longevity of its battery over time is with a new ""battery preservation mode."" When enabled, your Switch 2 will stop charging when it reaches 90 percent, saving its battery from the wear and tear of charging to 100 percent every time.

However, it noted that ""certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2."" We now have more information on which games are working thanks to a guide Nintendo put together.', 'As of April 1, the vast majority of Switch 2 games are marked as compatible, but many popular games are said to have some issues. Nintendo has marked most of these as ‚Äúunder investigation,‚Äù suggesting a fix may be on the way in time for launch. Nintendo says it is manually testing every Switch game for compatibility.', 'Only one title is marked as incompatible: Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This was part of Nintendo‚Äôs Labo range of games that worked with Cardboard accessories, and is incompatible as the Switch 2 doesn‚Äôt physically fit in the VR headset.', ""The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run some of the late-generation software that's come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? That‚Äôs unclear. In an ‚ÄúAsk the Developer‚Äù page on its site, Nintendo says that old games are working through a real-time translation system, which sounds similar to how Rosetta allows modern Macs to run old software. With that said, the new and old Switch are much closer in hardware than that."", 'In the same developer interview, it‚Äôs said that in its testing of old games for compatibility, there were some occasions ‚Äúwhere loading times became faster, or game performance became more stable,‚Äù but we don‚Äôt have any detail beyond that.', 'As well as backward compatibility, Nintendo is also offering up premium ""Switch 2 Edition"" upgrades for a select few games.

How Nintendo dodged Trump‚Äôs tariffs and saved the Switch 2 release,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/05/nintendo-trump-tariffs-switch-2,"['Fortunate timing and government hesitation allowed the Switch 2 to come out on time, but the headache isn‚Äôt over', 'N\nintendo fans across the US are breathing a sigh of relief as they tear apart the boxes housing their new Nintendo Switch 2 video game consoles. On-again, off-again trade tariffs implemented by Donald Trump, which precipitated pre-order delays from Nintendo, made the 5 June release date of the highly coveted hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers‚Äô fears did not come to fruition.', 'Nintendo‚Äôs maneuvering around Trump‚Äôs tariffs isn‚Äôt over, though ‚Äì far from it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely within a 90-day tariff pause issued by the president. If tariffs on countries such as India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.', 'It‚Äôs possible that a Switch 2 bought during the holiday season will cost more than it did at launch date. Nintendo‚Äôs top gaming hardware competitors ‚Äì and essentially anyone shipping electronics to the US ‚Äì have been watching the Switch 2 saga with bated breath.', '‚ÄúWhat saved Nintendo in this case was that Trump chickened out,‚Äù Notre Dame professor and international economist Robert Johnson said.', 'Since its launch in March 2017, the Switch has become one of the best-selling video game consoles in history, with more than 150m units sold worldwide. Nintendo teased its successor in January and gave a full reveal during an 2 April live stream, announcing the device would ship on 5 June with a hefty $450 price tag in the US (or $500 when bundled with Mario Kart World). Just hours later, Trump stepped up to a podium at the Rose Garden, chart in tow, to announce a new volley of tariffs on imports on countries with a trade deficit with the US.', 'Among them: a 24% tariff on Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered, and a 46% tariff on Vietnam, where the bulk of its Switch manufacturing takes place. Stock markets plummeted as Nintendo fans collectively wondered whether the company would pass the costs of those steep duties on to them.', 'US pre-orders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin later that week on 9 April. Nintendo delayed that date so it could ‚Äúassess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions‚Äù. The 5 June release date, the company noted, would stay the same. Gamers flocked to various social media sites to vent their frustration ‚Äì much of it directed not at Nintendo, but at the Trump administration. Pre-orders resumed on 24 April and, predictably, the console quickly sold out.', 'Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for comment', 'Johnson notes that Nintendo, like many other consumer electronics makers, has spent years grappling with the question of where to produce.', 'In 2019, during the tail end of the first Trump administration, the gaming company began shifting production of the Switch from China to Vietnam in an effort to sidestep US tariffs on Chinese imports. Nintendo still manufactures some Switch products in China, but those units are typically shipped to non-US markets. Other major consumer tech companies, such as Apple, have similarly moved parts of their manufacturing operations from China to countries such as India to mitigate tariff impacts.', 'That strategy was ultimately rendered moot when the current administration announced a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, an unexpected move that Johnson says ‚Äúcaught virtually everyone off-guard‚Äù. These looming tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding them, could affect the pricing dynamics of nearly any consumer tech product entering the US.', 'Sony and Microsoft, both expected to release new consoles in 2027, will likely face similar challenges as Nintendo.', '‚ÄúIt takes a long time and significant capital outlays to bring new production facilities online. Producers really like to operate in a stable environment.‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThe current trade environment is the exact opposite of that.‚Äù', 'The ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù tariffs could easily have led to a higher Switch 2 price or a delayed release. But Nintendo managed to avoid that fate thanks to backpedaling by the Trump administration, a behavior described by the Financial Times using the acronym ‚Äútaco‚Äù ‚Äì short for ‚ÄúTrump always chickens out‚Äù. Trump‚Äôs call for a 90-day pause on tariffs to allow negotiations with targeted countries meant the Switch 2 could still be released during a window in which the import taxes wouldn‚Äôt apply.', 'And even if negotiations with Vietnam ultimately fail, reports estimate Nintendo has already shipped around 746,000 Switch 2 units to the US, which would not be subject to the higher tariffs.', 'Nintendo consumers will not walk away unscathed by tariffs. The company has said accessories for its device, a major part of the Switch‚Äôs dual form factor, will ‚Äúexperience price adjustments‚Äù. So far, according to CNBC, docks used to play the Switch on a full-size screen will cost $10 more than before, while straps for the two controllers will see a $1 increase. Johnson also said he wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nintendo considers raising the console‚Äôs price around the holiday season, especially if Trump moves forward with a 46% tariff on Vietnam.', '‚ÄúI find it difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will want thousands of stories written during the holiday season about how Trump ruined Christmas,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúSo I expect they‚Äôll find a way to climb down, but ‚Äì like everyone else ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure about that.‚Äù', 'But there‚Äôs another reason why Nintendo may have an incentive to keep console prices from climbing too high: the majority of its revenue doesn‚Äôt come from physical console sales. Increasingly, the real moneymakers ‚Äì for Nintendo and its competitors ‚Äì are software and online subscriptions, neither of which are subject to tariffs.', '‚ÄúIn the end, Nintendo wants to sell consoles to get people to buy games and accessories,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúAs a result, it may be willing to hold down the price of consoles.‚Äù']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHdlbWhsV0hSdU5YaFJZVkZ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZWmc0NXJ0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df

Like its predecessor, it‚Äôs a portable games machine with a built-in screen ‚Äì you can use as a handheld mini-console when you‚Äôre out and about, or slide it into the dedicated dock device and plug it into your TV via an HDMI cable for a big-screen experience at home. A little bigger than the original Switch, with a crisp, clear 7.9in LCD touch screen, as opposed to the old 6.2in display, it comes with two Joy-Con controllers, which are chunkier than the previous versions. These now attach magnetically to each side of the screen with a pleasing clunk, replacing the fiddly sliding mechanism that most Switch owners disliked. They‚Äôve also got bigger L and R buttons on the top, which sounds like a minor detail but is a huge deal for anyone trying to perfect their Mario Kart power-slides.', 'The tech inside the Switch 2 is a lot more advanced than the previous console, featuring a custom nVidia processor, and a screen capable of displaying at 4K resolution (when plugged into a compatible TV) or 1920x1080 resolution in portable mode. It‚Äôs also got 5.1 surround sound, and supports high-dynamic range lighting (HDR) graphical effects at frame rates of up to 120hz. This brings the Switch 2 almost up to scratch with other modern consoles: most experts are placing its tech specs somewhere between the PS4 and PS5, or between Xbox One and Xbox Series X.', 'The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with the console itself, two Joy-Con controllers, a power adaptor and USB-C charging cable, a dock, a Joy-Con grip (which allows you to connect the two Joy-Cons together to create a traditional-looking games controller), and two Joy-Con wrist straps to stop them flying out of your hands.', 'Nintendo is going big on the social features of the console. Its GameShare function will allow you to play compatible games with other people who don‚Äôt own a copy ‚Äì they just need their own Switch or a Switch 2, and can play along in the room with you or connect online. This is particularly important for families sharing one copy of a game. Meanwhile, GameChat is kind of like Zoom, but for games: you can invite a bunch of pals into a group video chat session where you can talk to each other while playing the same game, playing different games, or just hanging out. If you all buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera you‚Äôll be able to see little video windows of each other on the screen, too. GameChat requires a paid subscription to Nintendo‚Äôs online gaming service, which costs ¬£17.99 (US$19.99/‚Ç¨19.99/A$29.95) a year or ¬£3.49 (US$3.99/‚Ç¨3.99/A$5.95) a month, but is free until 31 March.', 'The console is launching with around 25 games, though many of these are enhanced versions of older Switch titles. The big newcomers are Mario Kart World, an open-world take on the classic karting game; the introductory game Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour; the co-op survival challenge Survival Kids and anti-gravity racer, Fast Fusion. Some favourites making it across are Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom. Most games will retail for between ¬£45‚Äì¬£70 and will be available to buy and download online, or as physical boxed copies. You can also still play almost all your old Switch games on the new console, and there‚Äôs a huge back catalogue of retro NES, Nintendo 64, SNES and GameCube classics from the 1980s, 90s and 00s available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.', 'There are three things you may want to buy alongside the console. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller is a traditional console joypad intended for serious play. Then you have the Nintendo Switch 2 camera, basically a webcam compatible with the GameChat service, but also with any games that might use camera features. You may also want a microSD Express card to provide additional storage for your games.', 'If you haven‚Äôt pre-ordered, you may have to be patient and shop around. Some of the larger retailers including Amazon, Argos, Currys and John Lewis are saying they may have a few in stock today and it‚Äôs worth trying Nintendo‚Äôs online store. Be extremely wary of buying from private sellers on eBay or similar sites ‚Äì there will be a lot of con artists out there. Remember when people found their PlayStation 5 deliveries were instead full of bags of rice?']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHdlbWhsV0hSdU5YaFJZVkZ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZWmc0NXJ0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df
