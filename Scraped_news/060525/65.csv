Some continuously devour gas and dust, glowing eerily as matter spirals inward. Others, however, lie in wait for years, lurking undetected until an unsuspecting star drifts too close.', 'A new study utilizing NASA, ESA, and ground-based observatories has captured three extreme examples of supermassive black holes violently consuming massive stars. These eruptions unleashed more energy than 100 supernovae, making them the most powerful cosmic explosions seen since the Big Bang.', 'Each black hole resides at the heart of a distant galaxy and was silent for years—until a star three to ten times heavier than the Sun wandered too close. In an instant, the black hole tore it apart, triggering an intense outburst that lasted for months, illuminating the cosmos like a celestial beacon.', 'Black holes are notorious for their invisibility, but every so often, the cosmos offers a rare glimpse into their hidden power. Scientists have identified a new class of cosmic events known as extreme nuclear transients—violent outbursts that illuminate some of the universe’s most massive, ordinarily silent black holes.', '“These events are the only way we can have a spotlight that we can shine on otherwise inactive massive black holes,” said Jason Hinkle, lead author of a new study.', '“These events unleash enormous amounts of high-energy radiation on the central regions of their host galaxies. This has implications for the environments in which these events occur. If galaxies have these events, they’re important for the galaxies themselves.”', 'When a star meets its doom in a black hole’s grip, it doesn’t vanish quietly—it erupts in high-energy light, taking over 100 days to reach its brightest point before slowly fading over 150 days. This violent process sends ripples through space, affecting its surroundings and producing lower-energy emissions that telescopes can pick up.', 'One such event, nicknamed “Barbie,” was first spotted in 2020 by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California. Two others were detected earlier by ESA’s Gaia mission in 2016 and 2018.', 'NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory played a crucial role in confirming these were black hole-feeding frenzies, not supernova explosions or other cosmic disturbances. The way the X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical light flared and faded was a perfect match to the telltale signature of a star being torn apart.', 'NASA’s WISE spacecraft initially operated from 2009 to 2011 before being reactivated as NEOWISE, played a crucial role in uncovering the dusty environments surrounding black holes, a role it continued until its retirement in 2024. By mapping the sky in infrared wavelengths, WISE enabled scientists to detect new cosmic phenomena and distant objects in the universe’s most extreme regions.', 'Numerous ground-based observatories also contributed to the findings, including the W. M. Keck Observatory and several NASA-supported Near-Earth Object surveys, such as ATLAS, Pan-STARRS, and Catalina. Together, these powerful tools helped researchers identify the chemical fingerprints of these high-energy events.', '“This work is exciting because we’re pushing the upper bounds of what we understand to be the most energetic environments of the universe,” said Anna Payne, co-author of the study and scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute.', 'Funding from NASA’s FINEST grant enabled Jason Hinkle to track down and analyze these rare cosmic events. Ben Shappee, a study co-author and astronomy professor at the University of Hawaii, emphasized its impact, saying, “The FINEST grant gave Jason the freedom to figure out what these events were.', 'Journal Reference:', 'Picks for you', '© 2025 All Rights Reserved, Tech Explorist®']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZTbTlGTUMxa1NYQlZaRmhTVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZcHNvd1J1UVU=-w280-h168-p-df
Astronomers Just Found the Most Powerful Cosmic Event Since the Big Bang. It’s At Least 25 Times Stronger Than Any Supernova,https://www.zmescience.com/space/most-powerful-cosmic-event-since-big-bang/,"['Home → Space', 'The rare blasts outshine supernovae and reshape how we study black holes.', 'In the heart of distant galaxies, astronomers have witnessed the most violent stellar death throes ever recorded.', 'A massive star, several times heavier than our Sun, strays too close to the gravitational abyss of a supermassive black hole. It does not explode, not in the conventional sense. Instead, it unravels — shredded by tidal forces, stretched into a stream of stellar debris, and fed to the black hole like spaghetti into a maw. As this cosmic banquet begins, a brilliant flare of light ignites, bright enough to pierce billions of light-years of darkness. It persists not for seconds or hours, but for years.', 'Move over, supernovae. Astronomers call these phenomena Extreme Nuclear Transients, or ENTs. And they are, quite simply, the most energetic single events the universe has ever shown us since the Big Bang.', '“We’ve observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts,” said Jason Hinkle, the University of Hawaiʻi astronomer who led the discovery. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'The research team first spotted signs of ENTs while combing through public data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission. Hinkle noticed two mysterious flares, Gaia16aaw and Gaia18cdj, that didn’t fit any known pattern. Their light curves were smooth and brightened gradually, standing in stark contrast to the erratic flickers of typical black hole outbursts or the sudden flashes of supernovae.', 'Then came the kicker. A third event, AT2021lwx, was detected independently by the Zwicky Transient Facility. It too shone with a quiet, persistent intensity. “When I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies,” Hinkle said, “I knew we were looking at something unusual.”', 'The brightness was just the beginning. These events weren’t just unusual—they were off the cosmic charts. The most luminous of the group, Gaia18cdj, released 2.5 × 10⁵³ ergs of energy — 25 times more than the most powerful known supernovae. For comparison, our Sun will produce just one ten-billionth of that energy over its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.', 'These were no ordinary explosions. Supernovae couldn’t explain the observations. Neither could the chaotic feeding habits of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), where black holes devour surrounding material. ENTs evolved too smoothly, emitted too much energy, and lasted far too long.', ""Join 20,000+ curious minds who subscribe to ZME Science's best stories."", ""Don't worry. You can unsubscribe anytime. Before signing up, review our Privacy Policy."", '', 'Instead, the team zeroed in on a more exotic possibility: the tidal disruption of a massive star — a stellar body more than three times the mass of our Sun — by an ultramassive black hole, some hundreds of millions of times heavier than the Sun.', 'As the doomed star strays too close to the black hole, immense gravitational forces tear it apart. The debris forms a temporary disk around the black hole, slowly falling inward and heating up to extreme temperatures. This process releases a sustained blaze of radiation — one that can outshine entire galaxies for months or years.', 'To confirm this scenario, Hinkle and his team launched a years-long observational campaign using facilities including the W. M. Keck Observatory and NASA’s Swift satellite. They tracked each ENT across the electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to infrared.', 'The ENTs’ spectra glowed with hot, blue light and broad hydrogen lines, both hallmarks of high-energy accretion onto a black hole. Their blackbody temperatures hovered around 15,000 Kelvin, consistent with models of tidal disruption. And their host galaxies, located at redshifts near 1, placed the events around 7 to 8 billion years in the past — an epoch when star formation and black hole growth were both at their peak.', '“ENTs provide a valuable new tool for studying massive black holes in distant galaxies,” said co-author Benjamin Shappee. “Because they’re so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distances — and in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time.”', 'But, even in a sky filled with telescopes, ENTs are vanishingly rare.', 'The study estimates their rate at about one per thousand cubic gigaparsecs per year — a volume equivalent to roughly 30 million Milky Way-sized galaxies. That’s 10,000 times rarer than ordinary supernovae.', 'Their scarcity isn’t surprising. For an ENT to occur, a rare set of cosmic coincidences must align. A massive star must exist in the central region of a galaxy, a supermassive black hole must be present, and the star must drift close enough to be destroyed — but not swallowed whole.', 'Even then, many ENTs may go unseen. Their dust-shrouded environments may obscure the flare in visible light, and some events may fail to trigger standard detection algorithms. In fact, Gaia itself missed AT2021lwx — likely due to interference from a bright nearby star.', 'These violent deaths offer more than a fireworks show. They illuminate the invisible. Because ENTs trace interactions between stars and black holes, they open a new window into the mysterious lives of supermassive black holes in distant galaxies — especially those that lie dormant most of the time.', 'They also push the boundaries of known physics. The sheer energy of ENTs rules out many mechanisms, from radioactive decay in supernovae to spinning magnetars or dense clumps of stellar debris.', '“No stellar explosion model can account for what we’re seeing,” the authors write. Instead, ENTs belong to a new — and extreme — frontier of astrophysics.', '“These ENTs don’t just mark the dramatic end of a massive star’s life,” Hinkle said. “They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe.”', 'Astronomers have just discovered them, but the future of ENT discovery already looks promising. Two next-generation observatories — the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile and NASA’s Roman Space Telescope — are expected to dramatically improve the odds of spotting these rare events. Their wide-field surveys and infrared sensitivity could reveal ENTs from the early universe, as far back as 12 billion years ago.', 'If so, these cataclysms could become cosmic signposts — blinking beacons that map the rise of supermassive black holes across time and space.', 'For now, though, the ENTs remain exceptional and few.', 'The findings appeared in the journal Science Advances.', '', '', 'Tibi is a science journalist and co-founder of ZME Science.

Stars burn like celestial nuclear fusion reactors, quasars emit thousands of times the luminosity of the Milky Way galaxy, and asteroids slam into planets. But all of these pale in comparison to a new class of events discovered by researchers at the University of Hawai’i’s Institute for Astronomy (IfA). According to their findings published June 4 in the journal Science Advances, it’s time to classify the universe’s most energetic explosions as extreme nuclear transients–or ENTs.', 'ENTs are as devastating as they are rare. They only occur when a massive star at least three times heavier than the sun drifts too close to a supermassive black hole. The colliding forces subsequently obliterate the star, sending out plumes of energy across huge swaths of space. Similar events known as tidal disruption events (TDEs) are known to occur on a (comparatively) smaller scale, and have been documented for over a decade. But ENTs are something else entirely.', '“ENTs are different beasts,” study lead author and astronomer Jason Hinkle explained in an accompanying statement. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'Hinkle was first tipped off to ENTs while looking into transients—longlasting flares that spew energy from a galaxy’s center. Two particularly strange examples captured by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission caught his eye. The pair of events brightened over a much longer timeframe than previously documented transients, but lacked some of their usual characteristics.', '“Gaia doesn’t tell you what a transient is, just that something changed in brightness,” Hinkle said. “But when I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual.”', 'Hinkle soon reached out to observatory teams around the world for what would become a multiyear project to understand these anomalies. In the process, a third suspect was detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego. After months of analysis, Hinkle and collaborators realized they were witnessing something unprecedented.', 'The ENTs analyzed by astronomers displayed smoother, longer lasting flares that pointed towards something very particular—a supermassive black hole accreting a giant, wayward star.', 'This contrasts with a more standard black hole that typically acquires its material and energy unpredictably, resulting in irregular brightness fluctuations.', 'The energy and luminosity of an ENT boggles the mind. The most powerful ENT documented in Hinkle’s study, Gaia18cdj, generated 25 times more energy than the most powerful known supernovae. For reference, a standard supernova puts out as much energy in a single year as the sun does across its entire 10 billion year lifespan. Gaia18cdj, meanwhile, manages to give off 100 suns’ worth of energy over just 12 months.', 'The implications of ENTs and their massive energy surges go far beyond their impressive energy outputs.

This is NASA’s latest discovery, which is not only historic but also slightly frightening. This monster already has a name, and we already know where it lives, so it’s best not to get too close, even though it’s basically impossible at that distance.', 'It’s no surprise to anyone that black holes have always been a topic that attracts the attention of not only scientists, but society as a whole, whether out of curiosity, fascination or even fear that one day they will come too close to us and destroy our universe. That’s why NASA scientists are always monitoring these events; after all, the more information, the better.', 'That’s why, in May of this year, NASA used the Hubble Space Telescope together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to make a historic discovery: they found a solitary supermassive black hole that consumed a star in a rather shocking way.', 'This event has even been named; it’s called AT2024tvd, and it occurred 600 million light-years from Earth. But why is this so historic? Well, it revealed a very rare type of cosmic phenomenon that could change the way we understand the evolution of galaxies. And it’s not just about the phenomenon itself, but also the place where it happened and what it means for us from now on.', 'If we think about other black holes we’ve seen around (not in the literal sense, of course), we’ll realize that they follow a pattern: they exist at the center of galaxies, as a kind of gravitational core that attracts matter, gas, and stars (like the one found inside a solar system). However, this didn’t happen with AT2024tvd. Scientists realized that they weren’t facing a supernova as usual, but a TDE (tidal disruption event). What does that mean? It’s the moment when a star is torn apart by the gravitational forces of a hungry black hole.', 'And as if that fact wasn’t shocking enough in itself, scientists also realized that this TDE didn’t happen at the heart of the galaxy, but 2,600 light-years away from the center, where another, even larger black hole already exists. This revelation became a milestone for the first time we found a “displaced” TDE, that is, it was caused by a wandering black hole.', '“AT2024tvd is the first deflected translational event captured by optical sky surveys and opens up the possibility of discovering this elusive population of wandering black holes in future sky surveys”, said Yuhan Yao of the University of California, Berkeley, lead author of the study.', 'This discovery, besides shocking everyone right away, is historic because it shows us that giant black holes are wandering through the cosmos, invisible to most of our tools here on Earth. Except when they devour a star out of nowhere and emit a luminous signal that basically screams their presence… The place where all this happened is also striking, because it is in a dark, silent and apparently empty region, unlike the usual.', 'We can say that it was like a flash, similar to a bright blue dot, and highlighted against the orange tone of the galaxy. All this light was from the spaghettification process of the star, whose remains were heated to millions of degrees before being swallowed.

Astronomers detect most powerful explosions since Big Bang,https://www.yahoo.com/news/astronomers-detect-most-powerful-explosions-193911764.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'At any given time across the universe, massive cosmic bodies are releasing incomprehensible amounts of energy. Stars burn like celestial nuclear fusion reactors, quasars emit thousands of times the luminosity of the Milky Way galaxy, and asteroids slam into planets. But all of these pale in comparison to a new class of events discovered by researchers at the University of Hawai’i’s Institute for Astronomy (IfA). According to their findings published June 4 in the journal Science Advances, it’s time to classify the universe’s most energetic explosions as extreme nuclear transients–or ENTs.', 'ENTs are as devastating as they are rare. They only occur when a massive star at least three times heavier than the sun drifts too close to a supermassive black hole. The colliding forces subsequently obliterate the star, sending out plumes of energy across huge swaths of space. Similar events known as tidal disruption events (TDEs) are known to occur on a (comparatively) smaller scale, and have been documented for over a decade. But ENTs are something else entirely.', '“ENTs are different beasts,” study lead author and astronomer Jason Hinkle explained in an accompanying statement. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'Hinkle was first tipped off to ENTs while looking into transients—longlasting flares that spew energy from a galaxy’s center. Two particularly strange examples captured by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission caught his eye. The pair of events brightened over a much longer timeframe than previously documented transients, but lacked some of their usual characteristics.', '“Gaia doesn’t tell you what a transient is, just that something changed in brightness,” Hinkle said. “But when I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual.”', 'Hinkle soon reached out to observatory teams around the world for what would become a multiyear project to understand these anomalies. In the process, a third suspect was detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego. After months of analysis, Hinkle and collaborators realized they were witnessing something unprecedented.', 'The ENTs analyzed by astronomers displayed smoother, longer lasting flares that pointed towards something very particular—a supermassive black hole accreting a giant, wayward star.', 'This contrasts with a more standard black hole that typically acquires its material and energy unpredictably, resulting in irregular brightness fluctuations.', 'The energy and luminosity of an ENT boggles the mind. The most powerful ENT documented in Hinkle’s study, Gaia18cdj, generated 25 times more energy than the most powerful known supernovae. For reference, a standard supernova puts out as much energy in a single year as the sun does across its entire 10 billion year lifespan. Gaia18cdj, meanwhile, manages to give off 100 suns’ worth of energy over just 12 months.', 'The implications of ENTs and their massive energy surges go far beyond their impressive energy outputs. Astronomers believe they contribute to some of the most pivotal events in the cosmos.', '“These ENTs don’t just mark the dramatic end of a massive star’s life. They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe,” said Hinkle.', 'From here on Earth, ENTs can also help researchers as they continue studying massive, distant black holes.', '“Because they’re so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distances—and in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time,” explained study co-author and astronomer Benjamin Shappee. “By observing these prolonged flares, we gain insights into black hole growth when the universe was half its current age… forming stars and feeding their supermassive black holes 10 times more vigorously than they do today.”', 'There’s a catch for astronomers, however. While supernovae are relatively well-documented, ENTs are estimated to occur at least 10 million times less often.

The latest victim who attempted friendship with one of these hungry giants ended up causing the most energetic explosion to ever occur in the universe.', 'In a new study, published in Science Advances, a team of astronomers from the University of Hawai’i describes what they are calling “extreme nuclear transients” (ENTs). ENTs occur when stars more than three times the weight of the Sun get too close to a supermassive black hole. In response, the black hole slowly drains the life out of the star, creating a bright, energy surge unlike anything we’ve ever observed before.', '“We’ve observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts, reaching brightnesses nearly ten times more than what we typically see,” said Jason Hinkle, who led the study, in a press release. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'The amount of energy and brightness emitted by ENTs is unusual and unequaled in the history of the cosmos. The closest energy bursts to rival ENTs are supernovae, which are when stars explode in colossal fashion. Supernovae are extraordinary phenomena, with each explosion emitting the same amount of energy in one year as our Sun does in its entire lifetime. ', 'But even the most energetic supernova ever observed pales in comparison to an ENT, which emits 25 times more energy. A single ENT dwarfs the power of a supernova, radiating the energy of 100 Suns in the same time period a supernova radiates the energy of one Sun.', 'Read More: Supernova Helps Explain the Creation of Cosmic Dust Storms in Elliptical Galaxies', 'The team at the University of Hawai’i knew the phenomena they were observing weren’t supernovae and were curious as to what they were looking at and how these events radiated so much bright energy. Getting the answer took a global effort, and lots of time and patience, as ENTs take several years to fully evolve.', 'What they discovered was that the secret to these bright, energy emissions from the ENTs lay in black hole anatomy. As we know, black holes are able to grow thanks to their voracious consumption of matter — a process called accretion. ', 'After looking at the massive energy budget of ENTs and their distinct appearance, astronomers were able to land on accretion to explain what was happening between the star and the supermassive black hole. Pictures of ENTs show smooth, long-lasting curves of light that indicate the black hole is slowly ripping the star apart in order to grow bigger itself.', '“These ENTs don’t just mark the dramatic end of a massive star’s life. They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe,” said Hinkle in the press release.', 'The discovery and observation of ENTs is allowing astronomers to time-travel to a distant past without having to leave the comfort of their telescope. Although ENTs are rare, occurring 10 million times less frequently than supernovae, continuous monitoring of the cosmos can provide new insights into these events that will revolutionize our understanding of black hole activity.', '“ENTs provide a valuable new tool for studying supermassive black holes in distant galaxies.

While such events have been witnessed before, astronomers say some of the ones recently discovered are powerful enough to be classified as a new phenomenon: extreme nuclear transients (ENTs).', '""We\'ve observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts, reaching brightnesses nearly ten times more than what we typically see,"" said Jason Hinkle, a researcher at the University of Hawaii\'s Institute for Astronomy (IfA) who led a study on these events, in a statement. ""When I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual.""', ""Hinkle discovered the existence of these ENTs while combing through data gathered on long-lasting flares originating from galactic centers. Two flares caught Hinkle's eye, recorded by the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft in 2016 and 2018, respectively."", ""A third event discovered in 2020 by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) appeared similar to the two phenomena discovered by Gaia, which gave researchers clues that these belonged to a new class of extreme cosmic explosions. That's because these events appeared to release far more energy than other known star explosions, or supernovas, and seemed to last much longer."", 'These explosions also differed from tidal disruption events (TDEs), which are massive releases of energy that occur when extreme gravitational forces around black holes rip stars apart, flinging much of their mass outward into space. But TDEs typically last only a matter of hours; the events studied by Hinkle and other researchers appeared to last much longer. ""Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions,"" Hinkle said in the statement.', 'One of these ENTs, which astronomers have named Gaia18cdj, released over 25 times more energy than the most powerful supernova ever discovered, more than the amount of energy that would be released by 100 suns throughout their entire lifetime.', 'RELATED STORIES:', '— The most powerful explosions in the universe could reveal where gold comes from', ""— 'Shocking' nova explosion of dead star was 100 times brighter than the sun"", ""— Astronomers discover black hole ripping a star apart inside a galactic collision. 'It is a peculiar event'"", ""Aside from being the most powerful known explosions in the universe, ENTs can help astronomers learn more about monster black holes in faraway galaxies. That's because the incredible brightness of these events means they can be seen across vast distances, according to IfA's Benjamin Shappee, who co-authored the study."", '""By observing these prolonged flares, we gain insights into black hole growth when the universe was half its current age and galaxies were busy places — forming stars and feeding their supermassive black holes 10 times more vigorously than they do today,"" Shappee said in the statement.', 'A study on this discovery was published June 4 in the journal Science Advances.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZTbTlGTUMxa1NYQlZaRmhTVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZcHNvd1J1UVU=-w280-h168-p-df
