“Collision With Earth Is Real”: NASA Simulation Reveals Venus Asteroids Could Annihilate Entire Regions in the Coming Millennia,https://www.sustainability-times.com/research/collision-with-earth-is-real-nasa-simulation-reveals-venus-asteroids-could-annihilate-entire-regions-in-the-coming-millennia/,"['', '', '', '', 'Recent discoveries have unveiled a new threat to our planet: hidden asteroids that co-orbit with Venus could potentially collide with Earth. Known as Venus co-orbitals, these asteroids are difficult to detect from our vantage point due to their unique orbital path, mirroring that of Venus around the Sun. Over recent years, scientists have only identified around 20 of these asteroids. However, new research indicates that there may be a much larger, yet unseen population that could pose a threat to Earth. This emerging evidence calls for a re-evaluation of our asteroid detection and planetary defense strategies.', 'The asteroids orbiting in sync with Venus, classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), pose a significant challenge to astronomers. These asteroids are characterized by their size, at least 460 feet in diameter, and their potential proximity to Earth, coming within 4.6 million miles of our planet’s orbit. The challenge lies in whether these asteroids truly threaten Earth. Current detection methods are limited by short observation windows and the Sun’s glare, making these asteroids particularly elusive.', 'Adding to the complexity is the concept of “Lyapunov time,” which refers to the period after which an asteroid’s orbit becomes chaotic and unpredictable. For Venus co-orbitals, this time is approximately 150 years. While scientists can track their paths for a while, the longer-term behavior remains uncertain. This unpredictability complicates efforts to determine if any of these asteroids might have a close encounter or collision with Earth in the future.', '“The Oldest Algebra Problem Solved”: Australian Mathematician Cracks Ancient Mystery That Baffled Minds for Over 4,000 Years', '', 'To evaluate the threat posed by these asteroids, researchers have conducted extensive 36,000-year orbital simulations. The simulations revealed a substantial population of potential co-orbitals capable of approaching or even colliding with Earth. The study highlights asteroids with eccentricities below 0.38 as particularly concerning, as these orbits could lead to close encounters with our planet.', 'Understanding eccentricity is crucial here—it measures how elongated an asteroid’s orbit is. An orbit with an eccentricity of 0 is perfectly circular, while higher numbers indicate more elliptical paths. The findings underscore the need for enhanced detection capabilities. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory, with its powerful camera, promises to improve our ability to spot these elusive objects. Yet, even this advanced technology might not cover the entire population. A more comprehensive solution may involve deploying a space-based observatory or a constellation of spacecraft near Venus.', '“Dark Energy Just Got Stranger”: Groundbreaking Discovery Shakes the Foundations of How We Understand the Entire Universe', '', 'NASA has already initiated planetary defense measures, such as the successful DART asteroid mission, to prepare for potential asteroid impacts. This mission aims to prevent catastrophic events similar to the one that led to the dinosaurs’ extinction. However, accurately predicting the paths of Venus co-orbitals is essential for any successful deflection or mitigation efforts.', 'The study on these asteroids has been shared on the pre-print server arXiv.org and submitted for publication in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. As the scientific community continues to evaluate these findings, the need for international collaboration in monitoring and potentially mitigating these threats becomes increasingly clear. The potential risk these asteroids pose underscores the importance of advancing our understanding and technology to safeguard our planet.', '“I’m Almost Certain There Are Inhabited Planets”: Astrophysicist Drops Chilling Statement That Shakes Our Place in the Universe', '', 'Despite its similar size and proximity to Earth, Venus remains a planet full of mysteries. Its hostile environment, with extreme temperatures and pressures, makes it an unlikely candidate for human exploration. Yet, it continues to capture the imagination of scientists and researchers worldwide. The discovery of Venus co-orbitals adds another layer of intrigue to our understanding of the planet and its potential impact on Earth.', 'As scientists work to uncover more about these asteroids, the need for sophisticated detection methods and international cooperation becomes evident. The secrets Venus holds may one day prove vital to our survival. As we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: How can we best utilize our growing astronomical capabilities to protect Earth from these celestial threats?', 'Did you like it? \n4.6/5 (25)', 'News, investigations, and analysis — our top stories every morning to start your day right.', '', '', 'Rosemary Potter is a Chicago-based journalist for Sustainability Times, covering global sustainability challenges, environmental policy, science, business and climate resilience.

The first, the U.S.-owned Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile is set to officially come online in the next few weeks. With a huge field-of-view, it can see huge swathes of the night sky at once, and its giant nest of mirrors can gather so much starlight than even the smallest, faintest objects can be seen.', 'In just three to six months, the observatory could find as many as a million new asteroids, effectively doubling the current total. Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist at Queen’s University Belfast who was not involved with the new research, explains that Rubin will also conduct its own twilight surveys, the very sort used today to search for near-Venus asteroids.', 'If these surveys are conducted over the next decade, “Rubin could find as many as 40 to 50 percent of all objects larger than about [1,150 feet] in the interior-to-Venus-orbit population,” says Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington and who was not involved with the new research. But, as with all ground-based optical telescopes, Rubin will still have the sun’s glare, and Earth’s atmosphere, to contend with.', 'As long as the federal government decides to continue to fund the mission—something that is not guaranteed—NASA will also launch a dedicated asteroid-hunting space observatory, the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, in the next few years. Unobstructed by Earth’s atmosphere, it will seek out space rocks by viewing them through a highly-sensitive infrared scope, meaning it can see those hidden by the luminous sun.', 'Even those asteroids sneaking around near Venus won’t be able to hide from NEO Surveyor. And, finally, says Carruba, “we can see if the impact threat is real, or not.”']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXdVVmhhY0dObmRGSTVVSGxZVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZSlZJSkpLZ1k=-w280-h168-p-df

There are currently 20 known co-orbitals around Venus — ranging from ""Trojan asteroids,"" which are fixed either in front of or behind a planet in its orbital plane, to a closely circling ""quasimoon,"" known as Zoozve — all of which likely originated from the solar system\'s main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Dozens of similar co-orbitals also tag along with Earth, and more are being discovered all the time.', 'All of the Venusian space rocks are likely wider than 460 feet (140 meters) — large enough to be considered ""city killers,"" meaning they could potentially wipe out a heavily populated area if they impacted our planet.', 'Although the co-orbitals pose no threat to us from afar, a close approach to Earth could cause them to be pulled away from their gravitational anchor — and thus put them on a collision course with our planet. Venus is one of our closest neighbors and comes closer to Earth than any other planet — within around 25 million miles (40 million km) at its nearest point — making its trailing asteroids a credible threat to our world.', 'Related: Undiscovered extra moons may orbit Earth.
