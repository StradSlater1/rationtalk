', 'This announcement marks a historic Broadway first: never before has a live play ever been televised!', '“I can’t tell you how exciting it is to do something that’s never been done. CNN is the perfect place to bring this story of courage to so many more people than we could have ever hoped. Live TV. No net. Buckle up everyone,” shared George Clooney in the official press release.', 'George Clooney, a two-time Academy Award® winner and Tony Award® nominee, makes his Broadway debut as Edward R. Murrow, showcasing his legendary, history-altering, on-air showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy. As McCarthyism casts a shadow over America, Murrow and his news team choose to confront the growing tide of paranoia and propaganda, even if it means turning the federal government and a worried nation against them. Good Night, and Good Luck closes its theatrical run with a matinee performance on Sunday, June 8 in New York City.', '“Good Night, and Good Luck is not just a celebration of a golden age in TV journalism,” said Chairman and CEO of CNN, Mark Thompson. “It’s also about the importance of the free press and the need for strong news organizations to report the facts in a fair-minded way.

"'Good Night, and Good Luck,' airing June 7 on CNN, draws parallels between 1950s and 2025",https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/television/2025/06/05/good-night-and-good-luck-airing-on-cnn-at-a-dark-time-for-tv-news/83902173007/,"['In a scene from the 2005 movie “Good Night, and Good Luck,” CBS News legend Edward R. Murrow is anchoring an episode of ""See It Now"" about Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator who shot to fame with his claims that more than 200 “card-carrying” communists had infiltrated the U.S. Department of State.', ""After reviewing McCarthy's unsubstantiated accusations and false claims for viewers, Murrow notes that the politician didn’t create the climate of fear that exists in 1950s America, the era of the Red Scare. McCarthy is just exploiting it. "", 'Quoting from Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” Murrow says, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves,” an eloquent way of saying that most people are too afraid of becoming his next target to confront McCarthy about his smear tactics.', 'The acclaimed movie starring and co-written by George Clooney is a stirring tribute to journalism and a cautionary tale of what leaders will do in their quest for power. The script is peppered with references to due process under the law, the right of habeas corpus and freedom of speech, all principles mentioned in the Constitution that were under assault by McCarthy.', 'When CNN airs a live broadcast of the Broadway adaptation of “Good Night, and Good Luck” at 7 p.m. on June 7, the parallels to 2025 will be obvious to anyone who has been paying attention to the latest headlines. But the takeaway from Murrow’s courageous stand may not be the same today as it was 20 years ago.', 'The fault, dear viewers, is not in our stars, but at least partly in our news media.', ""CNN is doing a fairly extraordinary thing by showing the hit play, which has earned five Tony nominations and been available only to those who are in New York City and able to afford the exorbitant ticket prices. A quick online search this week for June 6's evening performance revealed a handful of seats were still available for $329 to $849 each."", 'Clooney and his filmmaking partner, Grant Heslov (producer and co-writer of the original movie), are behind the production, which has broken box-office records. As in the movie, Clooney again leads the cast. Only this time, the older and grayer superstar has switched from playing “See It Now” co-creator and producer Fred Friendly to portraying Murrow (a part filled on the big screen with melancholy gravitas by David Strathairn).', 'The CNN broadcast will be the first time a live Broadway play has been televised. So why would a cable news network be the one making TV history? Because this isn\'t ""The Lion King"" or ""Sunset Boulevard."" Although the narrative is set in 1954, the questions raised by ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" are similar to those being asked now about to President Donald Trump’s attempts to redefine executive power as something so vast and unfettered that it overshadows the other two branches of government, Congress and the judiciary, and, possibly, the Constitution itself.', 'Like the popular phrase says, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”', 'The movie version of ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" like ""All the President\'s Men,"" is one of the best arguments for watchdog reporting ever put on the big screen. Yet watching it through the lens of 2025, there is a certain sadness The movie now feels a bit like an elegy for broadcast journalism and a critique of how TV news may be rushing its own demise.', 'In the movie, the standoff between Murrow and McCarthy begins quietly enough after a staff meeting, when Murrow casually asks Friendly, “You ever spend any time in Detroit?”', 'Murrow brings up a Detroit News story on a man from Dexter, Michigan, Milo Radulovich, who has been thrown out of the Air Force because, essentially, his dad read a Serbian newspaper. The charges against him were kept in a sealed envelope and not shown to him or his attorney. “He was declared guilty without a trial and told if he wanted to keep his job, he’d have to denounce his father and his sister. … He told them to take a hike,” says Murrow.', 'A CBS News team is dispatched to Michigan to interview Radulovich, even though the network’s business side would rather leave the matter alone. Despite that and the military’s stonewalling of requests for comment, Murrow stands firm on the need to do the reporting. “I’ve searched my conscience. I can’t for the life of me find any justification for this,” he says of Radulovich’s predicament. “I simply cannot accept that there are, on every story, two equal and logical sides to an argument.”', ""On the air, Murrow puts it in even plainer words. Referring to what was inside that sealed envelope that decided Radulovich's fate, he asks: “Was it hearsay, rumor, gossip, slander or hard, ascertainable facts that could be backed by credible witnesses? We do not know.”"", 'Murrow keeps on examining McCarthy’s scare tactics, telling viewers that dissent must not be confused with disloyalty. ""We must remember always that accusation is not proof,"" he says, ""and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of the law.”', 'The movie’s image of TV journalists is, admittedly, nostalgically romantic and severely outdated. Newsrooms are no longer limited, thank goodness, to white men in white dress shirts with rolled-up sleeves who smoke cigarettes and drink Scotch habitually. The technology and speed of news delivery has evolved beyond anything Murrow could have imagined.', 'Yet “Good Night, and Good Luck” is also a reminder of how much influence TV news has lost as a trusted information source since the days of Murrow. Corporate media owners no longer care as much about the prestige of having a top-notch news team or the civic responsibility of staffing it adequately. When ratings go down, so does their funding.', ""Cable news has devolved into too little in-depth reporting and too many partisan pundits offering predictable opinions on the topics that drive those ratings. Broadcast networks don't really focus on news anymore beyond their nightly 30 minutes and their puffy morning shows. So-called newsmagazines airing in prime time have become a vast wasteland of true crimes and celebrity scandals, aside from “60 Minutes” on CBS."", 'Even ""60 Minutes,"" as popular as it is respected, seems under threat. This spring, its executive producer, Bill Owens, quit over interference in his journalistic independence. Not long after, CBS News head Wendy McMahon parted ways as tensions remain over Trump\'s $20-billion lawsuit against CBS News over a ""60 Minutes"" report on then-Vice President Kamala Harris.', ""It is difficult now to picture a modern-day version of “See It Now” outside of PBS, which is facing its own existential woes with the White House's request to Congress to take back more than $1 billion in funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."", 'Who will be our Murrow, the person trusted enough by both sides of the political divide to encourage a national conversation that fosters unity? Can there even be a Murrow-like figure in an age when so many people are dismissing traditional news outlets as the lamestream media and relying instead on Tik-Tok, extremist podcasters, YouTube influencers and other dubious online voices as their main sources of information?', 'Murrow used to sign off the air by saying, “Good night, and good luck.” If we’re lucky, broadcast journalism will find a way to keep providing the steady drip, drip, drip of legitimate news that can wear down the voices of disinformation and conspiracy theories. That, or Murrow will have to keep rolling in his grave.', 'Contact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com.', 'A live performance from Broadway’s Winter Garden Theatre', '7 p.m. June 7', ""The broadcast will air on CNN's cable network and also stream live, without requiring a cable log-in, through CNN.com.""]",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5Ua2xDTFhKalpGaEdXR0paVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZQlVwWmtwZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df

I didn’t want to grab George Clooney’s hand. I just wanted to tell him something.', 'I stood on 7th Avenue in Manhattan at the end of a long line by the Winter Garden Theater’s stage door after having seen “Good Night, and Good Luck.” Clutching the play poster I’d purchased while I waited for its star and playwright, I wasn’t there to fangirl but to deliver a message: “I teach journalism and I very much appreciate this show and how you’re standing up for the importance of journalism.” ', 'With a black “Good Night, and Good Luck” baseball cap tucked low on his dyed-black hair and oversized, tinted aviator glasses covering a substantial portion of his face, Clooney, the son of a journalist, signed my poster and responded to my message saying, “Well I appreciate anyone who teaches journalism.”', 'For years I’ve had a framed poster of the 2005 Oscar-nominated film of the same name on the wall in my home office. It occupied nearly the entirety of the background when I taught university journalism Zoom classes during the COVID.', 'The poster’s looming presence prompted questions from my students, affording me a natural opening to explain how the film depicted the heroic and ultimately career-sabotaging decision in 1954 by CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow to challenge the undemocratic crusade by a Wisconsin senator who’d been spearheading the persecution of people based on phantom allegations of unAmerican associations or thoughts in order to instill fear and elicit compliant silence among the populace. ', 'I saw the 2025 Broadway play a week after a well-respected CBS “60 Minutes” producer resigned “citing encroachments on his journalistic independence,” the New York Times reported, adding that the investigative journalism program “faced mounting pressure in recent months” from President Trump and its corporate owners due to its content on the same network for which Murrow worked.', 'A former newspaper reporter and investigative journalist who now writes books and teaches journalism and writing, it was hard for me to sit through the play which depicted Murrow  spotlighting on “See It Now” Senator Joseph McCarthy’s disingenuousness, lies and lack of empathy and ignore the parallels to our current American moment.', 'The characters’ discussions about the panic about the consequences of speaking out against injustices and the terror of truth telling called to mind recent events. Like the Turkish graduate student who was snatched off a Massachusetts street for the “crime” of co-writing a piece in her school newspaper which offered opinions unpopular with Trump administration officials. Or the fear in my foreign students’ voices when they asked me if they should return home lest they suffer the same fate.', 'The play’s final scene featured Clooney-as-Murrow four years after he lost his Tuesday evening primetime slot as a result of taking on McCarthy. Murrow delivered a blistering speech to the Radio-Television News Directors Association about the state of television journalism.', 'However, Clooney paused the speech as a giant TV screen behind him displayed a visual American history lesson from the 1950s through today. It included images of the 1991 Rodney King beating, the 9/11 attack and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.', 'A cacophony of cable news talking heads crowded the screen, including former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson who suggested that Jan. 6 was an inside job while other TV broadcasters uttered provable untruths, not unlike what led to Fox News in 2023 to settle a defamation lawsuit for $787 million that the Associated Press said “would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.”', 'Near the conclusion of the “Good Night” montage: Elon Musk, standing behind a podium bearing the presidential seal on Inauguration Day 2025 throwing his stiffened right arm up in the air in front of a roaring crowd. ', 'As I exited the New York’s Winter Garden Theater, lines from the end Murrow’s speech about the impact of television echoed in my head: ', '“This instrument can teach, it can illuminate, yes, and even it can inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise, it’s nothing but wires and lights in a box.”', 'Sadly, Clooney’s-as-Murrow’s words amid the smoky, jazz-infused “Good Night” scenes weren’t historic artifacts. They were bleating alarms to a country in peril. Right. Now. Professional, truth-based journalism delivered via the “wires and lights” in our phones, laptops and flat-screen TVs can shine light in dark places, bring injustice out of the shadows and shake us out of complacency if only we pay attention and only if folks are willing to create it. ', 'Journalist Margaret Sullivan recently wrote in The Guardian about the growing attacks on American news gatherers – specifically at “60 Minutes,” a modern-day “See It Now” aired on the same TV network, which is in the president’s crosshairs. ', '“… [T]he problem involves Donald Trump’s overweening desire to control the media,” Sullivan said. “… Those who could stand up to Trump’s bullying are instead doing what scholars of authoritarianism say must be avoided, if democracy is to be salvaged.” ', 'As “Good Night, and Good Luck” heads for a live broadcast on CNN on June 7 and Murrow’s network just lost the head of its news department, it’s my sincerest hope that the wires and lights inside whatever device people use to watch it will spark the embers of courage and inspire journalists to report the truth regardless of the consequences. ', 'In his 1958 speech, Murrow encouraged broadcasters to air content which brings “reality” into American homes, asking, “… [W]hat have they got to lose? Because if they are right, and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse and insulate, then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost.”', 'Meredith O’Brien is a Boston area writer who teaches journalism at Northeastern University and creative nonfiction at Bay Path University.

CNN’s Out of Touch And Self-Important George Clooney Broadcast Is Exactly Why the Network Is Struggling,https://www.mediaite.com/opinion/cnns-out-of-touch-and-self-important-george-clooney-broadcast-is-exactly-why-the-network-is-struggling/,"['(Photo by Andy Kropa/Invision/AP, File)', 'CNN is doing something innovative and outside the box of traditional cable news programming: They will be broadcasting the five-time Tony-award-winning play Good Night, and Good Luck, starring George Clooney, live from the Winter Garden Theater this coming Saturday.', 'Given the nonstop promotion on the network and the bizarre live broadcast starting at 6:30 p.m. co-hosted by Anderson Cooper and Pamela Brown, they are using every part of the promotional cow when it comes to this stunt. Their objective seems clear: signal the virtue of a journalistic legend in the hopes that it reminds viewers that their news organization is more journalistically sound than their competitors, which, in fairness, is largely accurate.', 'That said, the massive promotion is so nakedly out-of-touch and anachronistic that it’s become not just annoying for CNN viewers, but a stark reminder of precisely why the network is struggling with record-low ratings.', 'Good Night, and Good Luck — a play based on a 2005 film with the same name starring David Strathairn with the same name — tells the story of broadcast news legend Edward R. Murrow, “showcasing his legendary, history-altering, on-air showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy,” a CNN press release blares. “As McCarthyism casts a shadow over America, Murrow and his news team choose to confront the growing tide of paranoia and propaganda, even if it means turning the federal government and a worried nation against them.”', 'By any objective measure, it is both a fascinating play (and movie) that takes a close look at one of the most journalistically pure times in US history. And it’s easy to see some clear parallels between the McCarthyism of the 50s and the subjective information wars, irresponsible conspiracies, and gaslighting smears of the current day.', 'Murrow is a deserved legend for many good reasons. However, his commitment to sharing hard facts and truth, without fear or favor, came at a much simpler time in American media history. There were only three television broadcast networks, and most people relied on newspapers, radio, or film reels for their news and information. Much of the “news” was therefore less immediate than it is today, and the U.S. population was not only more homogeneous in thought but also benefited from shared experiences of consuming a handful of outlets.', 'However, that’s not the primary reason this play is best viewed as a period piece, rather than a totem for how we should be reporting and consuming news information today. Good Night, and Good Luck comes from a pre-psychological era, before post-modern philosophers deconstructed meaning and leaned into “semiotics.” Some 60 years later, it’s that very ephemeral nature of meaning that has led to the toxic cesspool of “analysis” or extremist opinions, which are packaged and delivered as though they are “news.”', 'This is not just opinion-based cable news programs that appeal to extreme ends on both sides of the aisle on MSNBC and Fox News. Take a look at the most popular political podcasts, Substacks, or social media feeds. They aren’t successful because they are fact-based. They exist to prove a subjective and partisan point. They are not news. But they rate. And they’re lucrative for networks, which is why they persist. Outraged opinions sell a lot of soap (or whatever pharmaceutical product, like Skyrizi, that enjoys an unlimited marketing budget).', 'As much as CNN might want to celebrate Murrow, he’d never last more than a few months on their air — if he were alive today — because his style of journalism would attract hardly any viewers on cable news. And that’s not a criticism of him, that’s a criticism of us, the viewers, who seem unable to resist the anger-inducing programming that so effectively stimulates our collective amygdala, which keeps us tuning in for more.', 'I get why CNN wants to connect its brand with a legend of journalism. However, the shameless promotion of a theatrical performance celebrating a historical and outdated legend seems only to draw attention to how far we’ve come and how different the network is from its intended DNA.', 'It’s no secret that CNN’s ratings have been in a steady decline since January 2021, when the network benefited from major news events, including the January 6th insurrection and a second Trump impeachment, to become the top-rated cable news network. Just over four years later, it finds itself in a distant third place.', 'One ratings bright spot, however, is NewsNight, hosted by the talented Abby Phillip. It’s successful because it’s a panel show featuring diverse political viewpoints, which often leads to a range of spirited discussions and occasionally, unhinged fights. In the context of current cable news fare, it’s good television, which is why it’s ostensibly the network’s hottest show.', 'It’s also the kind of show that Murrow wouldn’t be caught dead hosting — and we need look no further than Good Night, and Good Luck itself for proof. The play depicts Murrow holding his nose while hosting the show Person to Person, which featured puffy celebrity interviews with all the biggest stars of the day. (People like, say, George Clooney.) Murrow hated the type of celebrity glorification that Person to Person was all about, and he only did the show because his bosses demanded it in exchange for his ability also to host the more costly See It Now, which featured the more serious journalism Murrow preferred.', 'Despite Clooney’s best intentions, Murrow surely would have likely detested Saturday night’s presentation of Good Night, and Good Luck on CNN. The network is glorifying a partisan (read: divisive) Hollywood titan — building him up as a high-and-mighty Murrow-esque crusader for truth. That CNN is aligning itself with Clooney — arguably the single most prominent avatar of the coastal elite in all of American life — shows just how disconnected they are themselves, how distant they are from their audience.', 'And if Murrow was about anything, he was about connecting with his audience — talking to them, not at them. And he was about listening to them as well. For five years in the 1950s, he hosted a radio show called This I Believe, which gave ordinary Americans a chance to deliver their opinions on air in five-minute essays. That’s how he knew what Americans wanted and needed in a news broadcast, and that’s how he became a beloved American icon.', 'The whole endeavor feels like a pseudo-intellectual effort to portray oneself as one wants to be seen, instead of just doing the thing. Reminds me of the guys who purchase a David Foster Wallace novel, not to read, but to decorate their nightstand.', 'Max Von Sydow’s character famously said, in Hannah and Her Sisters, “If Jesus came back and saw what was being done in his name, he’d never stop throwing up.” It pains me to say this, but if Murrow were to come back and see CNN right now packaged as a “news,” he would also never stop throwing up. And he’d surely never want to be associated with it.', 'This is an opinion piece. The views expressed in this article are those of just the author.', 'Colby Hall is the Founding Editor of Mediaite.com.

It’s about how easily it can elude us, and what it takes to catch up with it again.', 'When Clooney and Heslov wrote the screenplay for the 2005 movie that this play is based on, what they had in mind was what shameless cheerleaders most of the media had been for George W. Bush’s war in Iraq. Sen. Barack Obama opposed the invasion, and Donald Trump later claimed that he had, too, though fact-checkers have found no evidence of that. Clooney, who plays Murrow, did not support the war, and was labeled a traitor.', 'In the run-up to the 2003 invasion, I was just moving back to D.C. from Italy, where most people I knew felt just as I did, that going in seemed like picking the wrong fight for reasons that you could tell weren’t the real reasons because they kept changing. So it was a shock to see so many friends in Washington, on the left as well as the right, so all-in and unquestioning. “There just aren’t that many bad guys,” one prominent journalist told me, so the whole thing would be over almost before it began. Many others cited Colin Powell’s seal of approval, as if the fact that he hadn’t bucked his bosses settled the argument. Maybe if I had been here the whole time, I would have felt that same way.', 'But this was a war that never made any sense: Not only did the rationale keep shifting, but Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11, and we actually did know at the time that there were no WMDs, based on public reports from the UN inspectors. None of that mattered, though, because propaganda overpowered the public. That is also what “Good Night, and Good Luck” is about.', 'There were reporters who did not agree with the official narrative on Iraq, and they fought hard to make the facts known, but theirs was not the preferred storyline, and here’s a truth: it takes more than bravery and hard work to turn a country’s head around.', 'Today, I think most of us agree that the war was a tragic mistake, just like we agree that Murrow and the CBS that unfortunately no longer exists really were heroes to go after Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the height of the anti-communist hysteria he used to wreck so many lives for so little reason.', 'Murrow, who as a radio reporter in London had reported on the Blitz during World War II, didn’t know that his team could weaken McCarthy’s spell. The risks they took were enormous, and not all of them came out OK. As Murrow said, the whole panic was based on lies 99% of the time but was wrong 100% of the time in negating our civil liberties.', 'What Murrow did know for sure was that in taking McCarthy on, with fact checks and reason, he’d be accused of working for the Soviets, too, and he was. “Anyone who criticizes or opposes Senator McCarthy’s methods must be a Communist,” Murrow says in response to the attack.', 'I can’t keep from noticing that this is happening today, when anyone who questions Donald Trump is a lunatic leftist, no matter what his actual politics or the facts of the situation. Anyone this administration wants to deport is a terrorist, even though no court has seen the evidence, just like no one ever saw McCarthy’s.', 'The direct connection between McCarthy and Trump, of course, is Roy Cohn, who was McCarthy’s chief counsel during the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings and later became a lawyer for and mentor to Trump.', 'There are so many moments in this play that resonate, but none more so than when Murrow says that McCarthy’s actions “have caused alarm and dismay among our allies abroad and given comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn’t create this situation of fear. He merely exploited it, and rather successfully.” Just as now, we’re ultimately to blame.', 'But again, if you admire the president, don’t think this isn’t for you, because that’s not necessarily true. If you are a critic of today’s media, I think you’ll appreciate the questions Murrow himself asks about where TV is headed.', 'I’ve heard plenty of laments that there are no more Edward R. Murrows, and it takes nothing away from him to say that there couldn’t be, because no one today has anything close to that kind of reach.', 'No one could have that kind of moral authority because there is no one the whole country watches.', 'Yes, this show shines Murrow’s halo, and he didn’t slay McCarthy on his own. But “Good Night and Good Luck” also shows Murrow as human, and as a human who might very well have failed. We see him at serious odds with his bosses, barely pulling off what he and his team did accomplish, and having to do kiss-kiss celebrity stories along with the history-changing ones to keep corporate happy.', 'In one piece he’d clearly rather not have done, he interviews Liberace about when he’s going to get married. Back then, TV was still figuring out what it was going to be, so you could be fierce with a major force one minute and encourage a star to lie to you the next. But if that Liberace interview happened today, social media would declare that Edward R. Murrow was no Edward R. Murrow, either.', 'Murrow mostly used McCarthy’s own words against him, and the footage of him that the play uses is frightening. But the same medium that was used to bring McCarthy down lifted Trump up.', '“He’s charismatic, there’s no taking that away from him; he’s a television star,” Clooney said in conversation with the Broadway actress Patti LuPone. But we’ll get through Trumpism, too, he believes, because the president is a demagogue, “and it goes away when they go away. We’ll eventually find our better angels. We have every other time, and I think we will again.”', 'Maybe the guy playing Murrow has to say that, but I’m going with it. And relying heavily on theatre to get me through until then.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5Ua2xDTFhKalpGaEdXR0paVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZQlVwWmtwZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df

', 'The idea for the live broadcast originated with Clooney, who is starring in the production as legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow, and co-wrote the play. The play follows Murrow as he pursues reporting exposing the tactics of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, and stands up to pushback from McCarthy as well as CBS station heads. ', '“One of the reasons that George came to Broadway with this show is because the story is deeply, deeply meaningful to him,” said Sue Wagner, one of the lead producers. “It was really important to him to stand on stage every night and say to people, ‘This isn’t about power unchecked. It’s about ‘What are you prepared to do? How are you prepared to save us?’” ', '', 'The play is set to air on CNN and CNN International at 7 p.m. ET, as well as stream on the CNN website and live on Max. CNN is also airing a preshow outside the theater, hosted by anchor Pamela Brown, and a postshow discussion with Anderson Cooper about the play and the state of journalism. ', '“You want it to be a big event. You want it to land big,” said Amy Entelis, executive vp talent, CNN Originals and Creative Development.', 'The Broadway producers and Clooney mulled over different kinds of captures that have taken place, including a filmed production like Hamilton on Disney+, but landed on a live broadcast given the time remaining in the run (the play closes June 8) and the reach it could have. In addition to Hamilton, previous Broadway shows have been captured for later release, including the recent revival of Purlie Victorious, which aired last year on PBS, but doing a live broadcast is the rarity. ', '', 'Production company 2929 Entertainment, which is owned by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban, Jeff Skoll’s Participant Media and Clooney are financing the live broadcast. The entities produced the 2005 film on which the play is based and were also producers on the play, holding the underlying rights, as well as the live capture rights.', 'The additional investment also comes after the production recouped its $9.5 million capitalization in just over seven weeks and has repeatedly broken the record for highest weekly gross of any Broadway play in history, with more than $4 million grossed last week and an average ticket price of $339.   ', 'Den of Thieves, a production company that has previously worked with Clooney and on live events, including the VMAs, is executive producing the live broadcast and plans to use 20 cameras, with 14 camera operators, positioned in the aisles and around the live audience that will be sitting in the 1,500-seat theater Saturday night. The idea is to film the production as it appears on stage, rather than in a stylized broadcast, which also means sometimes showing the audience. ', '“It was very critical for George that we capture this as a theater experience,” said Jesse Ignjatovic, co-founder of Den of Thieves. ', 'CNN will also be airing the production without commercials, in keeping with the Broadway experience. ', 'The team plans to shoot the Friday evening show and the Saturday matinee as a rehearsal, which will then be reviewed by Clooney, the play’s co-writer Grant Heslov and others, before the live broadcast. The production team’s director has already seen the show 12 times in preparation. ', '', 'Both CNN and Den of Thieves say they’re very accustomed to shooting live events, and while they have never done a live broadcast of a Broadway show, they expect it to run smoothly, given the fact that the cast has been performing this play on Broadway live for weeks. Den of Thieves will have a television production truck in front of the theater to liaise with CNN during the broadcast. ', 'CNN received the call from Clooney and found that the programming fit into their larger strategy with CNN Originals, which had previously aired a prerecorded version of Colin Quinn’s Off-Broadway play, as well as concerts and the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, among others. ', 'The goal with this is to bring different kinds of programming to the regular CNN viewers and grow the audience, particularly as cable news networks are looking to bring in viewers among a broader linear ratings decline, Entelis said. ', '“This was a great idea in the sense that, obviously the theme of the play is what was happening to the press in the 1950s and very much relevant to what people talk about today in our audience, what we talk about sometimes. And so syncing that up just made all the sense of the world,” Entelis said.', 'Both Wagner and John Johnson, a lead producer on the Broadway show, also view the broadcast as being good for the theater industry, since it stands to bring a large amount of attention to Broadway on Saturday evening, which can then carry over into the Tony Awards Sunday evening, where Clooney is nominated. And the hope is that making a Broadway show widely available helps convince audiences to buy a ticket to another show. ', '', 'In addition to the high cost of filming a show, which can be prohibitive, Broadway producers have also worried that filming a show would stop attendees from buying a ticket to see it live. Good Night, and Good Luck is ending its run a day after the broadcast, and has done well financially. But Johnson also said that mode of thinking should no longer apply to Broadway, at least when it is event-style theater. He points to the success of the Wicked movie and the increased box office at Wicked on Broadway as one example. ', '“I think there is an inherent nature of people wanting to be in the room with a group of people and a group of actors on stage, sharing that story and experiencing it all at the same time,” Johnson said. ', 'There have been discussions about a future production of Good Night, and Good Luck in London, but nothing has been announced yet.', 'CNN is well-suited to do more live events, Entelis said, and while she is not sure it will be another Broadway show, the network is looking for “more innovative, experimental ways to move the needle.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5Ua2xDTFhKalpGaEdXR0paVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZQlVwWmtwZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df

The play is at the Winter Garden on 51st Street. Paramount headquarters is on 44th Street; CBS News is on 57th Street. And Trump Tower is on 56th. That’s a mighty small fishbowl for the future of democracy and a free press.', 'The question is, will real life turn out differently from the play?', '“Good Night, and Good Luck,” about legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow challenging the Red-baiting terror of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, parallels the dilemma facing Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone. She is under pressure from the journalists at CBS News because she is seeking to settle a specious, $20 billion lawsuit from President Trump over CBS News’s “60 Minutes’” editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last year.', 'The lawsuit is a bully tactic to get Redstone to cave to Trump as she waits for FCC approval of her pending deal to sell Paramount to Skydance Media for $8 billion.', 'McCarthy used bully tactics too, like smearing Murrow’s reputation by claiming falsely that he had Communist ties, and by pressuring CBS President Bill Paley to get Murrow to back down.', 'Like Redstone, Paley wavered.', 'Reprising the project he directed as a film in 2005, Clooney is telling a fable for our times and issuing a warning. Murrow was one of a few household names in America at that time who had the credibility to take on McCarthy as the power-hungry Senator demanded that friends and family members rat each other out in public hearings on Communism and our military. He ruined the careers and reputations of those who came in his cross-hairs.', 'McCarthy was not president, but he was arguably as powerful in his day as the power-hungry Trump is in ours. And there is another tie: political operative Roy Cohn, who trained and counseled Trump in the art of lying and manipulation — a relationship detailed in the recent movie “The Apprentice” — was McCarthy’s chief counsel during those 1954 hearings, and assisted investigations of suspected communists.', 'Bill Paley, the just-as-legendary head of CBS who built the company into a media powerhouse from 1928 to 1946 and beyond, moved “See It Now” to a time slot far out of prime time, where fewer were likely to see it. He didn’t fire Murrow. And unlike the recent resignations at “60 Minutes” and CBS News, Murrow didn’t give in.', 'The play is a reminder that the boundaries of our democracy have been tested before. (My colleague Brian Lowry has written about yet another challenge CBS faced over airing an expose of the tobacco industry on “60 Minutes” while a merger with Westinghouse hung in the balance.) Freedoms were strained mightily – lives were ruined, in the play one staffer takes his own life – but overall our democracy held. CBS News lived to fight another day. And McCarthy had his downfall.', 'But not without principled warriors like Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly who were prepared to pay the price when the risks were high – drawing McCarthy’s counterpunch, losing nervous advertisers, alienating viewers. They joked about leaving the country.', 'Last month Redstone reportedly asked her CEO George Cheeks if “60 Minutes” could avoid reporting on the Trump administration until her Skydance merger was done. Despite the resignations at the news division, it does not appear that “60 Minutes” has done so.', 'She might do well to remember Murrow’s words, spoken solemnly by Clooney to an audience this weekend and night after night during this Broadway run:', '“We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.“', 'Murrow’s reports contributed to a turning point, the infamous moment when the senator was publicly called out during a hearing – “McCarthy, have you no sense of decency?” – which led to an investigation and vote of censure by his colleagues.', 'No such exit ramp seems open to us at this time. It is hard to imagine censure or public shame being effective today.

Murrow.', 'Clooney stars in Good Night, and Good Luck as Murrow, the CBS reporter and host who stood up to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who claimed Communists had infiltrated the U.S. government in the 1950s. McCarthy appears in 1950s news film.', 'The Broadway play — adapted from Clooney’s 2005 feature film of the same name — has been nominated for five Tony Awards, including Clooney for best lead actor. It’s also the highest-grossing play in Broadway history.', 'Good Night, and Good Luck — how Murrow would sign off his programs — will air live from Broadway’s Winter Garden Theatre at 7 p.m. Saturday, June 7, on CNN, CNN International and MAX, and will stream live on CNN.com, and via CNN’s apps on connected TVs and mobile devices, without requiring a cable login, according to CNN’s “How To Watch” page.', 'Before the movie premiered in 2005, George Clooney told me that Murrow “was someone that my father always talked about and quoted. That showdown (with McCarthy) was very famous in our family,” said George, a 1979 graduate of Independent High School in Augusta, Kentucky.', 'The Lexington, Kentucky, native grew up in Fort Mitchell and Mason while his father hosted variety shows on WCPO-TV and WKRC-TV (1969-75) before the family settled in Augusta, not far from his father’s hometown of Maysville. Nick returned to WKRC-TV as primary news anchor from 1976 to 1984.', 'As a child, Nick was mesmerized by Murrow’s authoritative voice describing the Germans bombing of London on CBS radio during World War II. Nick admired Murrow setting the gold standard for news when he started at Maysville’s WFTM-AM while in high school in 1950; broadcast on the Armed Forced Radio Network; and anchored TV news in Lexington and Cincinnati.', '“Ed (Murrow) was the guy . . . Murrow presented (the news) so well,"" Nick told me in 2005. ""Ed talked to you. It was biblical, it had resonance. And he had guts.” He also said he still had a photo on his mantel of Murrow, who died in 1965.', 'In the Clooney home “we talked about Murrow all the time,” particularly his courage to confront McCarthy’s anti-communism crusade now known as “McCarthyism,” Nick said. “You’ve got to have the courage to face it down. And it’s hard to do.”', 'Or as George says as Murrow in CNN’s promotion: “There are a certain kind of people who are the lifeblood of democracy, never wavering, never faltering, never straying in their pursuit of what matters. And what matters? Honesty, facts, integrity, accuracy, truth. Good night, and good luck.”', ""George Clooney’s fascination with doing a Murrow project goes back at least 30 years. After achieving stardom on NBC's ER in the 1990s, he often told me about wanting to do a film about Murrow. He co-wrote Good Night, and Good Luck with longtime writing partner Grant Heslov, and directed the film in 2006 — but chose to play CBS news producer Fred Friendly, with David Strathairn starring as Murrow. Now at 64, he felt he had the gravitas to play Murrow in his Broadway debut. (He and Heslov also tried to adapt Good Night, and Good Luck into a cable TV drama series in 2022.)"", 'George’s love for live TV goes back to his childhood romping around his father’s live noon variety shows on WCPO-TV and WKRC-TV. He also operated the Teleprompter for his father’s 1970s newscasts at Channel 12. This inspired him to push for a live broadcast of an ER episode in 1997, and his remake of Fail-Safe, a 1960s Cold War drama, for CBS in 2000.', '“I can’t tell you how exciting it is to do something that’s never been done,” Clooney said in CNN’s May 15 announcement for the first-ever live Broadway play telecast. “Live TV. No net. Buckle up everyone.”', 'Good Night, and Good Luck will end its Broadway run with a matinee on Sunday, June 8. That night CBS will broadcast the 78th Annual Tony Awards live 8-11 p.m. (Channels 12, 7) from New York’s Radio City Music Hall.', 'TWO CLOONEY NOTES: CBS’ 60 Minutes repeats its George Clooney profile from March at 7 p.m. Sunday before the Tony Awards . . .', 'Clooney will open Film Cincinnati’s 2025 gala to welcome the Association of Film Commissioners International (AFCI) Cineposium to town for its 50th anniversary Sept. 15-18.

(Photo by Emilio Madrid courtesy of DKC O&M). We asked Martha Wade Steketee, president of the Foundation of the American Theatre Critics/Journalists Association, to provide some background and context.', 'Good Night, and Good Luck on Broadway will be issuing Edward R. Murrow’s famous sign-off for the penultimate time on Saturday evening, June 7, to a live audience worldwide.', 'Adapted by George Clooney and his co-writer Grant Heslov following the text and texture of their 2005 film of the same name, the play tracks journalist Murrow and his CBS “See It Now” colleagues taking on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy’s anti-communist rantings in the early 1950s and their struggle with corporate support of news programming.', 'While this isn’t a history lesson (although some may see it as so), the theatrical version plays more as a call to arms. ', 'Streamed by the host channel for the broadest worldwide access, the June 7 live broadcast offers a sparely told history of moments of courage in the battle against government overreach. Although taking place over half a century in the past, there are, of course, a shocking number of lessons for the present day.', 'The play on the stage of the Winter Garden has been received variously by critics, who all seem to have extolled the importance of Edward R. Murrow and the other historical figures featured, but with notes on the success of the translation of the original film to an immense Broadway stage.', 'Among the critical comments:', '“Straightforward retelling of its source material” that is “controlled” and steadily led (Britani Samuel in Broadway News).', '“[S]peechifying, minor-key tirades and copious use of ’50s-era TV clips that make plain the all-too-obvious parallels between then and now” (Greg Evans in Deadline).', 'Adam Feldman in Time Out New York underscored how closely the play on stage hews to the film script. “Clooney and Heslov have just plopped their screenplay onstage and called it a play.” And this presents the challenge to animate the creation to the director David Cromer and the cast, “and they do what they can.”', 'Others have seen the adaptation as “taut” and “intense” and “laser-focused” (Frank Rizzo in Variety). ', 'Sarah Holdren in Vulture reflected on the ebb and flow of the storytelling on stage, and the challenges taken up by the theater professionals engaged to present it. “[The] curtain rises, and as lovingly detailed as Pask’s newsroom set is, Cromer has to enliven a still highly cinematic script in a wide-open theatrical space; the result is that Good Night almost immediately starts to diffuse.” Holdren also reflects acutely on the match of fine director David Comer’s expertise with subtle texts on stage with well-appointed, expansive set design by Scott Pask. ‘[T]here’s something a touch too shaggy in its current theatricality to keep us consistently attuned to its turns and its stakes.”', 'And Jesse Green in The New York Times found many elements of the production to champion while observing the production’s instinct to sermonize. “[P]reaching to the converted can be a good role for theater. So is rousing the demoralized with the example of heroes who have prevailed.” Clooney’s refusal to grandstand as an actor allows his Murrow to maintain his halo.', 'Critics find quibbles with how the story is told, but all agree that the story of 1953 broadcast journalism embarking on the takedown of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy’s House Un-American Activities Committee is worth hearing. While this play (and the movie on which it is based) can be accused of hagiography, the themes rouse an audience and underscore a series of lessons in civic engagement and the obligations of every citizen to study history and be wary of government assertions of truth.', 'Murrow and Fred Friendly (Glenn Fleshler) fight to obtain and retain corporate support for their news program, but equally fight for the ethics of journalistic practice. William Paley (Paul Gross) perseveres despite a wave of government disinformation. Murrow says at one point to Paley’s argument that despite this, there should be reportage, not commentary, in the show, Murray replied, “I simply cannot accept that there are, on every story, two equal and logical sides to an argument.”', 'Today’s theater audiences cheer.', 'And it may actually play better on your home screen.', 'In the audience at the Winter Garden, where it is staged with grace mixed with sometimes ponderous pronouncements that are more rallying the troops than analyzing political actors and actions, one could get lost in technology and final projected images of insurrections and terrorism that gild the lily of the history lessons that precede them. On TV, focused on faces and the words and the terrifying warnings power run amok, today’s audiences may receive history anew. The CNN live broadcast event itself, by virtue of its unique filming (there will be additional live camera people in addition to the roaming video cameras staged by Cromer in the stage production), will be yet another creation. There will be new angles selected, closeups conveyed – in many ways, the camera persons and the event director in the moment will be at the helm of this new experience, translating what was first a life lived, telling stories on the radio airways and then on television, then a story on film, then placed on a Broadway stage, will now be reformatted yet again to a small screen and transmitted to its largest-ever audience.', 'Told to us and through us, again in the medium of television that Morrow mastered and that generations now look to first for the lessons of the day, these lessons of the past may redirect us to a renewed democratic future.', 'Here’s hoping.', 'Good Night, and Good Luck livestreamed on CNN https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2025/06/02/how-to-watch-cnns-special-presentation-of-george-clooneys-good-night-and-good-luck-on-saturday-june-7-at-7pm-et/', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Tagged under: CBS, CNN, Edward R.
