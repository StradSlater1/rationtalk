Rodgers should be able to fill that void, even if its only on a short-term basis."", 'At 41 years old, Rodgers probably has just a couple of years left in his career at most. Even so, he is playing at a high enough level for the Steelers to justify him as an upgrade over the duo of Russell Wilson and Justin Fields that got them to the playoffs last season.', 'Rodgers posted just a 5-12 record in 17 starts for the New York Jets last season, but he tallied solid numbers across those games. He completed 63% of his passes for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions and looked particularly strong during the second half of the season.

Aaron Rodgers signing with Steelers: Four-time NFL MVP joins Pittsburgh on one-year deal,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-signing-with-steelers-veteran-quarterback-agreeing-to-a-one-year-deal-in-pittsburgh/,"['', ""After weeks of waiting and mulling his different options, Aaron Rodgers has chosen his new NFL team. The four-time NFL MVP is signing a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Rodgers will attend Pittsburgh's mandatory minicamp next week. "", 'The Steelers were one of three teams viewed as being in the running for Rodgers. The New York Giants were another, but instead opted to sign Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson. The Minnesota Vikings were also a team to watch; the sides had had conversations before the Vikings ultimately decided to go ahead with J.J. McCarthy, a 2024 first-round pick who was injured his entire rookie season. ', 'The Steelers made it clear at the NFL Scouting Combine that they wanted to re-sign either Wilson or Justin Fields at quarterback before the start of free agency, but failed on both counts. Now, Pittsburgh has committed to going the veteran quarterback route for another year while bringing back Mason Rudolph and drafting Ohio State QB Will Howard in the seventh round.', 'Rodgers, who spent the past two years with the New York Jets, is coming off the worst season of his Hall-of-Fame career. He registered career-worsts in games lost (12), yards per attempt (6.7) and passer rating (90.5). In 2024, Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and became the fifth quarterback in NFL history to reach 500 career touchdown passes.', 'While the Steelers can now feel more comfortable having grabbed a seat in this stressful game of quarterback musical chairs, the decision to sign Rodgers will be a polarizing one in Pittsburgh. After all, Rodgers has more losing seasons (three) than playoff wins (two) since 2017. In fact, earlier this offseason Steelers safety DeShon Elliott even commented on a social media post pointing to the fact that the Steelers became the betting favorites to land Rodgers, saying, ""Leave his ass at the retirement home.""', 'The Steelers are attempting to revamp an offense that was much too inconsistent in 2024. Pittsburgh swung a trade for former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf and gave him a five-year, $150 million contract last month, and now, has found its new quarterback. ', 'If Rodgers could win one more Super Bowl, he would join Manning and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks ever to win at least three league MVPs and two Super Bowls. That would certainly cement his place as a top-five quarterback in NFL history. ', ""That's the reward aspect of Rodgers giving it one more go with the Steelers in 2025 along with how celebrated he would be for lifting one of the league's most historic franchises back to the mountain top for Pittsburgh's first championship since the 2008 season. Doing so would also allow Rodgers to ride off into the sunset with many people forgetting some of his behavior regarding his public health stances and the worst season of his career helping lead to the firings of New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas in 2024. "", 'However, giving it another go in 2025 as he turns 42 is also a big risk. Rodgers will be two years removed from tearing his Achilles, and last season he looked incredibly stiff moving around the pocket following an injury that has drained much of the mobility that allowed him to dance around in the pocket before making jaw-dropping throw after jaw-dropping throw throughout his career. Another serious injury, missing the postseason, plenty of pain and even a potential, permanent limp could be the end result of another year of NFL football for Rodgers at his age. -- Garrett Podell', ""While talent was clearly a reason why the Steelers fell apart late last season, you could argue that a lack of offensive leadership also contributed to the collapse. While Rodgers' public persona is a complicated, he has largely been regarded in the past as a great teammate and a leader who isn't afraid to challenge anyone. The Steelers haven't had an offensive leader like that since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season. What Rodgers should bring to Pittsburgh from a leadership standpoint shouldn't be overlooked. "", ""While they don't have a ton of depth behind them, the Steelers' offensive line has the potential to be the franchise's best since 2020. The starting-five projects to include two former first-round picks in tackles Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu, a returning Pro Bowler in veteran guard Isaac Seumalo, and two second-years players in center Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick who were immediate starters in 2024. "", ""Rodgers has weapons at his disposal in DK Metcalf, fellow wideout Calvin Austin III and tight end Pat Freiermuth. He's already started working with Metcalf, and he should quickly gel with Austin, whose work ethic is among the best on the team. The Steelers are also reportedly trying to acquire another proven wideout after trading George Pickens to the Cowboys last month. There have been rumblings that Roman Wilson -- who missed his entire rookie season with an injury -- has impressed during OTAs. "", ""Pittsburgh still has Jaylen Warren, but it lost a big part of its offense when it let fellow running back Najee Harris test free agency (he ultimately signed with the Chargers). With Harris gone, the Steelers spent a third round pick on his replacement, former Iowa running back Kaleb Johnson. The 6-foot-1, 225-pound Johnson has already been compared to both Harris and Le'Veon Bell. Along with possessing Harris-like physicality, Johnson's patience and big-play ability are similar to Bell, who set several franchise records during his five-year run in Pittsburgh. "", ""Defensively, Rodgers will be complemented by a unit that is capable of winning some games on its own, especially after adding some necessary pieces via free agency and during the draft. The Steelers' defensive additions this offseason includes six-time Pro Bowl cornerback Darius Slay and first-round pick Derrick Harmon, one of the top-ranked defensive tackle prospects in this year's draft. -- Bryan DeArdo"", ""The fun gets started in Week 1 at New York in a game CBS will broadcast. The Jets had a chance to bring Rodgers back for a third season in New York, but they decided to move on. During an interview with Pat McAfee in April, Rodgers definitely sounded bitter about the way things ended. The 41-year-old said he flew across the country on his own dime only to sit down for a meeting where he was told in the first 20 seconds that the Jets didn't want him. "", ""The game between the Steelers and Jets is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. ET in Week 1, which is something that definitely would NOT have happened if the NFL had known for sure that Rodgers was going to sign. In a recent interview with CBS Sports, Mike North, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning and scheduling, admitted that the game likely would have been given a prime-time slot if the league had been 100% certain that Rodgers was going to play. "", '""I think if the league knew, we probably would\'ve scheduled that game for a national television window,"" North said. ""Look at what we did with Aaron Rogers\' first game the last two years (both Monday night games). If we knew something, I think you would\'ve seen it reflected in the schedule. That being said, still a good game.""', 'The Week 8 Sunday night game that will see Pittsburgh host Green Bay is likely to be bittersweet for Rordgers, who of course started his career in Green Bay after the Packers selected him in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. By 2008, he was the full-time starter and during his 15 years under center, he led the Packers to five NFC title games and one Super Bowl win while also winning four MVP awards. Rodgers had a Hall of Fame career in Green Bay, but it came to a somewhat bitter end in April 2023 when the Packers traded him to New York.  ', ""The Packers made it pretty clear that they were getting ready to move on from Rodgers when they used a first-round pick in 2020 to select Jordan Love. Rodgers wasn't happy about the pick and things became awkward between him and the front office after that. Rodgers will now get to face Love for the first time. -- John Breech"", ""If Rodgers can beat Green Bay, he'd be just the fifth quarterback to beat all 32 teams as a starter, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees Peyton Manning, Brett Favre. Only two other active quarterbacks -- Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes -- have beaten 31 teams. Neither is set to reach 32 this season, as Wilson's Giants do not play the Seahawks, and Mahomes remains on the Chiefs. Two quarterbacks -- Joe Montana and Fran Tarkenton -- beat all 28 teams when the NFL had only 28 teams. -- Zachary Pereles"", 'Metcalf, who was traded from the Seahawks and promptly signed a five-year, $150 million extension, projects as the type of No. 1 receiver Rodgers has thrived with. A supercharged athlete with speed to burn, Metcalf should feature heavily in this offense on in-breaking routes, too.', 'Moreover, the Steelers showed a willingness to match Metcalf, 27, with a quarterback who has worked with big-bodied, physically gifted perimeter receivers his entire career. Metcalf has little competition for targets in a relatively scarce wide receiver room, and he should put up a monster season. Even amid a rough 2024 for the Jets, Garrett Wilson had over 100 catches, and Davante Adams averaged over six catches for over 77 yards per game in New York. -- Zachary Pereles', 'The Steelers were reportedly monitoring the Kirk Cousins situation in Atlanta as recently as late May. Cousins has not been at OTAs and has asked for a trade, though a deal was always going to have to wait until post-June 1 money savings kicked in.', ""Now, there's no clear spot for Cousins to land as a starter. The Browns have four quarterbacks. The Giants brought in two free agents and drafted Jaxson Dart in the first round. The Steelers have found their answer. Cousins has wanted out for months, but it will be hard for him to find a good landing spot and perhaps even harder for the Falcons to find a willing trade partner. -- Zachary Pereles"", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

', 'He is a Steeler, he will be the starting quarterback, and hopefully now we can all get back to our regularly scheduled programming and figure out what it actually means for the 2025 season.', 'Yes, it took longer than it should have, and yes, there are some real reasons to be skeptical that it will work out. But the idea that Rodgers did anything wrong in this is silly. Every aging player who is getting to the end of his career should take some time to really consider if they want to continue to put his body through what it takes to play in the NFL.', 'Rodgers was thoughtful and took a little time, and that’s mostly because he wanted to make sure he was all in and ready to commit fully to being the best quarterback he can be and help the Steelers win as many games as possible.', 'Does he have anything left?', 'I have no idea, but from where I sit, he is the best option the Steelers have. And the reason for that is they weren’t as proactive as they needed to be in creating some sort of legitimate second option. Maybe Mason Rudolph is legitimate, but I think we have seen that show before and while there is probably a reasonable floor for what the Steelers would look like with him as the starter, there was also a very definitive ceiling.', 'Rudolph probably has a higher floor than Rodgers; I mean, if Rodgers can’t play any more, it will be a disaster. But Rodgers represents the best chance for the Steelers to breakthrough their recent ceiling of nine or 10 wins and a first-round loss.', 'Rodgers did finish the 2024 season by throwing for 18 touchdowns and four interceptions in his last 10 games with the Jets. It was clear earlier in the year he wasn’t fully healed from his Achilles tear, but as he got healthier, he played better.', 'It is entirely possible that Rodgers — with another whole offseason to heal, rest and clear his mind — might be able to play at a high level for another season and if he does, that’s the kind of gamble that could pay off in a big way for the Steelers. That is why the Steelers took the gamble, too, as it seemed like the risk/reward was far more in their favor than not.', 'Rodgers might stink. He might be cooked. He might not be able to play at a decent level. And if that happens, well, then the Steelers might just get that elusive top-10 draft pick that enables them to finally draft their quarterback of the future.', 'That would be a lose-win situation, and either way the Steelers will have placated the people who want them to play for the playoffs every year and the people who want them to tank to get a high draft choice. That would be an incredible development, so that’s why Rodgers makes sense — at best he represents a chance to contend in the AFC, at worst he represents a chance for them to draft their next franchise quarterback.', 'And let’s say he is somewhere in between. Nothing has been lost. He will be a one-year bridge quarterback that the Steelers signed without giving anything away that led them to another middling season without a playoff win. That would be the likely outcome if Rudolph were the quarterback, and so at that point it would be a wash.', 'Those that seem to be mad at Rodgers for “holding the Steelers hostage” have a lot of misplaced anger. If they want to be mad at someone, they should be mad at the Steelers for letting the situation go on as long as it did. ', 'Better yet, they should be mad at the Steelers for basically making it very clear that the only quarterback they were interested in was Rodgers, and they were willing to wait in order to get him. The Steelers could have signed a lot of other quarterbacks, could have traded for a couple of quarterbacks, and could have even signed one of the two guys they had on the team last year.', 'They didn’t do any of that, and as far as I can tell, they didn’t even negotiate with anyone else. They had some preliminary talks with Justin Fields but nothing serious, and it was very clear they were at best lukewarm toward him.', 'They made it very clear they were focused on Rodgers from the start of the offseason, and Rodgers made it very clear to them he was going to take his time. The funny thing is the only people who seemed bent out of shape because Rodgers was taking his time were all external — fans, media types, national pundits, etc. Art Rooney II, Mike Tomlin and Omar Khan all seemed to be more than comfortable waiting.', 'As I wrote at the start of it all, there is no way that the Steelers would be waiting if they weren’t extremely sure that the payoff at the end of the road would be Rodgers actually signing a deal. And whether you like Rodgers, hate Rodgers or are indifferent to Rodgers, the fact remains that he is, at this point, the Steelers’ best option for the 2025 season. So as a fan, you should be happy the deal got done.', 'I don’t know if it is going to work, but at this point, I completely understand what the Steelers were thinking and am willing have an open mind and sit back and watch it all play out.', 'First Published: June 5, 2025, 12:33 p.m.\nUpdated: June 5, 2025, 1:42 p.m.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTZjblZsTkhoTU5YaG1hVWRYVFJDb0FSaXJBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Steelers To Sign Aaron Rodgers,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2025/06/steelers-to-sign-aaron-rodgers,"['9:15pm: The Steelers have officially announced the one-year deal (pending physical).', '2:15pm: The Aaron Rodgers saga is nearing its expected conclusion. The future Hall of Famer has informed the Steelers he will sign with them, Tom Pelissero, Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo of NFL Network report.', 'To no surprise, Rapoport adds this will be a one-year deal. Rodgers will fly to Pittsburgh tomorrow, allowing him to sign ahead of next week’s minicamp. The four-time MVP will thus handle starting duties for 2025 as the Steelers look to upgrade their play under center on a short-term basis.', 'Uncertainty has clouded this situation throughout the offseason, but for quite some time signs have exclusively pointed to this arrangement taking place. Pittsburgh’s initial intention was to keep one of Russell Wilson or Justin Fields in place as a holdover from the team’s 2024 QB setup. Instead, Fields left for the Jets in free agency while Wilson (preferring not to wait for Rodgers to make his decision) will handle starting duties for the Giants.', 'Since losing both of their quarterbacks from the previous campaign, the Steelers have been connected to Rodgers. After two years with the Jets – one which ended after four snaps due to an Achilles tear and one which was marred by inconsistent play and turmoil in the organization – he was released. The manner in which Rodgers was informed of the decision by the new Jets regime was not well-received, but a first career foray into free agency brought with it conversations with a number of teams. The Giants were among them, although the team’s preference was to use the 2025 draft as a means of finding a long-term solution under center.', 'The Vikings represented a potential destination as well, with Rodgers informing them they were his preferred landing spot. After allowing Sam Darnold to depart in free agency, though, Minnesota is prepared to move forward with 2024 first-rounder J.J. McCarthy under center. In mid-March, the possibility was raised that Rodgers would either sign with the Vikings or retire. Neither route has been taken.', 'Shortly after that report emerged, a free agent visit took place in which Rodgers went to the Steelers’ facility. That did not produce an agreement, but a contract offer was made. While continuing to weigh the option of hanging up his cleats – and focusing his attention on a personal matter – the longtime Packers star mainly remained quiet with respect to public comments on his future. Clearly, Rodgers’ off-the-field situation has now reached a point where he is committed to suiting up for a 21st season in the NFL.', 'The Steelers have Skylar Thompson on their quarterback depth chart, and the team reunited with Mason Rudolph in free agency. The latter (who totaled 21 appearances and 13 starts across his first Pittsburgh stint) was made aware before signing of the possibility a deal such as this was a distinct possibility. The team aimed to have a firm Rodgers answer before April’s draft took place, but even without one Pittsburgh operated as though he would eventually arrive. Indeed, owner Art Rooney II expressed optimism on that front multiple times while the Steelers’ only rookie addition came in the form of sixth-rounder Will Howard.', 'Late last month, Rodgers hinted further that he would spend the 2025 campaign in Pittsburgh. The 41-year-old has already worked out with trade acquisition D.K. Metcalf this offseason while remaining in constant contact with Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin (whom ESPN’s Adam Schefter notes was a key factor in Rodgers’ decision). No firm timeline was ever established for a deal to be worked out, and missed reps at OTAs are certainly far from ideal. Realistically, though, upcoming minicamp represented a logical deadline for Rodgers to report to the team and begin acclimating to OC Arthur Smith‘s scheme.', 'Since Ben Roethlisberger‘s retirement following the 2021 campaign, the Steelers have been unable to find an effective replacement under center. Given Rodgers’ age, he will of course not be seen as a long-term solution at the position. Next year’s draft – which will take place in Pittsburgh, no less – looms as one to watch with respect to another notable rookie investment on the team’s part.', 'In the meantime, another postseason berth will be the goal for Tomlin and Co. The Steelers have never posted a sub-.500 record during his tenure, but playoff success has proven hard to come by dating back to the waning stages of Roethlisberger’s decorated career. If healthy, Rodgers could give the team’s offense its highest floor in years. Considering his age, declining mobility and production since the start of the 2022 season, however, it very much remains to be seen how effective his debut Steelers season will be.', 'One of the impacts of today’s news is the fact Pittsburgh will no longer be in the market for Kirk Cousins. The Falcons have consistently stated their preference to keep him as a backup, but the four-time Pro Bowler has aimed for a change of scenery all offseason. The Steelers were keeping tabs on a potential trade while awaiting word from Rodgers, their preferred target for a short-term addition. Now, Cousins can essentially be locked into remaining with Atlanta unless a starting quarterback is injured this summer.', 'Rodgers’ legacy will be dictated in large part by the success of his Packers stint. To say the least, though, things did not go according to plan during his Jets tenure. How this third chapter of his career plays out will be one of the league’s more interesting storylines.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTZjblZsTkhoTU5YaG1hVWRYVFJDb0FSaXJBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

But it’s of paramount importance that the four-time league MVP and his new offensive coordinator quickly get on the same page. (Obviously.)', 'Yet it’s worth underscoring the point. This isn’t New York, where Rodgers was intimately familiar with OC Nathaniel Hackett and the playbook that awaited when the Jets traded for him two years ago.

Smith also fancies having two and even three tight ends on the field, meaning Rodgers, who’s operated a robust passing attack (with the run game often an afterthought) for most of his sterling career, could routinely be executing plays with one wideout deployed downfield.', 'Rodgers is 41. Smith is 43. They oughta get a six-pack – Smith was known to have a beer with his players after a victory when he was the Atlanta Falcons’ head coach – and/or maybe some of the fine bourbon Rodgers tends to favor and start hashing out a plan that can work for both of them and the Steelers at large. (Obviously.) Maybe they even bunk together when the team relocates to Latrobe, Pa., this summer for training camp. But after a disastrous 2024 campaign − the worst full season of his 20-year career − Rodgers can hardly afford to be a square peg in a round offensive hole. Conversely, Smith can’t allow himself to be drawn into another dysfunctional relationship – which he had with Russell Wilson last season, according to reports – with his new QB1. And, frankly, running the ball shortens games, keeps the defense fresh and should lighten the burden on Rodgers − which should be a welcome byproduct given his age and all the physical abuse he absorbed last year for a Jets team that threw the ball way too often … and that imbalance was predictive of their 5-12 record.', 'WINNERS AND LOSERS: Sooo many questions as Rodgers finally heads to Pittsburgh', 'The Steelers knew what they were doing when they jettisoned WR George Pickens last month – and hard to see a scenario where he would have jelled well with Rodgers. ""That would have been a disaster,"" former New York Giants personnel executive Marc Ross told USA TODAY Sports recently.', ""Still, it certainly seems like Pittsburgh could use one more bona fide weapon aside from WR DK Metcalf, who was acquired earlier this offseason, but is typically a player who works well down the boundary and often relies on his physical prowess to overpower or blow past defensive backs. Yet, last year anyway, Rodgers had become a player who wants to distribute the ball quickly and seemed more comfortable working the hashes – which could mean more judicious targeting of Metcalf, whom he's tried to become acclimated with this spring."", ""Though neither can realistically be classified as a game breaker, TE Pat Freiermuth and slot WR Calvin Austin III could find themselves frequently in Rodgers’ crosshairs, assuming both conform to Rodgers' exact route standards. WR Roman Wilson might be that game breaker – based on his work at the University of Michigan – but after playing only five snaps in an injury-aborted rookie year, he remains an X-factor."", 'It’s a long way of saying that if the Steelers are going to cast their lot with Rodgers in 2025, then they should continue casting a wider net. Maybe that means brining in an experienced, reliable receiver like Keenan Allen or Amari Cooper, both currently free agents. Maybe it means ramping up talks with the Miami Dolphins to bring over TE Jonnu Smith, a favorite of Smith’s in Tennessee and Atlanta, as he enters the final year of his contract. Or perhaps GM Omar Khan calls the Jets and inquiries about WR Allen Lazard, who’s also got a year remaining on his deal, and considers acquiring a veteran capable of splash plays and offers the benefit of having already earned Rodgers’ hard-to-gain trust.', 'But standing pat in this circumstance just doesn’t cut it.', 'A third-round pick this year out of Iowa, Johnson led the Big Ten with 1,537 rushing yards and 23 total touchdowns in 2024. But the presumed replacement of Najee Harris as Pittsburgh’s lead back wasn’t much of a receiver in college. Maybe that won’t be a major hindrance in the NFL given the presence of third-down specialist Jaylen Warren, who’s averaged about 45 catches during his three NFL seasons in Pittsburgh. But if Johnson wants to be on the field in high-leverage situations, he needs to be ready to catch the ball and, far more importantly, must be prepared to protect Rodgers. Otherwise, he’s going to find himself standing next to Arthur Smith and head coach Mike Tomlin quite often when the stakes are highest.', ""Rodgers is Pittsburgh’s newest player. Watt remains the Steelers’ best player. He’s also in need of an extension with one year to go on his existing deal, one that now ranks seventh (in terms of average annual salary) among edge rushers − though fat chance you’re going to find six sack masters better than four-time All-Pro and single-season sack record holder. Aside from being cryptic on social media, Watt hasn’t said much this offseason – and his situation has largely been overshadowed with the spotlight trained on the Steelers’ pursuit of Rodgers. But it’s time for Pittsburgh to give Watt the raise he deserves given he's averaging $28 million annually while division rival Myles Garrett’s new four-year mega-pact comes in at $160 million."", 'Good, bad or indifferent, Rodgers is going to bring a certain level of distraction to this team. The Steelers shouldn’t invite any further ones, especially as it pertains to rewarding one of the best and most loyal soldiers in franchise history at a time when all the attention is going to a hired gun.', ""All NFL news on and off the field.

Wilson also outperformed Rodgers when they weren't pressured, per ESPN Research. Wilson completed 75% of attempts with 11 touchdowns and two interceptions for a QBR of 71. Rodgers completed 68% of attempts when he wasn't pressured and threw 21 touchdowns to 10 interceptions for a QBR of 55.

He averaged 2.69 seconds to throw, fifth among qualified quarterbacks, last season, and his 6.6-yard average throw distance was the fifth shortest in the league. 2024 marked the only full season as a starter that he averaged a throw distance below 7.4 yards."", ""Rodgers also hasn't been at the helm of prolific running offenses. The Jets ranked 28th in run plays last year, and from 2008 to 2022, the Packers ran on 37% of plays -- the fourth-lowest rate in the league over that span, according to ESPN Research. Rodgers' new offensive coordinator, Smith, however, has overseen top-five rushing offenses in five of his past six seasons as a playcaller."", ""But those are moot points, because while the Steelers waited for Rodgers' decision, Wilson took matters into his own hands and scheduled visits with the Browns and Giants. A day after news spread of Wilson's visits, the Steelers inked Rudolph, their 2018 third-round pick who spent the 2024 season in Tennessee, to a two-year, $8 million deal."", ""Some, like the Steelers, believe Rodgers has more upside than Wilson -- or any other option available in weak quarterback free agency and draft classes.

NFL free agency grades: QB Aaron Rodgers signs with Steelers,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44442475/2025-nfl-free-agency-grades-quarterback-aaron-rodgers-pittsburgh-steelers-signing,"['', 'Aaron Rodgers officially has a new team. The veteran quarterback agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday and is expected to join the team for mandatory minicamp next week. Rodgers was released by the New York Jets in mid-March but took some time to weigh options before ultimately landing in Pittsburgh.', ""Rodgers, who will turn 42 during the 2025 season, is expected to start for the Steelers. He threw for 3,897 yards, 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions last season, his first full year with the Jets after tearing an Achilles in Week 1 in 2023. He was one of the top available QBs this offseason, and he is a four-time league MVP. But there are questions about how much he has left in the tank. Is this really a good move for Pittsburgh, even without other obvious solutions? Does it help stabilize the offense? Let's size up the deal."", ""Analytics writer Seth Walder is evaluating and grading the deal based on multiple factors, including on-field impact, salary cap implications, compensation, player value/age and the context of the Steelers' short- and long-term outlooks. How large is the impact of this decision, and how sure are we it's a good or bad choice? How does this affect Pittsburgh's chance to win the Super Bowl this season or in the future? We also asked NFL analyst Ben Solak to make sense of the scheme fit in the Steelers' offense -- is Pittsburgh's offense better now than it was in 2024?"", ""Here's our take on the long-awaited Rodgers deal."", '', 'Jump to:\nGrading the Rodgers deal\nSizing up the team fit', ""I can't believe we're back here, watching another NFL franchise desperate for an answer at quarterback kowtow to a 41-year-old who hasn't played good ball since 2021. Twelve months from now we will look up and most likely be talking about the Steelers' lost season with Rodgers that ended in disappointment. But ... I also think this is the rational choice for the Steelers. The median outcome is not the point. This move makes some sense simply because of the slim amount of upside that Rodgers still possesses and the options that were on the table."", 'In 2021, Rodgers recorded a 74.1 QBR, leading the league in the category and winning MVP. For context, the last time Russell Wilson -- who signed with the Giants but was theoretically an option to return to the Steelers at one point -- hit that QBR mark was in 2012, his rookie season. Same goes for Kirk Cousins, who might have been a trade candidate. As poorly as Rodgers played last season, the chances of him being a top-10 quarterback this season are higher than those of Wilson, Cousins or any other veteran who was or is available.', 'Rodgers is coming off a very poor 2024 season with the Jets in which he ranked 25th in QBR (48.0) despite having Garrett Wilson and Davante Adams (for 11 games) to target. His completion percentage over expectation was minus-5%, per NFL Next Gen Stats, better than those of only Anthony Richardson and Cooper Rush. (Granted, the pass protection in New York was below average.)', ""The optimistic case for the Steelers is that Rodgers was still hampered by the torn Achilles that knocked him out for all but four plays in the 2023 season. And to be fair, Rodgers did look more mobile as the 2024 season went along. Of Rodgers' 30 fastest top-speed plays last season, 17 came in Week 13 or later, per NFL Next Gen Stats. But an underrated part of the Rodgers career arc is that he played poorly not only last season after missing virtually all of 2023 but also in 2022, his final season with the Packers. Rodgers ranked 26th in QBR that year (one spot ahead of Wilson). So Rodgers' recent struggles shouldn't be attributed entirely to that injury; the decline started before he joined the Jets."", ""The Steelers would probably be wise to not let Rodgers have as much say in the offense as he had with the Jets. After all, Rodgers' best season in recent history was 2020 playing under Matt LaFleur in a system that used play-action and motion at much higher relative rates than what the Jets ran last season. Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith ran play-action 27% of the time last season (10th most) but was light on motion at the snap at just 16% (28th)."", ""The Jets' offense was also heavily predicated on receivers running straight. In fact, 27% of the Jets' routes were deep fades, short fades, hitches and go routes. That probably isn't ideal in general and definitely isn't ideal for a team whose best receiver is Garrett Wilson, who excels at moving laterally. However, that route profile is a strength of DK Metcalf."", ""What separates the Steelers from, say, the Giants (another reported contender for Rodgers at one point) is that Pittsburgh has the infrastructure that could possibly take advantage of Rodgers' upside. By that I mean this is a team that has:"", 'A potentially great defense. Pittsburgh ranked 10th in EPA per play last season, but its ceiling is so much higher. With T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, Cameron Heyward and Nick Herbig (do not sleep on Nick Herbig!), the Steelers have an outrageous pass rush. And the secondary (with Minkah Fitzpatrick, Joey Porter Jr. and Darius Slay Jr.) can be solid, too.', 'Good enough pass protection. The Steelers ranked 13th in pass block win rate last season, though they lost left tackle Dan Moore Jr. to the Titans in free agency.', 'A good wide receiver in Metcalf. Though with George Pickens traded to the Dallas Cowboys, Rodgers and the Steelers really could use a second wide receiver behind the former Seahawks star. The depth chart behind Metcalf in not particularly inspiring.', ""A savvy coach with organizational power and a track record of being able to handle difficult personalities. This was something the Jets lacked, giving Rodgers de facto run of the organization. It's pretty clear that's not something a team should want, and if anyone can handle Rodgers, it's Mike Tomlin."", ""Assuming Rodgers is playing for something like the $10 million he said he would play for, this is a good move for Pittsburgh. Sure, there were low-cost QB alternatives at the draft. Shedeur Sanders fell to Day 3, but Pittsburgh passed on him at No. 83 and then again at No. 123. Even so, as poorly as Rodgers has played over the past few years, this is a relative bargain. The Steelers will likely be looking for a quarterback next offseason, but at least they didn't overspend in the interim. (They did draft Will Howard in the sixth round, but he is likely a backup in the pros.)"", ""• Offseason dates | OTAs and minicamps\n• 10 lingering questions | 2025 schedules\n• Draft pick analysis | Kiper's draft grades\n• Free agency grades | Top remaining FAs\nDraft | Free agency | Coaching hires"", ""Looking ahead, if Rodgers hits his, say, 85th percentile outcome, then the Steelers could go on a deep playoff run. If Wilson had landed in Pittsburgh and hit his own 85th percentile outcome, I don't think we could say the same thing. And if Rodgers were to hit his 85th percentile outcome with the Giants, they would still be a lacking football team. This is why the Rodgers-Steelers marriage makes uncomfortable sense."", ""Don't get me wrong: If I were the Steelers, I would not feel good about going down this path. But I also look at 30-year-old Watt and think that if they're going to take a swing while he's still there, there isn't a better alternative. -- Walder"", '', ""Riddling out whether Rodgers fits any sort of scheme or system starts not with his on-field talent but with whether he buys in. Will Rodgers willingly run the Arthur Smith offense when his time with the Jets was defined by his unwillingness to play in a new system or throw to new players? Smith's offenses in Tennessee, Atlanta and Pittsburgh have all relied heavily on play-action passes from under center, but Rodgers doesn't like turning his back to the defense. Is he finally ready to admit that his mobility is diminishing and bend his play style to accommodate it? Or will he continue to hold the line on how he wants to play?"", ""Rodgers is also an uncertain fit with Metcalf. The ex-Seahawk is one of the less precise route runners in the NFL, and Rodgers famously demands perfection from his receivers as they run his hand-selected variety of highly specific routes. It's hard to imagine a 17-game season in which there is no sideline or postgame blowup between Rodgers and his top pass catcher."", ""Even if the fit isn't perfect and the personalities clash, Rodgers was a better quarterback in the 2024 season than Russell Wilson or Justin Fields. The Steelers' offense under Rodgers will not consistently outperform last season's version, but it will likely have more peak games of competency, which could be a big deal come playoff time. -- Solak"", '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTZjblZsTkhoTU5YaG1hVWRYVFJDb0FSaXJBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

"Steelers' long wait for Aaron Rodgers is over, but offense far from finished product",https://www.nfl.com/news/steelers-long-wait-for-aaron-rodgers-is-over-but-offense-far-from-finished-product,"['Senior National Columnist', 'For months, Aaron Rodgers had said all the right things to the Pittsburgh Steelers, if not to everyone else. He had asked about practice schedules. He had throwing sessions with new Steelers receiver DK Metcalf. He had been in communication with head coach Mike Tomlin. He had given the Steelers every reason to believe he would eventually be theirs, as long as he did not shift field and completely leave the game.', ""During that time, the Steelers could only wait, knowing they were Rodgers' only potential landing spot, but having no more significant insight into his timeline than anyone else. Notably, Pittsburgh waited until the sixth round in April's draft to select a quarterback, Will Howard, about as clear as sign as possible that the team was confident Rodgers would be its QB1."", 'On Thursday, their very patient approach finally paid off, when Rodgers told the team he would be in Pittsburgh for their minicamp next week. The drama of his courtship and his decision-making process gives way to a more immediate concern: What does he still have left and how much can the Steelers put around him?', 'The Steelers are a win-right-now team, with defensive veterans like T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward, who have seen Pittsburgh through the final years of the Ben Roethlisberger era and then the long wandering through the fallow field of franchise quarterback wannabes. The Steelers have made the playoffs in four of the past five seasons. But Kenny Pickett, Justin Fields and Russell Wilson all came and went, doing enough to keep the team above .500 and get into the last two postseasons, but nowhere near enough to win a playoff game.', 'For Rodgers to get the Steelers over the hump, he will have to be considerably more consistent than he was with the New York Jets last year, when he showed flashes of being able to lead drives with his arm and brain, if no longer with his legs. Rodgers was coming back from an Achilles tear he suffered in his first game with the Jets in 2023, and there is little doubt that the injury -- coupled with being 40 years old -- contributed to the absence of mobility. The problem is that quarterbacks -- or any professional athlete, for that matter -- do not get better as they get older and there were real moments when Rodgers looked like he was very near the end. The Jets were a flawed team -- in coaching, in personnel -- and Rodgers is further removed from the worst injury of his career and from other injuries that nagged him last season, but it is fair to wonder if Rodgers is still the kind of player who can elevate his teammates. Rodgers looked mostly fine when throwing to his old friend Davante Adams last season. But his connection with a young star like Garrett Wilson never fully materialized, to the detriment of Wilson, Rodgers and the Jets offense.', 'Still, Rodgers played better toward the end of the season -- perhaps because he was healthier -- and finished the season with 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the team went 5–12 overall. It was not MVP-level Rodgers, but there was at least enough on tape to convince the Steelers that in an offseason offering few options -- it was considered a weak draft class at the position and their top choice in free agency, Fields, decided to sign with the Jets instead of staying in Pittsburgh -- Rodgers would give them the best chance to do what the Steelers are supposed to do: win playoff games.', ""To do that, it is up to the franchise to add more weapons for Rodgers after an offseason that has seen some big-name attrition. Running back Najee Harris is a Charger. George Pickens was traded to the Cowboys. Metcalf, by far the biggest offseason move before Rodgers, will be the No. 1 receiver and his downfield playmaking ability should match with Rodgers' accuracy and arm. The offensive line is going to be important here. Rodgers can still sling it when he has time. Too often with the Jets, though, he felt the pressure coming and resorted to short, over the middle dump-off passes to avoid taking hits. That's normal for an older quarterback who is not as mobile as he was as a younger player -- and it is potentially good news for slot receiver Calvin Austin III and tight end Pat Freiermuth -- but a porous offensive line and a skittish Rodgers would not be able to take full advantage of Metcalf's skills."", 'A meeting this week with free-agent Gabe Davis did not result in a contract and the Steelers likely have to keep looking for receiving targets. Pittsburgh drafted running back Kaleb Johnson, who is big with a good burst. The hope is he will add a spark and bigger running plays to a unit that struggled last season, and that offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will be able to lean into the running game he would like to execute. Without more personnel additions in the weeks before the team heads to Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in late July for training camp, the Steelers will be counting very heavily on the defense and Tomlin to generate enough support for Rodgers.', ""For as much relief and anticipation as Rodgers' decision generates, it is still just a band-aid for the Steelers. Even if they win big with Rodgers, it has been years since they could be assured they had a long-term answer at quarterback. Perhaps they hit the jackpot with Howard, who now can watch Rodgers. Perhaps the Steelers will be looking for a quarterback next offseason."", ""Rodgers, who will turn 42 in December, is a bridge, something he hasn't been in his Hall of Fame-caliber career. His buy-in will be critical -- it was clear he grew frustrated in New York last season -- but so will the Steelers'. The roster needs more help to maximize whatever time the Steelers get with Rodgers. Without reinforcements, the long wait for this quarterback, while finally over, will still have been in vain."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTZjblZsTkhoTU5YaG1hVWRYVFJDb0FSaXJBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Steelers HC Mike Tomlin loomed large in this entire situation. Tomlin was a drawing card for Rodgers, and was happy to work within Rodgers’ timeline.

', ""New York won only five games in two years with Rodgers and ended up having to eat $49 million on dead money against the salary cap. It's safe to say the Jets didn't get the Rodgers experience they hoped for. But as everyone knows, there's far more that comes with the Rodgers experience than how he plays on the field. "", ""Let's go over the pros and cons of the Steelers bringing in Rodgers for the 2025 season. "", 'Pros ', ""Even though it's easy to find negatives in signing a 41-year-old quarterback with his best football well behind him, there are positives and reasons why this move makes sense for Pittsburgh. "", 'First off, Rodgers truthfully played better than the narrative suggests last season, at least toward the end of the year. Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards, which was good enough for eighth-best in the entire NFL. He was only 31 yards behind Patrick Mahomes for seventh.  ', 'Rodgers also finished eighth in touchdowns with 28 to go along with 11 interceptions. His 11 picks were fewer than what several quarterbacks who led their team to the playoffs — Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and Jared Goff, just to name a few — put up. ', ""It's also only fair to take into account that Rodgers did open the year recovering from his Achilles injury that he suffered a few plays into the 2023 season. "", 'And after the Steelers added DK Metcalf and traded away George Pickens, a veteran like Rodgers could be the perfect person to try to get the most out of the receiver room as a whole. ', ""But most importantly, when trying to contextualize the Steelers' decision to sign Rodgers, there is an argument that he was the best available in a pretty weak market. Rodgers also won't try to hang around too long due to his advanced age, so everyone involved should be on the same page, knowing he's just a bridge option until Pittsburgh can find its next franchise guy.  "", 'Simply put, Rodgers is an upgrade, granted only a temporary one, from what the Steelers have had in recent years. ', 'Cons ', 'The problem with signing Rodgers extends far beyond what goes on between the lines. The full Rodgers experience is only partly about football. ', ""While there's a valid argument that he will still be better than the alternative, there's no player who comes with as much off-the-field baggage, either. "", 'From his political rants to his bizarre comments that turn into headlines to his appearances on ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" Rodgers is a lightning rod who can\'t help himself. Many even feel he\'s a narcissist who truly believes he\'s the smartest guy in every room. ', ""Whether HC Mike Tomlin likes it or not, he will have to manage and juggle Rodgers' personality as much, if not more, than coaching him. Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith runs a different system from what Rodgers has been used to. He's now tasked with catering his offense to Rodgers and dealing with input from a football legend way past his prime. "", 'Will Rodgers allow Tomlin and his staff to coach him? Will Rodgers make football his top priority? Will Rodgers be able to restrain himself from generating headlines that can divide a locker room?

Emailed daily. Always free!', 'When it comes to the Chicago Bears’ Achilles heel, fans will likely point to former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. However, statistics point in a different direction. Overall, the Bears are beginning a brand new era of their franchise’s history with head coach Ben Johnson at the helm. They’re hopeful his arrival will bring added structure and a true gameplan for success. What’s for certain is the team isn’t trying to hold onto to past struggles. But there’s no denying things have gotten rough for the Bears in recent years. Shockingly, Chicago has performed the worst when they were facing current Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Donte Jackson, via Dalton Wasserman of Pro Football Focus. “Jackson is perhaps the most unexpected name on this list, but in two recent matchups with Chicago, he shut down the Bears‘ receivers,” Wasserman wrote. “Across those outings in 2020 and 2023, Jackson allowed just three catches on eight targets for a total of 12 yards. He also recorded three pass breakups. The 93.1 PFF coverage grade that Jackson earned in the 2023 matchup represents his career high.” Donte Jackson vs Chicago Bears The Bears aren’t slated to play the Chargers in 2025, meaning Chicago is free from the wrath of Jackson. He did his damage against the Bears as a member of the Carolina Panthers anyway. Still, it’s a bit shocking to see how much Jackson has dominated Chicago over his career. To be fair to the Bears, they’ve come out victorious in both meetings against Jackson and the Panthers. However, the cornerback has racked up nine tackles, three pass breakups and overall played overwhelming defense on any Chicago receiver he faced. Rodgers likely still leads the list of players most hated by Bears fans due to their play against the franchise. But Jackson has crept onto Chicago’s hate list due to a pair of standout performances. Caleb Williams cannot allow cornerback dominance Williams threw just six interceptions as a rookie, a strong sign for his decision making. But while his 3,541 passing yards set a new Bears record, it wasn’t what Chicago was expecting after using the No. 1 pick on him. As he enters his sophomore campaign, Williams must live up to the hype and become a dominant force weekly. Too often during Williams’ rookie campaign did he look non-existent in the box score. Nine times did he fail to reach 200 yards passing, six games seeing him not even hit 150 yards. Overall, the Bears finished their 2024 campaign ranked second-to-last in passing offense, averaging 181.5 yards per game. Chicago has completely revamped their offense line, which should help Williams stay upright in the pocket. He was sacked a league-high 68 times as a rookie. Furthermore, the Bears made a pair of major additions in Colston Loveland and Luther Burden to what was already a pretty stacked receiving room. All the pieces are there for success, but Williams must put the Bears puzzle together. He won’t have Jackson to deal with, but he cannot become victim to any cornerback. Williams must be an expert at Johnson’s scheme and show why he was the top overall pick in the draft.', 'Mitch Marner\'s future in the NHL could dictate many things in free agency this summer, and now, it appears a shocking team has emerged as a contender to land him. The Toronto Maple Leafs appear ready to lose Mitch Marner in free agency this summer, and before free agency officially opens, we\'ve had plenty of reports around the superstar forward. It seems as though almost every team with cap space could be in on No. 16. Now, insider Elliotte Friedman has dropped a bombshell, revealing that the Utah Mammoth, after just one season in the NHL are ready to make a splash and land the superstar forward. ""If there is one team everyone is watching and saying I\'m really curious to see what they do it is Utah. Teams believe that Utah is determined to introduce themselves to the NHL in a big way."" With a young core led by captain Clayton Keller, Dylan Guenther and Logan Cooley, Marner is exactly the type of player who would be a perfect fit for the Utah Mammoth. With the salary cap to land him, they could put in one of the biggest offers for him. On top of that, they are open to moving the No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft, suggesting this is a team that wants to make a genuine impact in 2025-26. While they may or may not land Marner, expect them to be in the bidding all the way until the end.', 'Since joining the WNBA as the No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft, Indiana Fever guards Caitlin Clark and Lexie Hull have built a strong relationship. The two are constantly seen goofing around with each other throughout the season. They have even joined each other for vacation, taking a trip to Mexico during the WNBA\'s Olympic break last July. Now, they have entered their second season together, starting off with a 3-4 record. However, Clark has been sidelined for the last three games due to a quad strain. But, just like in 2024, Hull seems to have more exciting plans for this Summer. On Thursday, she took to social media to announce the start date of her new basketball camp. ""I’m so excited to host my @SimpleTruth4U Basketball Camp this summer!"" Hull wrote on Instagram. ""We’ll work on all aspects of the game—skills, teamwork, confidence—and of course, HAVE FUN!"" Hull also noted that the event will take place on June 28 at Aletto Family Sports Center in Carmel, Indiana. Clark, as she often does, was left excited by Hull\'s new announcement, leaving a response in the comment section. ""Can\'t wait to attend,"" Clark said. ""Hoping we just do defensive slides all camp."" The camp is open to boys and girls in grades one through eight and costs $125 per participant. Hull will also be giving out memorabilia for each participant, including an autographed souvenir, a camp team photo with Hull and a limited-edition t-shirt. Through seven games in 2025, Hull is on her way to having the best season of her career. She is averaging 10.7 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game, while leading the WNBA in 3-point percentage at 55.6%. The Fever will have one game left until Clark can potentially return from injury, with a target date of June 10 against the Atlanta Dream. But for now, the focus will be Saturday\'s game against Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky.', 'As the Baltimore Orioles look to try and build some momentum of late, some roster decisions are having to be made with players getting healthy. It has easily been the best stretch of baseball lately for the Orioles. This was a team that had some high expectations coming into the season but has fallen way short of those so far. With one of the worst records in the league, a recent winning streak has helped cause a bit of optimism, but a lot more work has to be done. Fortunately, the starting rotation has picked up their performance a bit, and the lineup is starting to finally get healthy as well. Recently, Baltimore outfielder Cooper Hummel elected to test free agency instead of accepting an assignment to the minors. Hummel has bounced around quite a bit in the Majors the last several years, and landed briefly with the Orioles. However, his time with the team is going to be short-lived, with just one game played for the franchise. Due to Baltimore starting to get some players healthy, Hummel likely wants to see if there are going to be more playing time opportunities elsewhere. Losing the 30-year-old will have some impact on the depth of the organization, but as long as players continue to get healthy, the organization has plenty of talent in the lineup. With the franchise in the midst of some success finally, it will be interesting to see if they can rally back toward .500 in the coming weeks and months with a healthy team.', 'Join hundreds of thousands of readers who start their day with The Morning Bark, the best newsletter in sports.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTZjblZsTkhoTU5YaG1hVWRYVFJDb0FSaXJBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

"Winners, losers from Aaron Rodgers joining Steelers: DK Metcalf gets boost, Steelers still bad?",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/winners-losers-from-aaron-rodgers-joining-steelers-dk-metcalf-gets-boost-steelers-still-bad/,"['', 'After months of speculation, Aaron Rodgers agreed to sign a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers and will report for minicamp next week. While the team was never truly worried about missing out on Rodgers according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones, it certainly took time, patience and a willingness to deal with at least a little bit of uncertainty.', 'Rodgers, 41, is coming off a disappointing two-year tenure with the Jets in which he tore his Achilles in Week 1 of 2023 and then struggled for much of 2024. After winning nearly two-thirds of his starts with the Steelers, Rodgers posted just a 6-12 record with New York, and he posted his lowest yards per attempt (6.7) as a starter last season while taking 40 sacks, his most since 2018.', 'Still, he is a four-time MVP, someone who, even far from his peak powers, slots in as the best quarterback the Steelers have had since Ben Roethlisberger\'s retirement. Even amid a lost 2024 season, he showed flashes of ""vintage Rodgers"" later in the year, highlighted by a four-touchdown performance in Week 18 against the Dolphins.', ""Rodgers' plan to sign has ripple effects across the Steelers and the league as a whole, both now and in the future. Here are winners and losers from the move:"", 'The Steelers, frankly, were desperate for Rodgers to sign. Yes, there were talks of contingency plans, but the Steelers had been after Rodgers for months, with every media appearance or every report on his plans holding major sway for an organization that has long prided itself on stability.', 'Pittsburgh moved on from both of its 2024 quarterbacks -- Russell Wilson and Justin Fields -- and had three quarterbacks on its roster: career backups Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson and sixth-round rookie Will Howard. That would have inarguably classified Pittsburgh as one of the worst quarterback rooms, if not the worst quarterback room, in the NFL.', ""Rodgers is no longer a premier quarterback, but he is a clear upgrade over what Pittsburgh had before Thursday and perhaps even above Wilson. Though both quarterbacks had similar success rates and expected points added per dropback in 2024, Rodgers avoids negative plays at a much higher rate -- Wilson had an 11.1% negative play rate last year compared to Rodgers' 8.8% -- and is much more willing to play on schedule and throw over the middle, vital parts of Arthur Smith's offense."", ""Rodgers is another year removed from a significant injury. He's entering a system that should, fundamentally, be more sound than the Jets' underwhelming, scattershot system, run first by Rodgers' old pal Nathaniel Hackett and then, after the Robert Saleh firing, by Todd Downing. The biggest difference between the Jets and the Steelers is stability. The Jets haven't had it for a decade-plus. The Steelers have. That should be good for Rodgers."", ""If the Steelers being both a winner and a loser from this signing doesn't summarize the Rodgers experience, nothing will. Rodgers, the player, is in clear decline. Beyond the stats, he graded out as Pro Football Focus' No. 18 quarterback last season, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize Wilson was 15th. A big issue for Wilson was his all-or-nothing approach that relied heavily on the deep ball. As a result, he finished 28th in success rate. That was still one spot better than Rodgers."", ""Beyond Rodgers the player is a significant injury history -- he limped through parts of 2024 -- and his sometimes-frustrating personality. The Jets appeased Rodgers with former coaches and teammates. He didn't deliver. He took a long time to decide his future and now faces an abbreviated offseason learning a new system. He is at the very least a big personality. He will have to fit into Mike Tomlin's well-established culture. That's not saying it can't be done. But there are questions -- and potentially headaches -- ahead."", 'One of the earliest signs pointing Rodgers to Pittsburgh was an informal throwing session with DK Metcalf in late March. Metcalf, who was traded from the Seahawks and promptly signed a five-year, $150 million extension, projects as the type of No. 1 receiver Rodgers has thrived with. A supercharged athlete with speed to burn, Metcalf should feature heavily in this offense on in-breaking routes, too.', 'Moreover, the Steelers showed a willingness to match Metcalf, 27, with a quarterback who has worked with big-bodied, physically gifted perimeter receivers his entire career. Metcalf has little competition for targets in a relatively scarce wide receiver room, and he should put up a monster season. Even amid a rough 2024 for the Jets, Garrett Wilson had over 100 catches, and Davante Adams averaged over six catches for over 77 yards per game in New York.', 'If there were ever a time to get off the high-floor, low-ceiling path the Steelers have been on since Roethlisberger retired, it was now. Instead, they likely face a similar outcome to what they have done every year since 2017: Go .500 or better and fail to win a playoff game.', ""Rodgers will be the Steelers' sixth different starting quarterback since 2022, the first year after Roethlisberger's retirement. Only one was drafted by the team: 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett, who never worked out. Pittsburgh never devoted resources to finding a Roethlisberger succession plan when he was in Pittsburgh and swung and missed on their only true attempt after he left."", ""Unless Rodgers really raises the ceiling, the Steelers will go another season without a true plan for the future of the position. Maybe he proves this inconsequential with a terrific year, but based on the past three seasons, that doesn't appear to be the case."", ""This isn't a perfect landing spot for Rodgers, but it is pretty good. The Steelers have famously never had a losing season under Tomlin. While that fact might be tiring, it's a testament to remarkable consistency in a league where most teams rise and fall. Rodgers should be backed by a strong defense and protected by a young offensive line that should only improve. Center Zach Frazier had a solid rookie season, and 2024 first-rounder Troy Fautanu returns from injury that limited him to one game last year. Left tackle Broderick Jones, a 2023 first-round selection, enters year three and is a key factor."", ""As a bonus, Rodgers faces the Jets in Week 1 and the Green Bay Packers (on Sunday Night Football, no less) in Week 8. The revenge tour begins. If he can beat Green Bay, he'd have beaten every team in the NFL over his illustrious career"", ""Rudolph and Howard did everything they were asked to do. Rudolph handled the Rodgers noise with aplomb. Howard, fresh off a national championship, figured to have a chance to be Rudolph's primary backup at worst. Now, both are relegated to the bench. Perhaps this matters, in the grand scheme of things, a little bit less for Rudolph, but Howard being relegated to third-string duty means fewer practice reps, which is a tough pill to swallow for him."", 'Rodgers is many things. ""Boring"" isn\'t one of them. For a franchise that\'s generally been very buttoned-up and straightforward dealing with the media, Rodgers is a major departure. Expect some fireworks.', 'The Steelers were reportedly monitoring the Kirk Cousins situation in Atlanta as recently as late May. Cousins has not been at OTAs and has asked for a trade, though a deal was always going to have to wait until post-June 1 money savings kicked in.', ""Now, there's no clear spot for Cousins to land as a starter. The Browns have four quarterbacks. The Giants brought in two free agents and drafted Jaxson Dart in the first round. The Steelers have found their answer. Cousins has wanted out for months, but it will be hard for him to find a good landing spot and perhaps even harder for the Falcons to find a willing trade partner."", ""If the Ravens, Bengals and Browns thought this might finally be the year the Steelers reset, they have to think again. We've run through the pros and cons of the Rodgers signing for Pittsburgh, but it's clear this team hopes to compete in the rugged AFC North. Rodgers is 3-0 in his career against the Browns, 3-1 against the Ravens and 2-2 against the Bengals."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Aaron Rodgers signing with Steelers: Four-time NFL MVP joins Pittsburgh on one-year deal,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-signing-with-steelers-four-time-nfl-mvp-joins-pittsburgh-on-one-year-deal/,"['', ""After weeks of waiting and mulling his different options, Aaron Rodgers has chosen his new NFL team. The four-time NFL MVP is signing a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, sources told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Rodgers will attend Pittsburgh's mandatory minicamp next week. "", 'The Steelers were one of three teams viewed as being in the running for Rodgers. The New York Giants were another, but instead opted to sign Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson. The Minnesota Vikings were also a team to watch; the sides had had conversations before the Vikings ultimately decided to go ahead with J.J. McCarthy, a 2024 first-round pick who was injured his entire rookie season. ', 'The Steelers made it clear at the NFL Scouting Combine that they wanted to re-sign either Wilson or Justin Fields at quarterback before the start of free agency, but failed on both counts. Now, Pittsburgh has committed to going the veteran quarterback route for another year while bringing back Mason Rudolph and drafting Ohio State QB Will Howard in the seventh round.', 'Rodgers, who spent the past two years with the New York Jets, is coming off the worst season of his Hall-of-Fame career. He registered career-worsts in games lost (12), yards per attempt (6.7) and passer rating (90.5). In 2024, Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and became the fifth quarterback in NFL history to reach 500 career touchdown passes.', 'While the Steelers can now feel more comfortable having grabbed a seat in this stressful game of quarterback musical chairs, the decision to sign Rodgers will be a polarizing one in Pittsburgh. After all, Rodgers has more losing seasons (three) than playoff wins (two) since 2017. In fact, earlier this offseason Steelers safety DeShon Elliott even commented on a social media post pointing to the fact that the Steelers became the betting favorites to land Rodgers, saying, ""Leave his ass at the retirement home.""', 'The Steelers are attempting to revamp an offense that was much too inconsistent in 2024. Pittsburgh swung a trade for former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf and gave him a five-year, $150 million contract last month, and now, has found its new quarterback. ', 'If Rodgers could win one more Super Bowl, he would join Manning and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks ever to win at least three league MVPs and two Super Bowls. That would certainly cement his place as a top-five quarterback in NFL history. ', ""That's the reward aspect of Rodgers giving it one more go with the Steelers in 2025 along with how celebrated he would be for lifting one of the league's most historic franchises back to the mountain top for Pittsburgh's first championship since the 2008 season. Doing so would also allow Rodgers to ride off into the sunset with many people forgetting some of his behavior regarding his public health stances and the worst season of his career helping lead to the firings of New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas in 2024. "", 'However, giving it another go in 2025 as he turns 42 is also a big risk. Rodgers will be two years removed from tearing his Achilles, and last season he looked incredibly stiff moving around the pocket following an injury that has drained much of the mobility that allowed him to dance around in the pocket before making jaw-dropping throw after jaw-dropping throw throughout his career. Another serious injury, missing the postseason, plenty of pain and even a potential, permanent limp could be the end result of another year of NFL football for Rodgers at his age. -- Garrett Podell', ""While talent was clearly a reason why the Steelers fell apart late last season, you could argue that a lack of offensive leadership also contributed to the collapse. While Rodgers' public persona is a complicated, he has largely been regarded in the past as a great teammate and a leader who isn't afraid to challenge anyone. The Steelers haven't had an offensive leader like that since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season. What Rodgers should bring to Pittsburgh from a leadership standpoint shouldn't be overlooked. "", ""While they don't have a ton of depth behind them, the Steelers' offensive line has the potential to be the franchise's best since 2020. The starting-five projects to include two former first-round picks in tackles Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu, a returning Pro Bowler in veteran guard Isaac Seumalo, and two second-years players in center Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick who were immediate starters in 2024. "", ""Rodgers has weapons at his disposal in DK Metcalf, fellow wideout Calvin Austin III and tight end Pat Freiermuth. He's already started working with Metcalf, and he should quickly gel with Austin, whose work ethic is among the best on the team. The Steelers are also reportedly trying to acquire another proven wideout after trading George Pickens to the Cowboys last month. There have been rumblings that Roman Wilson -- who missed his entire rookie season with an injury -- has impressed during OTAs. "", ""Pittsburgh still has Jaylen Warren, but it lost a big part of its offense when it let fellow running back Najee Harris test free agency (he ultimately signed with the Chargers). With Harris gone, the Steelers spent a third round pick on his replacement, former Iowa running back Kaleb Johnson. The 6-foot-1, 225-pound Johnson has already been compared to both Harris and Le'Veon Bell. Along with possessing Harris-like physicality, Johnson's patience and big-play ability are similar to Bell, who set several franchise records during his five-year run in Pittsburgh. "", ""Defensively, Rodgers will be complemented by a unit that is capable of winning some games on its own, especially after adding some necessary pieces via free agency and during the draft. The Steelers' defensive additions this offseason includes six-time Pro Bowl cornerback Darius Slay and first-round pick Derrick Harmon, one of the top-ranked defensive tackle prospects in this year's draft. -- Bryan DeArdo"", ""The fun gets started in Week 1 at New York in a game CBS will broadcast. The Jets had a chance to bring Rodgers back for a third season in New York, but they decided to move on. During an interview with Pat McAfee in April, Rodgers definitely sounded bitter about the way things ended. The 41-year-old said he flew across the country on his own dime only to sit down for a meeting where he was told in the first 20 seconds that the Jets didn't want him. "", ""The game between the Steelers and Jets is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. ET in Week 1, which is something that definitely would NOT have happened if the NFL had known for sure that Rodgers was going to sign. In a recent interview with CBS Sports, Mike North, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning and scheduling, admitted that the game likely would have been given a prime-time slot if the league had been 100% certain that Rodgers was going to play. "", '""I think if the league knew, we probably would\'ve scheduled that game for a national television window,"" North said. ""Look at what we did with Aaron Rogers\' first game the last two years (both Monday night games). If we knew something, I think you would\'ve seen it reflected in the schedule. That being said, still a good game.""', 'The Week 8 Sunday night game that will see Pittsburgh host Green Bay is likely to be bittersweet for Rordgers, who of course started his career in Green Bay after the Packers selected him in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. By 2008, he was the full-time starter and during his 15 years under center, he led the Packers to five NFC title games and one Super Bowl win while also winning four MVP awards. Rodgers had a Hall of Fame career in Green Bay, but it came to a somewhat bitter end in April 2023 when the Packers traded him to New York.  ', ""The Packers made it pretty clear that they were getting ready to move on from Rodgers when they used a first-round pick in 2020 to select Jordan Love. Rodgers wasn't happy about the pick and things became awkward between him and the front office after that. Rodgers will now get to face Love for the first time. -- John Breech"", ""If Rodgers can beat Green Bay, he'd be just the fifth quarterback to beat all 32 teams as a starter, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees Peyton Manning, Brett Favre. Only two other active quarterbacks -- Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes -- have beaten 31 teams. Neither is set to reach 32 this season, as Wilson's Giants do not play the Seahawks, and Mahomes remains on the Chiefs. Two quarterbacks -- Joe Montana and Fran Tarkenton -- beat all 28 teams when the NFL had only 28 teams. -- Zachary Pereles"", 'Metcalf, who was traded from the Seahawks and promptly signed a five-year, $150 million extension, projects as the type of No. 1 receiver Rodgers has thrived with.

Pittsburgh coincidentally did little in the draft to make the marriage less likely, waiting until Day 3 to select a quarterback (Will Howard; No. 185 overall).', ""That left the Steelers staring at a QB room composed of Howard, Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, with one of the NFL's most obvious needs for a difference-making signal-caller."", 'Especially following the signing of Russell Wilson by the New York Giants -- another Rodgers suitor -- and several teams finding QBs through the draft, Pittsburgh inking the 41-year-old became the expected result for both parties, barring a Rodgers retirement.', 'Rodgers is coming off a season that dinged his reputation as a top-tier quarterback, as he struggled to make the difference so many expected for the New York Jets during a 5-12 campaign that included his head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas being fired midseason.', 'But Pittsburgh is nonetheless happy to land a future Pro Football Hall of Famer with 62,952 passing yards and 503 touchdowns under his belt. Adding another level of intrigue to the signing is that the Steelers play at the Jets to open the regular season on Sept. 7 and also host the Green Bay Packers on Oct. 26 on Sunday Night Football.', ""Rodgers' perceived downswing during the 2024 season at least partly stems from just how prolific he's been in stacking stats throughout his 20-year NFL career."", ""He wasn't as deadly accurate for New York as he's been, nor was he as nimble coming off a torn Achilles, but he still completed 63% of his passes for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 2024. His numbers look even better when considering his final 10 games last season: 2,234 yards, 18 TDs and four INTs with a 64 completion percentage."", 'Rodgers, essentially swapping places with Justin Fields after the mobile QB agreed to go from the Black and Gold to Gang Green, will be working with a pass-catching group somewhat in flux.', ""The Steelers traded for Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf, who through six seasons has never fallen under 900 receiving yards and three times eclipsed 1,000.

Opinion: Is Aaron Rodgers washed up? Don’t be so sure,https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2025/6/5/24443987/aaron-rodgers-can-help-the-steelers-win-playoffs-new-york-jets-nfl-signing-nfl-2025-offseason-pff,"['FILED UNDER:', 'The four-time MVP can still sling it, and he can help the Steelers end their playoff drought', 'If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.', 'Mercifully, the months-long will-he-won’t-he game is over. Aaron Rodgers is officially the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers - but now what? What is the ceiling of this team? How far can they go? And what will Rodgers look like in his 21st year in the NFL? There are plenty of questions that still remain, even with Rodgers answering the biggest one. One thing seems pretty evident, though, and it’s that the Steelers are banking on the fact that Rodgers still has it and that he can prove a lot of people wrong - much like his former predecessor Brett Favre did in 2009.', 'Like Favre, Rodgers went to the New York Jets after a long career with the Green Bay Packers, and both stints didn’t exactly go as planned. Favre looked poised to lead New York to a playoff berth after an 8-3 start, but the Jets lost four of their final five games and missed the playoffs. Favre threw 22 touchdowns and 22 interceptions that season, and it looked as if that would be an unceremonious sunset season for the three-time MVP. However, in 2009, he joined the Minnesota Vikings and looked like a completely different player.', 'That season, Favre recaptured some of his former glory at age 40, throwing 33 touchdowns to just seven interceptions, which was the lowest total in a full season for his career. He also topped 4,200 yards passing for the first time since 1998 en route to leading the Vikings to an improbable appearance in the NFC Championship Game. And if not for a patented awful Favre interception late in the fourth quarter, the Vikings likely would have won and gone on to face Peyton Manning and the Colts in the Super Bowl.', 'I say all that to say this - Rodgers showed he still has some gas in the tank in 2024. Despite the Jets being a tire fire, Rodgers had 28 touchdown passes, which ranked sixth in the NFL. He averaged more yards per game than Justin Herbert, Jordan Love, Kyler Murray, C.J. Stroud, and Josh Allen, and his 90.5 passer rating was hovering around the league average of 92.3.', 'AARON RODGERS TO DAVANTE ADAMS FOR THE 71-YARD TD TO TAKE THE LEAD\n\n(via @NFL)\npic.twitter.com/Fn1FvWGG95', 'Rodgers’ arm talent was still very evident in 2024, as well. He finished seventh in the NFL in big-time throws with 26, and also didn’t put the ball in harm’s way, finishing with the third-lowest turnover-worthy play percentage of all quarterbacks with at least 150 dropbacks in 2024, per PFF.', 'To continue, Rodgers had one of the worst offensive lines in the NFL last season, which is practically kryptonite for an older signal-caller. Of the 44 quarterbacks with 150 dropbacks, he finished 33rd in average time to throw. Rodgers also didn’t get any help from the run game, as the Jets finished with the second-fewest rushing yards per game in the NFL. To compare, Justin Fields had the third-longest time to throw, while Russell Wilson finished in the upper half, as well, at 16th. The Steelers also had the 11th most rushing yards per game in 2024. Plug Aaron Rodgers into that offense last season, and it isn’t crazy to say they’d win at least one more game, which could have changed the outlook of their postseason fortunes, as well.', 'This isn’t to say that Rodgers is still the guy who was tossing 48 touchdowns to five interceptions back in 2020 - he isn’t. But he also hasn’t fallen off a cliff like some would suggest. Now in a more stable organization with a good head coach, a good No. 1 recevier, a solid offensive line and running back duo, as well as a strong defense on the other side of him, there’s no reason to believe Rodgers can’t have his own renaissance year like Favre did 16 years ago and help the Steelers end this playoff-win drought.', '', 'Gambling Problem?

"Are the Steelers lost? Pittsburgh is banking on Aaron Rodgers to save franchise from drama, mediocrity",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/are-the-steelers-lost-as-clock-ticks-on-aaron-rodgers-pittsburgh-is-mired-in-drama-and-mediocrity/,"['', ""The Pittsburgh Steelers pride themselves on tradition. Six Super Bowl wins. The NFL's longest-tenured head coach. Black and gold uniforms that have rarely been tweaked. They are what you might call one of the dignitaries of football history, established in the earliest days of the NFL and still graced with some of the league's premier matchups, like the NFL's first foray into Ireland this fall."", 'Unfortunately, legacy doesn\'t always equate to contemporary impact. ""Star Wars"" was a cultural phenomenon at the tail end of the 1970s, right around the same time the Steelers were the NFL\'s dynastic powerhouse. Today, ""Star Wars"" is an oversaturated made-for-streaming brand, and the Steelers are the NFL equivalent, living off residuals and banking on nostalgia without lasting results.', 'Is this an unreasonable critique of a franchise that last suffered a losing record in 2003, the year 50 Cent dropped ""In Da Club"" and George W. Bush was halfway through his first term? Does consistency warrant no respect anymore? Surely fans of downtrodden, dysfunctional teams like the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets would kill to have even half the Steelers\' annual success.', 'The problem is, the Steelers tout their higher bar -- ""The standard is the standard,"" coach Mike Tomlin often quips -- like it still applies to their operation. What is the standard? Winning titles? That hasn\'t occurred since 2008, when Ben Roethlisberger was 26 years old. Winning conference championships? That hasn\'t happened since 2010, when Aaron Rodgers was the trophy-wielding face of the Green Bay Packers, not the 41-year-old ""missing piece"" of the very Steelers team he conquered in Super Bowl XLV. Winning just a single playoff game? Nope. Not since 2016.', 'The Steelers deserve credit for staying relevant. But only in the sense that ""relevant"" means annually eligible for an ugly one-and-done postseason appearance. In the time since ""the standard"" last translated to a Pittsburgh playoff victory, the Kansas City Chiefs have drafted Patrick Mahomes and made five Super Bowls, the nearby Philadelphia Eagles have made three Super Bowls and won two (with two different sets of coaches and quarterbacks), and the rival Cincinnati Bengals have made two AFC title games. Only seven NFL teams have longer active playoff-win droughts.', 'Miami Dolphins', '24', 'Las Vegas Raiders', '22', 'New York Jets', '14', 'Chicago Bears', '14', 'Arizona Cardinals', '9', 'Carolina Panthers', '9', 'Denver Broncos', '9', ""But don't worry, Tomlin has never had a losing record! We should all fear that Steelers defense!"", ""Perhaps this is too harsh. Perhaps the Steelers really do deserve the benefit of the doubt. If you hang around long enough, after all, you're bound to get over the hump eventually. It's what defined Andy Reid's career, in a way, going from longtime would-be champion with the Eagles to repeat trophy-winner in Kansas City."", ""The difference is that Reid and his Chiefs, and even the Eagles that followed his Philly tenure, always adapted offensively (and had some elite quarterbacking to help). The Steelers, meanwhile, have been stumbling all over themselves in search of a dance partner since the final sluggish seasons of Roethlisberger's reign."", ""They closed their eyes and smashed the red button in 2022, spending a first-round draft pick on Kenny Pickett, only to saddle the young signal-caller with iffy staffing and support, then ship him out of town entirely once he soured on his hometown team a couple years later. They proactively pillaged the bargain bin with Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, only to let both veterans walk after another aggressively mediocre January finish. And now they're entering summer 2025 -- Year 19 of the Tomlin regime -- with every chip pushed onto Rodgers, who waited until June to make a firm commitment to the organization."", 'It\'s not easy to go from one long-term quarterback answer to the next, a la the Packers with Brett Favre to Rodgers to Jordan Love. Sometimes -- oftentimes -- taking lumps is required. In this way, however, the Steelers\' ""standard"" of perpetual wild-card contention has actually worked against them. ', ""Like, say, the New Orleans Saints, who until this offseason refused for years to embrace a full rebuild, forever gazing at the past peaks of the Drew Brees-Sean Payton reign, the Steelers have avoided the potential fruits of a total teardown -- at quarterback, atop the staff, etc. -- by always prioritizing quick fixes. Is that smart, given Tomlin's ability to coax a winner out of any roster? Or is it delusional, given his inability to top true contenders down the stretch?"", '2022', 'Mitchell Trubisky', 'Free agency', '2-5', '2022', 'Kenny Pickett', 'Draft', '14-10', '2024', 'Russell Wilson', 'Free agency', '6-6', ""As we stand here in 2025, it's probably true that Rodgers was the Steelers' best remaining bet at quarterback. He's aging, but he can still sling the rock. He certainly offers a higher ceiling than Mason Rudolph, whose recent internal endorsements should ring a bit hollow considering Pittsburgh literally let the career backup leave town immediately following his brief 2023 takeover."", ""Just because Rodgers was the best arm available doesn't mean Pittsburgh is off the hook for reaching this point. The guy who left the Jets in ruin and barely stayed upright while doing so is your grand plan? That's at least a little concerning."", ""We could've said the same thing about the Jets of two years ago. When Rodgers was approaching 40, coming off a so-so finale with the Packers, was he an upgrade for New York? An understandable win-now gamble? Sure. But the primary reason Rodgers chose the Jets wasn't because New York was a shining beacon of potential Super Bowl glory, but because he knew his time was up in Green Bay and his market around the NFL was no longer incredibly robust. And the primary reason the Jets bet on Rodgers' impact -- not so much his upside, but his past results -- was because they were absolutely desperate for help."", ""Is anyone surprised, in retrospect, that the entire marriage proved both short-lived and akin to a reality-TV circus? No. Not really. That's what makes the Jets the Jets. But the real question is, are the present-day Steelers that far off? That's not to say the two are comparable in the NFL standings; Steelers fans can at least bank on sniffing the playoffs every fall, which is a lot more than can be said for Gang Green faithful. Failure to meet internal standards, however, is just part of what makes Pittsburgh such a curious franchise right now. There's also the team's evident appetite for -- or at least tolerance of -- sideshow drama."", ""Love or hate Rodgers, he is an outsized presence and increasingly public personality. He acts and sounds off as he pleases. Now, he's earned that platform as a future Hall of Famer. And he may well face too much scrutiny for it. But the fact he dominated the Steelers' news cycle for months, even before putting pen to paper to play for the team, is just par for the course in Pittsburgh these days. Far from the buttoned-up outfit they're often portrayed as, the Steelers might be one of the NFL's most riotous assemblies -- darn near attracted to tabloid fodder -- during their near-decade of playoff stagnation."", ""When Roethlisberger retired in 2022, the franchise great indicated certain factions of the front office wanted him back, arguing the alleged divide all but forced him to hang up the cleats. Before the ill-tempered George Pickens was traded out of the wide receiver room this offseason, there was Le'Veon Bell, Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Chase Claypool, Diontae Johnson -- a whole cast of talented playmakers whose locker-room volatility bought them unceremonious exits."", ""These weren't bottom-of-the-roster malcontents. They were front-facing standouts who simply couldn't stick under the Steelers' standards. Or were they just products of that standard? Tomlin is a revered leader who often gets heralded for running a tight ship despite employing plenty of colorful characters. Are we sure his Steelers aren't just a wellspring of players destined to disrupt? Is Pittsburgh really good at maximizing troubled talents before cutting them loose, or does the team just have an unhealthy attachment to such projects? What about finding elite players stable enough to retain for the long term?"", ""There are exceptions, of course: T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Minkah Fitzpatrick. It just so happens most of those gems fall on the defensive side of the ball. It's the spots critical to modern-day success -- you know, quarterback, receiver, etc. -- that have either been fumbled or filled with short fuses in Western Pennsylvania."", ""Maybe, just maybe, the Steelers will finally right the ship with Rodgers at the helm. Maybe they have a longer-term solution up their sleeves. And maybe that something is an unspoken commitment to mining the 2026 quarterback class for a true savior. But even that should be considered something of a pipe dream. We're old enough to remember scouts suggesting teams desperate for quarterbacks wait for the 2023 class just for the mere possibility of landing ... Bryce Young. Literally every single quarterback class is barely even a 50-50 proposition in terms of who pans out and who doesn't. Are we to believe the Steelers front office that handpicked and quickly dumped Pickett is equipped to right that wrong next time around?"", 'Terry Bradshaw, the most accomplished Steelers quarterback of all-time, might\'ve been letting his emotions fly when he described the current club this offseason as a ""joke"" and ""failure"" for its pursuit of Rodgers. Yet it\'s hard not to consider his perspective when Pittsburgh\'s abundance of high-profile drama rarely supersedes its big-game production. Or when a pattern of actions that lends itself to being ""just good enough"" takes precedent over the necessary pains of an overhaul. Winning cures everything, they say, and the issue in Steel City hasn\'t necessarily been winning; it\'s been winning games that matter. Tomlin has done that before. The Steelers have done that before. No one can take that away from them.', 'Now it\'s time -- beyond time -- for them to make ""the standard"" mean something again. They\'d better hope Rodgers can be a better savior now, in Pittsburgh, than he was for a fellow AFC hopeful farther east.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

But Rodgers had given mixed signals about whether he wants to continue his career.', '“I’m in a different phase of my life,” Rodgers said in April. “To make a commitment to a team is a big thing. And I don’t think it’s fair to the Steelers or anyone while I’m dealing with a lot off the field.”', 'Whatever those issues were appear to have been resolved, but the Steelers will not get the version of Rodgers who once cut a swathe through the NFL in his prime with the Green Bay Packers, winning four league MVP awards and a Super Bowl along the way. Rodgers’s tenure with the Jets was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.', 'Rodgers’s hesitation over signing a contract had irritated many around the Steelers, including Terry Bradshaw, who led the team to four Super Bowl titles during his playing career.', '“That’s a joke. That to me is just a joke,” Bradshaw said last month of the Steelers’ prolonged pursuit of Rodgers. “What are you going to do? Bring him in for one year, are you kidding me?”', 'Without Rodgers, the Steelers would probably start Mason Rudolph, who recently rejoined the team from the Tennessee Titans. However, Rudolph was a modest quarterback at best during his first stint with the team.', 'If Rodgers does end up as the Steelers’ starter he will face a familiar foe in Week 1: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their season opener.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTZjblZsTkhoTU5YaG1hVWRYVFJDb0FSaXJBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

He spent his last two seasons with the New York Jets following an 18-year run with the Green Bay Packers to start his career.', 'Rodgers comes to Pittsburgh with a lengthy list of accomplishments and memorable moments.', 'Here are some of the most notable:', 'After developing into an NFL prospect during one year at Butte College and two at Cal, Rodgers was a possibility to go No. 1 overall in the 2005 draft. But he had a longer-than-expected wait before Green Bay selected him 24th overall.', 'After sitting behind Brett Favre for three seasons, Rodgers got his opportunity to be the Packers’ starter in 2008 after Favre – who retired briefly and then returned -- was traded to the Jets. Rodgers quickly established himself as one of the NFL’s top passers, throwing for 4,038 yards. It was the first of 10 seasons during which he’d pass for at least 4,000 yards.', 'Rodgers led the Packers to the Super Bowl to cap the 2010 season and was selected the game’s MVP after throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns in Green Bay’s 31–25 win over Pittsburgh.', 'Rodgers won the first of his four AP NFL MVP awards in 2011 after passing for a career-high and franchise-best 4,643 yards with 45 TDs and just six interceptions while setting an NFL record with a 122.5 passer rating.', 'In 2014, Rodgers and the Packers bounced back from a sluggish 1-2 start to reach the NFC championship game, where Green Bay lost to Seattle. He capped the season by winning his second MVP award.', 'Arguably Rodgers’ most memorable pass came in Detroit in Week 13 of the 2015 season against the Lions, who led the Packers 23-20 and appeared to win until a defensive facemask penalty was called with no time left on the clock. It gave Green Bay one more chance and Rodgers chucked a 61-yard toss that was caught by Richard Rodgers in the end zone for an unlikely victory. It was the first of Rodgers’ four career completed Hail Mary throws, the most in NFL history.', 'Rodgers threw a career-high and Packers-record 48 TD passes and set a personal best with a 70.7 completion percentage on his way to his third AP NFL MVP award. The Packers made it to the NFC title game again, but lost to Tom Brady and eventual Super Bowl-champion Tampa Bay. Rodgers fell to 1-4 in conference championship games and became the first QB to lose four straight appearances.', 'Rodgers missed a game in 2021 after testing positive for COVID-19 and later acknowledged he hadn’t gotten the vaccine. He said he was “immunized” when asked about his vaccination status before the season. Although he took responsibility for being misleading about his status initially, Rodgers also criticized the way NFL protocols impacted unvaccinated players and frequently spoke out regarding his skepticism over the vaccine.', 'Rodgers capped a controversy-tinged 2021 season by winning his fourth AP NFL MVP award, becoming the fifth player to win consecutive MVPs and first since Peyton Manning (2008 and 2009). He and Manning are also the only players to win at least four MVP awards.', 'Rodgers signed a three-year contract before the 2022 season with the Packers worth $150.8 million, with $101.5 million guaranteed, making him the highest-paid player in North American sports history on an annual basis at that time. He broke his right thumb early in the season, but continued playing and the Packers finished 8-9 and missed the playoffs.', 'Rodgers was traded to New York on April 26, 2023, immediately raising expectations for the Jets, whose only Super Bowl appearance was in the 1968 season. But just four snaps into his debut in the season opener against Buffalo, Rodgers tore his left Achilles tendon.', 'Rodgers started off slowly in his return from his torn Achilles tendon and then dealt with other knee, ankle and hamstring injuries as the Jets got off to a 2-3 start and fired coach Robert Saleh. Rodgers played better down the stretch, but New York finished 5-12 and missed the playoffs for the 14th straight year. After becoming the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 regular-season TD passes in the season finale, Rodgers said he needed to take some time off to ponder his playing future.', 'On Feb. 13, 2025, the Jets said they had informed Rodgers that new coach Aaron Glenn and new general manager Darren Mougey would be moving in another direction at quarterback. He was released a month later, officially ending Rodgers’ tenure with the franchise.', 'Rodgers ended several months of speculation when he informed the Steelers on June 5, 2025, that he plans to sign with Pittsburgh, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.
