"A ‘war on children’: as US changes Covid vaccine rules, parents of trial volunteers push back",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/02/vaccine-rule-change-child-trial-volunteers,"['Frustration and anger mount as Trump administration contemplates new trials and restrictions for Covid vaccines', 'As the Trump administration contemplates new clinical trials for Covid boosters and moves to restrict Covid vaccines for children and others, parents whose children participated in the clinical trials expressed anger and dismay.', '“It’s really devastating to see this evidence base officially ignored and discarded,” said Sophia Bessias, a parent in North Carolina whose two- and four-year-old kids were part of the Pfizer pediatric vaccine trial.', '“It’s infuriating. My kids contributed literal blood and tears to help demonstrate the safety of these vaccines,” Bessias said.', '“As a parent and also a pediatrician, I think it’s devastating that we might no longer have the option to protect kids against Covid,” said Katherine Matthias, a pediatrician in South Carolina and a cofounder of Protect Their Future, a children’s health organization.', 'Robert F Kennedy Jr, head of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has called for new trials using saline placebos for each of the routine childhood vaccines recommended by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), even though these vaccines have already been tested against placebos or against vaccines that were themselves tested against placebos.', 'Marty Makary, the head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s vaccines chief, outlined a plan in a recent editorial to restrict Covid boosters for anyone under the age of 65 without certain health conditions.', 'For everyone else between the ages of six months and 64 years old, each updated Covid vaccine would need to undergo another randomized controlled clinical trial, Makary and Prasad said.', 'It’s not clear when, how or whether this plan will be implemented officially.', 'On Tuesday, top US health officials said on the social media site X that they would remove the recommendation for Covid vaccination from the childhood immunization schedule, and would also cease recommending it for pregnant people, who have much higher risks of illness, death and pregnancy complications with Covid.', 'On Friday, the CDC appeared to contradict that announcement by keeping Covid vaccines as a routine immunization for children – though the agency now says health providers “may” recommend the vaccine, instead of saying they “should” recommend it.', 'Changing recommendations could affect doctors’ and parents’ understanding of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.', 'Vaccines recommended by the CDC are also covered by the federal Vaccines for Children program, and health insurers are required to cover the costs of routine vaccines. It’s not clear if the wording change from “should” to “may” will affect that coverage.', 'If insurance no longer covers the vaccines, pediatricians are less likely to keep many of the shots in stock, Matthias said, and pharmacies are limited by different state laws on which ages they may vaccinate – which means families who want the vaccines may not be able to find them.', 'Matthias drove her children, then aged 15 months and 14 years old, two hours each way to a Moderna pediatric trial. They did six or seven visits, plus two visits to receive the actual vaccines after they learned they had received placebos.', 'Child participants spent hours on each visit and endured blood draws, Covid swabs, regular symptom and temperature monitoring, and, of course, several shots. Each shot was followed by a week of daily journaling and side-effect reporting.', 'Participants who got Covid, even months later, had blood draws to check their antibody responses.', '“It was a pretty big commitment of our time and energy. But I did it because I wanted to be sure that my kids and all kids had access to vaccines,” Matthias said.', 'Laura Labarre, a parent in Oregon, said the trials involved “committing to something that felt important but larger than ourselves, because it ended up being a lot of work and a lot of logistics and a lot of effort”.', 'She drove her two kids, then aged one and three, an hour and a half each way to a Pfizer trial, and searched for ways to keep them occupied for hours on end.', 'When most people hear about new developments in pediatric medicine, such as new vaccines, they don’t often consider the hard work of volunteers, some only a few months old, who made the trials possible, Labarre said.', '“I don’t think people consider the toll on the families who are the ones who bravely and nervously put their children up to be the first to try it out,” she said.', 'When Nick Giglia got the call asking if he still wanted to enroll his one-year-old daughter in the Pfizer pediatric vaccine trial, he immediately said yes.', 'For eight visits, extending over nearly a year, he would drive an hour each way to a trial in New Jersey. In all, his daughter received seven shots – three saline placebos, three vaccines and a booster.', 'Sign up to This Week in Trumpland', 'A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration', '', '“It was very rigorous,” Giglia said of the study design.', 'Now, he said, “it’s really difficult to hear people harping on the thoughts of there not being the placebo group. Well, it’s news to me. My kid was in the placebo group,” he said.', 'Parents who were eager to enroll in the original trials now wonder whether families would want to endure another round of placebo-controlled trials for updated vaccines.', '“Finding the number of participants that they would need would be extremely difficult,” Matthias said.', '“To think that they would subject anyone, let alone children, to potentially getting the placebo in a trial where we know that the control is already so beneficial for health, just seems highly unethical and really disturbing,” Labarre said.', '“A new trial today would not add anything we don’t already know,” Bessias said. “It would feel like actually participating in a project of undermining the existing evidence, rather than contributing new evidence.”', 'And the whole point of updating the vaccines is to counter new strains, Matthias said. Those vaccines would be out of date by the conclusion of a new study, which could take years.', '“People should have the option” to get Covid vaccines, Matthias said. “The people who don’t want it don’t have to get it.”', 'When Matthias enrolled her kids in 2021, she felt as though they were in a limbo, and “we were all just desperate to get our kids protected”, she said. “To kind of have that feeling coming back now – we worked so hard and we advocated so much to get our kids access and now it might just be taken away – is really upsetting.”', 'While Covid mortality rates are highest among people over the age of 65, Covid is still the eighth leading cause of all deaths among children.', 'Any child dying a preventable death is a tragedy, Bessias said.', '“We have to take a step back and realize that absolute numbers matter, too. And we can really avoid a lot of hospitalizations and deaths and transmission and horrible experiences for families by reaching those younger children. It’s baffling because that seems to be completely left out of these discussions.”', 'Labarre feels “profoundly enraged and betrayed” by the Trump administration’s actions. Limiting access to the vaccine, especially while proposing cuts to Snap and Medicaid, feels like “an additional audacious battlefront they’ve opened up in this sort of war on children”, she said.', '“It is destabilizing, frustrating and enraging to feel like my daughter, who wasn’t even 18 months old, has done more for public health than some people who are now currently in charge of it,” Giglia said.', '“It is very frustrating to hear that sacrifice that we volunteered to make for the country, and frankly, the world, belittled.”', 'At the end of the trial, Giglia’s daughter was given a stuffed teddy bear in a sweater that said “Covid-19 vaccine study hero”.', '“I don’t care what anybody says. That’s what she is,” Giglia said. “I look forward to one day being able to tell my little girl all about how she helped save the world.

Will Kids Still Be Able to Get COVID Shots?,https://www.thecut.com/article/cdc-recommendations-children-2025-covid-vaccine.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'Despite his previous promise not to “take away anybody’s vaccines,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems determined to use his role as Health and Human Services secretary to create as much confusion about COVID vaccines as possible. In a video posted to X last week, Kennedy said he “couldn’t be more pleased” to announce that “the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.” HHS officials cited no evidence to support their decision, instead calling it “common sense.”', 'Today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from @CDCgov recommended immunization schedule. Bottom line: it’s common sense and it’s good science. We are now one step closer to realizing @POTUS’s promise to Make America Healthy Again. pic.twitter.com/Ytch2afCLP', 'The news was met with immediate pushback from doctors and public-health experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who warned the decision — which bypassed the standard process for vaccine recommendations — would put young children and pregnant women at risk. Then, a few days later, the CDC appeared to contradict Kennedy’s announcement when it released an updated childhood-immunization schedule that did include the COVID vaccine, noting that children can get the shot if their parents and doctor agree. Adding to the confusion, the FDA recently announced that it will require additional studies before approving COVID boosters for healthy people under 65 — a move experts say could restrict access for people who want the shot.', 'So, will kids and pregnant women still be able to get COVID shots? Here’s what we know.', 'Until now, the CDC has recommended annual COVID vaccines for everyone 6 months and older. While RFK Jr. initially claimed that the shot would be removed from the CDC’s recommended-immunization schedule for healthy children, it still appears on the updated schedule that was released last week. However, it now includes the caveat that if parents want to vaccinate their healthy children, they can do so in consultation with a health-care provider, which the CDC refers to as “shared decision-making.” The CDC still recommends the COVID vaccine for children who are immunocompromised.', 'According to Mona Amin, a pediatrician who hosts the PedsDocTalk Podcast, this essentially means that the official guidance is now for doctors to recommend COVID vaccines for kids on a case-by-case basis, “depending on what the family wants and what the clinician feels like kids need.” In her view, it’s actually not a huge change. “To be frank, this is what many clinicians have been doing already,” she says, noting that uptake of the COVID shot for kids was already low due to a number of factors, including the fact that many children have already had COVID at least once. According to the CDC, only 13 percent of children have received the most recent COVID shot.', 'Overall, kids tend to have mild symptoms from COVID, and Amin notes that “children are faring better with this current strain of the virus than they did with past strains.” But that’s not to say there’s no risk: According to the AAP, more than 11,000 children were hospitalized with COVID during the most recent respiratory virus season. Data from the CDC show that kids under 4 are most likely to be hospitalized, and those younger than 6 months are especially vulnerable. Because vaccination rates have been low, Amin says it’s difficult to pin down data on the efficacy of the shot. However, it’s clear that it provides some protection against hospitalization, especially for children at higher risk for complications. The CDC found that less than 5 percent of children hospitalized with COVID during the 2023–24 respiratory-virus season had received the most recent COVID shot.', 'It’s also misleading to say that the virus only poses a risk to children who have other risk factors. “We still do sometimes see young healthy kids get very sick from COVID,” says Sean O’Leary, a pediatric-vaccine expert for the American Academy of Pediatrics. According to the CDC, 41 percent of kids hospitalized with COVID between the fall of 2022 and spring of 2024 did not have a known underlying condition — and that number was even higher for children under 2. Since 2020, more than 1,800 American children have died from COVID, and 1 million kids have had long COVID, according to CDC data.', '“My personal opinion is that the COVID vaccine should be an optional vaccine for families, as opposed to shots for measles or pertussis that have more data,” says Amin. At the same time, she says, “I don’t think it’s fair to say that nobody needs it. A lot of children have underlying medical conditions. I’m having conversations with my asthmatic patients, or my preemie babies with lung issues like, Hey, I think you should get this because you’re more likely to develop pneumonia.”', 'Children who are immunocompromised or have other underlying conditions like obesity, diabetes, or asthma are also at increased risk of getting seriously ill from COVID. “Vaccination is still very important for these children,” says O’Leary.', 'While experts generally agree that healthy children over 5 are at low risk for COVID, the same cannot be said for pregnant women. In fact, as recently as two weeks ago the FDA included “pregnancy and recent pregnancy” on a list of risk factors for COVID. Now, the updated CDC vaccine schedule says “No Guidance/Not Applicable” for that group. Federal health officials did not explain their reasoning for changing the recommendation for pregnant women in their announcement video, which was less than a minute long.', 'Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement that the group was “extremely disappointed” with the announcement, noting that “it is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.” According to CDC guidance (which has remained online despite the clear contradictions with RFK Jr.’s announcement), pregnant women are more likely to get very sick from COVID and require hospitalization and are also “at increased risk of complications that can affect your pregnancy and baby, including preterm birth or stillbirth.”', 'O’Leary said he is “very concerned” about removing the recommendation for pregnant women, noting that a COVID vaccine administered to someone who’s pregnant also provides some immunity to the fetus. “Kids under 6 months are at particularly high risk of hospitalization, and that’s really the only way to protect those kids.”', 'While RFK Jr.’s initial announcement raised questions about whether insurance companies would continue to cover the shot for children, it appears that those shots will still be covered under the CDC’s “shared decision-making” guidance. However, the answer is less clear for pregnant women. Out of pocket, a COVID shot costs around $200.', 'And even if the shots are still covered, it will almost certainly become harder for families to get them. “It was already hard to get a COVID shot for kids,” says Amin. Storing the vaccines is expensive, and even many larger medical practices carry COVID shots at only certain locations due to low uptake. Amin says she worries about families who have to drive around or miss work to get the vaccine for their kids. “We need to have accessibility.”', 'Announcing the change in guidance, FDA commissioner Marty Makary said: “There’s no evidence healthy kids need it today, and most countries have stopped recommending it for children.” While the World Health Organization recommends a single COVID shot for children with underlying conditions, it’s true that they don’t recommend repeat boosters for healthy kids, and many European countries take a similar approach. Yet according to O’Leary, the reason other countries don’t recommend it mostly comes down to cost-effectiveness — not because COVID poses no risk to children. “I think everyone recognizes kids have some risks from COVID.” Experts also argue that it’s not a fair comparison given that nearly all European countries have universal health care. In the U.S., the CDC’s vaccine recommendations determine which shots will be covered by insurance. Given our patchwork health-care system, it’s also harder for many Americans to see a doctor if they get sick.', 'No. Health and Human Services officials did not cite any specific research to justify the change, instead referring to their decision as “common sense.” While Kennedy has previously called the COVID shot the “deadliest vaccine ever made,” there’s no evidence to suggest that’s the case. “These are the most studied vaccines in history,” says O’Leary, and they have been given to millions of people. “They are very safe.” While there is debate over the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating lower-risk groups, “I don’t think there’s a circumstance where the risk of the vaccine outweighs the benefit,” says O’Leary.', 'Announcing the change, Kennedy proclaimed: “We’re now one step closer to recognizing President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again.” But the new recommendations will make it harder for many people who want to vaccinate their kids for COVID to do so. Despite the administration’s eagerness to put the pandemic behind us, during last winter’s peak, about 1,000 people died from COVID each week, according to the New York Times. “Anything moving in the wrong direction to protect people from getting sick is a problem,” says O’Leary. “We’re going to see more disease, and more hospitalizations.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTJaRW93Y0ZvM2RsaFBTVXRsVFJDNkF4aTJCU2dLTWdhTmdwQW9OUWM=-w280-h168-p-df
"Duckworth, Warren, Blunt Rochester Condemn RFK for Making it Harder for Pregnant Women and Children to Receive COVID-19 Vaccines, Putting Their Health",https://www.riverbender.com/news/details/duckworth-warren-blunt-rochester-condemn-rfk-for-making-it-harder-for-pregnant-women-and-children-to-receive-covid19-vaccines-putting-their-health-83161.cfm,"['U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), joined by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), today condemned U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for announcing changes to the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) recommended vaccine schedule that would dramatically limit access to COVID-19 vaccines for millions of pregnant women and children, needlessly endangering their health. In their letter, the Senators slam the decision as anti-science and politically motivated, criticizing Secretary Kennedy for failing to provide scientific justification for the policy change and for confirming their longstanding concerns that he would enact unscientific, anti-vax policies as HHS Secretary—despite all his clamoring before Senate committees that he would not restrict vaccine access.', '“Your politically driven, anti-science decision—made suddenly and behind closed doors, without input from the public or scientific and medical communities—flies in the face of your commitment to ‘not…take away anybody’s vaccines’ and will lead to an untold number of preventable illness and death of Americans,” wrote the Senators.', '', ""Don't miss our top stories and need-to-know news everyday in your inbox."", '', '“Enabled by President Trump and fueled by decades of anti-vaccine skepticism, you appear to be establishing a roadmap by which the United States’ government can implement unscientific, anti-vaccination policies,” the lawmakers continued. “By sowing distrust, creating chaos and justifying your actions with misinformation, you are laying the groundwork to undermine access to other safe, effective vaccines, including for those that prevent diseases like whooping cough, measles and more.”', 'The full text of the letter is available on Senator Duckworth’s website and below:', 'Dear Secretary Kennedy:', 'We write to express our extreme concern regarding the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS’) recent policy changes to dramatically curtail access to the COVID-19 vaccine for those Americans who would choose to receive it. We are particularly alarmed by your May 27, 2025 announcement on X—along with Drs. Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), respectively—that the COVID-19 vaccine will no longer be included under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) recommended routine immunization schedule for healthy pregnant women.', 'We are also concerned that the CDC changed its recommendation for administering the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children and adolescents from routine to using “shared clinical decision-making” between clinicians and families. As of the writing of this letter, the CDC has updated the immunization schedule for adults, removing the previous recommendation for pregnant women. The unjustified announcement “blindsided” senior officials at the CDC and were designed to “further erode public trust in the [agency].” By side-stepping the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP’s) open and transparent deliberation of the evidence, you have thrown into question coverage of vaccines under Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance for millions of Americans. Your politically driven, anti-science decision—made suddenly and behind closed doors, without input from the public or scientific and medical communities—flies in the face of your commitment to “not…take away anybody’s vaccines” and will lead to an untold number of preventable illness and death of Americans. We therefore strongly urge you to reverse this position until there is a thorough, transparent consideration of the body of evidence regarding the COVID-19 vaccine’s public health benefit.', 'Political Motivations Threaten COVID-19 Vaccine Access for Millions of Americans', ""The ACIP’s vaccine recommendations, as adopted by the CDC, form the basis of no-cost access to the vaccines for millions of Americans. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, requires that most commercial health insurance plans and Medicaid Alternative Benefit Plans cover ACIP-recommended vaccines for a given individual with no cost sharing. In addition, for the Vaccines for Children Program, authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, ACIP determines which vaccines are provided at no cost to children who are uninsured, underinsured, Medicaid-eligible, Medicaid-enrolled or American Indian or Alaska Native. States must also cover ACIP-recommended vaccines and their administration for children enrolled in separate State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs without enrollee cost-sharing."", 'More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded no-cost coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and vaccine administration without cost-sharing to adults under Medicare Part D, Medicaid and CHIP. The uncertainty and confusion caused by your politically driven actions may lead to many insurers deciding to drop coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine for millions of people. Without insurance coverage, individuals who wish to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will be forced to pay up to $200 or more out-of-pocket—an insurmountable cost for many families, especially amid cost-of-living crisis exacerbated by the current administration’s policies.', 'Politically Driven, Anti-Vaccination Decision-Making Circumvents Scientific Input', 'You appeared to make this policy change without consulting the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and prior to the next scheduled public meeting of the ACIP, the members of which are leading vaccine experts tasked with developing vaccine recommendations. You did so even though the ACIP had independently been considering updating COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to take into account the risk levels of different populations and was expected to vote on those recommendations when it was next scheduled to meet on June 25-27, 2025.', '', '', '', 'Your announcement is a striking departure from the transparent and evidence-informed manner by which vaccine approvals and recommendations are formulated by HHS. For decades, scientists have weighed in on vaccine recommendations through a strenuous process. Following a decision from FDA experts about whether to approve a new vaccine based on clinical trial evidence and other data, ACIP “weighs extensive evidence about safety, effectiveness and other data to determine the best recommendation for who should receive the vaccine, when and how often.” The CDC director may choose to adopt, reject or modify these recommendations, though rejection or modification of such recommendations is rare. In the past quarter century, the CDC director has acted only twice to expand access beyond the ACIP’s recommendation, both times in response to extraordinary circumstances—in 2002 for the smallpox vaccine in connection with a vaccination campaign to address potential bioterrorism attacks, and in 2021 for the COVID-19 vaccine for front-line workers during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in an unprecedented and deeply troubling abuse of your authority, you did not wait to hear ACIP’s expertise, and you exploited a key vacancy at CDC to set these recommendations yourself. According to the Washington Post, this is “the first time an HHS secretary has unilaterally altered an existing recommendation from the advisory committee and the CDC.”', 'Your decision represents a significant public health threat that will endanger millions of Americans. Pregnant women are at higher risk of serious illness and hospitalization if infected with COVID-19, and the virus raises the risk of having a cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia and blood clots. COVID-19 infection during pregnancy has also been shown to result in higher risk of lower birthweight babies, preterm birth and stillbirth. Babies born to women who were not vaccinated against COVID-19 are at higher risk of needing intensive care. That is why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) strongly recommend women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to get pregnant get the COVID-19 vaccine. According to ACOG and SMFM, the COVID-19 vaccine has been demonstrated repeatedly to be safe and protective for such individuals. Because this vaccine is so protective and safe for this population, ACOG further recommends eliminating barriers to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. This is likely why the CDC stated in its “Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States,” updated on May 12, 2025:', '“COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older in the United States…Vaccination is especially important for people at highest risk of severe COVID-19, including people ages 65 years and older; people with underlying medical conditions, including immune compromise; people living in long-term care facilities; and pregnant women to protect themselves and their infants.” (emphasis added)', 'After birth, infants under 6 months of age are at the same high level of risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 as adults ages 65 to 74, and the only means of protecting these infants from COVID-19 is through maternal vaccination. An analysis of HHS data by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that 11,199 children were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 during the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season, 7,746 of whom were younger than 5 years old. And 41 percent of children ages 6 months to 17 years old hospitalized with COVID-19 from October 2022 to April 2024 did not have a known underlying condition, meaning that “healthy” children are also at risk of severe disease.', 'Establishing an Anti-Vaccination Policy Roadmap', 'Enabled by President Trump and fueled by decades of anti-vaccine skepticism, you appear to be establishing a roadmap by which the United States’ government can implement unscientific, anti-vaccination policies. By sowing distrust, creating chaos and justifying your actions with misinformation, you are laying the groundwork to undermine access to other safe, effective vaccines, including for those that prevent diseases, such as pertussis (whooping cough), measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), chickenpox, shingles, hepatitis A, as well as cancer caused by hepatitis B and human papilloma virus.', 'The May 27, 2025 video announcement is just one action in a series of anti-vaccination, anti-science efforts you have led since becoming HHS Secretary. For example, while the ACIP made recommendations for meningococcal and RSV vaccines months ago, you have failed to adopt the recommendations. Further, even though the United States is experiencing the worst outbreak of measles in 25 years, you have downplayed the harm of one of the world’s most contagious diseases and made false claims that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has not been “safety tested.” This undermining of trust in vaccines has led to multiple preventable hospitalizations and deaths. Indeed, President Trump’s nominee to serve as your deputy at HHS expressed unqualified support for your recommendation “encourag[ing] parents to take the measles vaccine,” while saying nothing about vaccinating children against the disease. And the Trump administration clawed back over $11 billion in pandemic-era funding, which has hampered the ability of public health departments across the country to contain the measles outbreak.', 'Moreover, on May 20, 2025, Dr. Vinay Prasad, Director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and Commissioner Makary published an opinion piece in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), outlining a new FDA approval framework that creates significant barriers for approval of annual COVID-19 vaccines for millions of Americans. This announcement indicated that the annual COVID-19 vaccine will generally be approved without a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT) only for people ages 65 and older and for those who have medical conditions that leave them at higher risk for severe COVID-19. The framework says nothing about the eligibly of healthy people at higher risk of being infected with COVID-19, such as healthcare professionals. This means that, unlike in most other countries, the annual vaccine will not be available to healthy individuals older than 6 months of age and under the age of 65 without an RCT. This change in the approval process will take away Americans’ freedom to choose to get the annual vaccine and put them and their loved ones at risk.', 'Further, placebo-controlled trials for vaccines when a proven intervention exists are widely considered by the medical and research community to be unethical. Ethical guidance advises, “Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of [the option to conduct placebo-controlled trials when a proven intervention exists]”; the FDA and HHS have guidance accordingly restricting placebo-controlled trials to certain situations. There is no question that the existing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are such “proven interventions,” and withholding their use in new placebo-controlled trials would constitute a grave ethical violation.', 'Your new approval process for the annual COVID-19 vaccine will significantly delay access to updated FDA-approved vaccines, jeopardizing the health and lives of the American people. Typically, vaccines, such as the annually updated flu shot, are approved after exhibiting immunogenicity data or other laboratory testing data comparable to previous vaccine versions, which themselves have provided robust safety and efficacy data. A multi-year study and lengthy approval process, which is generally considered by experts to be unnecessary, particularly for annually updated vaccines. The significant hurdles associated with FDA’s new RCT requirement could discourage vaccine manufacturers and researchers from developing new, innovative products that could prevent cancer, HIV and other diseases and ultimately save lives. Dr. Peter Hotez from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston stated requiring RCTs for future vaccine development “would basically be a recipe for paralysis.”', 'Indeed, the day after your announcement, Moderna withdrew an application for its new combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine, despite the new vaccine outperforming existing COVID-19 and flu vaccines. It also comes on the heels of the FDA delaying its approval of Novavax’s protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, missing its own April 1, 2025 deadline. When the FDA finally approved the vaccine, it did so for only a narrow population (adults 65 and older and those between ages 21-64 with an underlying medical condition). In a highly unusual step, FDA is also requiring that Novavax conduct a placebo-controlled RCT for less vulnerable populations.', 'Given the suddenness of your May 27, 2025 announcement and its lack of detail or scientific justification, we respectfully request you provide written responses to the following questions no later than June 18, 2025:', '', 'Your anti-vaccine, anti-science stance has taken priority over the public health and well-being of the American people.

Kennedy Jr., announced it was rolling back COVID vaccine recommendations for healthy pregnant women and children.', 'Kennedy has been a skeptic of vaccine safety for a number of years.', 'UW Medicine pointed to a new study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which followed 240 pregnant women in Washington between March and June 2020.', 'The study found that pregnant women with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times higher rate of hospitalization related to complications than similarly aged women with COVID-19 that were not pregnant.', 'A pregnant woman with COVID-19 was 13 times more likely to die from complications of the disease.', 'Three women in the study died from COVID complications, and were from minority ethnic groups and had other health conditions like obesity and hypertension.', '“The mortality rate was shockingly high,” Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf said. “We were very surprised by this.”', 'An interesting part of that Washington study is that those three deaths represented 6.7% of all maternal deaths connected to COVID-19 complications in the entire United States through mid-October, raising concerns about mass underreporting of true fatality rates.', '“We are gravely concerned that COVID-19-associated maternal deaths have been massively undercounted nationally and that the impact on pregnant patients, particularly with underlying conditions is greater than currently underappreciated,” Adams Waldof added. ', 'The date was compiled by a Washington state collaborative that  included 35 large hospitals and clinic systems. They perform 61% of the 86,000 annual childbirth deliveries. ', 'Dr. Linda Eckert, with Obstetrics and Gynecology at UW Medicine, was concerned about COVID booster rates declining in pregnant women, due to the potential for adverse impacts on a baby in its first six months of life.', 'Women who get the vaccine while pregnant pass those antibodies on to their babies, and infants from 0 to six months cannot get a COVID vaccine.', '""It\'s really important to talk about pregnant women develop more serious illness when they contract COVID than non-pregnant women who are a similar age, similar health. They develop more hospitalizations. They have to be in the ICU more often. They need the use of a ventilator more often, they even die more often, and it\'s three times the risk of hospitalization compared to a non-pregnant individual,"" said Eckert.', 'The American Academy of Pediatrics Family Practice is also still recommending the vaccine to healthy pregnant women and children.', '""Currently there isn\'t a COVID vaccine recommended for infant zero to six months of age. And so really the only way infant zero to six months of age can get protection is through a maternal source. And infants zero to six months of age actually are pretty high risk. When they develop COVID, they have the same hospitalization rate as adults over 65, and we\'re recommended to give adults over 65 those vaccines. So I think it\'s ironic that here we have this really vulnerable group of humans that we know about with increased hospitalization, increased challenges when they contract COVID. We have great data that getting the vaccine in pregnancy helps prevent those zero to six months old people from getting COVID. And somehow that has been lost in this recommendation. So I worry a lot about the protection of infants,"" Eckert added.', 'Pregnant women are urged to have a conversation with their gynecologists on whether they should get the COVID booster.', 'COPYRIGHT 2025 BY KXLY.

We're joined now by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary. Good morning. "", 'FDA COMMISSIONER DR. MARTY MAKARY: Good morning. ', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person. ', 'DR. MAKARY: Good to be here. ', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to get through a lot here, but one of the things we've noticed is this new COVID variant that seems to be circulating in Asia. I believe it's NB.1.8.1. It's a variant under monitoring. What do we need to know? "", ""DR. MAKARY: Yeah so this appears to be a subvariant of JN.1, which has been the dominant strain so it's believed that there is cross-immunity protection. The COVID- COVID virus is going to continue to mutate, and it's behaving like a common cold virus. It's now going to become the fifth coronavirus that's seasonal, that causes about 25% of the cases of the common cold."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're thinking of it as like a flu-type variant, just a normal fluctuation. "", 'DR. MAKARY: The flu mutates about 34 times more frequently than COVID. The COVID variant mutation rate appears to be a little more stable, but the international bodies that have provided some guidance on which strain to target, have suggested that either JN.1 or any of these subvariants would be reasonable strains to target.', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don\'t seem overly concerned about that. I want to get now into some of the recommendations that have been very specific this week from the CDC and you with the HHS Secretary in this video announcement on Tuesday where Secretary Kennedy said the CDC was removing the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women from its recommended immunization schedule. He then had a memo to the CDC rescinding recommendations for kids\' vaccines, saying the known risks do not outweigh the benefits. Then late Thursday, the CDC said quote ""shared clinical decision-making,"" which I think is just talking to your doctor should determine whether kids get vaccinated. Can you clearly state what the policy is? Because this is confusing. ', ""DR. MAKARY: Yeah, we believe the recommendation should be with a patient and their doctor. So we're going to get away from these blanket recommendations in healthy, young Americans because we don't want to see-- "", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: For all vaccines? ', ""DR. MAKARY: We don't- well on the COVID vaccine schedule, we don't want to see kids kicked out of school because a 12-year-old girl is not getting her fifth COVID booster shot. We don't see the data there to support a young, healthy child getting a repeat, infinite, annual COVID vaccine. There's a theory that we should sort of blindly approve the new COVID boosters in young, healthy kids every year in perpetuity, and a young girl born today should get 80 COVID mRNA shots, or other COVID shots in her average lifespan. We're saying that's a theory, and we'd like to check in and get some randomized, controlled data. It's been about four years since the original randomized trials, so we'd like an evidence based approach. Dr. Prasad and I published this in the New England Journal of Medicine last week, and we're basically saying we'd like to bring some confidence back to the public around this repeat booster strategy theory, because-- "", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: Your statement was not about repeat boosters. It says the vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, the vaccine is not recommended for healthy children. That's different than annual boosters."", ""DR. MAKARY: Yeah at this point we're dealing, you know, it is a booster strategy- people would be getting the updated shot. So whether or not a young, healthy--"", '(CROSSTALK)', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about kids who haven't gotten a shot?"", ""DR. MAKARY: So we'd like to see the data. We'd love to see that- that data. It doesn't exist."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, but on a practical level, for a parent at home, hearing you, trying to make sense here. ', ""DR. MAKARY: Yeah. We're saying, take it back to your doctor. "", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Their child has not been vaccinated. Are you recommending that their first encounter with COVID be an actual infection?', '(END CROSSTALK)', ""DR. MAKARY: We're not going to push the COVID shot in young, healthy kids without any clinical trial data supporting it. That is a decision between a parent and their doctor. And just so, I don't know if you know the statistics, but 80 for 88% of American kids, their parents, have said no to the COVID shot last season. So America, the vast majority Americans, are saying no. Maybe they want to see some clinical data as well. Maybe they have concerns about the safety--"", '(CROSSTALK)', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: I don't want to crowdsource my health guidance. I want a clear thing-- "", 'DR. MAKARY: The worst thing you--', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: --I wouldn't go with popularity--"", 'DR. MAKARY: The worst thing--', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: --I'm going with, as you're saying, data-- "", ""DR. MAKARY: --Yeah so let's see the data."", '(END CROSSTALK)', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So the CDC data said 41% of children aged six months to 17 years hospitalized with COVID between 2022 and 2024 did not have a known underlying condition. In other words, they looked healthy--', 'DR. MAKARY: So--', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: --and COVID was serious for them.', 'DR. MAKARY: So first of all, we know the CDC data is contaminated with a lot of false positives from incidental positive COVID tests with routine testing of every kid that walks in the hospital--', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't trust the CDC data?"", ""DR. MAKARY: --When I go to the ICU, when I walk to the P- the we know, We know that data, historically under the Biden administration, did not distinguish being sick from COVID or an incidental positive COVID test. When you go to an ICU in America and you ask, how many people are in the ICU that are healthy, that are sick with COVID, the answer I get again and again is, we haven't seen that in a year or years. And so the worst thing you can do in public health is to put out an absolute universal recommendation in young, healthy kids. And the vast majority of Americans are saying, no, we want to see some data. And you say, Forget about the data. Just get it anyway."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so on data and transparency for decades, since 1964 it was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP that went through this panel recommendation. People watched these things during COVID. The report was then handed up. It offered debate, it offered transparency, and it offered data points that people could refer back to. Why did you bypass all of this and just come down with a decision before the panel could meet and meet that data? ', 'DR. MAKARY: That panel has been a kangaroo court where they just rubber stamp every single vaccine put in front of them. If you look at the minutes of the report from, they even say we were- generally want to move towards a risk stratified approach. ', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So why not let them do that in June? ', 'DR. MAKARY: So in the meantime, we don\'t want an absolute recommendation for healthy kids to get it. They can do it, and that committee-committee will meet and make recommendations. But you look at the minutes of the last couple of years, they say we want a simple message for everybody, just so they can understand it. It was not a data based conversation. It was a conversation based on marketing and ease and and I\'ve written an article titled ""Why the people don\'t trust the CDC,"" and it\'s in part from that blanket strategy–', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: You're telling them not to right now. You just said don't trust the CDC. "", ""DR. MAKARY:  We're saying it's going to be between a doctor and a patient until that committee meets or more experts weigh in, or we get some clinical data. If there's zero clinical data, you're opining. I mean, you're just, it's a theory, and so we don't want to put out an absolute recommendation for kids with no clinical data at this point."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So you made this pronouncement as well on pregnant women. There is data. Researchers in the UK analyzed a series of 67 studies, which included 1.8 million women, and the journal BMJ Global Health published it. People can Google it at home, and it says the COVID vaccine in pregnant women is highly effective in reducing the odds of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission and improves pregnancy outcomes with no serious safety concerns. This is data that shows that it is recommended or could be advised, for pregnant women to take this vaccine. Why do you find otherwise?', ""DR. MAKARY: There's no randomized control trial. That's the gold standard. Those 67 studies are mixed. The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a comorbid condition. So it's a very mixed bag. So we're saying your obstetrician, your primary care doctor, and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it. 12% of pregnant women last year got the COVID shot. So people have serious concerns, and it's probably because they want to see a randomized trial data, the randomized trial of pregnant women– "", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, the world moves on, and you published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 20. In that report, you referenced, you listed pregnancy as an underlying medical condition that increases a person's risk for severe COVID. You said that. So then seven days later, you joined in this video announcement saying you should drop the recommendation for the COVID vaccine in healthy pregnant women. So what changed in the seven days? "", ""DR. MAKARY: In the New England Journal medicine, we simply list what the f- what the CDC has traditionally defined as high risk, and we're just saying, decide with your doctor. We're not saying the other–"", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: But doctors want data and information as well from you–', ""DR. MAKARY: and the randomized trial– so here's the data on pregnant women. A randomized control trial was set up, and it was closed without any explanation. We wanted to see that trial complete so women can have information that in a randomized control trial, which is the gold standard, this is what the data shows. We don't have those data. "", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. It is still unclear what pregnant women now should do until they get the data that you say-- ', ""DR. MAKARY: I'd say talk to their doctor. "", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: When do they get the data you're promising? All these controlled studies."", 'DR. MAKARY: In the absence of data, they should talk to their doctor-- ', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So no date?', 'DR. MAKARY: --and their doctor will use their best wisdom and judgment.', 'MARGARET BRENNAN: FDA Commissioner, thank you for trying to help clear this up. ', '© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Q&A on New COVID-19 Vaccine Policies,https://www.factcheck.org/2025/06/qa-on-new-covid-19-vaccine-policies/,"['By Jessica McDonald and Catalina Jaramillo', 'Posted on June 5, 2025', 'Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.', 'In the past two weeks, U.S. public health authorities have skirted normal procedures and announced two major policy changes that will likely reduce access to COVID-19 vaccines and restrict use to higher-risk populations. ', 'On May 20, the Food and Drug Administration announced a new regulatory framework that suggests that without new placebo-controlled trials, the agency will only approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in the future for people 65 and older and those with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19.', 'On May 27, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a video posted on X that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was no longer recommending a COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children or healthy pregnant women. Previously, the CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone 6 months of age and older.', 'In both cases, officials skipped the regular process for such decision-making, which typically includes guidance from advisory committees and input from vaccine makers, scientists and regular people during meetings that are livestreamed and open to the public.  ', '“These were announcements, not actual discussions,” Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at University of California Law San Francisco who specializes in vaccine law and policy, told us. “They both can have the effect of making it harder for people who want COVID vaccines to get them.” ', 'Both decisions also leave many outstanding questions that the agencies have not yet clarified. Here, we explain what we know — and don’t — about these new COVID-19 vaccine policies.', 'FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the agency’s division that regulates vaccines, announced the new framework for COVID-19 vaccines in a livestreamed video and commentary published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 20.', 'Citing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations from other high-income countries — none of which has a universal recommendation — along with what they described as uncertainty about whether healthy, younger people benefit from the vaccines, the two officials indicated that future COVID-19 vaccines would only be approved for people 65 years and older and those with at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19.', 'Those approvals, they explained, would be based on immunogenicity data, or evidence that the vaccine generates an antibody response in people. That’s a slightly higher bar than the evidence required for last year’s updated shots, which relied on antibody data in animals in addition to other accumulated evidence. (With earlier updates, companies have sometimes submitted clinical antibody data, but given that the change to the vaccine is so minor, the FDA did not require clinical data, similar to how the agency handles seasonal influenza vaccines.)', 'For everyone else, the officials wrote in their commentary, the “FDA anticipates the need for randomized, controlled trial data evaluating clinical outcomes” before approval. ', 'The regulatory change is similar to the FDA’s recent, more limited approval of Novavax’s protein-based COVID-19 vaccine for people 65 and older or those with at least one underlying health condition. According to reporting by Politico and the Wall Street Journal, political appointees delayed and intervened in the approval.', 'The new framework does not apply to the COVID-19 vaccines currently on the market. It only applies to updates or new formulations of the vaccines. For the 2025-2026 season, the FDA is advising that vaccines continue to target the JN.1 lineage, but says that it prefers an update to a specific subvariant. Last year, the FDA authorized and approved updated vaccines in late August.', 'A week later, in a 58-second video also featuring Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Kennedy made another announcement.', '“I couldn’t be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,” Kennedy said.', '“It’s common sense and it’s good science,” Bhattacharya added, even though no evidence was provided.', 'Notably, Kennedy’s announcement is at odds with the new FDA framework, which includes pregnancy as a high-risk condition for which updated vaccines would be approved without new trials.', 'Kennedy’s announcement also does not entirely match with how the CDC ultimately updated its childhood immunization schedule. The schedule is a timetable for when recommended vaccines should be given and dictates which vaccines insurance providers are required to cover without a copay under the Affordable Care Act.', 'Although Kennedy said in the video that the policy was effective on May 27, the CDC did not update the schedule until the evening of May 29. Instead of removing the COVID-19 vaccines for “healthy” children, however, the schedule changed the recommendation for all children without compromised immune systems to one of shared clinical decision-making, meaning such children “may” receive a vaccine after consultation with their health care providers. For children who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, the full recommendation to receive a vaccine remains. ', 'Kennedy never said what he meant by “healthy” children, but previously, Makary and Prasad have suggested that the FDA views them as children without a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Many children have one or more risk factors but are not necessarily immunocompromised.', 'For pregnant adults, the CDC schedule now lists the vaccine as “no guidance/not applicable.”', 'HHS did not respond to a detailed list of our questions trying to clarify various aspects of the different policies.', '“The old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is restoring the doctor-patient relationship. If a parent desires their healthy child to be vaccinated, their decision should be based on informed consent through the clinical judgement of their healthcare provider.”', 'Reiss told us the HHS statement was “pretty disingenuous,” noting that “the decision to vaccinate is always a personal one, and most people do it through their doctor.”', 'Following news coverage that the CDC schedule retains a modified recommendation for children, HHS has since insisted in a post on X that the media are wrong and that the schedule is “very clear” that the vaccine “is not recommended” for pregnant women or healthy children.', 'However, as we said, the recommendation for now is one of shared clinical decision-making for kids who are not immunocompromised.', 'Immediately, there may not be a large change. But soon, some kids (or their parents) and pregnant people may have to pay out of pocket for a vaccine, and some providers may be more hesitant to recommend the shots to patients. And in the fall, if the vaccines are updated under the new framework, that is likely to be the case for even larger swaths of the population.', 'The reason for the intense focus on the language of the policy — and whether the vaccines are truly removed from the CDC’s immunization schedule or not — is because removal from the schedule would mean that insurers are no longer required to cover the vaccines with no cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act. ', 'People without a recommendation could still get them, Reiss said, but they would need to pay out of pocket if their insurer decided to drop coverage of the vaccine. CVS currently charges around $200 for a single dose.', 'Some insurance companies might still cover the shots if it’s cost-effective for them. “But that would be up to the insurance company,” Reiss said.', 'Under the current language used in the amended CDC schedules, Reiss said, insurance companies are no longer required to cover the shots for pregnant adults. Insurers are still required to cover vaccines recommended under shared clinical decision-making, although she said that in practice, that doesn’t always happen.', 'Come fall, the FDA appears poised to approve updated vaccines only for higher-risk groups, since it’s not possible for any new trials with younger, healthier people to have been completed, even if companies decide to start them.', 'Prasad and Makary have emphasized that the list of medical conditions the CDC uses to define high risk — which includes pregnancy, obesity, depression, physical inactivity and being a current or past smoker — is “vast” and estimated to include around 100 million to 200 million Americans.', '“This is a tremendously broad category,” Prasad said in the livestreamed video. “At-risk Americans can be reassured that they will be covered by such approvals.”', 'Experts told us updated vaccines could still be prescribed off-label for younger people who aren’t high risk, but if there isn’t a CDC recommendation, then insurance coverage won’t be required. And if the vaccines are both not licensed and not recommended, Reiss said, “more doctors may hesitate to prescribe” them. The vaccines may also be harder to find, and pharmacies, for example, may not be willing to administer them.', 'Charlotte Moser, co-director of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s Vaccine Education Center and a member of the CDC’s outside Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, told us in an email that it’s “possible that the ACIP would vote to have the vaccines used ‘off-label,’ which would mean using them differently than the way the FDA licensed them.”', 'But the ACIP recommendations would need to be accepted by the director of the CDC, and currently, there doesn’t appear to be an acting director. The recommendations ACIP made in its last meeting in April went directly to Kennedy, and so far, he has only accepted one of three recommendations, Moser said.', 'Even if the vaccines aren’t updated to target a new variant, the CDC recommendations could still shift.', '“I don’t quite know what CDC will do and how this will go,” Reiss said. “It’s a mess.”', 'Typically, the FDA is in charge of licensing vaccines and giving general indications for their use, and the CDC’s job is to make tailored recommendations about who should use them, when and how. And as we’ve mentioned, both the FDA and the CDC have panels of independent, outside experts that inform those decisions. ', 'But in this case, both policy changes were made without the input of the agencies’ advisory committees, even though both ACIP and the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee were scheduled to meet to discuss COVID-19 vaccine recommendations in the near future — on May 22 for VRBPAC and late June for ACIP.', 'Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a retired vaccinologist and pediatrician and former member of the VRBPAC and ACIP, wrote in a STAT opinion piece that the way in which the FDA changed its regulatory framework “is in stark contrast” with the standard process.', '“The usual practice is to provide Draft Guidance Documents, comprehensively outlining specific requirements in the Federal Register, and inviting a period of public comment so experts in a broad range of fields, including immunology, biostatistics, and clinical care, can add their perspectives. Then the FDA finalizes the document and posts it to the FDA website,” she wrote. ', '“The FDA guidance presented in the NEJM was not released in the Federal Register, did not invite comment, and provided only a general outline for Covid-19 vaccine licensure. The report lacked detail, and a clear blueprint was not provided,” she continued.', 'The decision to change the CDC vaccine schedules also circumvented the way in which vaccine recommendations are typically made. As Reiss told us when we reported on Kennedy’s intention to remove the COVID-19 vaccines from the childhood vaccination schedule, the decision should have been made after discussion with ACIP. ', '“This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a statement sent to us by the AAP.', 'By not following the established procedures, the HHS agencies are vulnerable to legal challenges, Reiss told us.', '“This is really bad administrative procedure, even before we talk about circumventing ACIP,” she wrote on social media. Under administrative law, she said, agency decisions have to meet certain criteria. For instance, they must include explanations of the agency’s fact-finding and how the facts support the decisions.', 'On June 3, Reuters and CBS News reported that a pediatric infectious disease expert at the CDC who had helped lead ACIP’s working group resigned from her position. “My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, “and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role.”', 'Physicians’ and other experts’ confusion and frustration have been followed by relief after the CDC did not go through with Kennedy’s stated plan of removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the childhood immunization schedule for healthy children, which would have removed the requirement that the vaccine be covered by insurance.', 'While the guidance “allows families to continue to choose the Covid vaccine, how we got here is troubling,” the AAP said in a post on X.', 'As we’ve reported, and as the AAP noted in a statement, ACIP was already leaning toward shifting from a universal recommendation to a risk-based recommendation for certain populations, recognizing that the vaccine is significantly more beneficial to older people and those with conditions that put them at higher risk.', 'Children are typically at much lower risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19 than older adults, and some doctors do not think healthy kids need to receive annual doses. At the same time, data presented at the last ACIP meeting in April shows COVID-19 does still kill and hospitalize children, including those without any risk factors. There is also evidence that the vaccine protects children and adolescents from long COVID.', 'At the last ACIP meeting, nearly 90% of ACIP work group members who supported a risk-based recommendation also supported allowing anyone who wanted protection from vaccination to receive a vaccine.', 'Experts have pushed back on changing the recommendation for pregnant people and have also been particularly concerned about babies and other young children receiving an initial series of shots, given evidence that very young children are among the most affected by COVID-19.', 'In a LinkedIn post, Moser pointed out that in practice, the shared clinical decision-making recommendation “often does not translate into a focus on individual benefits” and is “particularly troublesome” for high-risk children, “who now have a weaker recommendation than adults with similar conditions,” and for unvaccinated children.', '“Every year in this country, 3 to 4 million children are born and don’t have any immunity to this virus,” she told us in an interview.', 'In the past, experts have argued that shared clinical decision-making recommendations are confusing and hard to implement, and can ultimately create an access barrier for vaccination.', 'Women who get vaccinated during pregnancy can pass on protective antibodies to their babies, as we have reported and as a CDC webpage on the issue still said, as of June 4. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 during the first six months of a baby’s life, and particularly during the newborn period, according to multiple studies. ', '“[G]rowing evidence shows just how much vaccination during pregnancy protects the infant after birth, with the vast majority of hospitalized infants less than six months of age—those who are not yet eligible for vaccination—born to unvaccinated mothers,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement following Kennedy’s announcement.', 'Evidence shows that vaccination also protects the pregnant person from severe COVID-19.', '“Removing pregnant women from the vaccine schedule is neither common sense nor good science,” Dr. Robert T. Schooley, a distinguished professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego and former VRBPAC member, told us, referencing Bhattacharya’s comments in the announcement video. “This is an example of decision-making that is wrong on both process and outcome.”', 'In an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on June 1, Makary misleadingly claimed, as he did previously in an interview with NBC News, that the data on the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy is “mixed.”', '“Those 67 studies are mixed. The data in pregnant women is different for healthy versus women with a – a co-morbid condition. So, it’s a very mixed bag,” he said, when presented with a 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of 67 studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. “So, we’re saying, your obstetrician, your primary care doctor and the pregnant woman should together decide whether or not to get it.”', 'Victoria Male, a senior lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told us that studies have included pregnant people regardless of underlying health conditions, so in that sense they are “mixed.” But the results themselves have not been mixed.', '“It is unequivocal that COVID vaccination during pregnancy does not increase the risk of any problems during the pregnancy or with the baby, and is effective at preventing severe disease, which can cause problems,” she said.', 'It’s also misleading for Makary to have presented the policy change for pregnant people as simply one of discussing the option with a doctor, since by removing the CDC’s recommendation, insurance companies are no longer required to cover the vaccine.', '“ACOG is concerned that as a result of the new CDC recommendations, payers may be less likely to cover the COVID-19 vaccines, leaving patients to pay out of pocket or unable to get vaccinated at all,” an ACOG spokesperson told us in an email.', 'Many experts are skeptical of the framework’s call for new randomized, placebo-controlled trials before approving COVID-19 vaccines for healthy people below the age of 65. ', 'In the NEJM commentary, Makary and Prasad said that the FDA considers the healthy 50- to 64-year-old population an “ideal population for future trials,” but that vaccine companies can also choose to conduct trials for other younger, healthy groups. They noted that very young children — those below the age of 4 — are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 than older children, but the risks “remain lower than those for adults 65 years or older and on par with those for adults 50 to 64 years old.”', 'The two officials indicated that the FDA would want the trials to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of symptomatic infection — 95% confidence that the vaccine’s efficacy is above 30% — with follow-up of at least six months, in a population that includes participants who have had COVID-19 in the past year. The trials should also assess outcomes of severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death, they said.', 'It’s not clear whether vaccine makers will want to conduct those trials, as they are likely to take time and be very expensive. Makary said in a Senate hearing on May 22 that he anticipated the trials would take “roughly a year” to complete. As staffers and advisers with the Vaccine Integrity Project, an initiative with the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, wrote in a viewpoint article, it is unclear how that timeline fits with a vaccine that would need to be rolled out within the same season to target the primary variants in circulation.', 'Experts have also noted that conducting placebo-controlled trials is ethically questionable, given that there is now a vaccine available. Typically, investigators can only ethically conduct a trial when there is genuine uncertainty over whether a vaccine is beneficial. Otherwise, a trial would be denying a protective vaccine from one group. And ultimately, experts question the benefit of doing new trials, when an abundance of safety and effectiveness data already exists.', 'In their video, Prasad and Makary pointed to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, who served under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, endorsing the idea of performing such trials.', '“In the case of COVID-19 I believe it would now be quite reasonable, and even advisable, to conduct placebo-controlled trials for ‘boosters’ using updated versions of the vaccine in people who are not high-risk,” Califf wrote in a May 9 Substack post, echoing a viewpoint he published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.', 'Other experts, however, disagree.', '“I can’t imagine an institutional review board would approve that kind of study,” Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who’s a current member of VRBPAC and a former member of ACIP, told us in an interview, citing consistent CDC data that annual updated shots provide a benefit, regardless of age or risk factors, even in the background of high immunity. “I think it’s a wholly unethical prospect.”', 'In the May 22 VRBPAC meeting, Dr. Eric J. Rubin, an adjunct professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and editor-in-chief of the NEJM, also questioned the proposal, noting that the CDC had just presented a lot of “very reassuring” effectiveness data on the vaccine, which could mean there is not enough uncertainty to ethically conduct such trials.', 'Even though he’s “a believer” when it comes to randomized controlled trials, Rubin said, “observational data has a lot more richness in the case of a very varied population with all kinds of different exposures. So I think this is a case where we learn a lot more out of observational data than we would out of an RCT and I don’t think the RCT is feasible.”', 'In the CBS interview, Makary also insisted that pregnant people could not rely on observational data and need a randomized controlled trial before continuing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. “A randomized controlled trial was set up and it was closed without any explanation,” he said.', 'Male, however, said that for that trial, there was “so much epidemiological data showing that COVID vaccination in pregnancy is safe and effective, that it was unethical to continue recruiting to the unvaccinated group.” She also noted that there is some data on the COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy from the original trials, as 102 people in the Pfizer and Moderna trials became pregnant unintentionally. There was no increased risk of pregnancy problems in those who received the vaccines, she said.', 'Editor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Last week, the FDA announced routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.', 'Among the confusion created by Tuesday’s announcement, experts said, was the implication that the coronavirus isn’t dangerous to pregnant women.', 'During the height of the pandemic, deaths of women during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth soared to their highest level in 50 years. Indeed, pregnancy was on the list of health conditions that would qualify someone for a COVID-19 vaccination under FDA’s new guidance “framework” announced last week.', 'Vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women, in part, because it’s a way to pass immunity to newborns who are too young for vaccines and are vulnerable to infections.', '“To say that they are not at any risk is simply incorrect,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.', 'Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: “The science has not changed.

He did not cite new evidence in doing so. CDC guidance published days later still recommended COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children if their parents and doctors agree, but said the vaccines are no longer recommended during pregnancy.', 'Children can contract COVID-19 like any other person, but are less likely to become seriously ill from the virus than adults, though they can still spread it to more vulnerable individuals. Pregnant women, however, are more likely to become seriously ill, which can lead to preterm birth and other problems. Experts say vaccination during pregnancy can safeguard infants after birth because babies depend on maternal antibodies for early immunity.', ""Federal vaccine recommendations matter not just because the public pays attention to them, but because it can affect which vaccines insurers decide to cover, said Patrick Remington, emeritus professor at UW-Madison's School of Medicine and Public Health."", ""Given the recommendation from the state, Remington said he's hopeful companies that insure people in Wisconsin will continue covering the COVID-19 vaccine despite the change in federal recommendations. Wisconsin's Medicaid program will continue to cover the vaccine, according to the news release."", ""Dr. Amy Domeyer, a Madison obstetrician-gynecologist and past chair of the Wisconsin section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said patients have already asked her whether they'll be able to have the vaccine covered by insurance later on. She said the recent change in federal guidance doesn't impact ACOG's own guidance, or what she recommends to her patients."", '""We know the COVID vaccine is safe in pregnancy — that research and data has not changed. We know pregnant individuals are at higher risk due to COVID,"" Domeyer said. ""I convey to my patients, \'My goal is for you to have the safest, healthiest pregnancy possible. For that reason, I, as your doctor, recommend the COVID vaccine.""', 'Still, she acknowledged the conflicting information may make it more challenging to discuss with patients, adding another layer of difficulty on top of vaccine hesitancy that already exists.

Kennedy, Jr, announced that the CDC will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, a move supported by leaders of the FDA and National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, the CDC’s website still lists COVID-19 vaccination as recommended for these groups, citing studies that show vaccination during pregnancy can protect both mother and infant from severe illness.', 'The announcement coincides with the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, spreading in the US, and follows a recent proposal from FDA officials to require randomized controlled trials for COVID-19 vaccines in healthy individuals under 65 years before broader approvals are granted. Notably, the CDC’s Advisory Committee did not vote on the reported schedule change.', '', ""A new commentary published yesterday by leaders of the American College of Physicians (ACP) warns against the increasing politicization of science and public health, calling for humility, transparency, and inclusivity in future crisis responses. Reflecting on the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors highlight how political influence and misinformation eroded public trust, particularly around vaccination. They criticize recent federal decisions that complicate access to COVID-19 vaccines, as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires insurers to cover all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)–recommended vaccines. The FDA's recent limit on COVID-19 booster vaccines and the CDC's lack of recommendations for young children and pregnant women complicate ACIP's ability to approve off-label vaccine use."", 'Stressing that public health should prioritize both scientific rigor and real-world context, the authors advocate for a risk-based approach that considers social and caregiving factors, not just clinical ones, and affirm the need to safeguard individual autonomy in health care decision-making.', '', 'Kennedy is reportedly planning to ban government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and The Lancet, claiming they are corrupted by pharmaceutical interests. Instead, Kennedy proposes creating new, in-house, government-run journals for federally funded research, arguing NIH funding alone proves scientific legitimacy.', 'Critics, including public health experts, warn this move could undermine scientific credibility, limit peer review, and politicize medical research. The proposal follows significant research funding cuts under the Trump administration, heightening concerns about government overreach in shaping science.', '', 'The 340B Drug Discount Program has grown rapidly, reaching $148 billion in 2024, despite a shrinking vulnerable patient population. Critics, including insurers and employers, argue that hospitals are driving growth through profit-driven strategies, especially with high-cost specialty drugs. Although 340B advocates blame drug price inflation, a comprehensive analysis found that from 2018 to 2024, the overwhelming majority of the program’s growth—over 79% at list price and over 100% at discounted prices—was due to increased utilization, not price hikes. Even among top-selling drugs and those with high price increases, utilization remained the primary driver.', '', 'Oncology biosimilars may help alleviate some of the financial toxicity faced by both patients and health care systems due to cancer care, according to a pair of abstracts presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. A comprehensive analysis of 2022 data reveals that financial toxicity in cancer care varies widely by insurance type, income, race, and geography, with uninsured and low-income patients facing the greatest burden.

Kennedy Jr., flanked by doctors including National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya — handpicked for his vaccine-skeptic approach — decreed that the COVID vaccine would no longer be recommended for children and pregnant women.

For all of Trump’s downplaying of the pandemic and failures of management, one thing he did absolutely right in his first term was directing massive federal resources to the development of a vaccine that could help save humanity from a plague that killed millions. The COVID vaccine was developed in record time, a whole-of-government and private industry partnership that managed to meet the moment of total emergency.', 'Why Trump has decided to distance himself from one of his most tremendous accomplishments is a question only he can really answer, though it certainly runs through the never-ending culture war that he and his political constituency feel they must at all times wage, and which has sucked into itself not just culture itself, but science, medicine, economics and all else.', 'RFK himself might be a true believer, but he is still a loyal member of the administration that can be brought to heel if necessary. Trump, who if nothing else does seem to worry about how he is publicly perceived, should realize that the development and widespread adoption of the COVID vaccine can be a legacy-defining moment, and his health secretary is standing in the way of that.', 'If Trump won’t reel RFK in, then it should be the other branches — namely Congress, which has the power to drag the secretary before it and, if need be, impeach him.', 'MAGA legislators may have turned the process of impeachment into one more political football, filing proceedings against not just former President Joe Biden but members of his cabinet over thinly sourced accusations that boil down to disagreements over broad-strokes policy, as was the case with former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.', 'Still, impeachment was intended as and remains a tool to remove high-level public officials who are engaged in gross negligence in the performance of their duties in ways that threaten public order and the polity as a whole. There’s hardly a more clear-cut assault on the public than throwing up obstacles in the way of life-saving vaccinations, perhaps humanity’s greatest ever medical advancement.', 'Kennedy likes to frame his actions in the language of anti-elitism: The vaccines, in his estimation, are being pushed by an out-of-control Big Pharma establishment and therefore their restriction is inherently an anti-elite move. Tell that to the kids who have been hospitalized and died from measles, following quack Dr. Bobby’s Rx to avoid the shots.', 'From smallpox to polio to measles and, yes, also to COVID, vaccines are safe and have for many decades now driven back illnesses that were once widespread among the population.

HHS Secretary Says Healthy Pregnant Women Do Not Need COVID-19 Boosters,https://www.physiciansweekly.com/rfk-jr-says-healthy-pregnant-women-dont-need-covid-boosters-what-the-science-says/,"['', '', 'JUN 03, 2025', '', 'Photo Credit: iStock.com/bogdankosanovic', 'Despite political interference and mixed messaging, scientific evidence strongly supports COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, as unvaccinated pregnant women face significantly higher risks of severe illness, hospitalization, blood clots, pregnancy complications, and even stillbirth—while vaccination protects both mother and newborn.', 'You’re pregnant, healthy, and hearing mixed messages: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is not a scientist or doctor, says you don’t need the covid vaccine, but experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection still put you in a high-risk group of people who ought to receive boosters. The science is on the side of the shots.', 'Pregnant women who contracted covid-19 were more likely to become severely ill and to be hospitalized than non-pregnant women of the same age and demographics, especially early in the covid pandemic.', 'A meta-analysis of 435 studies found that pregnant and recently pregnant women who were infected with the virus that causes covid were more likely to end up in intensive care units, be on invasive ventilation, and die than women who weren’t pregnant but had a similar health profile. This was before covid vaccines were available.', 'Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and the director of the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said he still sees more bad outcomes in pregnant patients who have covid. The risk of severe covid fluctuated as new variants arose and vaccinations became available, Silverman said, but the threat is still meaningful. “No matter what the politics say, the science is the science, and we know that, objectively, pregnant patients are at substantially increased risk of having complications,” Silverman said.', 'A request for comment regarding the scientific literature that supports covid vaccination for pregnant women sent to HHS’ public affairs office elicited an unsigned email unrelated to the question. The office did not respond when asked for an on-the-record comment.', 'Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before joining the Trump administration, announced May 27 that covid vaccines would be removed from the CDC’s immunization schedule for healthy pregnant women and healthy children. His announcement, made in a video posted on the social media platform X, blindsided CDC officials and circumvented the agency’s established, scientific processes for adding and removing shots from its recommended schedules, The Washington Post reported.', 'There’s still much unknown about how covid affects a pregnant person. The physiological relationship between covid infections and mothers and fetuses at different stages of a pregnancy is complex, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.', 'The increased risk to pregnant patients comes in part because pregnancy changes the immune system, Rasmussen said.', '“There is natural immune suppression so that the mother’s body doesn’t attack the developing fetus,” Rasmussen said. “While the mother does still have a functioning immune system, it’s not functioning at full capacity.”', 'Pregnant patients are more likely to get sick and have a harder time fighting off any infection as a result.', 'In addition to changing how the immune system works, being pregnant also makes women five times as likely to have blood clots. That risk is increased if they contract covid, said Sallie Permar, chair of pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine.', 'The virus that causes covid can affect the vascular endothelium — specialized cells that line blood vessels and help with blood flow, Rasmussen said. In a healthy person, the endothelium helps prevent blood clots by producing chemicals that tweak the vascular system to keep it running. In a person infected with the covid virus, the balance is thrown off and the production of those molecules is disrupted, which research shows can lead to blood clots or other blood disorders.', 'Permar said that those clots can be especially dangerous to both pregnant women and fetuses. Inflammation and blood clots in the placenta could be connected to an increased risk of stillbirth, especially from certain covid variants, according to studies published in major medical journals as well as by the CDC.', 'When the placenta is inflamed, it’s harder for blood carrying oxygen and nutrients to get to the developing baby, said Mary Prahl, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.', '“If anything is interrupting those functions — inflammation or clotting or differences in how the blood is flowing — that’s really going to affect how the placenta is working and being able to allow the fetus to grow and develop appropriately,” she said.', 'It makes sense that we see the effects of covid in the placenta, Silverman said. “The placenta is nothing more than a hyper-specialized collection of blood vessels, so it is like a magnetic target for the virus.”', 'Blood vessels in the placenta are smaller and may clot more easily than in the mother’s circulatory system, he said.', 'Permar said recent data suggests that pregnant women sick with covid still have a higher risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and miscarriage, even with existing immunity from previous infection or vaccination. Covid, she said, can still land women in the hospital with pregnancy complications.', 'Prahl said the connection between stillbirth and covid may be changing given the immunity many people have developed from vaccination or prior infection. It’s an area in which she’d like to see more research.', 'There’s already strong evidence that both mRNA-based and non-mRNA covid vaccines are safe for pregnant women.', 'Prahl co-authored a small, early study that found no adverse outcomes and showed antibody protection persisted for both the mother and the baby after birth. “What we learned very quickly is that pregnant individuals want answers and many of them want to be involved in research,” she said. Later studies, including one published in the journal Nature Medicine showing that getting a booster in pregnancy cut newborn hospitalizations in the first four months of life, backed up her team’s findings.', 'Prahl expects more evidence will be available soon to support the benefits of mothers receiving a covid booster during pregnancy.', '“I can say, kind of behind the scenes, I’m seeing a lot of this preliminary data,” she said.', 'She blames the delay in part on the Biden administration’s scaling back of federal efforts to track covid. “A lot of the surveillance of these data were pulled back,” she said. The Trump administration is further cutting money used to track covid.', 'But because the vaccines give a pregnant woman’s immune system a boost by increasing neutralizing antibodies, virologist Rasmussen is confident that getting one while pregnant makes it less likely a pregnant woman will end up in the hospital if she gets covid.', '“It will protect the pregnant person from more severe disease,” she said.', 'Getting a covid vaccine while pregnant also helps protect newborns after birth. Pregnant women who get vaccinated pass that protection to their young babies, who can’t get their own shots until they are at least 6 months old.', 'According to data released by the CDC in 2024, nearly 90% of babies who had to be hospitalized with covid had mothers who didn’t get the vaccine while they were pregnant.', 'As recently as April 2024, research showed that babies too young to be vaccinated had the highest covid hospitalization rate of any age group except people 75 and older.', 'The Trump administration’s decision to remove the covid vaccine from the list of shots it recommends for pregnant women means insurance companies might no longer cover it. Pregnant women who want to get it anyway may have to pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket.', '“I don’t want to be that doctor who just says, ‘Well, it’s really important. You have to vaccinate yourself and your kids no matter what, even if you have to pay for it out-of-pocket,’ because everyone has their own priorities and budgetary concerns, especially in the current economic climate,” Silverman said. “I can’t tell a family that the vaccine is more important than feeding their kids.”', 'But he and his colleagues will keep advising pregnant women to try to get the shots anyway.', '“Newborns will be completely naive to covid exposure,” he said. “Vaccinating pregnant women to protect their newborns is still a valid reason to continue this effort.”', 'KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Viewpoint: Eroding trust by making COVID vaccine decisions with no transparency,https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/viewpoint-eroding-trust-making-covid-vaccine-decisions-no-transparency,"[""The threat to Americans' access to lifesaving vaccines has arrived. "", 'In the past, vaccine use recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while not always free from criticism, were based on a thorough, public review of relevant evidence as part of the ""evidence to recommendation framework."" The recommendations serve as guidance—to the frontlines of healthcare, to state-based immunization programs, and to the American public. Any resulting ""mandates"" are dictated by the states, not the federal government. Federal vaccine recommendations also provide guidance about insurance coverage for vaccines. ', ""Without that endorsement, insurers may choose to drop a vaccine in their scope of benefits, thereby limiting a patient's choice by eliminating affordable and convenient access."", 'On May 27, flanked by the leaders of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in a 58-second video posted to X that the COVID vaccine had been removed from the CDC\'s recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women. One headline splashed, ""CDC removes COVID vaccine recommendation for healthy children and pregnant women."" In reality, the secretary took this unilateral action without CDC leadership present, without CDC advisory engagement, and without informing the CDC in advance. ', 'None of the evidence that went into Secretary Kennedy\'s recommendations was either presented or available—contrary to HHS\'s slogans of ""radical transparency"" and ""gold standard science,"" and in contrast to the open, public process that has been used to date, which allowed everyone to see how recommendations were developed. ', 'Announcing such a consequential shift in public health policy via social media abandoned the deliberative, evidence-based process to determine vaccine use that healthcare providers, insurers, state health departments, and, most important, the American people expect and deserve: an intentional process specifically designed to build trust. ', ""None of the evidence that went into Secretary Kennedy's recommendations was either presented or available—contrary to HHS's slogans of 'radical transparency' and 'gold standard science.'"", ""Indeed, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet in a month to make recommendations on the very question of who should get a COVID vaccine. They had previously hinted their intent to review the evidence on whether to recommend routine boosters in healthy children at the upcoming meeting, where they would share the data and, with opportunity for input from the public, have experts publicly deliberate the important questions at hand. The ACIP discussion would have focused on the facts about COVID vaccines—what the science says about who may benefit and who may be harmed—and whether the vaccine is cost effective. "", ""The American people instead got an announcement video less than a minute long. This action raises the concern that it could be how vaccine policy—and other health policies and recommendations—will be made going forward. This is a precedent sure to undermine the public's trust. And undermining the public's trust in vaccines has been Kennedy's professional goal for nearly a decade. "", 'In response, professional societies that many patients and physicians turn to for independent guidance—the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)—issued statements criticizing both the process and the content of the new recommendations.', 'The announcement spurred confusion. The previous week, in the New England Journal of Medicine, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told Americans something different. In that May 20, 2025 article (see Figure 2 in that article), and in a subsequent public discussion on YouTube, Makary reassured the public that pregnant women—who face substantially higher risks of severe illness, hospitalization, and even death from COVID-19—would still have access to vaccination. ', 'He pledged that the vaccine would be available to people who have health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe disease related to COVID infection. Pregnancy is on that list of conditions that he provided. ', ""In a Face the Nation appearance after Kennedy's announcement, Makary said that women need to consult with their providers, but he didn't indicate what evidence should inform the discussion. If HHS has new information, it should make it public. "", 'With the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (its mutating variants, changes in disease severity, and virus transmissibility) and the recent appearance of a new variant (NB.1.8.1B) that the World Health Organization believes may be affecting disease patterns around the world, a public discussion of the data is more important than ever. ', 'If HHS has new information, it should make it public. ', ""And it needs to happen soon, well in advance of respiratory virus season. ACIP should lay out the data at its next meeting—currently scheduled for June 25 through 27—and provide its recommendations to help inform the very clinicians and patients charged with decision making, even if it's after the fact of Kennedy's unprecedented actions. "", ""If that doesn't happen, it demands a response, with input from the frontlines of our healthcare system and public health. There must be an open, public discussion about the evidence supporting COVID vaccine recommendations. The American people deserve that. They deserve to see the work. It's vital for public confidence. "", 'The best and most durable public health decisions, including about vaccine use, are made in plain sight, in consultation with independent medical professionals, and are backed by rigorous review of current data. The events of the past few weeks raise serious doubts about whether we can count on the US government to follow that common sense blueprint. ', 'The Vaccine Integrity Project, together with our medical, public health, and community partners, is preparing to fill that void.', ' ', 'Vaccine Integrity Project Viewpoints are authored by project staff and advisers. They are intended to address timely issues regarding vaccines with straight talk and clarity by presenting facts to counter falsehoods.', 'The woman had amebic meningoencephalitis, a rare, often fatal brain infection caused by the ameba Naegleria fowleri.', 'Some of the latest cases are tied to a large outbreak centered in West Texas, while others are linked to instances of community transmission or travel to other states or countries.', 'The increase in activity is seen in the Western Pacific, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Mediterranean regions.', 'Preschool-aged children were more likely to have a dry cough and daytime tiredness or low energy.', ""Experts say illnesses don't seem more severe and more studies are needed to further assess the risk of antibody escape."", 'Neutralizing antibodies tested 90 days after infection were greater in participants who had been vaccinated before their variant infections than in those who had been vaccine-naive.', 'Other states report more cases, including Minnesota, with two, one of which involves a child whose infection suggests community spread.', 'Buoyed by promising clinical findings, Moderna says it will explore alternatives for late-stage development of the H5 vaccine.', 'The company\'s ""next-generation"" COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, was approved for adults 65 and older and younger people at risk of severe disease.', ""Iowa's patient is an unvaccinated adult, and Nebraska's is a vaccinated child who had not traveled outside the state."", ""Help make CIDRAP's vital work possible"", 'CIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy\nResearch and Innovation Office, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN', 'EMAIL US', '© 2025 Regents of the University of Minnesota.
