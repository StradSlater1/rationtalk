The witness, who testified under a pseudonym to protect her identity and was identified as ""Jane,"" said that Combs financially supported her during their relationship and leveraged that support in order to pressure her into sexual encounters with male escorts.', ""Unlike Combs' former partner Cassie Ventura, the prosecution's highest-profile witness so far, there's little publicly known information about Jane, who will presumably be the centerpiece of the second half of the prosecution's case against Combs. The trial, which is nearing the end of its fourth week, is expected to last eight weeks total."", 'The producer and entrepreneur faces two counts of sex trafficking by coercion, two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution and one count of racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors say these crimes span two decades. Jane is listed as ""Victim 2"" in the government\'s indictment of Combs, in which he is accused of forcing her into commercial sex acts from around 2021 until approximately 2024. Combs\' defense attorneys say their client had an unconventional yet consensual sex life that had nothing to do with his businesses. He has pleaded not guilty.', 'In the courtroom, Jane described a romantic first date with Combs in early 2021 that lasted several days. Although they did not live in the same city, she said the record producer and entrepreneur showered her with affection, compliments and romantic trips in the first few months of their involvement.', '""I was head over heels for Sean already,"" Jane said. ""I felt like Sean was really passionate, and he brought a lot of passion out of me too.""', 'The relationship was not public or monogamous, and involved drug use during much of the time they were together. Jane became emotional on the witness stand describing how, months into the relationship, Combs told her he fantasized about watching her with another man. She said she agreed to try it, but was surprised when he arranged to make it happen that same night because they had been taking drugs and had already been awake for close to 24 hours straight at that point.', 'Jane described arriving at a hotel suite hours later, where Combs\' assistants were setting up the room with lights, beverages and other supplies. That was the first night Jane had an encounter with a male escort while Combs watched and masturbated. She said it felt exhilarating and ""taboo,"" but she assumed it was a fun, one-off thing.', '""I truly feel that night opened a Pandora\'s box for our relationship,"" she told the court. ""It was a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship.""', 'According to Jane, these ""hotel nights"" eventually took up the majority of the time she spent with Combs. She said she went along with them willingly in the early stages because she loved Combs and wanted to make him happy — echoing earlier testimony by Cassie Ventura. But Jane said from 2021 until 2024, she told Combs many times that she no longer wanted to have sex with other men. Whenever she broached the subject, she felt he was dismissive.', 'Jane explained that she was a single mother making a living as a content creator when she began dating Combs. But she said her social media work waned as she invested more of her time into the relationship, and he often gave her thousands of dollars and paid her rent. On one of the occasions she told him she wanted to stop having ""hotel nights"" with escorts, Combs allegedly framed it as a break-up conversation and asked how much time she needed to move out of the house he paid for. Jane told prosecutor Maurene Comey that she didn\'t want to stop seeing Combs altogether, but she felt ""obligated to perform"" in the encounters.', ""Jane's direct questioning and cross-examination are expected to take up the remainder of this week and most of the following week."", 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVljVXcwY1ZSamIwbFlaWGhXVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZVko2QkpsZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

His lawyers have argued that he is not guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering, and denied any criminal enterprise.', 'On Wednesday, Bongolan also told the jury that Combs and Ventura often had a volatile relationship. Bongolan said she saw Ventura with a black eye or bruises on multiple occasions. Once, Bongolan said she saw Combs throw a knife in Ventura’s direction at Ventura’s apartment.', 'Another time, on the beach in Malibu, California, Combs approached Bongolan and said: “I’m the devil and I could kill you,” Bongolan testified.

After all, if you are on trial, and you believe you are innocent, wouldn’t you show emotion at all these “lies” being told about you?', 'But for whatever reason, emotive defendants do not play well with juries.

A defense attorney once told me he advises his clients to “just sit there and look not guilty.”', 'But what does that mean? What it doesn’t mean is acting out. No muttering under the breath.

Sign up to get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial.', 'Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Diddy’s former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, testified today to a terrifying moment involving the music mogul in September 2016. Bongolan said she was sleeping on the couch at Ventura’s 17th-floor Los Angeles apartment when Diddy banged on the door. She went out to the balcony to smoke marijuana, and Diddy, who had gotten inside, “came behind me and lifted me up and had me on top of the rail,” she testified.

The government first called a hotel security officer who testified that Diddy paid $100,000 in cash in a brown paper bag in exchange for the video. Today, prosecutors called a forensic video expert, who narrated the events on screen, frame by frame. So why is the video relevant if Diddy was not charged with the assault that was recorded?', 'The defense tried mightily to exclude the video, arguing, in part, that any relevance was outweighed by the prejudicial effect. It lost.', 'How the video fits into the government’s theory of the case appears to be this: Prosecutors allege the drug-fueled sexual encounters known as “freak offs” constituted commercial sex acts (for purposes of sex trafficking).', 'The video shows Diddy using force or coercion — one of the necessary elements of sex trafficking — to prevent Ventura from escaping a “freak off,” as she said during her testimony.', 'The cash payment to hotel security is then an effort to conceal that conduct. Plus, racketeering charges are often about a boss corrupting his own company.', ""Finally, the government is very skilled at finding a way to introduce the most devastating evidence against a defendant — which it's done here."", '🗓️ What’s next', 'Tomorrow: The defense plans to continue cross-examining Bongolan as court resumes later than usual. Also, a Diddy accuser who will go by the pseudonym “Jane” is expected to begin multiple days of testimony.

Combs\' defense attorney Brian Steel asked.', 'It is not uncommon for sexual assault survivors to wait some time before revealing their experiences to loved ones or law enforcement.', 'Mia\'s testimony turned emotional as she was asked whether she was able to speak about Combs allegedly assaulting her without looking down while she addressed the court. Mia said she couldn\'t: ""It’s the worst thing I\'ve ever had to talk about in my life,"" she shared.', ""Mia was then asked why she chose to speak out now. She explained that she felt she couldn't help her loved ones, including her niece and goddaughters, if they were ever sexually assaulted and she had never raised her accusations against Combs."", 'The former assistant alleged during her testimony last week that the first time Combs sexually assaulted her was at the Plaza Hotel, when they were in New York City celebrating his 40th birthday in 2009.', 'In later years, Combs allegedly assaulted her several additional times, including at his Los Angeles home and on a private plane.

She replied that she didn’t think five months was a long time frame, explaining that Combs would grieve Porter, with whom he shares four children, for a lifetime.', 'Mia testified that Combs had stolen both her and Ventura Fine\'s devices on multiple occasions, and he put tracking devices on Ventura Fine\'s car. ""I\'m not sure what he\'s capable of,"" she said.', 'But Steel quickly pressed Mia on an instance in which Ventura Fine had come to her, saying that Combs was acting ""jerky."" Mia responded by saying his ""brain needed to be rewired,"" comparing him to a child throwing tantrums who needs his mother.', '""Why would you stick up for Mr. Combs?"" Steel asked, but Mia denied wanting to defend her former boss.', '""One of the worst parts"" of her job was being put in the middle of Ventura Fine and Combs’ relationship, she said, which Cassie has alleged was fraught with physical and sexual abuse. ""I wouldn’t lie to her about anything I wasn\'t forced to,"" she added.', 'Steel questioned Mia about a friendly text message exchange with Combs from 2020, years after her employment with him ended.

Glad you\'re well,"" adding, ""I only remember the good times."" Mia wrote back, ""Love you too, and the only things to remember are the good times, and those are the only ones I have.""', 'Steel asked Mia why she did not respond to Combs by saying, ""Well, I remember the bad times.""

Steel shot back that this is ""because it’s not true,"" but Mia maintained that she has ""never lied in this courtroom, and I will never lie in this courtroom."" She continued, ""I was still brainwashed,"" noting that she was ""constantly seeking"" Combs\' approval.', 'Mia also testified that Combs ""threatened to tell Cassie everything,"" referring to Combs\' allegedly sexually assaulting her.

One was a tribute for Combs\' 45th birthday, where she wrote, ""Happy birthday, Puff Daddy. Thank you for being the good kind of crazy,"" adding that she loved him with all her heart. Steel remarked that this was five years after Combs first allegedly sexually assaulted her.', '""When the highs were high and the goods were good, you tried so hard to stay in that,"" Mia said.

He points out he does ""75 percent defense work."" He says he\'s paid $295 per hour.', 'He\'s asked about technical details regarding cellphone and surveillance video -- the prosecuting attorney shows the infamous video of Diddy in a towel chasing Cassie down a hotel hallway from 2016.

Ex-Girlfriend and Alleged “Diddy” Victim Testifies How 90 Percent of Their Sex Involved Other Men,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/diddy-trial-jane-doe-sex-90-percent-with-other-men-1236257282/,"['', '', ""The woman going by Jane Doe from the witness stand at the rap mogul's trial detailed a romantic courtship that devolved quickly into drug-fueled sex marathons with other men."", 'BY KEVIN DOLAK', 'A woman federal prosecutors are calling a victim of Sean “Diddy” Combs took the stand at his federal trial in lower Manhattan on Thursday, telling the court that during their three year relationship, which lasted up until his September arrest, 90 percent of their time together was during drug-fueled, days-long “freak-offs” where she was coerced into performing sex acts with male sex workers.', 'The woman, who is being referred to as Jane Doe during the trial to protect her identity, is the latest woman brought forth by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to explain how the feds say the once powerful rap and fashion mogul used his companies and loyal staff as a criminal enterprise to coerce and control women, who he would blackmail and manipulate into performing in “freak-off” sex marathons, which the near-billionaire would often film while masterbating. Combs has pled not guilty to all charges in the feds’ five-count indictment, which includes sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. ', '', 'Taking the stand after court had returned from the day’s lunch break, Jane Doe revealed early in her testimony that prior to connecting romantically with Combs in 2021, she was involved with a man whom Combs has history and a tense relationship. She said she met the rap world icon in Miami at a party she attended with a group of girlfriends, one of whom was casually dating Combs at the time; since his 2018 split with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, the federal prosecutors’ star witness. Combs has been involved with several women at once, a fact that Doe told the jury was known to her as the relationship’s inception. ', 'Over her first few hours of testimony on Thursday afternoon, Doe painted a picture of the couple’s meet-cute and easy segue into a more serious relationship, which grew over phone calls, texts and FaceTime video calls. In fact, their relationship saw a boom when Doe’s friend, who was dating Combs, got engaged and moved to Europe. Soon, she told the court, Combs swept her off her feet with a trip to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas over 15 days. The two enjoyed the relaxing island and dinner on their hotel suite’s balcony, where they enjoyed viewing sunsets together. She recalled how he even bought her a bracelet that spells out L-O-V-E. Their sex life was the two of them; she was smitten. ', '', '“I really fell head over heels for Sean,” she said, adding that it was OK for her that he was also seeing other people because she really liked him. “I understood that on his end, it was never a monogamous relationship. ', 'One small hiccup on the trip, she recalled, came when Doe was handed an ecstasy pill by Combs and ended up so gobsmacked by the mind-bending drug that she doubled over in the sand and had to be taken into a tepid shower; over the remainder of the 15-day trip, Doe said she took Ecstacy 10 more times in smaller increments that were pieced out by Combs. ', 'The questioning prosecuting attorney on Thursday quickly moved on to the moment that the relationship soured for Doe, when she asked her to recall for the court the night of March 21, 2021, when she was asked to participate in her first “freak-off” with Combs, which were also referred to as “hotel nights” at times. After Combs’ assistants had set up the hotel suite, Doe said, she would dress in racy lingerie and high-heeled shoes. That was when Combs told her someone was coming: a male escort named Don, who Combs said he knew. The encounter as described by Doe followed a familiar trajectory, one described by Ventura a few weeks ago when she testified about her “freak-off” experiences: the woman and escort would pour baby oil onto each other’s bodies (12 bottles one time, she said); the two begin touching; Doe begins to perform oral sex on Don as Combs watches, masterbating. From the witness, Doe said that it was her that “tried to move things along” into the suite’s bedroom. Combs protested when Doe asked to use a condom, she explained to the court, but he soon provided one and Don and Doe began to have sex. ', '', 'Doe said that her initial experience performing a “freak-off” hotel night with Combs made her “happy” and that “it was taboo.”', '“I just thought that it was a night of fun; I didn’t think that we’d be doing it again,” she told the court, at that point holding back tears. “I think that night opened a Pandora’s Box in our relationship and I was never able to shut it. It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward.”', 'Doe told the court when asked to give a percentage figure by federal prosecutors that after May 2021, 90 percent of the sexual experiences she had with Combs involved other men. The rapper, Doe told the court, suggested they have a hotel night the very next time the two saw each other. ', '“I just wanted to satisfy my partner,” she said of participating in the freak-offs. ', 'As their relationship stretched into months, Combs began to give large sums of money to Doe, whose work marketing brands on her social media accounts was dwindling. He handed her $10,000 after their initial trip to Turks and Caicos as she’d missed out on some work while on the trip with him; later, he’d typically give her $5,000 or $6,000 incrementally. As was the case with Ventura, he began to pay for her apartment; Doe said this was a reason she felt compelled to participate in “freak-offs” even when she started to not enjoy them.', '“I felt obligated to perform because my partner was paying my rent,” she explained. ', '', 'An attempt she had planned to earn her own money by launching an Only Fans account, where she would appear in lingerie and bikinis, could have helped out with a sense of independence — as she told Combs, a friend had claimed she’d brought in $4 million in a year doing a Just Fans page. But Combs, she testified, was having none of that, telling her, “Let’s just give it time.” Prosecutors believe this constitutes coercion to keep Doe financially dependent on him so he could control her and force her into his sexual fantasies.

At the time, Combs was dating one of her friends but offered his phone number to her at the end of the trip. When her friend moved on to someone new, Jane and the rapper continued on talking.', 'Jane said she was charmed by the rapper but also stated Combs didn’t get along with the father of her child. Despite that, she joined him in January of 2021 for a five-day Miami trip. They went on another trip the following month, to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas where she remembered an assistant “KK” being present. During this trip was the first time she took ecstasy and was also paid $10,000 for being away from work.', 'Jane said the two grew deeper in romance though, Combs told her he was seeing multiple women.', 'Upon having sexual intimacy with the rapper, she testified that she learned Combs likes to be intimate in specific ways. ', '“I learned how he liked to have pornography playing. I learned how he preferred me to dress, and I just learned the things that he liked sexually,” she stated.', 'Among the list of the rapper’s preferences, Jane cited baby oil, lingerie and high stripper heels as a few things Combs wanted her to part take in. She said they would have sex in his bedroom with red lighting, going for 12 to 24 hours. At the time, she said she enjoyed it. However, she said it began turning into a more intense, dark “fantasy” sex. ', 'Jane said Combs asked if she would want to participate in sexual activities with another man. Within hours, she said Combs called a man named “Don” from Cowboys for Angels, took her to a hotel and had his assistants set up the room.', 'Jane said she then had sex with Don as Combs watched. She described feeling “excited” and “happy” afterwards but also said she thought it would be a one-time thing. ', '“It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward,” Jane said, adding that she was “unable to shut for the remainder of their relationship.” ', 'With Jane, Combs called what was considered “freak-offs” with Ventura as “hotel nights” or “debauchery.” These events occurred every time she saw the rapper from May 2021 to October 2023, Jane said.

Cassie’s friend Bryana Bongolan pressed on alleged balcony incident, Sean Combs’s attack",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2025/06/04/diddy-trial-live-updates-sean-combs-witness-testimony/,"['Bryana “Bana” Bongolan testified about a chilling encounter with Sean “Diddy” Combs on Day 16 of his federal sex trafficking trial. The witness, a friend of prosecutors’ star witness Cassie Ventura, said she was sleeping over at Ventura’s when Combs burst in and dangled her over a 17th-story balcony, then threw her into some furniture, leaving her with cuts and bruises. A defense lawyer then tried to paint Bongolan, who has also sued Combs, as a drug abusing liar on cross-examination.', 'Another alleged victim is expected to take the stand later this week: a woman who, like Ventura, used to date Combs and claims he abused her in group-sex sessions he called “freak-offs.” She will testify under the alias Jane to protect her privacy.', 'Combs has denied all allegations in the dozens of sexual assault lawsuits filed against him and he has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution.', 'Follow Music', 'Before following the jury out the door for the day, the legal teams discussed anonymity rules for “Jane,” the woman expected to testify under an alias against Sean Combs on Thursday or Friday. There was a mishap with a previous anonymous witness — “Mia,” who alleged Combs raped her — when her real name was published online after the defense showed a video with a zoomed-in picture of her face.', 'Prosecutors have asked the judge to remind the court Thursday of the rules regarding Jane’s testimony, which includes censoring evidence to the press that could reveal her identity.', 'While conceding that stricter rules are necessary, defense attorney Alexandra Shapiro asked Judge Arun Subramanian not to make a big deal of the announcement, lest it end up “chilling efforts to even describe the witness’s demeanor.”', '“We are just concerned saying it yet again is going to deter … not descriptions of what the person looks like, but vaguer descriptions that may reflect people’s observations,” Shapiro said.', 'The judge said that news outlets were able to effectively report Mia’s demeanor without compromising her identity. He is expected to issue a stern reminder in the morning that witnesses testifying under a pseudonym should remain fully anonymous.', 'During her testimony Wednesday, Bryana Bongolan said lawyer Tyrone Blackburn initially represented her in her lawsuit against Sean Combs, whom she has accused of dangling her over a high-rise balcony and attacking her. But she parted ways with the lawyer, Bongolan said, after he got details about the incident wrong in her complaint.', 'Blackburn, who didn’t respond to The Washington Post’s request for comment, has represented multiple plaintiffs who are suing Combs in more than 70 civil sexual assault lawsuits. Combs has denied all the allegations. He also represents Liza Gardner, who alleged in a November 2023 lawsuit that Combs and singer Aaron Hall drugged and sexually assaulted her at a New Jersey residence in 1990 when she was 16 (Combs has filed to dismiss the lawsuit).', 'Blackburn has even attended Combs’s trial with another of his clients, music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, who accused Combs of sexual assault and sex trafficking. Jones’s suit was partially dismissed, but the sexual assault and sex trafficking charges remain.', 'He also represents April Lampros, who alleged Combs sexually assaulted her four times over the course of their relationship between 1995 and 2001. Combs has filed to dismiss Lampros’s lawsuit.', 'Grace O’Marcaigh alleged Combs’s son Christian drugged and sexually assaulted her on a yacht Combs chartered. Her lawsuit was originally filed with Blackburn as one of her lawyers, but his name is no longer listed on the case. (Combs plans to file to dismiss O’Marcaigh’s suit, according to a court filing.)', 'Blackburn’s most recent Combs complaint filed was for Kirk Burrowes, a Bad Boy Entertainment co-founder who alleges Combs repeatedly harassed and sexually assaulted him in the 1990s, and threatened him with a baseball bat to sign away his ownership stake in the label.', 'Will tomorrow bring long-awaited testimony from “Jane,” the pseudonymous woman at the center of the government’s second sex-trafficking count against Sean Combs? The government sure hopes so, but first the defense needs to wrap up their spirited cross-examination of Bryana “Bana” Bongolan, who says Sean Combs dangled her over his girlfriend Cassie Ventura’s balcony in September 2016.', 'Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland estimated she needs another 45 minutes to cross-examine the witness. And then, before the government calls Jane, it wants to call a witness named Enrique Santos who will walk jurors through the formatting of text messages that will be introduced during Jane’s testimony.', 'Also it’s a short trial day tomorrow. Testimony isn’t expected to kick off until 11 a.m., New York time.', 'Nicole Westmoreland is zeroing in on discrepancies in Bryana Bongolan’s claims that Sean Combs dangled her off of a 17th floor balcony in 2016.', '“In one interview with the government you told them you were smoking weed on the balcony, but isn’t it true in your civil demand letter [to Sean Combs] you said you were smoking a cigarette?” the defense lawyer asked Bongolan.', 'She raised another inconsistency where Bongolan testified that she was staring out into the distance when Combs charged into the apartment, but in a previous interview with the government she said that she was looking inside from the balcony.', 'Bongolan has often responded “I don’t remember” to Westmoreland’s questions, which continued until the judge sent the jury home for the day.', 'The defense team told the judge they want to demonstrate that Sean Combs was concerned about Cassie Ventura’s drug use with her friend Bryana Bongolan. This is similar to an argument the defense made about Ventura’s former best friend Kerry Morgan earlier in the trial, when they suggested Combs was upset about her drug use with Ventura. (Ventura countered that Combs was only upset she was doing drugs with people other than him.)', 'While Bongolan testified earlier today that she and Ventura frequently did drugs, a defense attorney asked if Combs ever requested her to stop giving Ventura drugs. “I don’t remember him saying that,” the witness replied.', 'It has been standard procedure for the defense lawyers to compare witnesses’ testimony on the stand to what they said in previous meetings with government investigators, looking for contradictions. Notes are generally taken at these meetings, though, as we’ve seen in this trial, witnesses will sometimes say those notes don’t accurately capture what they said.', 'Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland is using the strategy with Bryana Bongolan, bluntly suggesting that the witness is being dishonest about certain holes in her testimony about being dangled off a high-rise balcony and thrown into furniture by Sean Combs.', 'Bongolan, who was using drugs heavily at the time, has said repeatedly that she doesn’t remember some key details, including her allegation earlier Wednesday that Combs threw a knife at Cassie Ventura in a separate incident. The defense hasn’t offered anything directly contradicting Bongolan’s testimony but appears to be exploiting these gaps to paint a picture of a dishonest witness.', '“I don’t know how it happened. I just saw what I saw,” Bongolan said of the knife incident.', '“You really don’t remember this incident, true?” Westmoreland countered.', 'Cassie Ventura discussed her pending lawsuit against Sean Combs with her friend Bryana Bongolan, the latter testified on cross-examination. Bongolan said Ventura asked for permission to name her in the suit, and Bongolan told her no. (The suit mentions Combs dangling a friend of Ventura’s over a 17th-story balcony, but does not name the friend.)', 'Bongolan also sued Combs herself, a matter she said she tried to keep private from her friends. Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland kept pressing the witness, asking questions that suggested Bongolan and Ventura didn’t just compare notes on their memories of the balcony incident, but made details up.', 'Nicole Westmoreland’s voice is thundering through the microphone as she cross-examines Bryana Bongolan — a very different tactic from other defense attorneys, who were generally deferential when questioning their client’s alleged victims.', 'Westmoreland immediately characterized Bongolan’s testimony about Combs’s attack on her as suspect, and has spent 15 minutes asking the witness to detail drugs she took with Cassie Ventura. Bongolan has listed ecstasy, molly, GHB, cannabis, various types of pills, and a blunt sprinkled with cocaine she called a “cocoa puff,” which was Ventura’s favorite. She said she supplied Ventura with drugs on multiple occasions and introduced her to dealers.', 'Nicole Westmoreland was a late addition to Sean Combs’s sprawling defense team, which includes at least eight attorneys. She’s cross-examined just one witness before now: Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard on May 19.', 'Bryana Bongolan testified that she is seeking $10 million in damages from Sean Combs in a separate lawsuit “because I wanted to seek justice for what happened to me on the balcony.” That suit was filed late last year in Los Angeles State Supreme Court. You can read about it and dozens of other suits against Combs on our updating lawsuit tracker.', 'Bongolan is now being cross-examined by defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland, who started on a heavy note, speaking forcefully into the microphone: “Who gets to decide if you have lied?”', 'The government attempted to ask Bryana Bongolan about an alleged settlement offer between herself and Sean Combs, over the alleged balcony incident. That questioning went nowhere, as after a lengthy sidebar, the judge sustained the defense’s objections.', 'Bongolan said she’s seeking $10 million in damages in her lawsuit against Combs, a number she said was suggested by her lawyer.', 'While photos of Bryana Bongolan’s injuries were being shown to the court, Sean Combs leaned over to his attorney Teny Geragos and peered into a monitor displaying the images. Geragos’s hands were steepled in front of her face as Combs spoke to her.', 'Combs, who had been leaning back in his chair and listening intently to Bongolan’s testimony, briefly motioned toward the monitor again when another image came up: of Bongolan’s bandaged back.', 'He spoke to his lawyer as Bongolan described her efforts to get sober, and testified that certain details of the “balcony incident” in Cassie Ventura’s lawsuit against Combs were incorrect.', 'The jury is looking at a graphic photos: bandages and a neck brace, and a baseball-size bruise with a puncture wound in the middle of it. Bryana Bongolan testified Sean Combs gave her these injuries when he dangled her over a high-rise balcony railing, then threw her into the patio furniture.', 'After hiding her ex-girlfriend in the bathroom of Cassie Ventura’s apartment, Bryana Bongolan testified, she walked out to the 17th-story balcony and tried to “act casual” as Sean Combs entered the unit. The witness said Combs grabbed her from behind anyway, “lifted me up and then put me on top of the rail.”', '“I was trying not to slip,” she said.', 'Asked how long Combs held her over the railing, Bongolan recalled the words he yelled at her. “You know what the f--- you did,” she said in a staccato voice, sounding each syllable out. “If you repeat the words over and over, it was about 15 seconds.”', 'We’ve come to perhaps the most anticipated part of Bryana Bongolan’s testimony — the day in 2016, referenced in her lawsuit against Sean Combs, when she says he dangled her over a high-rise balcony.', 'She told the jury she and her girlfriend were staying at her close friend Cassie Ventura’s 17th floor condo in Los Angeles, sleeping on Ventura’s couch, when they heard Sean Combs banging on the door.', 'Bongolan jumped up and instructed her girlfriend to hide in the bathroom, holding her finger to her lips to indicate she should keep quiet. When asked why she hid her girlfriend, Bongolan responded, “I didn’t want to expose her to the things that I see.”', 'Bryana Bongolan is back on the stand, ready to continue testifying under a subpoena as soon as the court works through some technical difficulties with the monitors.', 'The government wants Bongolan to corroborate details of star witness Cassie Ventura’s testimony, and to help establish that force and violence were endemic to Combs’s world. The defense plans to argue that some events Bongolan detailed didn’t happen.', 'Bongolan, who has her own pending lawsuit against Combs, is wearing a long plaid blazer and black pants. Her sleeves are rolled up, displaying her tattooed forearms. Her long bleached hair is curled and parted down the middle.', 'The jury had to briefly return to the jury room after lunch while the attorneys worked on some wiring problems with their monitors.', 'Judge Arun Subramanian joked that it was good to see the prosecution and defense “working together.”', 'Sean Combs’s attorneys have repeatedly referenced the Metropolitan Detention Center — the federal jail where he lives between trial sessions — saying the conditions there are hindering their ability to prepare his defense.', 'Combs is hardly the first high profile resident of the Brooklyn lockup. Last September, he was cell mates with Sam Bankman-Fried, the fallen crypto king who was convicted in this same courthouse on fraud and money laundering charges.', 'And Martin Shkreli, dubbed “Pharma Bro” for jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000 percent, also spent time at the jail after he violated the terms of his bail by threatening Hillary Clinton.', 'Keith Raniere, leader of the sex cult NXIVM, was held at the facility while he was on trial, as was Ghislaine Maxwell, who trafficked young women for the disgraced financier Jeffery Epstein. And R. Kelly, the R&B artist convicted of sex trafficking, sued the Brooklyn jail for $100 million, claiming they improperly held him in solitary confinement while he was on suicide watch.', 'Sean Combs’s lead attorney Marc Agnifilo represented both Shkreli and Raniere. Maurene R. Comey, a prosecutor in Combs’s trial and the daughter of former FBI director James B. Comey, was one of three government lawyers who tried Maxwell.', 'The defense argues the jail limited Sean Combs’s phone calls and that visiting hours there are insufficient to prepare him for trial. Judge Arun Subramanian has cast doubt on the claims after speaking with jail authorities, but he has allowed Combs to arrive at the court early and stay late under the supervision of U.S. Marshals.', 'There haven’t been many days when the court didn’t have side issues to discuss before the lunch recess. Wednesday is one of those days. The court is now on break until 1 p.m.', 'Bryana “Bana” Bongolan said she and Cassie Ventura often did drugs together, primarily marijuana, cocaine and ketamine. Combs also gave her drugs “three or four times,” she said, including GHB and ketamine.', 'Bongolan admitted she sold drugs to others but “not often.” The witness has had a flat affect on the stand, speaking in a low, monotone voice and giving short answers. She has smiled once, when she explained her and Ventura’s failed attempts to quit using. “We would try to cook,” she said, but it’s “hard to get sober if there’s a lot of drugs around.”', 'To recap events before Bryana Bongolan took the stand:', 'Over and over Wednesday morning, the jury watched 2016 footage from the sixth-floor elevator bank at the InterContinental Hotel when Sean Combs attacked his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. A couple of days after the beating, Combs paid three security staffers working at the hotel for what they believed was the video’s only copy.', 'But another security worker at the hotel, Israel Florez, had recorded a copy of the security footage. Florez did this so he could prove to his wife what had happened, he testified earlier in the trial. “If I would have told my wife, ‘Hey, this is what happened,’ she wouldn’t have believed me,” he said.', 'Bryana Bongolan is testifying that she became friends with Cassie Ventura around 2014, when they designed clothes together at an L.A. streetwear company.', 'Bongolan said that she avoided meeting Ventura’s boyfriend, Sean Combs, for over a year because she considered the couple’s relationship “volatile.” At one point Ventura showed up with a black eye, Bongolan testified.', 'Earlier Wednesday, while the jury was out of the courtroom, prosecutors introduced evidence that included text messages between Combs and his bodyguard D-Roc discussing a black eye and an ice pack, and a prosecutor suggested it could be the same incident.', 'The government has called its next witness, Bryana Bongolan, a creative and marketing director who is a close friend of Cassie Ventura.', 'Bongolan has claimed that an enraged Sean Combs dangled her off a 17th floor balcony in Ventura’s presence, and her testimony has been somewhat anticipated.', 'Sean Combs’s defense lawyers have questioned Frank Piazza for roughly 45 minutes concerning the video that shows Combs attacking Cassie Ventura in an L.A. hotel. It’s unclear how effective this tactic has been. They have asked the forensic witness incredibly detailed questions, ranging from pixelation on the video to asking him to narrate frame by frame sequences. They haven’t contested anything Piazza has said, who is a government witness. Instead, the video is being played multiple times in front of the jury. The intended effect could be that the jurors wind up desensitized, or this could backfire and sear the images of Combs attacking Ventura into their collective memories.', 'Holly Baird, Sean Combs’s publicist, arrived Wednesday for Day 16 of Combs’s trial in a brightly colored dress and black boots.', 'There has not been much about this case that’s unambiguous. Witnesses have testified that they idolized Sean Combs even as he repeatedly abused them. Cassie Ventura, whose accounts of being coerced to have sex with prostitutes are central to the government’s sex trafficking case against Combs, sent texts appearing to express enthusiasm for the freak-offs.', 'That’s why Eddy Garcia’s straightforward and largely uncontested testimony Tuesday stands out.', 'Garcia was working security at the InterContinental hotel in 2016, on the day Sean Combs attacked Ventura, his then-girlfriend, at the elevator bank on the sixth floor. Garcia recounted being approached multiple times by Combs’s chief of staff and then Combs himself as they tried to obtain security footage of the attack. Combs referred to him as “Eddy, my angel,” Garcia recounted on the stand: “He kept repeating that I sounded like a good guy and he believed I could help.”', 'Garcia testified that after his supervisor agreed to give Combs the video in exchange for money, Garcia met with Combs and received $100,000 in cash from a brown paper bag. The jury viewed contracts Garcia signed for Combs, avowing that no other copies of the video existed and that he wouldn’t disclose their deal.', 'Combs’s defense did not challenge this account during cross-examination, focusing instead on a paragraph from the contract that suggested that Garcia could go to law enforcement if he wanted. (Garcia said on the stand he didn’t actually read the contract.) In their opening arguments, the defense acknowledged that Combs paid Garcia money but argued that it was “solely related to preventing bad publicity for both Combs and Cassie.”', 'Other government witnesses have testified that they felt coerced or forced to do things Combs wanted under the threat of violence, or threats to their careers and livelihoods. The defense has countered much of this testimony by claiming that the events didn’t happen as witnesses described, or that witnesses had their own reasons for participating in potentially illegal behavior.', 'For the government, Garcia’s testimony was a straightforward tale of Combs exerting his money and influence to hide his crimes and protect his reputation.', 'Sean Combs’s mother, Janice Combs, is back again Wednesday at the Manhattan courthouse to sit in on her son’s trial.', 'Establishing the authenticity of the video showing Sean Combs beat Cassie Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel is important for evidentiary reasons, but there is another effect at play in forensic expert Frank Piazza’s testimony.', 'As Piazza answer questions, the video is being played over and over again in front of the jury. It’s not the first time they’ve seen the video, but at the moment they are watching frame-by-frame replays of the brutal assault.', 'The surveillance footage showing Sean Combs attacking Cassie Ventura has some pixelation issues, including when Ventura bends over to put on a shoe in front of an elevator bank and, moments later, when Combs grabs her and throws her to the ground.', 'The pixelation does not indicate the video has been doctored, forensic video expert Frank Piazza told the jury, but results from issues with a corrupted video stream at the hotel where it was captured.', 'Frank Piazza said he helped correct investigators’ copy of a 2016 video that showed Sean Combs attacking Cassie Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. Piazza said the video he worked on was a cellphone recording of original security footage, and had been sped up due to how it was exported. This is common, Piazza testified, and did not indicate any tampering with the video.', 'The forensic specialist said he restored the video to its original speed, but was not able to correct distortions and motion blurs. He testified that no one had doctored the video, which ties in to the defense team’s claim that CNN aired a doctored version of the video that leaked last year.', 'Frank Piazza analyzed the InterContinental assault video for the government, as well as videos of Sean Combs’s freak-offs obtained by federal investigators, he said in his testimony Wednesday morning.', 'Piazza, as an expert in video forensics, is being paid $295 an hour for his testimony. That’s much less than the $600 an hour another expert witness, forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes, was paid for her time on the stand earlier in the trial.', 'A forensic audio and video editor named Frank Piazza is on the stand, expected to testify to the validity of security camera footage that shows Sean Combs attacking Cassie Ventura in an InterContinental Hotel hallway in 2016.', 'The parties have debated the scope and format of the video evidence, which is key to the prosecution’s case that Combs trafficked people for sex.', 'Testimony from a security guard Tuesday alleged that Combs went to great lengths to erase copies of the video, paying the guard and his co-workers $100,000 to hand over the only copy.', 'Bryana Bongolan was sworn in, but she won’t be testifying immediately because she has invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination while on the stand, and needs to wait for the judge to grant an order of immunity in exchange for honest testimony.', 'Bongolan is a friend of star prosecution witness Cassie Ventura, and has claimed that an enraged Sean Combs once dangled her off a high-rise balcony. Her testimony is expected to include accounts of illicit drug use.', 'This is at least the third government witness to get immunity for their testimony. The others were George Kaplan, a former personal assistant to Combs who talked about witnessing physical violence and fetching drugs for his employer, and Eddy Garcia, a security worker who accepted $100,000 in cash for surveillance footage showing Combs beating Ventura in 2016.', 'In a high-profile trial, nearly every piece of evidence and testimony is hashed out by the judge and lawyers before the jury sees it, and that’s what’s happening Wednesday before testimony kicks off.', 'Sean Combs’s lawyers want to send a letter to Judge Arun Subramanian that the prosecution wouldn’t be able to read. The defense wants to communicate with him directly about evidence that the prosecutors could use to undermine Combs, but the judge won’t allow it.', 'Spectators and reporters are filing into the courthouse for the 16th day of the Sean Combs trial. We are approaching the halfway mark in a trial expected to last two months, and local public interest remains strong. Drivers slow down when passing the courthouse, craning their necks out the windows of their cars to catch a glimpse of the phalanx of cameras, and maybe a celebrity.', 'In late 2022, well before Sean “Diddy” Combs got into real trouble, a man in Los Angeles approached Tanea Wallace with an offer.', 'The man was a scout for Soft White Underbelly, photographer Mark Laita’s YouTube channel about people struggling with issues such as abuse or addiction. Wallace, an aspiring singer who sometimes made money doing sex work, took Laita up on it, for $300, sitting for his camera and talking about her life.', 'In the interview, she recounted an alleged incident from 2018 — a crown prince of Brunei flew her from Los Angeles to Miami with a promise to help her singing career. Once there, he took her to a party on Star Island, an uber-exclusive, man-made enclave that is home to celebrities such as rapper Rick Ross, retired basketball star Shaquille O’Neal and Combs. The music mogul was throwing the party. Security guards took her phone before she could wander through the property.', 'Wallace entered quite a scene, as she recently described in a Washington Post interview. Topless waitresses served drinks by the pool, she said. Inside, woozy partygoers were having sex as if nobody was watching. Wallace eventually encountered Combs outside on a patio couch. At some point, she says said, he started masturbating.', 'This is an excerpt from a full story.', 'Cassie Ventura, the trial’s star witness, earlier testified that she witnessed a chilling encounter when Sean Combs physically assaulted one of her friends at Ventura’s Los Angeles apartment.', 'That friend — Bryana “Bana” Bongolan — detailed the same alleged incident in her November 2024 sexual battery lawsuit against Combs.

Diddy has pleaded not guilty to all charges.', 'Bongolan, 33, testified about her relationship with Diddy’s ex-girlfriend Cassie, whom she said she became friends with around 2014. (Diddy, 55, and Cassie, 38, dated off and on from 2007 to 2018.)', 'According to Bongolan, she avoided meeting Diddy for more than a year because of the allegedly “volatile” nature of his relationship with Cassie (full name Casandra Ventura). “I wasn’t really fond of what I was seeing, so I didn’t really want to meet him right away,” she told the court, claiming that she would get “upsetting” phone calls from Cassie and once saw her friend with a black eye.', 'During her testimony, Bongolan detailed her previous allegation that Diddy once dangled her over the 17th floor of a high-rise apartment building in Los Angeles. She claimed that the incident occurred when she and her girlfriend were staying at Cassie’s apartment. They were sleeping on the couch when they allegedly heard Diddy banging on the door.', '', 'At that point, Bongolan told her girlfriend to hide in the bathroom. When asked why she did that, Bongolan replied, “I didn’t want to expose her to the things that I see.”', 'After her girlfriend went into the bathroom, Bongolan walked out onto the balcony and tried to “act casual” as Diddy came into the apartment. She claimed the rapper then grabbed her from behind and “lifted me up and then put me on top of the rail.”', 'Bongolan went on to say she was “trying not to slip” as Diddy allegedly yelled, “You know what the f*** you did.” When asked how long she was held there, she estimated that it was about 15 seconds.', 'The jury was then shown photos of her injuries, which included a large bruise, and of her wearing a neck brace. She claimed she sustained the injuries when Diddy held her over the balcony and then threw her into patio furniture.', 'Bongolan told the court that the alleged incident left her with feelings of “paranoia” and caused “night terrors” that made her scream in her sleep.', 'During cross-examination, defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland asked Bongolan to name the drugs she did with Cassie during that period in their lives, and Bongolan listed marijuana, GHB, ecstasy and ketamine, among other things. Westmoreland also pointed out seeming discrepancies in the balcony story, noting that Bongolan told prosecutors she was smoking weed when she was allegedly attacked but said in her lawsuit that she was smoking a cigarette.', 'The defense also questioned Bongolan about her relationship with Cassie, which she said resumed in late 2023, around the time Cassie filed her own lawsuit against Diddy. Bongolan said that the pair discussed the balcony incident and Cassie asked whether she could use Bongolan’s name in her lawsuit, but Bongolan said no. (Cassie and Diddy settled out of court in November 2023, and he denied all the allegations in the suit.)', 'Cassie mentioned the alleged balcony altercation in her own testimony last month, telling the court that it happened early in the morning.

', '“We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr. Combs by the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” Diddy’s attorney Marc Agnifilo said in a statement at the time. “He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal. To his credit Mr. Combs has been nothing but cooperative with this investigation and he voluntarily relocated to New York last week in anticipation of these charges. Please reserve your judgment until you have all the facts. These are the acts of an innocent man with nothing to hide, and he looks forward to clearing his name in court.”', 'Since his arrest, Diddy has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. His four requests for bail were denied by Judge Arun Subramanian. ', 'Last year, Bongolan sued Diddy for sexual battery. That lawsuit included the allegation that he dangled her over a balcony at Cassie’s apartment in September 2016.', '“The only purpose of dangling someone over a balcony is to actually kill them or to intentionally terrorize them and rob them of any concept of dominion over their own bodily autonomy and safety,” the lawsuit read. “Ms. Bongolan refuses to allow this fear to control the rest of her life and brings this action to demand that Mr. Combs takes responsibility for the trauma he intentionally and maliciously [inflicted].”', 'Diddy, meanwhile, denied Bongolan’s claims in a statement shared with Rolling Stone via his legal team.', '“Anyone has the right to file a lawsuit, regardless of the evidence they may or may not have,” the spokesperson told the outlet. “Since last year, Ms. Bongolan has expressed an intention to sue Mr. Combs and has sought legal representation to pursue her claims. Mr. Combs firmly denies these serious allegations and remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless.”', 'If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).
