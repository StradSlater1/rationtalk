I told her it shouldn’t have happened, but it did. But you have your own difficulty with that, and we do.”', 'He was referring to Merkel, but did not call her by name. The former chancellor visited the White House in 2017, during Trump’s first term of office, when she was given a grilling by Trump over her so-called open-door policy, which allowed around 1 million refugees – mainly from Syria and Iraq – into Germany.', 'Merz’s highly anticipated visit had been viewed with trepidation in Berlin, amid fears that the German leader may face another Oval Office ambush, such as those endured by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa.', 'In the end, all the criticism was levied at Merkel, a former political rival of Merz. Trump also made a dig about Merkel’s enthusiasm for the building of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brought gas from Russia to Europe.', 'During the 35-minute press conference, Merz struggled to get a word in, though as German commentators noted, that was probably to the relief of his advisers, who feared there were a number of issues on which Trump might have pilloried him, from defence spending to immigration.', 'When he did manage to speak, the former corporate lawyer mostly focused on Ukraine and the need to end the conflict, in particular by bringing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to account.', 'Merz also pushed back several times on Trump’s narrative that Ukraine and Russia were equally to blame for the war.', '“I’m here, Mr President, to talk to you later on how we could contribute to that goal [to end the war]. We are all looking for measures and for instruments to bring this terrible war to an end,” Merz said.', 'He compared the US role in ending the conflict with the part US troops played in defeating the Nazi dictatorship. He noted that Friday will mark the 81st anniversary of D-day, in which tens of thousands of US troops joined allied troops in invading Normandy.', 'The US, he said, was “again, in the very strong position to do something” about ending the war. Trump, he said, was the “key person in the world” who could stop the war “by putting pressure on Russia”.', 'Trump praised Germany for having agreed to boost its defence spending to 5% of GDP, after years-long demands from Washington for it to do so.', 'Asked by a German journalist whether Berlin was “doing enough on defence”, Trump said: “I know you’re spending more money on defence now. Quite a bit more money. That’s a positive.”', 'But to some nervous laughter in the room, he quipped that he was “not sure if Gen MacArthur would have said it’s positive,” a reference to the supreme commander for the allied powers, among whose focuses was postwar demilitarisation.', 'Merz prepared for the visit in part by talking to other leaders who have met Trump in recent months to gather tips about the best way to handle him.', 'Merkel has said that she prepared for her first Trump visit – when he was less well-known as a politician – by reading a 1980s interview with him in Playboy and watching episodes of The Apprentice.', 'Merz was put up for the night in the official government guest house, Blair House, which his advisers said was a signal that the two leaders – who refer to one other by their first names – were on a good footing.', 'Merz presented Trump with a gold-framed birth certificate of his grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who emigrated from Germany in 1885, as well as a book titled News from the Land of Freedom – German Immigrants Write Home, which is a collection of letters written by German émigrés in the US to their families back in Germany.', '“It is a small present to remind him of his family,” Merz said.

Trump has issued another round of warnings to the European Union on tariffs; the war in Ukraine appears no closer to ending; and pressure is mounting on Israel over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.', 'Since taking office, Merz has been on a tour of European capitals, meeting with France’s Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Keir Starmer and Poland’s Donald Tusk – before they all appeared in Kyiv alongside Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in a show of European unity.', 'The one major omission has been a meeting with Trump. While there have been phone calls between the two, the handshake accompanied by the frantic clicks of camera shutters will mark the start of the new German-US relationship.', 'Germany’s status as the economic powerhouse of Europe and Merz’s repositioning of the country as a leader in European security – which includes a commitment to beef up its military and fall in line with Trump’s demands for NATO members to increase defense spending – underscore the importance of a successful encounter.', 'There is also the chance of an explosive diplomatic broadside, as seen with President Zelensky and, more recently, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa.', 'Both Vice President, JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have recently criticized Germany’s decision to classify the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party, as “certainly right-wing extremists”, and therefore expanding surveillance on the party.', 'Both took to X, to express their anger at what they called the German “establishment” for the designation. Secretary Rubio said, “that’s not democracy – it’s tyranny in disguise”.', 'Vance followed up by saying Germany is trying to redivide the country, “the West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt — not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.”', 'The German Foreign Ministry, for its part, said on X, the decision was democratic, “the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law.”', 'Merz, a few days later, also rejected the statements, saying “Germany was liberated from tyranny by the US; Germany is stable, liberal, and democratic today. We don’t need a remedial lesson in democracy.”', 'The expectation though, is that this will be a cordial meeting.', 'Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States, told CNN that Merz is “totally ready” for the meeting and said the chancellor’s personality and manner of communicating would help him win over the president.', '“He doesn’t mince his words… That’s not Friedrich Merz’s style.

As part of that trip, he would accompany the US president to the rural town of Bad Dürkheim, the childhood home of Trump’s paternal grandfather.', 'And recently there has been Germany’s alignment with the US on NATO defense spending.', 'Merz and his government have indicated that they are ready to comply with, and push others to agree to, the long-stated Trump demand that members of the alliance increase spending on defense to 5% of GDP.', 'Building up a positive working relationship, though, is likely to be Germany’s major ambition for the White House meeting. And Merz’s previous roles and experience could play a big part in bringing that about.', 'Formerly the head of “Atlantik Brucke,” or Atlantic Bridge, a think tank that promotes German-US ties, Merz is known in Germany as being an ardent proponent of the transatlantic relationship.', 'He was a huge advocate for a US-EU trade agreement while at Atlantic Bridge and has spoken openly about his admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan.

She told CNN that although she believes the German government understands it needs to keep a good relationship with the White House, “deep inside, they are totally, deeply, utterly worried” about the Trump administration and its commitment to the defense of NATO allies in Europe, particularly given the threats posed by an increasingly bellicose Russia.', 'The conundrum, she said, is that Germany “can’t afford the Americans leaving,” because despite European commitments to increase spending on security, building up those capabilities takes years. “At the same time, we don’t want them to leave, because we think we are better off together,” she added.', 'She points to the German coalition agreement, (essentially a contract between the two coalition parties, the CDU and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), on how they will govern Germany) and a major change in the constitution that could unlock half a trillion dollars of spending on the military, as indicators of the conflicting sentiment.', 'The revision of Germany’s constitutional debt brake, pushed through by Merz in March before he even formally became chancellor, was a “revolutionary change by German standards,” Major said. But it was forced through because “international relations have changed so much” that it appeared essential, she said.', 'At the same time, she said, the coalition pact reads as if everything about the transatlantic relationship is in fine working order. “If you’re such great partners, why did we need a constitutional change?” Major asked.', 'A Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak ahead of the meeting, told CNN that Merz’s recent words have been “both tactical and strategic.”', 'The source said Merz sees Germany as “(needing) to grow up and take care of (itself),” adding that the chancellor does not see that as possible “in the next three years,” and thus it is still in Germany’s interest to have a good relationship with the US and find a way to work together.', 'Ischinger, too, sees pragmatism at play, suggesting that Merz could seek to replicate the personal relationship built by Macron with Trump.', 'The German chancellor will want to ensure that “Donald Trump understands that if Friedrich Merz is a committed European, that does not mean that Friedrich Merz is going to make the Atlantic wider,” he said.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

So let's talk about what we can do jointly, and we are ready to do what we can,” he said."", 'The bizarre moment was not even the first example of questionable historical references to the Nazi and post-Hitler era from Trump, who also attempted to crack a joke about Merz’s efforts to push past decades of German pacifism to help bolster Ukraine’s defense and jump-start his country’s own arms industry.', 'Asked whether Germany is doing enough to meet their commitments to NATO by spending a set percentage of GDP on defense needs, Trump replied that he knows Germany is now “spending more money on defense now and quite a bit more money” and called the development “a positive thing” before waxing on about the late American Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s views of Germany in the wake of two world wars.', ""“I'm not sure that General MacArthur would have said it's positive, you know, he wouldn't like it, but I sort of think it's good,” Trump said."", ""“He made a statement, never let Germany rearm. And I said, I always think about that. When he says, ‘Sir, we're spending more money on defense,’ I say, ‘Oh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?’ I think it's a good thing. But you know, at least to a certain point, there'll be a point where say, Please don't arm anymore. If you don't mind.”"", 'The president then, perhaps jokingly, suggested that the U.S. would be “watching” Germany’s re-armament efforts with skepticism.', 'In what appeared to be a reversal from his first-term position, the American leader told reporters that the U.S. would be keeping the tens of thousands of troops based in Germany in that country, the site of some of America’s largest European bases.', 'Asked whether the U.S. would continue to base troops in Merz’s country, he replied: “The answer is yes.”', ""“We'll talk about that. But if they'd like to have them there, yeah,” he said."", ""“We have a lot of them, about 45,000 it's a lot of troops. It's a city,” Trump continued, adding that their presence is good for Germany’s economy because they’re “highly paid” and “spend a lot of money” there. \\""]",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHlaRGhOYjFWbFFWUjZjbU40VFJDa0F4ajJCQ2dLTWdtQkVKeTJET3ZBcFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

It also detonated explosives under a bridge to Crimea, though the structure appeared largely intact.', 'In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin called Trump on Wednesday, warning that Russia would retaliate for the drone attacks, which destroyed or damaged several long-range bombers used both in nuclear defense and missile strikes against Ukraine. The next day, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv issued an urgent air raid alert.', ""The drone strikes on four Russian airfields—including sites in Siberia and the Arctic Circle—were widely hailed by Kyiv, Western officials, and military experts as a major success, demonstrating Ukraine’s ability to deal serious blows deep inside Russia.

He added that he had relayed that analogy to Russian President Vladimir Putin in their phone conversation on Wednesday.', ""Asked about Trump's comments as the two leaders sat next to each other, Merz stressed that both he and Trump agreed “on this war and how terrible this war is going on,” pointing to the U.S. president as the “key person in the world” who would be able to stop the bloodshed."", 'But Merz also emphasized that Germany “was on the side of Ukraine” and that Kyiv was only attacking military targets, not Russian civilians.', '“We are trying to get them stronger,” Merz said of Ukraine.', ""Thursday's meeting marked the first time that the two leaders sat down in person. After exchanging pleasantries — Merz gave Trump a gold-framed birth certificate of the U.S president's grandfather Friedrich Trump, who immigrated from Germany — the two leaders were to discuss issues such as Ukraine, trade and NATO spending."", ""Trump and Merz have spoken several times by phone, either bilaterally or with other European leaders, since Merz took office on May 6. German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump's relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in the Republican president's first term."", ""The 69-year-old Merz — who came to office with an extensive business background — is a conservative former rival of Merkel's who took over her party after she retired from politics."", 'A White House official said topics that Trump is likely to raise with Merz include Germany’s defense spending, trade, Ukraine and what the official called “democratic backsliding,"" saying the administration\'s view is that shared values such as freedom of speech have deteriorated in Germany and the country should reverse course. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.', 'But Merz told reporters Thursday morning that if Trump wanted to talk German domestic politics, he was ready to do that but he also stressed Germany holds back when it comes to American domestic politics.', 'Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.', 'In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.”', ""Under Merz's immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits."", 'In his remarks on Thursday, Trump still left the threat of sanctions on the table. He said sanctions could be imposed for both Ukraine and Russia.', '“When I see the moment where it’s not going to stop ... we’ll be very, very tough,” Trump said.', ""At home, Merz's government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump's first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies."", 'The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5% mark.', ""Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany's armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027."", 'Merz has said that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.” He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.', ""Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany's economy, Europe's biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump's tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025."", 'Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.', '“Germany is one of the very big investors in America,” Merz told reporters Thursday morning. “Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.”', 'The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S.', 'Trump’s 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles in hopes of causing them to move their factories to the U.S., even though many of the companies already have plants in the U.S. with Volkswagen in Tennessee, BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and South Carolina.', 'There’s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs “benefit no one and damage everyone” while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union’s executive commission. Trump recently delayed a planned 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month.', ""One source of strain in recent months is a speech Vice President JD Vance gave in Munich shortly before Germany's election in February, in which he lectured European leaders about the state of democracy on the continent and said there is no place for “firewalls.”"", ""That term is frequently used to describe mainstream German parties' refusal to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished second in the election and is now the biggest opposition party."", ""Merz criticized the comments. He told ARD television last month that it isn't the place of a U.S. vice president “to say something like that to us in Germany; I wouldn't do it in America, either.”"", 'Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHlaRGhOYjFWbFFWUjZjbU40VFJDa0F4ajJCQ2dLTWdtQkVKeTJET3ZBcFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

In May, he threatened to levy a 50% tariff on European goods, saying that it was ""time that we play the game the way I know how to play the game"".', 'Trump later backtracked and delayed the tariffs until 9 July, a move that his US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer characterised as having a ""fire lit"" under the EU.', ""Germany is the EU's largest exporter to the US, leaving the country's businesses extremely agitated about any trade obstacles."", 'Merz, a 69-year-old reputed millionaire with a corporate background, may feel confident about going toe-to-toe with Trump, who often hails himself as the consummate ""dealmaker"".', 'Whether the Chancellor will be able to smooth the path for EU negotiators, however, remains to be seen.', ""Constanze Stelzenmüller, an expert on German-US relations at the Brookings Institution, believes Merz's ability to push the negotiations along is limited, given that the EU as an institution has taken the lead on those talks."", '""Whatever Merz says is mood music, rather than being able to say that XYZ will happen, even if major nation states aren\'t without influence on the European Commission,"" she explained.

He added that he had relayed that analogy to Russian President Vladimir Putin in their phone conversation on Wednesday.', ""Asked about Trump's comments as the two leaders sat next to each other, Merz stressed that both he and Trump agreed “on this war and how terrible this war is going on,” pointing to the U.S. president as the “key person in the world” who would be able to stop the bloodshed."", 'But Merz also emphasized that Germany “was on the side of Ukraine” and that Kyiv was only attacking military targets, not Russian civilians.', '“We are trying to get them stronger,” Merz said of Ukraine.', ""Thursday's meeting marked the first time that the two leaders sat down in person. After exchanging pleasantries — Merz gave Trump a gold-framed birth certificate of the U.S president's grandfather Friedrich Trump, who immigrated from Germany — the two leaders were to discuss issues such as Ukraine, trade and NATO spending."", ""Trump and Merz have spoken several times by phone, either bilaterally or with other European leaders, since Merz took office on May 6. German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump's relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in the Republican president's first term."", ""The 69-year-old Merz — who came to office with an extensive business background — is a conservative former rival of Merkel's who took over her party after she retired from politics."", 'A White House official said topics that Trump is likely to raise with Merz include Germany’s defense spending, trade, Ukraine and what the official called “democratic backsliding,"" saying the administration\'s view is that shared values such as freedom of speech have deteriorated in Germany and the country should reverse course. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.', 'But Merz told reporters Thursday morning that if Trump wanted to talk German domestic politics, he was ready to do that but he also stressed Germany holds back when it comes to American domestic politics.', 'Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.', 'In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.”', ""Under Merz's immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits."", 'In his remarks on Thursday, Trump still left the threat of sanctions on the table. He said sanctions could be imposed for both Ukraine and Russia.', '“When I see the moment where it’s not going to stop ... we’ll be very, very tough,” Trump said.', ""At home, Merz's government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027."", 'Merz has said that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.” He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.', ""Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany's economy, Europe's biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump's tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025."", 'Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.', '“Germany is one of the very big investors in America,” Merz told reporters Thursday morning. “Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.”', 'The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen.
