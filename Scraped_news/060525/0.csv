Musk Fends Off Trump Questions in Tense Interview Exchange,https://www.thedailybeast.com/musk-fends-off-trump-questions-in-tense-interview-exchange/,"['Media Reporter', 'A CBS interview with Elon Musk went off the rails after he was asked about President Donald Trump’s crusade against Harvard.', '“I’m wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal,” Pogue said on CBS’s Sunday Morning. “I mean, you were one of those kids, right?”', '“Yeah. I mean, I think we wanna stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is, like, spaceships, as opposed to, you know, presidential policy,” Musk replied.', '“Oh, okay,” Pogue replied. “I was told anything is good, but—”', '“No, well—no,” Musk said.', 'The Trump administration announced on May 22 it was revoking Harvard University’s ability to enroll foreign students, of which it has approximately 6,800. The move has since been blocked by the courts.', 'Musk later went back on his refusal to talk politics, however, lamenting that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had become a “whipping boy” for those opposed to his slash-and-burn cuts to federal programs.', '“It’s a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything. So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE,” he said.', 'Musk brought up the Trump administration—and his gripes with it—all on his own.', '“And you know, it’s not like I agree with everything the administration does,” he said. “I agree with much of what the administration does. But we have differences of opinion. You know, there are things that I don’t entirely agree with.”', '“But it’s difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention,” he added. “So then, I’m a little stuck in a bind, where I’m like, well, I don’t wanna, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don’t wanna take responsibility for everything this administration’s doing.”', 'Musk also remarked on Trump’s “big, beautiful” spending package that passed the House. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the package would add $3.8 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years, and Musk told CBS he was “disappointed” to see the package’s cost.', '“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, doesn’t decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said. “I think a bill can be ‘big’ or it can be ‘beautiful,’ but I don’t know if it could be both. My personal opinion.”', 'Shortly after CBS released a clip of Musk’s comments on the spending bill on Tuesday, Musk announced on X that he would officially leave his role as a “special government employee.” He told CBS he would still have some involvement with the agency, but he wanted to prioritize his companies.', '“DOGE is gonna continue, just as a way of life,” he said. “I will have some participation in that, but as I’ve said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.”', 'Media Reporter', 'corbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com', 'Got a tip?

GOP civil war erupts as Musk ratchets up attacks on Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vs-musk-republican-civil-war-budget-bill-rcna211168,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By Chris Hayes', 'This is an adapted excerpt from the June 4 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”', 'There’s a civil war brewing in the Republican Party and it’s threatening the centerpiece of Donald Trump’s legislative agenda: his one big, beautiful, disgusting abomination of a bill, which the Congressional Budget Office says will add almost $2.5 trillion to the deficit, while depriving more than 11 million Americans of health care coverage in the next decade.', 'To say this is leaving the Republican caucus in disarray is an understatement.', 'That bill is now meeting new resistance from far-right members of Congress, thanks to the actions of Trump’s one-time wingman, Elon Musk. Shortly after his DOGE days in the White House ended in embarrassing fashion, with a literal black eye and reports left and right about alleged drug use and other weird behavior, Musk started this week off by declaring war on Trump’s legislation. (Musk has denied the reported drug use.)', '“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk posted on his social media platform, X, on Tuesday. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”', 'To say this leaves the Republican caucus in disarray would be an understatement. Just days ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is shepherding the spending bill through Congress, posted a photo of himself riding in style with Musk and Trump. But on Wednesday, he said he couldn’t even get Musk on the phone.', '“We’ve gotta get it done, and I think Elon understands the weight of that,” Johnson told reporters. “I hope he comes around, and I’d love to talk to him this week, and I hope he calls me back today.” (As of Thursday morning, Johnsons told reporters they were still playing phone tag.)', 'Hours after that Wednesday news conference, Musk posted a call to action against the Trump legislation on X: “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” (In case that was too subtle, eight minutes later, he also posted a movie poster for the film “Kill Bill.”)', 'But this is more than just a food fight. Remember, Musk threatened to primary Republicans who won’t toe the MAGA line. Now, the threat seems to be that he could primary Republicans who pass Trump’s bill. And so some of those Republicans are tying themselves in knots to try to keep both Trump and Musk happy.', 'When Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was asked about Musk’s criticism, she told reporters, “Well, you know I have to agree with him on one hand. I always love it when Americans are angry at the federal government and express it … And so, do I like the price tag of the bill? No. But I want to get off the Biden and Democrat CR that this government is currently funding on.”', 'At one level, this is a story of two people with enormous egos who were never going to be content as co-presidents. But the deeper story here calls into question the entire Trump enterprise and what Trump was using Musk for, which was to make really unpopular cuts across the government.', 'Cuts that followed the Project 2025 playbook and appealed to the most hardcore anti-government extremists in the Republican base and far-right members of Congress, like the House Freedom Caucus, who want a government small enough to drown in a bathtub.', 'But as a policy, that approach is substantively disastrous and politically unpopular. It is not even popular with Trump, who has no qualms about running up massive budget deficits. He told everyone he’s not going to touch Social Security or Medicare. But he has to worry about pro-austerity Republicans, so he outsourced the austerity to Musk and DOGE. That way, Trump could say to the anti-government vanguard in Congress, “Oh, don’t worry about the deficit and the debt or spending, because I’ve got Musk going to town over there. He’s just going to cut all the stuff you don’t like, and no one in Congress is going to have to take hard votes.”', 'But this was always a dubious play. First, because what DOGE was doing was illegal, as many courts have found. Second, Musk wasn’t actually making a dent in federal spending. He decimated our international aid budget, but that was never where the big government spending was, contrary to all the lies and false conspiracy theories Musk spread.', 'Most importantly, Musk’s activities were so unpopular that the American people’s outrage blew back on Trump and the Republicans. In town hall after town hall, it became clear that Trump’s play for plausible deniability was a failure. That’s why I believe the White House didn’t keep Musk on and why he’s freelancing now.', 'Trump’s special weapon against party division has always been his cult of personality. When it comes to voting for their own beliefs or voting for Trump, Republican lawmakers almost always vote for Trump. That was enough to get the bill through the House.', 'This is the Frankenstein’s monster that Trump helped create: A guy who has virtually unlimited funds to primary politicians he doesn’t like.', 'But there are Republicans, particularly in the Senate, folks such as Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who are being very vocal about wanting to scale back Trump’s legislation drastically, to pull it apart or to kill it. And now, thanks to political cover from Musk, senators such as Tuberville, Paul and Johnson may be even more emboldened to resist Trump.', 'This is the Frankenstein’s monster that Trump helped create: A guy who has virtually unlimited funds to primary politicians he doesn’t like. Musk is giving these Republicans cover to rail in the way that they are politically comfortable with — and he has a massive social media platform that he can use to supercharge the debate, just as he used it to spread totally ridiculous stories and false numbers about what DOGE has been up to.', 'That points to a real danger here: Musk’s propaganda machine now rivals Fox News in its ability to influence and target the right wing of the Republican Party. It seems Trump is discovering that his oligarchy would be great … if it weren’t for the oligarchs.', 'Chris Hayes hosts “All In with Chris Hayes” at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday on MSNBC.

', 'The president invited Musk into the Oval Office and Cabinet meetings. Musk called himself ""first buddy.""', 'Mr. Trump welcomed Musk\'s idea to create a Department of Government Efficiency. [""You gotta give him credit!"" the president told reporters.]  Musk demonstrated his goals for DOGE by wielding a chainsaw at a February meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. ""This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!"" he bellowed.', 'In four months, DOGE took the chainsaw to every federal department: 250,000 workers were fired or bought out; Musk even slashed grants and staffing at environmental agencies, like the EPA and NOAA, after decades of warning about the risks of climate change.', 'But Musk did not enjoy the pushback. There were acts of violence; death threats; lawsuits; mandatory re-hirings; and shouting matches with Cabinet members.', ""Tesla profits plummeted by 71%—and Musk's net worth dropped by $100 billion. "", 'Last month, Musk finally left Washington, but still intended to work on DOGE a day or two a week. And this past Tuesday, he offered ""Sunday Morning"" an interview at SpaceX\'s headquarters near Brownsville, at the southern tip of Texas.', 'We knew we were in the right neighborhood when we saw a huge bust of Musk, installed by his admirers—and vandalized by his critics.', ""But the interview didn't get off to a smooth start."", 'I asked, ""I noticed that all of your businesses involve a lot of components, a lot of parts. Do the tariffs and the trade wars affect any of this?""', '""You know, tariffs always affect things a little bit,"" Musk replied.', '""I\'m wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal. I mean, you were one of those kids, right?""', '""Yeah. I mean, I think we wanna stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is, like, spaceships, as opposed to, you know, presidential policy,"" Musk said.', '""Oh, okay,"" I said. ""I was told anything is good, but…""', '""No, well—no,"" Musk replied.', 'But Musk was willing to talk about the DOGE firestorm. I asked him, ""You\'ve spoken about how much of a grind and a stress it was on you, and you know, Tesla\'s reputation took a hit, your reputation took a hit. People are very upset about [effects on] Social Security, and national parks, and air traffic, and food safety, and cancer research, Alzheimer\'s research. Now that you\'ve had a chance to look at it, might there have been a different approach?""', 'Musk said, ""Yeah, I think … what was starting to happen was that, like, it\'s a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything. So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. I\'ve had people think that, like, somehow DOGE is gonna stop them from getting their Social Security check, which is completely untrue.""', 'I asked, ""I was just thinking about the, you know, \'move fast and break things,\' you know, before you really understand what the agency does?""', '""Yeah, I mean, I guess part of it is, like, is it depends on where you\'re coming from,"" Musk said. ""I\'m like a proponent of smaller government, not bigger government. So, now if somebody\'s a proponent of, you know, more government programs and bigger government, and they see, \'Hey, DOGE is cutting all these government programs,\' then they\'ll be fundamentally opposed to that because they just think the government should do more things. That\'s just a fundamental, I guess, ideological opinion. ', '""But my frank opinion of the government is that, like, the government is just, like, the DMV that got big, okay? So, when you say it like, \'Let\'s have the government do something,\' you should think, \'Do you want the DMV to do it?\'"" ', 'And then, Musk started talking about the Trump administration, without even being asked about Trump. ""And you know, it\'s not like I agree with everything the administration does,"" said Musk. ""So it\'s like, I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does. But we have differences of opinion. You know, there are things that I don\'t entirely agree with. But it\'s difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. So then, I\'m a little stuck in a bind, where I\'m like, well, I don\'t wanna, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don\'t wanna take responsibility for everything this administration\'s doing.""', ""In Washington, federal workers say that DOGE has left the government's operations in disarray. And worst of all, it might have all been for nothing. Musk claims to have saved the government $175 billion so far (nowhere close to his original target of $2 trillion, or even his revised target of $1 trillion)."", ""And that was before the president's new spending bill passed the House. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the president's proposed budget will add $3.8 trillion to our debt over the next ten years. It's now being debated in the Senate."", 'Musk said, ""I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, doesn\'t decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.""', 'I said, ""I actually thought that, when this \'big, beautiful bill\' came along, it\'d be like, everything he\'s done on DOGE gets wiped out in the first year.""', '""I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,"" Musk laughed. ""But I don\'t know if it could be both. My personal opinion.""', 'And here is where the story gets a little complicated.', ""On Tuesday, right after our interview, CBS News released a clip of it to promote this very report. It was that part, where Musk criticizes Trump's spending bill, and his remarks became news. It went all the way to the White House, where the president was asked about Musk's criticism of the bill. Within 24 hours, Musk announced that his time in the Trump administration was officially over. Out of DOGE, out of government."", 'Musk said that the reason was that his limited 130-day stint as advisor was ending. But until that moment, he\'d been saying that he still intended to work on DOGE part-time. ""Well, DOGE is gonna continue, just as a way of life,"" he told us. ""I will have some participation in that, but as I\'ve said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.""', ""Truth is, the Trump-Musk relationship had already seemed to be cooling. The president used to post about Musk about six times a week. But by April, he'd stopped mentioning Musk altogether. "", 'Still, on Friday, they held a media event at the White House to confirm their mutual admiration—and to leave the door open for future collaboration. ""Elon\'s really not leaving,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He\'s gonna be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.""', 'Musk added, ""The DOGE team is doing an incredible job. They\'re going to continue doing an incredible job, and I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to the president.""', 'Musk might be the first to admit that his DOGE experiment gave him a black eye—like the actual black eye he had on Friday, which he says he got from his five-year-old son … or the matching one on that statue.', 'At least for now, Musk says that his focus will be running his business ventures: Tesla, Starlink, X, xAI, Neuralink, Optimus robots, the Boring Company, and SpaceX. ', 'I asked, ""Are all of your businesses related in some way?"" ', '""I guess you can think of the businesses as things that improve the probable trajectory of civilization,"" Musk replied. ""So you know, for making life multi-planetary or extending life to Mars, the idea there is to ensure the long-term survival of life and consciousness as we know it.""', 'After our interview Tuesday, we were invited to witness the ninth launch of his Starship, the biggest rocket ever built. The two previous Starship tests ended in explosions – or, as SpaceX puts it, ""rapid unscheduled disassemblies."" So, all eyes were on Test Launch 9 to see if a Starship could return to Earth in one piece.', 'As Musk left our interview to watch the launch, he said something that could sum up all his enterprises: ""I can\'t guarantee success, but I can guarantee excitement.""', ""In the end, Elon Musk's giant rocket spun out of control. It did not survive re-entry."", '       \nFor more info:', '      \nStory produced by Dustin Stephens. Editor: Carol Ross.

"Republicans Big Mad At Elon Musk For Telling The Truth About 'Big, Beautiful Bill'",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elon-musk-big-beautiful-bill_n_683ddcdde4b08b77a460f49e,"['', '', 'Republicans are pushing back on criticism of their bill cutting taxes and Medicaid from an unexpected source: former White House adviser Elon Musk.', 'Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.) said Monday that Musk, who complained the bill increases the budget deficit, doesn’t know what he’s talking about.', '“I would disagree with Elon in the sense that he doesn’t understand how the tax bill works,” LaHood said on CNBC. “This is going to be rocket fuel for the economy.”', 'In fact, Musk understands the legislation perfectly well. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” calls for $4 trillion or more in tax cuts and increased spending but less than $2 trillion in spending cuts.', '“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said last week.', 'HuffPost is dedicated to holding lawmakers accountable and covering how their actions impact you, your community, and the country. Support journalism that demands transparency — join our membership program today.', 'As criticism, Musk’s statement was extremely mild. He didn’t say anything about how the legislation would cut benefits for poor people to finance tax cuts for the rich. He just made a factual observation that the numbers don’t match up.', 'Musk’s gripe burns because he was the man President Donald Trump appointed to head up the “Department of Government Efficiency,” an effort to reduce federal budget deficits by slashing spending. Republicans made Musk an avatar of fiscal responsibility, a cause they’ve championed for years, and now he’s called them out for abandoning their own core governing principle.', 'That’s why Republicans keep getting asked about Musk and why they insist he’s mistaken.', '“I sent a long text message to my good friend Elon Musk after he made those comments the other day to explain this is not a spending bill,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Sunday on “Meet the Press,” adding that he believed Musk and other critics are somehow “missing” the spending cuts in the bill.', 'A Congressional Budget Office analysis of the individual components of an earlier version of the legislation found about $1.6 trillion in spending cuts, about $3.8 trillion in tax cuts, and about $200 billion in spending increases for border security and the military. In total, the gap between the tax and spending cuts is around $2.3 trillion. (The CBO analysis did not account for the cost effects of interactions between the bill’s provisions and didn’t include last-minute changes to the bill; the office will put out a new analysis this week.)', 'Republicans make three main arguments to try to drown out complaints about the obvious deficit of the legislation. One argument is that the spending cuts, while not bigger than the tax cuts, are still really, really big.', '“There is no dispute that the bill cuts over $1.6 trillion in spending. It mainly accomplishes this through the largest welfare reform in history,” White House adviser Stephen Miller said in a social media post Sunday, referring to the bill’s cuts to federal health and food programs.', 'The more substantive GOP argument against the budget math is that the tax and spending cuts will boost business activity so much that federal tax receipts will rise in tandem.', '“The reason we call it the big, beautiful bill is because it is a tremendous pro-growth package entwined in this legislation that is going to make everybody’s incomes go up,” Johnson said. “There’s going to be more job opportunity, more opportunity to climb up that economic ladder in America, because job creators, entrepreneurs and risk takers will have the government off their backs, that will have lower taxes, and they will be expanding their businesses.”', 'Johnson and others have complained that the CBO’s long-term projections of economic growth are too low and that the CBO fails to account for the increased economic activity that will result from the tax cuts. But budget forecasters that do use so-called dynamic scoring don’t share Republicans’ optimism.', 'The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, found that the bill would increase deficits by $2.5 trillion on a conventional basis, and increased economic growth would only partially reduce its deficit. “On a dynamic basis, accounting for economic growth, the deficit would increase by $1.7 trillion over ten years before interest costs,” the group said in its analysis.', '(The Penn Wharton Budget Model found the bill’s economic effects would actually increase its cost, partly because higher-income households would work less as a result of the tax cuts.)', 'Another argument Republicans make against the budget experts is that they should not even have to count the cost of their tax cuts since the bulk of the cuts in their bill are merely an extension of cuts they enacted in 2017. Those cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, with higher marginal tax rates automatically snapping back.', '“As for the deficit, maintaining current tax rates by definition cannot add a penny to the deficit,” Miller said. “It doesn’t ‘cost’ the government anything to keep current rates in place.”', ""For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. Support our mission to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you."", '', '', '', '', 'Already contributed? Log in to hide these messages.', '', '', 'Republicans scheduled a December 2025 expiration of their tax cuts in 2017 in order to make them appear less expensive in the CBO forecasts back then. Now Miller and certain Senate Republicans are trying to have it both ways by saying the expiration wasn’t real, even as they pass legislation to make sure it doesn’t happen.', 'Musk, who lies prodigiously about other things, may have been more willing to tell the truth about the bill last week because he was leaving his role at the DOGE office in the White House, having fallen far short of an overly ambitious goal to save $2 trillion in spending. Now Republicans on Capitol Hill are passing legislation that does an even worse job of reducing deficits than Musk did.', 'FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING\nSINCE 2005', ""By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

""@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Have a nice day, DJT!"" ', 'Trump officials vowed to unveil more files related to the Epstein case when the administration took power.

This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.""', 'Musk also expressed support for a post that said Mr. Trump should be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance. ', 'The break between the president and the world\'s richest man originated over Musk\'s ongoing criticism of Republicans\' ""big, beautiful bill"" on Capitol Hill, which cuts taxes by trillions of dollars and implements Mr. Trump\'s domestic agenda, including cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. Musk has railed against the legislation as ""outrageous"" and ""a disgusting abomination."" The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Wednesday that the bill would lead to an increase of $2.4 trillion in total deficits over the next 10 years, a conclusion that Republicans and Mr. Trump dispute.', '""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday evening. ""The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""', ""The president was asked about Musk's criticism for the first time publicly during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office earlier Thursday."", '""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Mr. Trump told reporters.

The president claimed he ""never had a problem"" with the legislation until provisions dealing with electric vehicle subsidies were eliminated, threatening Tesla\'s business. The bill would roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, phasing out a tax break for clean energy vehicles.', '""I\'m very disappointed in Elon. I\'ve helped Elon a lot,"" Mr. Trump told reporters, adding that Musk ""worked hard"" and did a ""good job."" ', '""And I\'ll be honest, I think he misses the place,"" the president continued. ""He\'s not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don\'t know what it is. It\'s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it."" ', 'Appearing to respond to Mr. Trump\'s comments in real time, Musk wrote on X: ""Whatever. Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.""

SpaceX\'s Crew Dragon is used by NASA to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station.', ""The president's comments expressing disappointment with Musk were a swift about-face. Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump gifted Musk a key to the White House as an expression of gratitude for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
