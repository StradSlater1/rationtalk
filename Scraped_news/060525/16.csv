The civilian population of Gaza understands that Hamas is not taking care of them — on the contrary, Hamas is actively trying to prevent them from receiving the aid.""', 'Defrin said IDF forces ""operate nearby and do whatever is necessary to ensure that the aid does not fall into the hands of Hamas.""', ""He also accused the United Nations' aid agencies of failing to collect and distribute more than 450 trucks carrying humanitarian aid that Israel says were allowed into Gaza in recent days but left waiting on the other side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel. The U.N. has rejected similar previous Israeli claims, noting that Israeli forces maintain control over virtually all of Gaza and that there are huge logistics challenges to operating in a densely populated active warzone."", ""And the IDF's assault, which Israel has vowed to continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining 58 Israeli hostages are brought back home from Gaza, has continued to ramp up despite the U.S.-backed aid effort."", ""CBS News' team in Gaza was there as Palestinians rushed to rescue survivors of an Israeli strike that destroyed a bank in Gaza City where families had taken shelter. At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to first responders who spoke with CBS News at the scene.

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams joined the mass casualty response in Nasser hospital, Khan Younis. Patients told MSF they were shot from all sides by drones, helicopters, boats, tanks and Israeli soldiers on the ground. ', '“Today’s events have shown once again that this new system of aid delivery is dehumanising, dangerous and severely ineffective,” states Claire Manera, MSF emergency coordinator. “It has resulted in deaths and injuries of civilians that could have been prevented. Humanitarian aid must be provided only by humanitarian organisations who have the competence and determination to do it safely and effectively.”', 'MSF teams at Nasser hospital treated patients with serious injuries today. Some patients in critical condition are still undergoing surgery. But with the blood banks almost empty, medical staff themselves have had to donate blood.', '“The hospital corridors were filled with patients, but unlike what I have witnessed before, where most of the patients were women and children, today it was mainly men,” says Nour Alsaqa, MSF communications officer. “They lay in their beds in the hallways because the rooms are already packed with injured people. They had visible gunshot wounds in their limbs, and their clothes were soaked with blood.”', '“They looked shattered and distraught after trying to secure food for their children, returning instead injured and empty handed,” Alsaqa continues. “Outside, there was shouting, sirens, a constant rush of new arrivals to the emergency room.” ', '“Amid the chaos, we received confirmation that a colleague’s brother had been killed while attempting to collect aid from the distribution centre,” she adds. ', '”People fought over five pallets. They told us to take food—then they fired from every direction,” says Mansour Sami Abdi, a father of four, who described the chaos. ”I ran 200 metres before realising I’d been shot. This isn’t aid. It’s a lie. Are we supposed to go get food for our kids and die?”', '“I was shot at 3:10am. As we were trapped, I bled constantly until 5:00am,” says Mohammad Daghmeh, who is displaced in Al-Qarara, Khan Younis. “There were many other men with me. One of them tried to get me out. He was shot in the head and died on my chest. We had gone there for nothing but food — just to survive, like everyone else.” ', 'This is the second time this new system of aid distribution has led to bloodshed. On 27 May, the first afternoon of distribution in Rafah, Israeli forces shot dozens of people, as wholly insufficient amounts of basic lifesaving supplies were distributed amid chaos.', 'As a result of the total siege that was imposed by the Israeli authorities on 2 March, 100 per cent of Gaza is now at risk of famine, according to the United Nations. Since 19 May, the few hundred food trucks brought in – an insufficient fraction of what is needed – have spread despair among the more than 2 million people who have been largely deprived of food, water, and medication for three months now. Totally or partially blocking humanitarian aid to enter Gaza has aggravated the situation of all Gazans. ', 'MSF reinforces that, along with displacement orders and bombing campaigns that kill civilians, weaponising aid in this manner may constitute crimes against humanity. Only a lasting ceasefire and the immediate opening of Gaza’s borders for humanitarian aid – including food, medical supplies, fuel and equipment – can ease this man-made catastrophe.', 'Your donations pay for millions of consultations, surgeries, treatments and vaccinations every year.', '140, Route de Ferney, 1202 Geneva, Switzerland\nFederal identification number: UID CH-660.1.555.004-1']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUdla2wwWlhWUlVHMWpPVWRwVFJDWEF4aXlCU2dLTWdhUmdwWUlzZ2M=-w280-h168-p-df

Rather than being a humanitarian lifeline, they are killing fields.', 'On Tuesday, Israeli forces carried out yet another massacre near an aid distribution site in Rafah, killing 27 people and injuring 90. On Monday, 3 people were killed and dozens were wounded in nearly the exact same circumstances. This followed a massacre on Sunday in which 30 people were killed and 170 were wounded.', 'In its report, the Euro-Med Monitor stated that, “According to testimonies and information collected by Euro-Med Monitor’s field researchers, Israeli army snipers deliberately targeted starving civilians with direct gunfire, mostly to the head, despite no apparent threat to Israeli forces.”', 'One survivor told the monitor, “At around 3:50 a.m. today, an Israeli quadcopter flew over and photographed the civilian crowd. Then, the army opened fire from a crane in the area. I personally carried three people who had been shot in the head. Most of the injuries were to the head. People came looking for food to ease their hunger, but they went back dead or wounded.”', 'In another testimony, A. B., 38, told the Euro-Med Monitor team, “Around 5:45 a.m., we managed to enter the center, and I was able to get an aid package. On my way out, I met a woman in her 40s who said she couldn’t continue forward and that she and her children were suffering from hunger and poverty. I gave her my package and returned to try to get another one, but there was nothing left. A quadcopter was overhead, broadcasting insulting remarks: ‘You animals, go away, the supply is out.’”', 'He continued, “As I was leaving and nearing the chute’s exit, I saw a child crying out loudly, ‘Mom, get up, Mom, get up.’ I went closer and found the woman I had given my package to lying in a pool of blood. She was dead,” he said. “A group of young men and I carried her outside and placed her in an ambulance. I accompanied her son to the hospital. On the way, along the sea road, I saw seven bodies lying on the side of the road.”', 'Aid-seekers attempting to access food are forced to wait in long lines before being subjected to facial recognition scans. The testimony presented by the Euro-Med Monitor could indicate that the ongoing massacres are not random killing sprees, but that the facial recognition scans are being used for targeted assassinations at the aid distribution sites.', 'On Wednesday, the United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza – the fifth time it has done so. Fourteen other members of the Security Council voted for the ceasefire, which called the humanitarian situation in Gaza “catastrophic” and called for the lifting of restrictions on food aid.', '“Israel has a right to defend itself, which includes defeating Hamas and ensuring they are never again in a position to threaten Israel,” said U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Sheato. “In this regard, any product that undermines our close ally Israel’s security is a non-starter.”', 'Sheato openly endorsed the so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,” declaring, “We instead urge the UN and NGOs to support the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to help it safely deliver aid without being diverted by Hamas.” In an open embrace of the massacres as the GHF aid centers, she said the foundation is delivering aid “consistent with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.”', 'The US vetoed a similarly worded UN Security Council resolution under the Biden administration, using essentially the same rationalization.', 'Riyad Monsour, Palestine’s representative to the UN, told the Security Council, “the engineered starvation that has brought an entire civilian population, 2 million people, among them 1 million children, to the edge of famine and then used aid to lure them and confine them to an extremely limited area of the Gaza Strip, clearly to facilitate their expulsion and annexation.”', 'Last week, Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian office, told reporters in a briefing that “One hundred percent of the population is at risk of famine,” and that Gaza is the “hungriest place on earth.”', 'He added that Israel’s ongoing blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza has made the UN’s efforts to feed the population “one of the most obstructed aid operations, not only in the world today but in recent history.”', 'On Wednesday, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said in a statement that he is “shocked” by the extent of malnutrition in Gaza, saying, “I’m seeing teenage boys in tears, showing me their ribs.”', 'He condemned Israel’s daily massacres of aid-seekers, saying, “Imagine knowing there’d be a massacre, but being so desperate to feed your family that you still go.”', 'Gaza’s health ministry said Wednesday that 95 Palestinians had been killed in the last 24-hour period and that 440 had been injured.

An additional 500 are wounded. Following the series of deadly attacks, the shadowy U.S.-Israeli humanitarian aid operation is shutting down for a day, and Israel’s military warned Palestinians that roads leading to the aid distribution centers will be considered “combat zones.” The United Nations has called for a prompt and impartial investigation into each of the attacks. The U.S.-Israeli aid system is “more about the humiliation and the control of the people” than feeding Palestinians, says Mahmoud Alsaqqa, Oxfam’s food security and livelihoods coordinator in Gaza, who joins us from Gaza City.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks over the past day have killed at least 95 Palestinians and injured 440 others. At least 18 of the dead are in Khan Younis following an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians.', 'Meanwhile, the new shadowy U.S.-, Israeli-backed aid operation has suspended aid distribution for a day to address what it called, quote, “renovation, reorganization and efficiency improvement work,” unquote. This comes after Palestinian officials accused Israel of repeatedly attacking Palestinians headed to the aid sites. The attacks killed 102 people, left nearly 500 others wounded.', 'The dead included a mother named Reem Zaidan, who was shot while waiting for aid in western Rafah. On Tuesday, her children and other mourners gathered for her funeral procession in Khan Younis. This is Reem Zaidan’s 16-year-old daughter Tahrir.', 'TAHRIR ZAIDAN: [translated] In the highest paradise, mom — we’ll see her in the highest paradise, God willing. … She put on her abaya and veil, took a sack of flour and a bag with her, hoping to fill them with canned food. For five days, she’s been going for nothing.', 'AMY GOODMAN: And this is Reem Zaidan’s 15-year-old son Ahmed describing how his mother was fatally shot while trying to get aid.', 'AHMED ZAIDAN: [translated] We haven’t eaten in two months. Everything has been under siege. Of course, we were going to go get aid. Today, my mother was telling my brother, “Lean over. Lower your head. Do what I’m doing.” My brother turned his head. Then a bullet went into her head.', 'AMY GOODMAN: We go now to Gaza City, where we’re joined by Mahmoud Alsaqqa, the Oxfam food security and livelihoods coordinator in Gaza.', 'Welcome back to Democracy Now! In a moment, we’re going to be going to the ship that’s trying to make its way to challenge Israel’s blockade of Gaza. We’ll be speaking with the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. But can you, Mahmoud, tell us what’s happening on the ground and the latest with this closing of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation set up by Israel, backed by the U.S., that took over the, what, three or four sites — it built them — instead of the 400 that were on the ground around Gaza?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for having me again.', 'In fact, the situation on the ground is extremely chaotic. And it’s as we have warned before about this, especially with this aid distribution mechanism. In fact, what is happening in these new militarized distribution points, it’s more about the humiliation and the control of the people. We are seeing the people — thousands of people are standing from the early hours in the morning to secure something to their starving children. And in such cases, it’s rare even to get actually the supplies. And now they are facing the issue of returning home alive. So, we are considering these points as death traps, and we are seeing shooting of starving people near to these sites, especially what’s happened in Rafah, as per your reporting, deaths. It’s horrifying, and many people have lost their lives in these sites.', 'So, these sites are controlled by private actors. It’s located in military zones, in military conflict areas. So, they didn’t even consider any things related to that, to the human beings and dignity. And what was exposed — expected to have from these sites is contradicts again and nothing achieved in terms of addressing the high and the overwhelming needs of the people here in Gaza.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mahmoud, the other organizations, aid organizations, that have been on the ground since this conflict began, has the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had any kind of communication or coordination with the existing groups?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: No, no. You know, our position from the first, that we were against such a mechanism, because we have the system in place. We have the system of the U.N. and the international NGOs that exist in place and which has proven its effectiveness since the 19 months, and even the improvement was noticed during the ceasefire period, where we were able to reach more and more vulnerable people. And this is vulnerable people who are not accessing even this distribution — the new GHO distribution points. And we have this multisectoral assistance. What we are having now in these distribution points is just food, and the people in need for a multisectoral assistance that we were even and we were trying to provide, this including the medical supplies, the clean water, shelter materials and all these things. And these things are now ignored within this mechanism. And we are trying all the time to abide to the international humanitarian law and to preserving the dignity of those people, which is — this mechanism strips the people of dignity, and this is why we are seeing all this humiliation of the people.', 'In summary, this mechanism is dehumanizing the people, and it’s really dangerous. People are losing their lives there. And it’s ineffective in reaching the people, especially the vulnerable people. And we have our mechanism in place and active, so there’s no need even for this mechanism at all.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And is Israel allowing any supplies in for the existing mechanism of aid groups in Gaza?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: Yeah, as you know, after the international community pressure on Israel after 12 weeks of a full blockade, on the 21st of March, they allowed a trickle of aid to come in. But it still have this over control on this aid that are coming, and it’s very limited quantities that are coming. And even it’s limited for food supplies and some nutrition items, where the need is much more than this. On average, what we are receiving in Gaza Strip right now in this mechanism is around 50 trucks, 60 trucks, or even less, more. But it’s nothing compared to what we should have, and it’s not addressing the huge needs of the people here in the Gaza Strip.', 'So, even with these mechanisms, we are still seeing this happening, and the people are starving. And this is the question, that: Where is the problem? The problem is with this mechanism, is that it’s not efficient or effective. We need to have a smooth supply of the aid in order to be able to provide the services. And we succeeded in doing so in a previous period of time.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, the U.N. Children’s Fund, UNICEF, has reported that the number of Gaza’s children killed or injured by Israel since October 2023 has surpassed 50,000. In a statement, UNICEF wrote, “How many more dead girls and boys will it take? What level of horror must be livestreamed before the international community fully steps up, uses its influence, and takes bold, decisive action to force the end of this ruthless killing of children?” As we speak, people in London are forming a red line. They’re holding red banners fully around the British Parliament. While Britain and France and Canada have said they’re going to crack down on relations with Israel, these people are demanding that they stop arming Israel. Can you talk about what’s happening with the children on the ground at this point?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: Yeah, the situation is deteriorating over time, especially with the vulnerable groups, including the children, you know? And according to the last food security and nutrition report, that we are expecting more worsening in the health of children, who are more affected by this shortages of all supplies in the Gaza Strip. And this is increasing, because we are seeing more displacement orders are in place, more intensifying of the military operations, and more displacement for the people to crowded people, so — to crowded places, so we are seeing the outbreak of diseases. And the health from — the health, public health, is deteriorating, and the health sector is collapsing, so we are expecting worse for the vulnerable groups, including the children.', 'So, this is why we have to save lives. We must go back to our work, reopening all the crossings, and lift the movement and the fuel restrictions for the people. And what we are seeing around the world nowadays, it’s really important and should be continued in order to hold Israel accountable to their — what they are doing right now, and also to reach this permanent ceasefire. Nowadays we are talking about permanent ceasefire, when we do not need a proposal to have such a few days and return back to the same area. We need a permanent ceasefire, so the people can breathe again and at least to have — to be able to recover from all these things that they are encountering and facing right now.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Alsaqqa, I want to thank you so much for being with us, Oxfam’s food security and livelihoods coordinator, speaking to us from Gaza.', 'When we come back, we go to the high seas to Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who’s attempting to sail to Gaza with about a dozen other people on a humanitarian aid boat organized by the Freedom Flotilla.

EJIL:Talk!,https://www.ejiltalk.org/privatizing-aid-the-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-affair/,"['', '', 'Israel and its allies have introduced quite a number of legal and political configurations over the past 19 months that even the most creative Jessup moot court problem writers would not dare to imagine. One such staggering development was the announcement of a new plan to replace the United Nations (UN) agencies that were vital in the provision of humanitarian aid in Gaza. The UN is to be replaced not by an alternative international organization or a state-run program but by a private foundation – the “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation” (GHF) – that will execute its aid program together with the private security firm, “Safe Reach Solutions”. The daunting question now is: on what basis is outsourcing core humanitarian functions to private actors legally or ethically defensible? Before turning to a few legal reasons why this model is deeply problematic, here is what we know so far about GHF and its operational plans.', 'The mystery of the GHF', 'The GHF was established in February 2025, around the time when Israeli legislation was passed seeking to bar UNRWA from operating in the occupied Palestinian territories. The GHF is registered as a nonprofit organization both in the US and Switzerland and is envisioned as a privately administered vehicle to deliver aid into Gaza without the involvement of international humanitarian organizations traditionally active in such settings. The Foundation will be partnered with a private security firm owned by Philip F. Reilly, a former senior CIA officer, to oversee logistics and access routes. Many might argue that the method of aid delivery is secondary, so long as those starving receive food and water. However, there are serious legal and ethical concerns surrounding this particular arrangement.', 'Under this new plan, initially, four aid distribution sites located in southern Gaza will be established, and to reach them, Gazans will have to walk across the Israeli military line. This will inevitably concentrate aid in a few fixed points, which will endanger civilians as they have to cross militarized zones on foot and will likely provoke permanent forced displacement from northern Gaza, paving the way for Israel’s settlements and annexation plan. There is no transparency about who will oversee the work of the Foundation, how decisions on aid distribution will be made, or what principles, if any, will guide its operation.', 'It is similarly unknown who funds the enormously expensive GHF’s mandate of feeding more than a million people and hiring thousands of security guards, with Israel claiming not to fund this mission. What is clear, though, is that the move reflects a deep political desire to dismantle the existing humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza, and replace it with a framework controlled by actors more palatable to Israel and its allies. The coalition of aid and human rights NGOs described the GHF as “a project led by politically connected Western security and military figures, coordinated in tandem with the Israeli government, and launched while the people of Gaza remain under total siege. It lacks any Palestinian involvement in its design or implementation.” So, whether this constitutes a “humanitarian innovation” or an erosion of international legal obligations of an occupying power depends on where one stands. But legally, the warning signs are flashing red.', 'Which wrong? Whose conduct?', 'So what happens to international humanitarian law when humanitarian aid is no longer coordinated by impartial international organizations but handed over to private foundations and security companies? The GHF is not simply another NGO. Unlike the International Committee of the Red Cross, which derives its mandate directly from the Geneva Conventions and longstanding state recognition, or UN agencies with intergovernmental oversight, the GHF is a domestically incorporated private entity with no international legal status, no treaty-based mandate, and most importantly, it operates without the institutional safeguards of neutrality, independence, and impartiality that are foundational to international humanitarian action.', 'IHL assumes that relief actions are carried out either by states or by impartial humanitarian organizations accepted by the parties to the conflict (Common Article 3, AP I, Article 70, GC IV Articles 59 and 60). In Gaza, however, we are witnessing the construction of an aid model that appears deliberately designed to sideline these principles. Even the former executive director of GHF, who resigned one day before the operations were about to start, stated that the decision to resign is motivated by the inability of the GHF to adhere to “the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence […].” And this should all be viewed in the context of the systematic denial of access to neutral humanitarian actors, which contributes to the war crime of starvation (AP I Article 54 and Article 8(2)(b)(xxv) of the Rome Statute). Thus, replacing a neutral, multilateral aid framework with a politically affiliated, privately-run mechanism, funded by actors with close ties to the occupying power, risks breaching Israel’s obligations under the Geneva Conventions, not only in terms of facilitating humanitarian relief, but in ensuring it is delivered according to humanitarian law.', 'Let’s also not forget about the hired private security company (PSC) in all this unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. The involvement of such actors in the provision of humanitarian aid in the disastrous conditions of Gaza introduces a for-profit, security-first logic into what should be a rights-based humanitarian operation. Moreover, in Gaza, where access to aid has already been severely restricted and plans for its annexation outlined, the PSC’s presence may facilitate serious violations of international law. Reports have emerged of fatal shootings at aid distribution points (though it remains unclear whether fire was opened by Israeli forces or the PSC). Besides, the strategic location of distribution points raises concerns about the forcible transfer or displacement of civilians (GC IV Article 49). TRIAL International has already submitted legal filings in Switzerland, urging authorities to investigate whether GHF’s and its partner’s activities violate Swiss and international law, especially in light of evidence that this new aid model could serve Israel’s goal of depopulating northern Gaza.', 'This whole GHF story is not a matter of ideological disagreement about how best to deliver aid – it is a matter of law. When aid is distributed in a way that serves military objectives, bypasses neutral channels, and limits access for segments of the civilian population, we are no longer dealing with humanitarian relief as defined under IHL. We are witnessing a political project disguised as aid. But the question remains: who bears legal responsibility – Israel, the GHF, or both?', 'Outsourcing and privatization under international law', 'Privatization of public functions is by now a familiar story. States outsource, delegate, and partner with private actors across all sectors. International law mostly looked the other way, content with reaffirming that state obligations under human rights and humanitarian law remain intact, even when the state disappears behind a contractual veil. In other words, outsourcing does not always mean illegal offloading of obligations and responsibilities. But the GHF’s involvement in Gaza is not just another case of a state retreating from service provision. It is a troubling example of a governmental function, i.e., the facilitation of humanitarian relief in occupied territory, being repackaged as a private humanitarian venture with geopolitical and military implications.', 'What is at stake here is not simply the legality of letting private actors into the aid space. It is the transformation of a legal obligation under international humanitarian law into a privatized, discretionary act. As discussed above, Israel, as the occupying power, is bound by the Fourth Geneva Convention. It must ensure the provision of essentials for the civilian population and must facilitate relief schemes by impartial humanitarian organizations. It does not get to pick and choose which civilians deserve aid, or which actors it deems politically palatable.', 'International law scholars have long debated whether privatization modifies the nature of state obligations. The usual answer is no, but it does complicate how these obligations are met and enforced. As the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made clear, states must regulate and monitor private service providers, and they remain responsible for ensuring services remain accessible, adequate, and rights-compliant. But what happens when privatization is not just about logistics or efficiency, but is intentionally used to bypass the scrutiny, neutrality, and access requirements that public providers like the UN agencies would otherwise ensure?', 'The previous section outlined potential violations of international law by both Israel and the GHF and co, but nobody has offered us a framework for responsibility – neither Israel, nor US and Switzerland, where the GHF is registered, nor its secret funders. In the absence of the answers, we should turn to the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA). Under Article 5, conduct by a private entity exercising elements of governmental authority may be attributable to the state when the entity is empowered by the law of that state to exercise such authority. The GHF or the PSCs perform functions that are typically the prerogative of the state, e.g., controlling access to humanitarian aid, securing the access points. Even if Israel claims not to be involved in the operations of the GHF, as it is supposed to be neutral, attribution may still arise under Article 8 ARSIWA where a state exercises “effective control” over the actor’s conduct. We will have to closely monitor the situation to see if Israel indeed directs or closely coordinates GHF’s operations by selecting its operational zones, approving its personnel, or vetting beneficiaries but it is hard to imagine that the GHF’s presence in Gaza is possible without that.', 'Furthermore, Israel’s obligations under IHL, as discussed above, require that humanitarian relief be facilitated impartially and without discrimination. Delegating this responsibility to a politically affiliated private actor, lacking impartiality and transparency, arguably undermines these duties. Even if the acts of the GHF or PSCs are hard to attribute to Israel, Israel may still bear responsibility for violating its own obligations by outsourcing aid in a manner incompatible with international law. Thus, privatization, in this context, is not a shield from legal responsibility; it is a potential modality of wrongful conduct.                                     ', 'The GHF or nothing at all?', 'The question is not whether starving people should receive aid from GHF or be left to die. That binary is itself the product manufactured by Israel famine and dire humanitarian crisis, in which existing rights-based aid infrastructures were deliberately obstructed. They were not originally absent. As UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the Security Council, the GHF plan “makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”', 'Framing GHF as the only viable option for delivering aid in Gaza erases both the illegality of the blockade and the deliberate sidelining of international humanitarian operations. It also obscures a deeper shift: the erosion of legal obligation through privatization. The GHF may be formally incorporated, but it operates under the patronage of the occupying power and without the impartiality, transparency, or oversight that international law demands. Replacing UN agencies with a private foundation and a private security firm further signals the political reframing of Gaza as a site outside the normal rules of international law – treated not as an international issue governed by law-bound institutions, but as a domestic, manageable problem. We are witnessing the emergence of ‘privatized humanitarianism’ as a political project that reframes humanitarian relief not as a legal obligation flowing from international law, but as a matter of discretionary benevolence delivered by private actors.', 'The danger is not only that private actors fill the vacuum, but that they are used to create it. What is being dismantled is not just aid delivery, but the very legal architecture meant to constrain wartime power and protect civilian life. The international community must resist legitimizing this model. The solution is not to invent new privatized techniques for dealing with man-made famine. It is to confront and stop the conditions producing it: the blockade, the denial of humanitarian access, and the instrumentalization of aid as a weapon.', '', 'Your comment will be revised by the site if needed.', 'Harry Melkman says', 'June 4, 2025', '', 'Well composed to get high credentials, though.\nOverlooking the sheer fact of the Hamas factor that is deliberaterly abusing any International Humanitarian law to help destroy Israel.\nI.e quite unbalanced overview.', '', 'Julia Emtseva is currently a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute.

"Who’s shooting whom near Rafah’s aid center, and who’s exploiting the bloodshed",https://www.timesofisrael.com/whos-shooting-whom-near-rafahs-aid-center-and-whos-exploiting-the-bloodshed/,"['ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 609', '', 'This Editor’s Note was sent out earlier Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.', 'On three successive days this week, Hamas alleged that Israeli troops opened fire at and near the newly established US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid distribution center in Rafah.', 'On Sunday, the terror group charged that 31 Gazans were killed by Israel, on Monday that the death toll was 3, and on Tuesday that 27 were killed. The way Hamas depicted it, and much of the world reported it, Israel was brutally gunning down Gaza civilians who were desperately seeking access to vital food supplies.', 'The International Committee of the Red Cross, a relatively credible source of medical information, said its field hospital in Rafah handled a mass casualty influx of 179 cases on Sunday, most of whom had gunshot and shrapnel wounds, and 21 were declared dead on arrival. All patients, it noted, said they had been trying to reach the aid site. On Tuesday, the ICRC reported another mass casualty incident, of 184 patients, 19 of whom were dead on arrival and another eight of whom died soon after. It does not appear to have issued a separate announcement on Monday, but its Tuesday statement referred to four mass casualty incidents in the previous 96 hours. Unlike Hamas, the Red Cross statements did not issue allegations of responsibility for the deaths and injuries.', 'The Israel Defense Forces has said it fired what it described as warning shots in the area of the aid center — about a kilometer away on Sunday and Monday, it said, and 500 meters away on Tuesday. It has acknowledged that its fire hit an unspecified number of people, but has not acknowledged killing anybody.', 'At a Tuesday evening televised press conference, IDF Spokesman Effie Defrin said Hamas’s figures were “exaggerated.” Relating to Tuesday’s incident, Defrin said “warning shots were fired” at suspects “who posed a threat to our forces, far from where they were supposed to be.” The shots were aimed so as “not to hit anyone,” he said.', 'Trying to pierce the fog of war and make sense of conflicting unverifiable claims has been spectacularly difficult ever since Hamas triggered almost 20 months of conflict with its unprovoked invasion of Israel, from territory it fully controlled, slaughtered 1,200 people for the crime of living in Israel, and abducted 251, of whom it still holds 57 captive.', '', 'Hamas had spent years turning Gaza into a terror state, its war machine deliberately constructed to utilize Gaza’s civilians as cover — their homes booby-trapped, mosques used as missile and arms depots, schools repurposed as command centers and tunnel access points, hospitals abused as hideouts with Hamas chiefs seeking to evade capture in warrens beneath them. For 20 months, Hamas has worked assiduously to misrepresent Israel as a capricious aggressor viciously targeting the Gazans that the terror chiefs have carefully ensured would find themselves in harm’s way.', 'Its depiction of Israeli forces cynically killing Gazans desperately seeking food this week has been one of its many tragic successes on this second battlefield — the war for global public, diplomatic and legal legitimacy and support. It’s a battlefield on which official Israel has for decades simply declined to deploy — refusing to allocate resources, to hire and train skilled personnel, to formulate a strategic approach — but never with such dire and abiding consequences as since October 7, 2023.', 'It is not definitively clear who killed the 61 Gazans Hamas alleges were shot this week at and near the Rafah aid center. It is not definitively clear that 61 Gazans were killed at all. It is not definitively clear who they were. Noncombatant men, women and children? Hamas and other gunmen killed in that area or elsewhere? Victims of Hamas gunfire? (It has been reported that Hamas has set up checkpoints and tried to stop Gazans from reaching aid centers. And the IDF on Sunday published footage it said showed gunmen opening fire at Gazans seeking to collect looted humanitarian aid in Khan Younis.)', 'It should be manifestly clear, however, that Israel has no interest in deliberately gunning down Gaza noncombatants approaching an aid center set up with Israel and American backing. Hamas, by contrast, has every interest in seeking to doom the aid project, which threatens its hold on Gaza aid, and constitutes an alternative to the trucks of supplies it has routinely commandeered, and either used for its forces or sold off to helpless Gazans to finance its efforts to recruit and revive. The trouble is that Israel does not maintain the mechanisms necessary to make very much at all manifestly clear.', 'Defrin, new to the post from which his broadly effective predecessor Daniel Hagari was essentially removed, defended the IDF’s failure to respond in anything close to real time to the daily global-headline-making Hamas-led allegations of Israeli mass murder by stressing that the IDF needs to investigate extensively before issuing specific responses to immensely sensitive accusations. The IDF has indeed lost credibility with hurried responses it was subsequently forced to correct regarding incidents such as the March killing of medics in a convoy in southern Gaza.', 'An effective civilian public diplomacy mechanism, however, would at least be capable of immediately explaining the context in which allegation and counter-allegation are hurled. Except that Israel refuses to properly task and staff such a hierarchy. According to the former head of the Public Diplomacy Directorate at the Prime Minister’s Office, Gadi Ezra, who left the post when the current government took office, the cabinet has not held a single meeting to discuss its public diplomacy strategy. Hundreds of millions of shekels were recently allocated to the Foreign Ministry for some kind of media room; it does not provide any kind of real-time response to unfolding events.', 'Official Israeli defeatism — and that’s what it is, defeatism — in the battle for world opinion is unforgivable. Competent public diplomacy would not shift the needle from one side to the other. It would nudge it a little, however, and give those who are minded to delve into the cause and effect of this conflict a basis for doing so.', 'Global judgments of right and wrong, aggressor and victim, however, are also affected by the declared policy governing the conduct of the war.', 'The IDF has stated that it is seeking to raise its hold on Gaza to 75% in the next few weeks, and push Gazans into limited largely coastal areas in the south, center and north of the Strip. But the IDF’s Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir has also said that it seeks to keep the war as short as possible in attaining victory — which he defined last week as returning the hostages, defeating Hamas and dismantling its rule. This is “not an endless war,” he insisted.', 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, says the war will not end until US President Donald Trump’s vision for the relocation of all Gazans is carried out. And far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir are avowedly bent on Israel permanently reoccupying and resettling a Gaza emptied of its Palestinian populace.', 'An initial IDF probe into Tuesday’s shootings reportedly has found that Palestinians heading to the aid center “got lost” en route to the distribution point, approached IDF soldiers, and were fired on when they failed to retreat. Other indications, some of which have been confirmed in military briefings, are that troops fired this week at what the IDF has called “suspects” who headed to the center before it was open and/or approached it from outside the designated safe route. Gaza, of course, is a war zone, and the IDF is charged with the highly complex task of protecting the aid distribution centers from deadly Hamas attack, protecting the intended aid recipients from Hamas, and ensuring the safety of its own troops — four of whom have been killed by Hamas elsewhere in the strip this week.', 'The fog of this particular juncture of the war would be cleared a little were the IDF to enable access for independent reporters to the new aid operation. But, as throughout this conflict, the IDF thinks it has more to lose via the risk of local or international war reporters getting killed or injured in Gaza than it has to gain from enabling independent reporting there.', 'Declining to provide access, failing to provide detailed real-time information and context on fast-changing and deadly events, and with its inadequate responses undermined by its own ministers’ radical policy goals for Gaza, Israel is failing itself and its would-be supporters on the second battlefield even as it continues to struggle to eliminate the Hamas threat on the first.', 'On Wednesday, the Gaza Humanitarian Federation suspended its operations for the day, to enable a logistical overhaul that aims to ensure it can handle the larger-than-expected crowds and coordinate more effective security procedures with the IDF — essentially to prevent the recurrence of whatever exactly has been happening this week. Hopefully, the one-day pause will enable an effective reset.', 'It will take a lot more than a day to resuscitate Israel’s public diplomacy, however, and there remains absolutely no sign that the government intends to embark on any such effort.', 'And worst of all, in this terrible, Hamas-sparked war, Israel’s cause and legitimacy are continually and deeply harmed by the empty-and-occupy Gaza goals of two coalition parties whose agenda dominates government policy.', '', '', '', 'We’re really pleased that you’ve read 7 Times of Israel articles in the past month.', 'You clearly find our careful reporting valuable, during an ongoing war when facts are often distorted and news coverage of Israel often lacks context.', 'Your support is essential to continue our work.

"‘Death and hunger’: Videos, expert analysis and witnesses point to Israeli gunfire in Gaza aid site shooting",https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/middleeast/israel-military-gaza-aid-shooting-intl-invs,"['Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic images and descriptions of violence.', 'A CNN investigation into a deadly incident near an aid distribution site in southern Gaza on Sunday points to the Israeli military opening fire on crowds of Palestinians as they tried to make their way to the fenced enclosure to get food.', 'More than a dozen eyewitnesses, including those wounded in the attack, said Israeli troops shot at crowds in volleys of gunfire that occurred sporadically through the early hours of Sunday morning. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US and Israeli-backed aid initiative that runs the site, said that Israeli forces were operating in the area during the same period.', 'Multiple videos geolocated by CNN place the gunfire near a roundabout where hundreds of Palestinians had gathered about half a mile (800 meters) away from the militarized aid site in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah. The designated route to the site along the coast, Al-Rasheed Street, is in an area under the Israeli military’s control and Israeli troops operate at a base nearby.', 'Weapons experts said the rate of gunfire heard in the footage, as well as images of bullets retrieved from victims, were consistent with machine guns used by the Israeli military that can be mounted on tanks. Multiple eyewitnesses said that they saw gunfire emanating from Israeli tanks nearby.', 'None of the videos definitively show who fired shots outside of the aid camp. However, CNN’s review of audiovisual material sheds fresh light on how the pursuit of aid turned chaotic and then dangerous, on the actions of Israeli forces and the consequences of the new aid mechanism, which has been mired in controversy.', 'The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially said on Sunday that its forces did not fire at civilians “while they were near or within the aid site.” An Israeli military source later acknowledged that troops had fired “warning shots” at suspects about 1 kilometer (1,093 yards) away.', 'The Israeli military declined to answer questions about CNN’s findings.', 'During a press conference on Tuesday, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said the military investigated and found its troops played no role in any mass casualty event. Defrin said: “This week, it was claimed that the IDF fired at civilians in an aid distribution area. This report is entirely false and echoes the propaganda of the terrorist organization Hamas… Regarding the incident on Sunday – it simply didn’t happen!”', 'Defrin also suggested casualty figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry were inflated, but did not elaborate as to how many people the military believed had been killed or injured.', 'Sunday’s mass shooting, which the Palestinian health ministry said killed at least 31 Palestinians and injured dozens, was the deadliest incident involving aid distribution in recent months. It comes amid warnings from the United Nations that the new aid distribution mechanism has become a “death trap” for desperate people seeking food in the strip.', 'Thousands of starving Palestinians had gathered in the sandy bulldozed area near the GHF-run site before the gates opened on Sunday, braving chaotic scenes when gunfire struck the crowd.', '“No one move, stay in your place… no one move!” one Palestinian man is heard yelling in a series of videos posted to TikTok on Sunday, filmed along the coast where crowds had gathered near the aid site.', 'The videos – reviewed and geolocated by CNN – capture Palestinians taking cover amid repeated bursts of gunfire, and what appear to be two explosive munitions seen landing next to the crowd.', 'Mohammed Saqer, 43, told CNN in an interview that he only narrowly escaped death, watching people around him get shot in the head as he crouched on the ground, hoping to survive long enough to reach the site run by GHF and get food for his family.', 'After the US-backed private foundation finally opened the site at 5:00 a.m., witnesses said the Israeli military’s gunfire continued nearby. Surveillance footage shared by GHF shows crowds of onrushing Palestinians scrambling to reach the limited boxes of food as tracer fire explodes into the night sky in the distance.', 'By sunrise, the extent of the catastrophe was undeniable. Videos captured bloodied bodies of Palestinians scattered across the sands, roughly a half mile from the food distribution center.', 'Similar deadly incidents on Monday and Tuesday near the same site have raised further questions about whether the militarized aid initiative backed by the US and approved by Israel can deliver food supplies safely. In the subsequent episodes, the IDF acknowledged that Israeli troops had fired warning shots in the area. GHF said none of the shootings occurred within or adjacent to their distribution sites, adding that the location of the shootings was “an area well beyond our secure distribution site.”', 'For Saqer, who said he managed to finally reach the aid site and escaped with whatever he could carry, the harrowing night still weighs heavily on him.', '“We survived a night that was worse than we could imagine,” he said. “The reality for people was one of death and hunger searching for food.”', 'When GHF announced its distribution plans for Sunday, the instructions were direct: only one aid site would be open starting at 5:00 a.m., and the IDF would be present in the area to secure passage on a designated route.', 'It also warned – albeit after gunfire reportedly already erupted – that the Israeli military would be “active” in the area ahead of the site’s opening.', '“Using the passage before 5:00 a.m. is prohibited, as we were informed by the military that it will be active in the area before and after the specified safe hours,” the GHF said in a release on Facebook at 4 a.m. “We remind all residents to stay on the road — straying from it poses a significant danger.”', 'Having endured an 11-week Israeli blockade of humanitarian aid, thousands of desperate Palestinians began making their way down Al-Rasheed Street in hopes of being among the first to reach the aid site – the only one operating in all of Gaza that day – before the limited supplies ran out.', 'As people attempted to slowly advance to the aid site from the Al-Alam roundabout, more than a dozen witnesses interviewed by CNN described the IDF opening volleys of intense fire on the crowd starting as early as 3:30 a.m.', '“I could hear the screams of young people and others from their injuries,” Saqer said. “In front of me were four young men with direct injuries to the head… there was a person next to me who was injured by a bullet in his eye.”', 'He and others said a quadcopter drone appeared above the crowd, with the voice on its speaker telling people to turn around. But amid the warning, gunfire crackled all around them.', '“Even retreating was almost impossible, and everyone was lying on the ground unable to lift their heads because if you lifted your head, you would get shot.”', 'As the chaos unfolded near the Al-Alam area, the GHF aid site officially opened at 5:00 a.m. Security video of the location released by the organization, which was labeled as beginning at 5:02 a.m., shows crowds of Palestinians running into the fenced distribution center.', 'Three minutes later, in the background of the video, bursts of tracer gunfire are seen overhead, which forensics experts told CNN appear to be outgoing from an area near the distribution site. In the video, which has no audio, crowds can be seen running in another direction nearby. It is unclear whether they are running from gunfire.', 'Around the same time back in the Al-Alam area approximately 800 meters (874 yards) away, 30-year-old Ameen Khalifa was filming as he took cover. Several videos shared on TikTok by Khalifa show groups of Palestinians lying flat on the ground and taking cover from ongoing bursts of automatic gunfire. CNN geolocated the video to the area using visible spotlights at the Egyptian border and the unfinished hospital that became an Israeli military base.', 'Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined the footage for CNN and said that the bursts of gunfire were at a rate of 15 and 16 shots per second (or 900 and 960 per minute), fired from a distance of about a quarter of a mile (450 meters).', 'Based on the erratic nature of the sound, Maher said that the shots seemed to be spread out, fired repeatedly in one direction. “Since the cracks are irregular, it seems more like the gunfire was being sprayed over the area.”', 'Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, said the rate of fire was consistent with the FN MAG, a heavily-used machine gun in the Israeli military’s arsenal. The FN MAG is commonly equipped on the IDF’s Merkava tanks, which several eyewitnesses said they saw open fire on the crowds.', 'Ball told CNN he could not confirm the specific weaponry used, or who fired it, but the rate of fire, he said, indicated it wasn’t consistent with machine guns used by Hamas.', 'Ball also said the tracer fire – ammunition containing a pyrotechnic charge illuminating its trajectory – seen in the GHF’s footage is consistent with the use of machine guns. “Typically belt fed machine guns have tracer rounds inserted every few rounds. So while only 3 tracers are visible in the video, more rounds were fired.”', 'Khalifa, who loved sports and bodybuilding, survived the harrowing night on Sunday only to be shot and killed by a drone two days later while heading to the same aid site to look for food, one of his close friends told CNN.', 'By daylight, video footage reviewed by CNN captured the dire scene near the coast, with several bodies strewn in the sand. The Palestinian health ministry said that more than 200 casualties reached hospitals, including dozens with serious injuries. It added that all of those killed had been shot in the head or chest.', 'The International Committee of the Red Cross said that its nearby field hospital was overwhelmed by patients, describing the carnage as the “highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident” since it opened over a year ago. Other dead and wounded were taken to Nasser Hospital.', '“It’s difficult to describe what we saw with the young and the old, there was severe injuries to the head, severe injuries to the lung,” recalled Dr. Ahmad Abou-Sweid, an Australian working at the Nasser medical complex.', '“There was a heavy proportion of head-targeted injuries from bullet wounds.”', 'Doctors working at Nasser Hospital shared photos with CNN of the bullets retrieved from patients injured and killed in the attack, which weapons experts say appear to match the type of ammunition used in the Israeli military’s machine guns. “This bullet is consistent with the NATO standard 7.62mm M80, which would be fired by IDF 7.62x51mm weapons, including the Negev 7.62 and FN MAG,” Ball said of one of the images.', 'GHF, which runs the site, insisted: “There was no gunfire in the (distribution) center and also not in the surrounding area.”', '“All aid was distributed today without incident. We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.”', 'The IDF said allegations that Israeli soldiers fired on Gazans near or within the aid distribution site were “false reports.” It added: “Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.”', 'An Israeli military source told CNN that IDF troops did fire warning shots towards suspects approaching their position approximately a kilometer (1,100 yards) away from the aid distribution site in an incident that happened several hours before the site opened.', 'Ihab Musleh told CNN he had taken his two young sons along to the aid distribution center. When he told them to stay put at a nearby hill as he went inside the site, he heard more gunfire and rushed back out.', 'Yazeed, 13, was shot in the stomach by gunfire from an Israeli tank and survived his injuries, according to his dad.', '“He was waving his hands towards the tank and within seconds, he was hit with gunfire and fell to the ground,” Musleh said, speaking to CNN from the hospital where his son was being treated.', 'Other witnesses told CNN they were either injured or saw intense gunfire in the area after the aid site opened.', 'Mohammad Abu Rezeq was shot in the stomach upon arriving at Al-Alam where he said Israeli forces were deliberately targeting the crowd.', '“I have seen a lot of soldiers in this war. When they want to clear an area or warn you, they shoot around you.
