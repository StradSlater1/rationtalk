Instead they gave it back with some amendments, because they wanted to ultimately see a total and complete end of the war.', 'They wanted a deal that would stop all of the aggression on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, which Israel had refused, saying that they would only be willing for a partial agreement for a period of up to 60 days.', 'There are only painful options for the group in light of the latest Israeli attacks.

It doesn’t want to fall into an Israeli trip or allow Israel to set the tempo of any new round of warfare,” he said.', '“There’s no doubt that this particular strike is larger than the previous ones. Is it going to lead to the full-scale conflict which we saw between September and November of last year? I still remain sceptical of that,” he said.', '“I think Israel might want [that], but I think Hezbollah is going to continue exercising strategic patience in dealing with the situation.”', 'The international medical group MSF has said that Israeli displacement orders and movement restrictions in Gaza have pushed Nasser Hospital to the edge of “becoming non-functional”.', '“Ordering hospitals to refuse new patients and making it harder for people to reach places of care has been a pattern by the Israeli forces throughout this war, aimed at closing the hospitals,” the group said in a news release.', '“Nasser is the last remaining referral hospital in the south of Gaza, a vital lifeline for people in need, and its full functionality must be immediately restored and preserved,” it said.', 'Jose Mas, head of MSF emergency programmes, said that putting the hospital out of commission would be a “death sentence” for severely wounded patients, the critically ill, and women in need of emergency obstetric care.', 'The World Health Organization (WHO) has also called for the protection of Nasser and al-Amal Hospitals in Gaza.', '', 'Several rights groups have urged support for a congressional resolution in the US calling on the Trump administration to use “all diplomatic tools at its disposal” to ensure aid reaches Palestinians in Gaza.', '“US-origin weapons have been a significant part of what we determined is an ongoing genocide in Gaza,” Amnesty International USA Director Paul O’Brien said in remarks in support of the measure.', '“Despite opportunities to change course, the Biden administration failed to do so, and now the Trump administration is failing to do so,” he said.', 'The Council on American-Islamic Relations also released a statement on Thursday saying every member of Congress “with a shred of morality” should support the bill to end US complicity for Israeli abuses against the Palestinians.', '', 'In a post on X, Israel Katz has hailed today’s strikes on southern Beirut, saying they were needed to “enforce the ceasefire rules”.', 'Israel has repeatedly claimed that Lebanon’s government is unable to oversee the ceasefire agreement reached with Hezbollah in November of last year.

Arab envoy: Netanyahu’s arming of Gaza gang shows ‘he’s learned little since Oct. 7’,https://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-envoy-netanyahus-arming-of-gaza-gang-shows-hes-learned-little-since-oct-7/,"['ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 609', '', 'An Arab ambassador said Thursday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to arm one of Gaza’s most notorious criminal gangs as a foil to Hamas demonstrates that “he has learned little since October 7.”', '“Netanyahu worked to weaken the [Palestinian Authority] by bolstering Hamas in Gaza before October 7, and now he is doing it by bolstering this gang of criminals,” the ambassador told The Times of Israel on condition of anonymity, likening the Gaza financial aid that Netanyahu solicited from Qatar for Hamas to the transfer of weapons that the premier authorized to the Abu Shabab clan, which is widely known for its looting of humanitarian aid in Gaza.', 'Netanyahu has denied bolstering Hamas through the Qatari aid, insisting that it was meant to stave off a humanitarian crisis in the blockaded Strip. However, critics have argued that the hundreds of millions of dollars that came in from Qatar allowed Hamas to focus on expanding its military arsenal in the years leading up to its October 7, 2023, attack when some 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and another 251 were taken hostage.', '“Netanyahu didn’t want to work with the PA then because it would have meant advancing a broader diplomatic resolution to the conflict, and he is taking the same approach now,” the senior Arab diplomat said.', '“Arming clans in Gaza only further divides the Palestinians and increases the chances of a Somalia-like scenario in Gaza,” the ambassador said, expressing concern that the Strip will become a failed state characterized by lawlessness and rival militia groups.', 'Netanyahu’s decision to arm the Abu Shabab clan was kept secret from his far-right coalition partners, who would have likely come out against the move. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have long spoken out against Israel’s decision to arm the PA as part of the Oslo Accords. But Israel’s security establishment has backed the paradigm, arguing that the PA has played a critical role in stabilizing the West Bank.', 'In confirming his decision to arm the Abu Shabab clan earlier today, Netanyahu made a point of stressing that the initiative was advanced “in consultation with security officials.”', '“We made use of clans in Gaza that are opposed to Hamas… What’s wrong with that?” he asked. “It’s only good. It saves the lives of IDF soldiers.”', 'But an Israeli official told The Times of Israel that such schemes were only proposed by the Shin Bet because Netanyahu has barred the security establishment from advancing Gaza security initiatives that involve the PA.', 'Granting a foothold in Gaza to the Palestinian Authority — which backs a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — would likely have risked collapsing Netanyahu’s government, given Ben Gvir and Smotrich’s strong disregard for the PA.', 'Allowing the PA to play a role in Gaza would unlock the support of roughly half a dozen Arab countries who have expressed willingness to play a role in the post-war rehabilitation of Gaza if invited by Ramallah.', 'But that initiative has never gotten off the ground due to opposition from Netanyahu, who has likened the PA to Hamas, while rejecting the notion of entrusting Israel’s security to foreign actors.', 'The Israeli stance is widely understood to be an extension of Netanyahu’s efforts to thwart a two-state solution, which would be advanced by having a single governing authority in both Gaza and the West Bank, where the PA is currently based.', '', 'Supporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

However, online comparisons to previous images of Abu Shabab’s gang suggested it was the same group.', 'In a conversation with Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper earlier this week, anonymous Hamas sources shared more information about the group, which they admitted has been a thorn in their side.', 'According to the sources, the militia comprises some 300 people, of whom Abu Shabab personally recruited around 50.
