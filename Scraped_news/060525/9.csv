She reportedly threatened to enlist high-profile Black activists such as Rev. Al Sharpton, her former MSNBC colleague, to raise the alarm if she were pushed out.', 'Others who worked with Jean-Pierre described her as incurious and unwilling to prep for briefings to the point where she would rely heavily on a binder full of briefing notes but would always appear as she was reading them for the first time when answering questions — because she often was.', 'And in the wake of her book announcement, the criticisms have grown sharper and harsher.', 'One ex-official said Jean-Pierre’s leadership in the press shop was nonexistent.', '“She didn’t know how to manage a team, didn’t know how to shape or deliver a message, and often created more problems than she solved,” they said, according to Axios.', 'The ex-official also told the outlet that Jean-Pierre routinely “had meltdowns” whenever she participated in an interview that veered off of the narrow set of topics she’d been notified of in advance. Another agreed, saying that Jean-Pierre required “coddling” that distracted her team from “actual matters of substance” on a regular basis.', 'As for her book, another ex-White House staffer called the book project a “bizarre cash grab” and slammed Jean-Pierre for having “have enjoyed the perks of extreme proximity to power — which ... bestows the name recognition needed to sell books off your name” while trying to position herself as an outsider to sell books.
