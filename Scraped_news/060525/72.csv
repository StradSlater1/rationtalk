,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/infant-rare-disease-receives-customized-gene-therapy,"['An official website of the United States government', '', '', '', 'June 3, 2025', 'More than 30 million Americans have some type of rare disease. Most are caused by an abnormality in just one gene. In recent years, different forms of gene therapy have been developed and FDA-approved to correct or replace faulty genes and treat conditions like sickle cell disease, various blood disorders, and a severe skin condition. But developing such approaches for treating unique or ultrarare conditions has been challenging and can be costly.', 'A team of researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania set out to develop a way to create personalized gene therapy for patients with rare metabolic disorders. Led by Drs. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas and Kiran Musunuru, the scientists focused on inherited conditions that lead to toxic buildup of ammonia in blood and tissues, called urea cycle disorders. These conditions arise from faulty liver enzymes that can’t convert ammonia to urea.', 'The researchers had spent years developing and testing potential gene-editing therapies for these disorders in animal and cellular models. So they were prepared when a newborn patient displayed potential symptoms of a very rare type of disorder called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency. People with this condition can’t process byproducts from protein metabolism in the liver, which leads to ammonia buildup. The excess ammonia can severely damage the brain and liver. Standard treatment for CPS1 deficiency includes a low-protein diet until the child is old enough for a liver transplant. But the children are at risk for organ failure during this waiting period. About half of infants diagnosed with CPS1 deficiency die in early infancy.', 'With support from NIH, the scientists quickly took steps to gain FDA approval for their experimental gene therapy, which they customized to correct the infant’s particular mutation. The therapy used an advanced gene-editing technology called CRISPR base editing to precisely edit and correct the rare mutation in this child’s CPS1 gene. The gene-editing molecules were encased in fatty nanoparticles and infused into the liver. This was the first known case of a personalized gene-editing medicine being given to just one person. The approval process took only six months, from diagnosis to the start of gene therapy. Results were described in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 15, 2025. ', 'At first, the child received a very low-dose infusion of the experimental therapy at six months of age. A higher dose was then given three weeks later.', 'Within weeks after the infusions, the patient was able to receive a greater amount of dietary protein and needed less medication to keep ammonia levels in check. No serious side effects were observed. The child was also able to recover from a cold without ammonia buildup in his body. Such common childhood illnesses can be extremely dangerous for patients with CPS1 deficiency.', 'The researchers note the need for long-term follow-up to fully test the safety and effectiveness of this therapy. But with further study, this type of personalized gene therapy holds promise for treating a variety of disorders.', '“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible,” says Ahrens-Nicklas. “And while he is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs.”', 'Patient-Specific In Vivo Gene Editing to Treat a Rare Genetic Disease.

First Personalized CRISPR Gene Editing Therapy Patient Baby KJ Discharged,https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/topics/precision-medicine/first-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-patient-baby-kj-discharged/,"['Three hundred and seven days after he was first admitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the 10-month-old went home after being treated with a bespoke base editing approach', 'By Jonathan D. Grinstein, PhD', 'On Tuesday, 307 days after he was first admitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), KJ Muldoon went home after being successfully treated with the first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy. KJ, who was born with a serious and rare genetic condition called severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, received two doses of a base editor bound to a bespoke targeting guide sequence using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) when he was 7 and 8 months old. Around two months after the second infusion, KJ was discharged with his parents, Nicole and Kyle, accompanied by a police escort.', 'KJ’s case was brought to the world’s attention on May 15, 2025, when Kiran Musunuru, MD, PhD, presented it in a plenary session at the American Society for Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) in New Orleans. The case was described in detail in a study led by Musunuru published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).', '“I’m overwhelmed to see the pictures of KJ at home, with his family, for the first time,” Musunuru told Inside Precision Medicine. “Somehow that hits harder, makes it more real for me, than anything else that’s happened over the past 10 months. And it just increases my determination to find ways to do the same for as many kids as possible.”', '', '', 'When Kyle and Nicole Muldoon’s newborn son, KJ, was diagnosed with severe CPS1 deficiency, hope seemed elusive. The rare genetic disorder, marked by toxic ammonia buildup in the blood, often leads to severe neurological damage or death in infancy. With KJ too young for a liver transplant, the standard treatment for severe CPS1 deficiency, the Muldoons faced limited options. That is, until an experimental therapy offered a glimmer of hope.', 'CHOP physician-scientist Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, MD, PhD, proposed a groundbreaking solution: a personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy designed to correct KJ’s unique genetic mutations in the CPS1 gene. This uncharted approach represented a dramatic pivot in treating rare genetic disorders, leveraging the precision of CRISPR technology.', '', '', 'Taking the therapy from idea to an FDA-approved clinical-grade drug—typically a years-long process—was expedited to six months through partnerships with organizations like the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) and Danaher Corporation. The FDA approved the treatment within a week, acknowledging the urgency of KJ’s case.', 'Within seven weeks after receiving the two infusions of personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy, KJ’s condition began to improve. He could tolerate higher protein intake, required lower doses of nitrogen-scavenger medications, and started reaching developmental milestones, such as sitting upright—a feat once uncertain. KJ’s story is a testament to resilience and innovation. His parents, Kyle and Nicole, found strength in the possibility of a breakthrough.', 'Reflecting on the journey, Kyle remarked, “If you’re going through something of this nature, it’s important to find the tiniest bead of hope and hold onto that as long as you can.” KJ turned ten months old on June 1. His case not only marks a medical milestone but also sets a precedent for treating rare genetic disorders with speed, precision, and compassion.', '', '', 'While the long-term effects of the treatment remain unknown, KJ’s case underscores the potential of personalized gene-editing therapies to transform medicine. This patient-first approach could democratize access to life-saving treatments. By rapidly customizing therapies to individual genetic mutations, CRISPR-based solutions could address previously untreatable rare diseases.', 'In an editorial published alongside the NEJM study, Peter Marks, MD, former FDA CBER director, highlighted the transformative potential of the gene-editing treatment KJ received for rare diseases, emphasizing how rapid diagnosis, customized gene editing, and innovative delivery methods could serve as a model for tackling thousands of rare conditions. Marks discussed the importance of platform technologies, which streamline regulatory pathways by reusing standardized components like mRNA backbones and delivery systems. This approach reduces development complexity and cost, enabling the customization of therapies at scale. Marks argued that this framework could transform N-of-1 therapies into scalable solutions for rare diseases, unlocking broader commercial viability and benefiting millions worldwide.', 'This isn’t just a vision, and the landmark therapeutic wasn’t pulled out of thin air. The IGI and Danaher were able to step in and manufacture KJ’s personalized gene editing therapy because their partnership, the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures, aims to revolutionize personalized medicine with CRISPR-based technologies. The partnership focuses on scalable delivery systems, affordable manufacturing, and global accessibility to treat rare and underserved diseases, which was detailed in a recent in-depth interview with Brad Ringeisen, PhD, the IGI’s executive director. Notable programs for the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures include collaborations on Artemis-SCID, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, cancer, and diseases of the nervous system.', 'Ringeisen emphasized that partnerships with global institutions and regulatory bodies will be crucial in creating umbrella trials for multiple diseases, utilizing standardized CRISPR tools to bring personalized gene editing therapies to patients worldwide, and making a transformative impact on global health.', 'At CHOP, Musunuru and Athens-Nicolas are trudging ahead in parallel to the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures. Musunuru said, “Becca Ahrens-Nicklas and I are hard at work in taking the next steps towards our ultimate goal, which is to partner with the FDA to establish a robust gene editing platform that can be deployed to treat any inborn error of metabolism in the liver, so that nobody will need to undertake a heroic effort to help a child like KJ—it will simply be the standard of care.”', 'Join host Jonathan D.

Thanks to a multidisciplinary team of scientists spanning industry and academia, KJ received a gene therapy that was custom-made to treat his disease, and he is now thriving.', 'This remarkable milestone, reported in a study published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, made headlines for being the first ever on-demand gene therapy to treat an infant with a genetic disorder.1 However, this breakthrough would have been impossible without a synergistic collaboration between multiple teams of expert scientists, working together to get the job done in a mere six months—a timeline unheard of in the world of gene therapy.', '50 percent of infants with CPS1 deficiency will die, but a personalized gene therapy has saved KJ’s life.', 'CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA', ""Shortly after birth, KJ was diagnosed with severe carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, an ultrarare disease affecting 1 in 1,300,000 people.2 “CPS1 is one of the first enzymes in the [urea cycle] pathway, so if you don't have any functioning CPS1, you can't clear ammonia,” said Petros Giannikopoulos, a physician and molecular pathologist at the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) and coauthor of the study. The resulting toxicity and brain damage cause death in about 50 percent of cases."", 'Giannikopoulos is part of the somatic cell gene editing consortium, an NIH initiative that meets in person twice a year. It was during one of these meetings in the fall of 2024 that he first heard his colleague Fyodor Urnov, a geneticist and vocal champion of gene therapies for ultra-rare diseases, and Kiran Musunuru, a physician who studies the genetics of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, discuss KJ’s case. They wanted to try to correct his unique genetic mutation in vivo using a derivative of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology called base editing.', 'It would certainly be a challenge. KJ’s mutation had never been identified before, so they had to carefully design a therapy that was tailored just for him. They would also be racing against the clock to treat KJ before his disease caused significant and irreparable damage, and they would need to team up with experts and industry leaders across several fields to produce the medicine on a short timeline.', 'But if they didn’t try, KJ had a 50 percent chance of dying before he received a liver transplant, which is one of the only options available for CPS1 deficiency patients. Urnov, Musunuru, and Giannikopoulos decided to forge ahead, teaming up with physicians from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. One of the key questions was how they would produce the therapy and get it approved in time.', 'Thanks to Urnov, the IGI already had a partnership with Danaher Corporation. “A few years ago, Danaher recognized that they had a lot of potential synergies across their [subsidiaries]. They have a company that makes oligonucleotides, a company that makes enzymes, and a company that makes lipid nanoparticles,” said Giannikopolous.', 'Those subsidiaries—Integrated DNA Technologies, Alvedron, and Acuitas Therapeutics—prioritized KJ’s case and provided the various components needed to create the therapy in record time, such as the mRNA encoding the base editor, the guide RNA, and the liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle to package them in.', 'Unlike traditional CRISPR, base editing does not create double-stranded breaks in DNA but instead uses bacterial enzymes to substitute specific residues, directed to the target site using a disabled CRISPR enzyme and a guide RNA. “In principle, base editors are supposed to be safer, but really the primary driver of this was just the feasibility of being able to package everything in a single lipid nanoparticle,” Giannikopoulos explained.', 'Giannikopolous and his team explored the on-target editing outcomes of correcting the mutation in depth, as well as any potential unintended genomic alterations. With a necessary level of obsession, they mapped out all the possibilities and selected the best approach.', ""Giannikopoulos said there was no room for ego in the broader team. “In great sports teams, there's this wonderful ethos that nobody cares who gets credit. It's just about winning a championship,” he remarked. “So, there was a feeling that there's a child's life on the line, let’s just get this done.”"", 'Just six months after those first discussions, after preclinical testing in animals and an FDA fast-track designation, KJ received his first dose of the therapy. They took a cautious approach; KJ’s nonsense mutation caused a premature stop codon in the CPS1 gene, so his liver and immune system had never been exposed to the CPS1 enzyme before. “If you are now going to enable hepatocytes to make CPS1, there was some concern that maybe there might be sort of immune reaction,” Giannikopoulos said.', 'Fortunately, careful monitoring of KJ’s liver enzymes showed no signs of inflammation, and he was responding well. A month later, KJ received a second, higher dose, and he has since received a final dose. Now approaching his first birthday, KJ can consume a normal amount of protein and requires fewer medications than other people with CPS1 deficiency use to tamp down their ammonia levels.', ""According to Giannikopoulos, who has a background in oncology, the risks associated with gene therapy need to be reframed. “In cancer, we tolerate insane levels of toxicity, even in babies, in an effort to clear them of their cancer,” he said. “My explanation for why our risk tolerance in [gene therapy] is so much lower is that we don't think of people who have a genetic disease as being sick, in the sense that that's just who they are, because they were born that way.”"", 'Recent guidance documents published by the FDA allow for CRISPR-based biologics to be assessed in umbrella trials, a platform-based approach in which a broader patient population would be treated under a single IND application, but with slightly different interventional arms depending on their mutation. “The idea is that you would, you would do a lot of the intensive safety and efficacy work for the first arm, and then once you get that green light, the idea is that you could then just tweak the program a little bit [for the others].”', 'Giannikopoulos is hopeful that with these changes, gene therapies will save more lives like KJ’s. “What this case really represents, to me, is the birth of the interventional arm of medical genetics,” he said.', 'Rebecca Roberts is a science writer and communicator.

One significant advancement in newborn screening technology is the integration of protocols with fewer steps between sample collection and results. For instance, dry PCR makes use of pre-plated and dried plates to eliminate wash steps and master mix preparation, streamlining gene of interest amplification and detection.5 Protocols with fewer hands-on elements minimize user error and support timely interventions, ensuring rapid and accurate diagnostic testing, which is crucial for treating conditions that have narrow therapeutic windows such as SCID and SMA.4', 'As technologies and research knowledge expand, many newborn screening laboratories aim to add new disease targets and testing equipment to their current services. Access to newborn screening is a global priority, but screening centers across different socioeconomic contexts face unique space constraints and resource limitations that may impede equipment and method accommodations.2 For example, qPCR-based diagnostic tests often necessitate designated sample preparation areas to ensure the laboratory space remains RNAse-free and uncontaminated for sensitive and accurate detection. Additionally, working with biological samples and degradation-prone analytes typically requires ultracold storage for kits and reagents.6 Scientists benefit from contemporary protocols and platforms that make the most of the available bench space through small instrumental footprints and straightforward workflows. Stable and pre-plated reagents, along with compact machinery, help researchers access, simplify, and maximize molecular testing.4', 'Just as methodologies and equipment must progress to improve newborn screening, efficient data management and interpretation is crucial for effective diagnostics in the 21st century. Traditional paper-based record keeping systems can be cumbersome and prone to errors, and manually analyzing conventional qPCR amplification curves after lengthy workflows can hinder readout interpretation.7 New software solutions often accompany novel methods, such as integrated data management systems for cutting-edge PCR platforms, which streamline real-time data capture analysis and storage, providing fast and reliable results.', 'The Eonis™ Q system from Revvity is an innovative dry PCR workflow that simplifies and streamlines molecular testing for SMA and SCID.
