"‘He’s calm, clever and dangerous’: The battle to convict Madeleine McCann’s prime suspect",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/04/christian-brueckner-madeleine-mccanns-suspect-killer/,"['The current search in Portugal is a last desperate attempt to stop paedophile Christian Brueckner from evading police', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The red dust kicks up again as police vans rattle along the narrow rural tracks east of Portugal’s Praia da Luz, while the global press pack strains to peer beyond the cordons. For many, the scene is painfully familiar.', 'Eighteen years ago, the search for three-year-old Madeleine McCann dominated news bulletins worldwide after the toddler from Rothley, Leicestershire, vanished from her bedroom at the infamous Ocean Club holiday resort.', 'But this time, surrounding this search – coming nearly two years after the last search in 2023, and the most extensive since 2008 – a different urgency hangs in the dry air. A sense, as experts have phrased it, of a clock ticking.', 'The catalyst behind this three-day scramble? One man: German paedophile Christian Brueckner. More specifically, the need to keep him in the German prison from which he is set to walk free on September 17, despite his disturbing back catalogue of sadistic crimes and his status as the prime suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance. Chillingly, a leading German psychiatrist told a court last year that Brueckner had been tested and scored 99 per cent on a scale of dangerousness.', 'Some 30 German police officers, joined by forensic experts and supported by Portugal’s Polícia Judiciária – the national criminal investigation police agency – began fresh searches on Tuesday across a 26-mile area in pursuit of new evidence in Madeleine’s case. Chainsaws, hedge trimmers and pickaxes are being used to clear thick foliage and access crumbling ruins, while mounds of earth are shifted across the barren fields.', 'Equipped with radar capable of scanning 15ft below the surface, the team is expected to continue this extraordinary operation – scouring 20 privately owned plots and draining wells – until Friday.', 'Currently serving a seven-year sentence for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American tourist near where Madeleine vanished, Brueckner has been the official suspect in the British toddler’s disappearance since 2020 – yet he has always protested his innocence and has never been formally charged.', 'Now it seems this heartbreaking British case has become the only means left for German authorities to keep the sex offender behind bars.', '“It’s now or never,” read a headline in Germany’s Bild newspaper this week. Meanwhile, Brueckner has made his feelings perfectly clear in an extraordinary interview with German journalist Ulrich Oppold, in which he described looking forward to “a nice steak and beer” upon release. Refusing to answer any questions about Madeleine, he instead admitted he planned to flee if released from prison.', 'Few offenders are as instantly recognisable as Brueckner, with his ghostly complexion and pale blue-eyed stare. His chequered criminal history makes for disturbing reading.', 'In 1994, a teenager of 17, he was first convicted of sexual abuse of a child, attempted sexual abuse of a child, and carrying out sexual acts in front of a child. But he fled to Portugal with a girlfriend to avoid completing a youth custody sentence, and a European arrest warrant was issued.', 'The pair split, and drifter Brueckner became adept at odd jobs, finally settling in his run-down house on the edge of the Praia da Luz resort in the mid-1990s. He would frequently return there over the years to come, and has since been linked to the disappearances of seven-year-old Jair Soares and 16-year-old Belgian Carola Titze, both of whom went missing during this period.', 'In 1999, he was finally arrested by Portuguese police and sent home to serve his youth sentence, begging questions as to how a sex offender known to the Portuguese was not later tracked.', 'Over the next nearly two decades, he flitted between the two countries, often dodging criminal proceedings ranging from drug dealing and sexual offences to theft. In his later rape trial, witnesses spoke of a life of crime, stealing from tourists and climbing “through open windows in one or another holiday flat”.', 'The particularly heinous rape for which he is currently imprisoned occurred in 2005, two years before Madeleine’s disappearance. His 72-year-old American victim lived in an apartment half a mile from the McCanns. Late one evening, Brueckner broke into her home, where he beat her with a 30cm scimitar – a short, curved sword – before forcing himself on her.', 'The rape was investigated in Portugal but police eventually closed the case. Brueckner continued living in his house, returning to Germany frequently, and was staying in a camper van several miles away when Madeleine disappeared. In 2020, police said his phone placed him nearby the night she vanished.', 'It was only much later that a former co-conspirator of Brueckner’s, who had stolen diesel with him – for which Brueckner was arrested in 2006 – found a video of the rape and went to police. In late 2019, Brueckner was finally sentenced.', 'The 48-year-old was first linked to Madeleine’s case in 2013 after the McCanns appealed for information on German television’s version of Crimewatch, Aktenzeichen XY.', 'Among some 500 calls, federal investigators received a convincing tip-off. A former colleague had linked Brueckner to a photofit of a man spotted near the site where Madeleine had gone missing.', 'Then a month after the McCanns’ television appearance, the local police force in the German town of Braunschweig – where Brueckner was living at the time – sent a letter to Brueckner inviting him to be interviewed as a witness in the “missing person case of Madeleine McCann”. Journalist Jon Clarke, an expert in the case, who has written the book My Search for Madeleine, explains this was a huge error.', '“They messed up, they sent a policeman around to his house and told him he had to appear in a police station three days later to answer questions in the case of Madeleine McCann,” he explains. “They actually wrote it on the letter, so he was completely warned, and in those three days who knows what happened?”', 'Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine has also highlighted the error, speaking to an officer who admitted: “This should not have happened and in no way complies with common procedure in such a delicate case.”', 'Assessing how Brueckner has seemingly slipped through so many cracks, Clarke also believes the number of different police forces involved in Germany, combined with Brueckner’s moves around the country, as well as to Portugal and back, have complicated investigations. “They’ve not been sharing information between different police forces, and it’s been very difficult therefore to piece things together,” he claims.', 'Nevertheless, Brueckner’s crimes started to catch up with him. In 2017, he was convicted of sexual assault of a child in Germany in 2013, the five-year-old daughter of an ex-girlfriend, and sentenced to 15 months in prison. She was assaulted in a public park and graphic photos were later found on a digital camera when police were investigating him for a separate claim of domestic violence.', 'It was after his release that he is reported to have been in a bar with a friend when televisions showed 10th-anniversary coverage of Madeleine’s disappearance, allegedly prompting him to confide he “knew all about” what happened, and then revealing video of himself raping a woman. The friend is understood to have gone to the police.', 'The same year, another witness, Helge B, who had attended a music festival with Brueckner in 2008, told police the suspect admitted the killing while they were there, adding that Maddie “did not scream”, although doubts persist about the witness’s credibility.', 'Brueckner was arrested the year after while in Italy and extradited to Germany, this time on a warrant for drug trafficking. He was jailed for 21 months for dealing and then convicted for rape of his American victim.', 'By all accounts, Brueckner is not stupid. Witnesses in that trial described him as a well-presented and intelligent man who drove a Jaguar, while in court he spoke eloquently, often reading from legal texts.', 'This week, Clarke spoke to Oppold about his interview with Brueckner. “He said he was so calm, and knew exactly what he wanted to say. He’s very careful,” he explains. “If you read his prison records, his psychological records, it’s very difficult to analyse him because he doesn’t let anyone in. He won’t say anything. He’s clever and cautious.”', 'In 2020, the German prosecutor announced Madeleine was believed to be dead and identified Brueckner as the official suspect – the first time his name had been made public.', 'The evidence for this announcement has never been made clear although, last month, a Channel 4 documentary, made in conjunction with The Sun, disclosed a catalogue of grim discoveries it claims were made by police in 2016 at a disused factory Brueckner owned in Neuwegersleben, east Germany.', 'Among hordes there are reported to have been toys, children’s clothes – including 75 girls’ swimsuits – chemicals and firearms, as well as an 80GB hard drive and laptop, USB sticks and memory cards, some enclosed in a Lidl bag found under the remains of his dead dog.', 'Some of these reportedly contain sickening exchanges with paedophiles, including the wish to “capture something small and use it for days” and child abuse images. It has even been claimed there is evidence of Madeleine’s death.', 'Portuguese authorities made him a suspect in 2022, and Scotland Yard has seemed supportive. The noises point to strong evidence against Brueckner, but Clarke explains the German system, without juries, often hinges on more exacting evidence than British courts.', '“I think if it went to trial in England on probability [a jury] would convict,” he says. “[In Germany] you have professional judges and a panel and it makes it very difficult to bring a case forward unless you’ve got DNA or a confession, or somebody that actually puts him there.', '“Unfortunately, although he’s confessed to a couple of people, friends, the evidence may not be as good as they would have liked.”', 'Importantly, Clarke adds: “They haven’t got DNA yet.”', 'He also explains that the cache of evidence reported to have been found in Brueckner’s factory was initially uncovered during investigations in part around another case, the assault of his ex-girlfriend’s five-year-old daughter, for which he was jailed in 2017. Because they had used the evidence in one case, they couldn’t rely on it again for the other, claims Clarke, citing a legal quirk. “They couldn’t use this whole huge drop of photographic information they found in the factory again,” he explains.', '“They are certain that he’s the man who did it,” says Clarke, “and they do have evidence that they haven’t revealed.” But, he explains, they need every piece in place to play a “tactical game” with Brueckner, who has heavyweight lawyers on his side.', 'Undermining his suspect status further, last October, Brueckner was acquitted of five unrelated offences in his latest trial – three counts of rape and two of indecent assault against children in Portugal between 2000 and 2017, which he denied. Accounts of videotape evidence and even a cell confession formed part of the case, but could not be validated. The prosecution is “furious” says Clarke, and will appeal. This may not be in time to delay Brueckner’s release.', 'Brueckner himself never gave evidence, and only spoke once. When asked if he had anything to say he reportedly simply said: “No, I would not like to”. The impression is of a man who feels in control.', 'Only last month he is reported to have smirked in court as he was convicted for verbally abusing prison guards. He received probation, but the term is still unspecified and not predicted to extend his sentence for as long as prosecutors hoped. He had later apologised in writing for the insults, but only after claiming he was being treated “inhumanely”.', 'In the UK, it is implausible to think a convicted sex offender would be able to simply disappear on release. But more implausible is that dangerous Brueckner, whatever the truth about Madeleine, should be released so soon at all.', '“He’s not just a dangerous rapist,” explains Clarke. “He’s what they call 0.1pc of the most dangerous people in the world, because he’s someone who likes inflicting pain – he doesn’t just get off on the power, he likes torturing people.”', 'That the barren landscape of Praia da Luz and the disappearance of a British toddler 18 years ago should now hold the only key to his cell, is most implausible of all.', '', '', '', '', '', '4/5']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDJOM0pvTFdsTk5ITnNRMkZMVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

He is due to be released from prison in September.', 'Click here for live updates on the search', 'Here is a reminder of the events of the case.', 'The story began when the McCanns – doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean – joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.', 'After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort’s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.', 'When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming “Madeleine’s gone! Someone’s taken her!” The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl’s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.', 'Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.', 'The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.', 'The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their “anguish and despair” over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.', 'The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine’s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney.', 'A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.', 'By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter.', 'Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events. These claims were all totally false.', 'In July, British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA.', 'Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan’s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).', 'By August 2007, Madeleine had been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.', 'The McCanns themselves were interviewed as “arguidos” (suspects) by Portuguese police in September 2007, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.', 'Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September.', 'A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report claiming that Madeleine had died in the apartment along with a series of other unproven allegations.', 'On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns.', 'He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017. Their claim against Mr Amaral was unsuccessful.', 'Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a “predator” during their stay at Praia da Luz.

He did so.', 'Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.', 'It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine’s description in May 2007.', 'Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost £10m in its first four years of operation.', 'That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.', 'The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig.', 'He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.', 'German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.', 'Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was “very confident” the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her.', '“If you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can’t give you details because we don’t want the accused to know what we have on him – these are tactical considerations,” he told the BBC.', 'Portuguese police formally made Brueckner a suspect in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.', 'Following their unsuccessful libel claim against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, the McCanns applied to the European Court of Human Rights on the ground that the Portuguese legal system had breached their right to be presumed innocent. But on 19 September 2022, the Court rejected their claim.', 'In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann. Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims.', 'In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction, while police in Germany continued to claim they had“concrete evidence” that Madeleine is dead.', 'On 2 May 2023, Madeleine’s parents posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter’s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day.', '“The police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support – it really helps.”', 'Portuguese police also reportedly apologised to the parents of for the way detectives investigated the case and treated the family.', 'Later that month, the case unexpectedly lurched back into life in when investigators launched a major search operation at a reservoir in the Algarve, with Mr Wolters saying they were acting on “certain tips” from Brueckner, whom the prosecutor said he remains “very confident” holds the key to Madeleine’s disappearance.', 'With help from Portuguese police and with Scotland Yard detectives watching on, German investigators carried out a thorough examination of the Barragem do Arade beauty spot in Silves.', 'They combed the shoreline and surrounding grasslands with sniffer dogs, rakes, spades and pickaxes and inspected the water in a rigid-hull inflatable boat.
