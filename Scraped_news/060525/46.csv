Jonathan Joss: Three roles the late US actor was known for,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7074e570o,"['US actor Jonathan Joss, known for his roles in King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation, has died aged 59.', 'Joss was shot dead, in what his husband called a homophobic hate crime, although police in Texas say there is no evidence of this.', ""Joss's broad career spanned different genres and platforms, appearing in films, sitcoms, animations, stage productions and more."", 'He has been credited with increasing representation of Native Americans on screen. Here are three of the notable performances he will be remembered for.', 'In the animated sitcom King of the Hill, Joss voiced the character of John Redcorn, a Native American ""licensed New Age healer"" from season two onwards.', 'The sitcom centres around the Hill family and is set in the fictional town of Arlen, in suburban Texas.', ""For the first four seasons, Redcorn is having an affair with Hank Hill's neighbour, Nancy Gribble. Nancy's husband Dale is oblivious."", 'While a flawed character, Redcorn is known for his kindness and calm persona, and for championing his Native American heritage.', 'In season four, during perhaps his most notable storyline, Redcorn reveals an ongoing battle between his tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, saying he hoped to regain Native American land from the government.', 'Considering Redcorn a ""true friend"", Dale decides to help him with the lawsuit filed against the government, by introducing him to the Freedom of Information Act.', 'Redcorn then permanently ends his14-year affair with Nancy, out of respect for Dale. The affair is not revealed to Dale and he happily heads home with Nancy.', 'Author Dustin Tahmahkera once described Redcorn as ""arguably the most developed and complex indigenous character in US sitcom history, thanks in critical part... to the on-and-offscreen work of Joss"".', 'In his 2014 book Tribal Television, which considered the representation of Native Americans in sitcoms, Tahmahkera added that the portrayal ""attempted to break through a largely unkind and unflattering history of representations of the indigenous"".', 'But the fact that Redcorn was the ""most human and multidimensional"" Native American on screen was ""a disheartening and stark reminder of the history of indigenous representations in network television"", Tahmahkera pointed out.', 'King of the Hill originally aired from 1997 to 2010. The sitcom is set to return in August with the characters aged and living a new part of their lives.', ""Joss's onscreen role as Native American tribe leader Chief Ken Hotate was a fan favourite in this live-action sitcom."", ""The Chief's sharp dress sense matched his comedic wit, and he was often seen teasing the core characters as they struggled to tell if his straight-faced comments were deadly serious or a complete joke."", 'Chief Hotate often met Leslie Knope, deputy director of the Parks and Recreation department for the fictional city of Pawnee, to discuss use of the land.', 'He would often use stereotypes associated with Native Americans to his advantage, for example when opposing a festival organised on an ancient burial site by saying he hoped his ancestors ""don\'t put a curse"" on the event. White people are ""terrified of curses"", he explained to the camera in a tongue-in-cheek aside.', ""As with King of the Hill, Joss's character was dedicated to defending tribal ancestry, and would often highlight injustices faced by his community."", 'Parks and Recs creators used Joss\'s character with a ""really witty kind of self awareness"", said Samantha Sheppard, associate professor of cinema and media studies at Cornell University.', '""Parks and Rec loved to kind of reckon with the fact that despite the very good intentioned and warm-hearted, generous public servant that was Leslie Knope, and the folks who worked for the city, that the city still existed on indigenous land, and therefore had to account for those violences and that history,"" Prof Sheppard told the BBC.', 'His role made light of the sensitive issues in a way that made the difficult topic of America\'s ugly history with indigenous groups more ""accessible"", Prof Sheppard said.', '""There was this kind of cheeky awareness of stereotypical representations of Native Americans on screen,"" she said, referring to the dichotomy of Chief Hotate also being a casino owner.', '""I think it did pave the way for, like, other kinds of indigenous storytelling to happen.""', ""Taking on a darker role, Joss portrayed the ruthless Denali in 2016's The Magnificent Seven."", 'A retelling of a 1960s Western of the same name, a group of gunslingers come together to protect the town of Rose Creek, which is under threat from a tycoon wanting to mine the ground for gold.', 'Denali, exiled from the Comanche tribe, becomes a personal assassin to the tycoon, and is seen firing arrows and in hand-to-hand combat.', '""When people ask me what I thought of the movie, I tell them that all I know is my dad would have loved it,"" Joss told MySanAntonio: a news outlet local to his home town at the time of the film\'s release.', 'On Thursday, in a federal court filing, the university accused the Trump administration of a ""vendetta against Harvard"".', ""A knock-down fight between world's the richest person and the most powerful politician is playing out in public view."", 'The US secretary of state has accused the International Criminal Court of taking ""illegitimate actions"".', 'The breaking point came after Musk criticised Trump\'s centrepiece ""big, beautiful"" spending bill as an ""abomination"".', 'The tech billionaire took to his social media site, X, as the president expressed disappointment in his opposition to his spending bill.', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.”', 'Joss was born on Dec. 22, 1965 in San Antonio. He graduated from McCollum High School and then Our Lady of the Lake University, a private college in San Antonio, with a BA in theater arts.

"In His Final Public Appearance, Jonathan Joss Said That He Wanted to Go Out Like His ‘King of the Hill’ Co-Star Johnny Hardwick",https://www.cracked.com/article_46829_in-his-final-public-appearance-jonathan-joss-said-that-he-wanted-to-go-out-like-his-king-of-the-hill-co-star-johnny-hardwick.html,"['Jonathan Joss kept his late co-star Johnny Hardwick in his mind until the very end of his life, when the King of the Hill family suffered yet another tragedy.', 'Yesterday evening, San Antonio police arrived at Joss’ home to find the TV legend with multiple gunshot wounds, which they believe were inflicted by his neighbor, Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, whom the officers arrested just one block from the site of shooting. Joss’ husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has since claimed that the shooting was a homophobic hate crime following a pattern of intimidation and abuse that went unaddressed by local authorities. Paramedics pronounced Joss dead on the scene.', 'Just one day before Joss would die in the horrific tragedy, he made an appearance at a live recording of BWAAA! a King of the Hill Podcast in Austin, Texas, where he made numerous concerning and, at times, erratic comments. At one point, Joss expressed his wish that, when his own time would come, he would pass on the way that Hardwick had done back in August 2023, when, as Joss said facetiously, the voice actor for Dale Gribble “turned into soup.”', 'As fans of King of the Hill will recall, back in 2023, Texas law enforcement found Hardwick dead in his bathtub during a wellness check. Since Hardwick had died long before the police entered his home, his body had partially decomposed in the water, prompting Joss’ macabre comment on his old co-star’s passing.', 'The topic of Hardwick’s death arose during the live show when Joss was attempting to explain his awkward outburst during the King of the Hill reunion panel at the ATX Television Festival in Austin on Friday. Joss explained how he didn’t feel that Mike Judge, Greg Daniels and the select group of original King of the Hill cast members paid proper homage to the actors who had passed away since the show first became a hit, mentioning both Hardwick and Brittany Murphy.', '“I felt bad, because I hated the son-of-a-bitch,” Joss crassly commented on Hardwick’s demise, “I hated Dale. I hated Johnny Hardwick!” As Joss explained, the acrimony began years earlier when “I had an offer for $250,000 to do 10 autograph signings within a year. I called Johnny up, I said, ‘I’m working on a production, we got so many things to do you get $350,000, I get $250,000.’”', 'Hardwick turned down Joss’ offer, saying that autograph signings were “not my cup of tea,” prompting Joss to develop a resentment for his co-star, which he would come to regret after Hardwick’s passing. “It broke my heart,” Joss said of Hardwick’s passing, “It pains you when you lose somebody, and you hate ‘em.”', 'But for all the misgivings Joss had for Hardwick during life, Joss admired the way Hardwick went out, saying, “I hope, when I pass, I go out bathing like Johnny, like a can of soup.”', 'Sadly, Joss met a more grisly end than his late co-star, leaving another hole in the King of the Hill cast list that will forever be hard to fill.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXROVlZyWTI5ZlJUVjBXRmc1VFJDUEF4alhCQ2dLTWdheFJKaXZvUWc=-w280-h168-p-df
