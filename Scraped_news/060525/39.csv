Some retailers, like GameStop, saw instances of employees stapling the receipt straight on the box, thereby puncturing the Switch 2 screen. Awful. Some folks on social media sites are also reporting that their brand new Switch 2 consoles have dead pixels straight out of the box, though the problem does not seem widespread.', 'Others are counting their blessings right now, as plenty of people managed to nab a Switch 2 despite not having a pre-order. As we reported earlier this week, many retailers received an unprecedented stock of Switches. In some cases, that meant a few dozen available units for walk-ins, which I saw first-hand as I purchased a bundle this morning. Despite arriving at my local Target a couple of minutes before it opened, and a line of people awaiting before me, I was able to grab a ticket without issue. By the time I left, around a dozen people were behind me in line. Target’s website noted that it still had two additional units in stock at that location.', 'I’m not nearly as lucky as the person who got Walmart to upgrade their base console order to a bundle after the retailer ran out of stock, though. I wouldn’t blame anyone who saw their orders canceled at Walmart this week for side-eyeing this unlikely turn of events. Perhaps all the reported Walmart Switch 2 deliveries that are coming with a side of coke and Pringles are a mea culpa from the retailer? It’s definitely a good way to overwrite the Google-filling bad press Walmart got this week.', 'Mileage may vary for people who venture into stores later in the day, and it’s likely a lost cause for retailers like Best Buy, which held midnight releases that, regardless of location, often saw dozens if not hundreds of people waiting in line before the store officially opened. Stores like GameStop may well be cleaned out already.', 'If anything, it’s the people who have their Switch 2 consoles being shipped by mail who might be having the worst time out of everyone. Target customers in particular are dismayed to find that their order status still displays that their consoles are are preparing to ship. “What a weird slap in the face to have people who pre-ordered have to wait until June 11 to receive their unit, whereas people who didn’t bother pre-ordering can just walk into the store the morning of launch and grab one,” writes one Redditor. Unsurprisingly, some Target customers are being told that while they are guaranteed a console, it might not arrive for launch day specifically. Unfortunately, it appears that a notable number of people won’t be receiving their Switch 2 until next week.', 'Then you’ve got the obligatory scalpers, who took advantage of the stores that did not place limits on how many consoles you can buy. Already, on reselling sites like eBay, you can spot Switch 2 devices going for hundreds of dollars more than retail. Nintendo really needs to bring that anti-scalper tech they’ve got going in Japan to the rest of the world.', 'As for those among us who were fortunate enough to grab a console on day one, launch is equal parts exciting as it is mundane. While some people are already filling up entire Mario Kart World lobbies with cows, plenty of people will be spending the next couple of hours setting up their consoles, downloading games and their respective updates, and downloading transferring save data alongside any account information.

He's comfy. Maybe he's heard me say it's OK to wait, too.

Why are they selling a $450 portable console with no game-themed carrying case? Having some cute first-party Mario or Kirby accessories at launch seems like the least they could do to make up for not making the console available in atomic purple. Sure, there's only one color for Joy-Con 2 controllers, but couldn't they at least make some Joy-Con pad covers shaped like Triforces? Why should I have to resort to Etsy or Amazon for a cheaply made skin to help protect a device that costs nearly one-third of my rent? Nintendo: Help me make my Switch 2 pretty or make it make sense! "", 'Metroid Prime 4 Beyond with the mouse controls looked a bit uncomfortable on stream, but I remained hyped.', ""I had a whole lot of hope for the Switch 2's mouse controls when we first got to see them in action during Nintendo's Switch 2 Treehouse streams back in April. It felt like an exciting step for a console to try to emulate some form of keyboard and mouse controls for first-person shooter games."", ""As reviewers get their hands on the first Switch 2's, I'm feeling slightly more ambivalent about this new feature. Using the Joy-Cons as a surrogate for a wired mouse just seems too clunky for games that require speedy target acquisition, not to mention that the whole control scheme just doesn't look comfortable. If you're clasping the tiny controllers in that upright position and dragging them along a desk for a prolonged period of time, I feel like you're just asking for a nasty hand cramp."", 'My dreams of widespread FPS game adoption on the Switch 2 haven\'t been dashed quite yet, though. It turns out that you can plug a USB mouse into the new Nintendo console and use that for some games that permit mouse controls. Whether this will be a more ergonomic control scheme remains to be seen -- but I\'m crossing my fingers that this will be one of the ""next big things"" for the hybrid console.', ""I just set up the Switch 2 Camera with a big TV here at CNET to play Mario Kart World, and its little magic tricks are better than you might think.

Why It\'s OK to Wait, and while the FOMO is most definitely real (I love my OG Switch and definitely plan to get a Switch 2 this year), I can stand to wait a bit. I have no burning desire to play any of the launch games now, the new features like mouse control don\'t float my boat (yet), and summer is starting, so I\'d rather touch some grass.', 'As Scott said: ""As good as the Switch 2\'s upgrades are, and as fun as the new Mario Kart and Donkey Kong games seem to be -- and the GameCube gaming library also seems like a blast of retro fun -- the Switch 2 is very much an iterative upgrade for now.
