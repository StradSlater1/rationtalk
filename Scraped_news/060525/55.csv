"How Panthers, Oilers retooled rosters to return to Stanley Cup Final",https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/article/how-panthers-oilers-retooled-rosters-to-return-to-stanley-cup-final/,"['', '', '', '', 'One year after the Florida Panthers defeated the Edmonton Oilers to hoist the Stanley Cup at the end of a dynamic, dramatic, seven-game thriller, both teams are back to do battle once again. ', 'Panthers general manager Bill Zito has put on a masterclass in team building over his five-year tenure which now includes three straight Cup Final appearances. His ability to lock up his core with timely, team-friendly extensions and knack for complementing it with a smart combination of big swings and low-risk signings has turned the Panthers into a powerhouse. ', 'Edmonton, too, brings the same high-skill core to the Cup Final, with a few new faces. Most notable is the one steering the ship in the front office, as Stan Bowman took over for Ken Holland last summer. The roster Bowman inherited is rich in top-end skill and depth, too, and his moves since taking over last July show a commitment to both. ', 'Both teams enter this year’s Final with the same core, the same coach, the same starting goalie, and the same overall style of play. And with the same highest stakes, it’s a rematch in the truest sense. But alongside all of these familiar foes, there are a few new faces entering the picture, too. With that in mind, we’re looking at how both the Panthers and Oilers fortified, adjusted, and added to their respective rosters to get back to the game’s biggest stage. ', ""With the Stanley Cup within reach, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers are set to battle once again for hockey's ultimate prize. Watch every game of the Final on Sportsnet and Sportsnet+."", 'Biggest off-season signings focused in-house to keep offensive cores intact', 'Both the Panthers and Oilers entered the summer of 2024 with clear directives to lock up key parts of their respective cores. ', 'In Florida, Zito faced a pivotal off-season with two of his top-six forwards due new deals and a third extension-eligible. First came the signing of leading goal-scorer Sam Reinhart to an eight-year pact on July 1. Then he put pen to paper on a six-year contract for RFA Anton Lundell July 3 before closing out the off-season just prior to puck-drop with an eight-year extension for Carter Verhaeghe. A summer that started off with uncertainty atop the lineup ended with all five of Florida’s leading scorers from the 2024 playoff run signed long-term — a recipe to run it back that proved successful. ', 'In Edmonton, the focus was a little more singular… and a bit existential, too, with one half of the Oilers’ leading duo, Leon Draisaitl, eligible for an extension. Locking up Draisaitl was priority No. 1 for incoming GM Stan Bowman, and the eight-year pact signed in September was not only a win for Bowman and the Oilers but a major vote of confidence from Draisaitl that he’s all in on Edmonton and feeling confident Connor McDavid is, too. ', 'Oilers’ busy summer of bottom-six signings pays off', 'Through 16 games in three rounds of playoff action, every single Oilers forward has scored at least one goal. All but three Panthers have done the same. The remarkable depth on both sides of this matchup is just one of the many reasons these clubs are set to square off yet again. ', 'Look at the bottom six of both the Oilers and Panthers, and you’ll see summer signings at work. Among the many July 1 deals in Edmonton were the re-signings of contributors like Adam Henrique, Mattias Janmark, Corey Perry, and Connor Brown — those four count for a combined $6.85 million AAV this season and an impressive 19 goals in these playoffs. ', 'While reeling in free agent forward Viktor Arvidsson hasn’t yielded as much production as expected, he and fellow free agent signing Jeff Skinner as well as summer trade target Vasily Podkolzin and waiver pickup Kasperi Kapanen, have contributed a combined 16 points from the bottom six and have given head coach Kris Knoblauch plenty of options as he navigates lineup changes. ', '', '', '', '', 'Florida’s depth defence for hire thriving (again)', 'When you get to the Cup Final, other teams come calling. Zito knows this well, particularly on the blue line. Each of the past two off-seasons have seen defensive leaders price themselves out of Florida and cash in elsewhere — see Radko Gudas to Anaheim after the 2023 run, and Brandon Montour to Seattle last July after hoisting the Cup. But Zito always has a plan. His ability to seek motivated blue-liners coming off down seasons, sign them to low-risk deals and set them up for success is pretty impressive. Look at Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who signed a one-year pact with Florida after being bought out by the Canucks, rehabilitated his career with a Stanley Cup run and turned it into a lucrative contract in Toronto where he’s been a really solid part of the Maple Leafs’ blue line. ', 'Is Nate Schmidt next? Schmidt’s one-year, $800,000 signing with the Panthers flew under the radar last July after the Jets bought him out, but he’s found his footing in Florida and even flexed his offensive know-how early in the post-season. Slotted in alongside the physical Niko Mikkola in the third pairing, Schmidt has been a steady presence. ', 'The Oilers’ mid-season signing of John Klingberg follows a similar mould, with Edmonton bringing in the veteran with a low-risk one-year deal and in return getting some solid post-season production as he’s really hit his stride alongside fellow newcomer Jake Walman.', '', '', '', '', 'Big swings at Trade Deadline fitting right in', 'Both the Oilers and Panthers made targeted moves around this year’s trade deadline, with both adding pieces on the blue line and on offence — and both shopping in Boston for the latter. ', 'The Oilers acquired winger Trent Frederic to round out their bottom-six, while the Panthers pulled off the surprise of the deadline when they landed Bruins captain Brad Marchand as the clock ticked down to zeros on Deadline Day. Marchand has fit in seamlessly in Florida from the start, was integral in the Panthers’ second-round defeat of the Maple Leafs, and currently ranks fourth on the team in points with 14. ', 'Florida pulled off the higher-impact trade on the blue line, too, with the major acquisition of Seth Jones to help fill the season-long void left by Montour’s summer departure. Jones is finding his offence, and while Montour’s presence (and his production) is hard to replicate, the former Blackhawk is poised to be a big part of Florida’s defensive core moving forward. Edmonton, meanwhile, brought in Jake Walman to suit up in the bottom pair and his contributions have been noticeable. His six playoff points — including three helpers in his last two games — rank him second among d-men behind only Evan Bouchard.', 'COMMENTS', 'When submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

"Stanley Cup Final, Conn Smythe predictions for Panthers-Oilers by NHL.com",https://www.nhl.com/news/2025-stanley-cup-final-staff-predictions,"['Writers split between Florida, Edmonton; Bobrovsky, Barkov, McDavid favorites for MVP', '© Getty Images', 'The Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will meet in the Stanley Cup Final for the second straight season and NHL.com writers and editors are split down the middle on who will win.', 'Of the 16 staffers who made their predictions, eight picked the Panthers to repeat as champs and eight think the Oilers will get revenge after a seven-game loss last year.', 'As for who will win the Conn Smythe Trophy, voted as most valuable player in the playoffs, Edmonton captain Connor McDavid, the winner in a losing effort last year, received seven votes, with center Leon Draisaitl getting one. For Florida, captain Aleksander Barkov and goalie Sergei Bobrovsky received four votes each.', 'Here is how they picked:', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 9-5', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: This is a tough pick. But as good as the Panthers have looked over the first three rounds, as smart and as dogged and as true to their style as they’ve played, I just think revenge will carry the Oilers past. They were devastated when they brought the Cup Final back to Game 7 last season, narrowly losing by one goal, and they came back hungry and ready. With Stuart Skinner looking like he can hold the fort in goal and McDavid and Draisaitl working their magic, I think it’s finally time for the game’s best player to get over the hump and get his Cup. Much like the Panthers did after losing the Cup Final to the Vegas Golden Knights in 2023 and coming back to win it last season, I think the Oilers are going to be ready to prove themselves and their mettle. It’s their year.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Leon Draisaitl, Oilers', '', '', '', '', 'EDM@DAL, Gm5: Oilers earn second straight Clarence S. Campbell Bowl', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', 'WHY: You can’t say enough about either team finding its way through this grind to return to the Cup Final. I would have liked the Oilers’ chances more with a healthy Zach Hyman, given how physical he was until his injury; that would have suited this series especially well against the Panthers. But adding Brad Marchand to what was already a team designed to play at this time of year would prove to be too much for Edmonton. And as well as Skinner has responded in goal for the Oilers since the first round, I have to give the edge here to Sergei Bobrovsky.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', 'WHY: The Panthers can keep up with the Oilers offensively, and they’re tighter defensively. They’re more physical and better in goal. Hyman is a huge loss for Edmonton. The forward, out for the series with an upper-body injury, leads the playoffs with 111 hits. The Oilers have 648 hits in 16 games this postseason, while the Panthers lead the playoffs with 812 hits in 17 games. As well as Skinner has played lately in goal, Bobrovsky still has the edge. Since reclaiming the net May 10, Skinner has gone 6-2 with a 1.73 goals-against average, .931 save percentage and three shutouts for Edmonton. Over the same period, Bobrovsky has gone 7-2 with a 1.34 GAA, .944 save percentage and two shutouts for Florida. The Panthers will repeat.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', '', '', '', '', 'FLA@CAR, Gm5: Panthers win third straight Prince of Wales Trophy', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Panthers in 7', 'WHY: It’s hard to go against McDavid, the best player in the world, but I think Florida has a resilience and all-business approach that will serve it well in the Final rematch. The addition of Seth Jones from the Chicago Blackhawks has made the Panthers defense bigger, more mobile and added scoring punch. Adding Marchand from the Boston Bruins has given Florida more scoring depth and another pest to put on the ice against McDavid and Co., along with All Star agitator Matthew Tkachuk. Skinner has been very good in goal lately for the Oilers, but the edge goes to Bobrovsky, who has elevated his game in each series. Still, defeating Edmonton won’t be easy. But then it wasn’t last year, either.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: Edmonton has been working toward this Stanley Cup Final rematch since losing to Florida in seven games last season and is better prepared for it this time. After appearing outmatched in losing the first three games, the Oilers found their footing in Game 4 and nearly came back to win the series before falling short in a 2-1 loss in Game 7. Learning from that experience, they won’t be on their heels to start this series and shouldn’t have to climb out of an 0-3 hole again. McDavid is driven to win the Cup for the first time and will finish the job.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', '', '', '', '', ""EDM@DAL, Gm5: McDavid extends Oilers' lead in 2nd period"", 'Conference finals record: 0-2', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: There are so many reasons to believe in Edmonton right now: the extra motivation from last year’s Stanley Cup Final Game 7 loss; its scoring depth and even-strength play this postseason (outscoring opponents 42-26 at 5-on-5); its best player, McDavid, riding the momentum from his 4 Nations Face-Off championship-winning goal with Canada in pursuit of the Stanley Cup; the return of defenseman Mattias Ekholm in front of an already dominant Skinner. But the way the Oilers have rallied in many games this postseason and dismantled three deep, structured teams so far gives them a real chance to take down the ferocious Panthers. I’m going back to my preseason Cup pick because Edmonton has shown it can win in every which way.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 0-2', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', ""WHY: The Panthers and Oilers are different than when they met in the Final a year ago, but one thing that feels similar is Florida's dominance. The Panthers are just built for the Stanley Cup Playoff grind, and that's why I think they'll repeat as Cup champs. They're deeper up front with the way they've gotten production from the third line of Marchand, Anton Lundell and Eetu Luostarinen. And the addition of Jones and the growth of Niko Mikkola gives them a better top-four defense than they had a year ago. And I know the Oilers are better defensively than a year ago -- and the way they limited the Dallas Stars to 17 shots on the road in an elimination game Thursday was impressive -- but I have a tough time trusting Skinner in a big spot. Florida didn't celebrate after eliminating the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final; the Panthers know the only party that matters will be the one they have after they win the Cup again."", 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', '', '', '', '', 'The guys discuss the Florida Panthers advancing to their third straight Stanley Cup', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Panthers in 7', 'WHY: Full disclosure: I had the Panthers repeating as champion and Barkov winning the Conn Smythe Trophy from the outset of the playoffs, but have been more impressed by what the Oilers have been able to achieve this postseason. Still, no reason to change my prediction now, particularly since Florida has the look of a team primed to win a second straight Stanley Cup after adding critical pieces up front (Marchand) and on defense (Jones). The Panthers officially become a dynasty after winning this series that I believe will go the distance so long as Bobrovsky remains healthy.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 8-6', 'PICK: Panthers in 7', ""WHY: OK, I’m really torn on this one. I was tempted to just flip a coin and go from there. I believe the Oilers are stronger coming into this Stanley Cup Final than they were last year and were dominant in the Western Conference Final against the Stars. But there’s something about the Panthers that just amazes me and convinces me they're going to win a second straight Stanley Cup. This is their third consecutive season in the Final. Logic tells you they should be physically broken at this point, given the amount of hockey they’ve played the past three seasons, yet they keep on going and going. This is going to be one heck of a Cup Final; I just think Florida takes it again."", 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 10-4', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: Here is what we know. This will go seven games, because, why not? We also know McDavid will win the Conn Smythe for a second straight season because he’s the best player on the planet. The question is will he win the Conn Smythe and the Stanley Cup, or will he be the MVP on the losing side again? I say yes to the first part of that question. Sure, the Panthers defeated the Oilers last season, but there is no question Edmonton is much better equipped for Florida and the Final this season. First of all, the Oilers will have home ice, unlike last year, and secondly, they know what type of game the Panthers play. Now losing forward Zach Hyman to injury is huge and you do wonder if Skinner can keep playing at his current level, but there should be no doubting McDavid and Edmonton this time around. It won’t be easy and I would not be shocked if Florida wins it again, but this feels like it’s McDavid’s time to finally hoist the Cup.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', '', '', '', '', 'The guys discuss the Oilers advancing in a win over the Stars', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 8-6', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', 'WHY: To be the man, you have to beat the man, as Ric Flair said more than once in his illustrious wrestling career. Florida is still the man. It proved it on this playoff run. In the second round, the Panthers were down 2-0 in the series to the Toronto Maple Leafs and were losing Game 3. Yet, they rallied, winning four of five in that series and four of five against the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final. That’s .800 hockey during their past 10 games. With the additions of Marchand and Jones they are arguably better than the team that jumped to a 3-0 series lead against the Oilers before stumbling home in seven last year. It will be entertaining, it will be fierce, it will be riveting, but in the end, it will end as it did last season. Florida will still be the man.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 8-6', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: The answer here is simple. It’s because the Oilers touched the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl. Duh. Of course. Reverse the curse, right? They didn’t touch it last year and lost in seven to the Panthers. So touch it this year and they win it. Simple math, really. But in all seriousness, it’s because they remind me a lot of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009, when they won the Stanley Cup against the Detroit Red Wings after losing to them in the Stanley Cup Final in 2008. It’s the old live and learn, get a second crack at the same opponent, and be better for it. Edmonton is still led by McDavid and Draisaitl, just like Pittsburgh was by Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. But like the Penguins in 2009, the Oilers are better all around their generational stars. They will not be intimidated by the moment. They will not be overwhelmed. They will not lose the first three games like they did last year. They’re rolling and they have home ice this time. Edmonton will be the city of champions again. Lock it in.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 9-5', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', ""WHY: This one could go either way, but for me, it will come down to depth and Florida is just a deeper team up and down the lineup. When your stars aren't producing, you need the depth players to. With 21 of 22 skaters who have played at least one playoff game scoring a point and 19 of them having at least one goal, what more can you ask for? And when all else fails, they have future Hall of Famer Bobrovsky in net to bail them out."", 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', '', '', '', '', 'NHL Tonight on the Panthers advancing to the Stanley Cup Final', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 12-2', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: It’s not plagiarism when you copy and paste yourself, which I do here from last season (just adding one year) because the sentiments still hold: It has been 32 years this spring since Canada loaned the Stanley Cup to the United States and it’s time that the 1892 gift to this country from then-Governor General Lord Stanley of Preston came home. From Barkov to Bobrovsky, Florida is a fabulous team. But I want to see McDavid, arguably the greatest player in hockey today, press the Stanley Cup overhead and watch Edmonton, back in its dynasty 1980s known as the City of Champions, lose its mind in celebration. To a full generation of Canadians, the Stanley Cup has been only a rumor. Nothing scientific about this pick, but it’s time that fantasy became reality.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 2-0', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: I find it difficult to imagine McDavid and Draisaitl being defeated in the Stanley Cup Final for the second consecutive season. The two superstars are healthy and have taken their game to another level. They also have a stronger, more experienced supporting cast than they had a year ago. Once healthy, the Oilers rolled through the Western Conference, winning four straight to dispatch the Los Angeles Kings and eliminating the Golden Knights and Stars in five games each. Edmonton is rolling and getting contributions up and down the lineup. The Oilers have been waiting an entire year for this opportunity, and I can’t see them being denied. McDavid and Draisaitl will be the difference in the series and bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 2-0', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: Are the Panthers a better team than the one that beat the Oilers 2-1 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final a year ago? Yes, thanks to adding Marchand and Jones in the second half of the season. But so, too, are the Oilers, a point Stars coach Pete DeBoer emphasized after his team was eliminated by Edmonton on Thursday. According to DeBoer, the Oilers play a much tighter, playoff-friendly defensive structure than they did last year, adding that they also have better depth. The fact they have home ice advantage should it come down to another Game 7 is huge, given the raucous nature at Rogers Place and, for that matter, the entire city. But the main reason I’m selecting Edmonton? The Oilers were my preseason pick to win the Cup nine months ago. The proof is on the web. Let’s see if they can prove me right. This much is certain: It won’t be easy.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'FLA vs. EDM', 'FLA vs. CAR | EDM vs. DAL', 'FLA vs. TOR | CAR vs. WSH | DAL vs. WPG | EDM vs. VGK', 'OTT vs. TOR | FLA vs. TBL | MTL vs. WSH | NJD vs. CAR', 'STL vs. WPG | COL vs. DAL | MIN vs. VGK | EDM vs. LAK']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9OMmhhTVdaR1kwbE9aUzAxVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhZElvQkpLZ2M=-w280-h168-p-df
Why American hockey fans should root for the Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nhl-finals-edmonton-oilers-stanley-cup-trump-canada-rcna210497,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Whether you’re an actual Canadian person or simply one of the roughly 10% of Americans who, like me, consider themselves diehard ice hockey fans, this week no doubt finds you largely consumed — if not full-on bedridden — by a little something I like to call Stanley Cup Fever (or La Fièvre de la Coupe Stanley as it is known to my avid French Canadian readership).', 'The fact that the Panthers’ logo looks like it was meant for a life insurance company makes the concept of a South Florida Stanley Cup champ unacceptable to me.', 'This year’s contest is a rematch of last year’s finals — with the Edmonton Oilers facing off against the defending champion Florida Panthers. There is no shortage of reasons I am rooting for the Oilers to whip the Panthers around like a bunch of rag dolls and assume their rightful place as Stanley Cup champions for the first time in 35 years — and also the first Canadian franchise to win the Cup in ... wait for it ... 32 years.', 'I insist you root for the Oilers, as well.', '“But Dave,” you ask, “didn’t the Oilers rebuff your offer to perform both the Canadian and American national anthems on electric guitar at an Oilers home game a couple of years ago after someone in the Oilers organization saw you doing that very thing at an Anaheim Ducks home game just a couple weeks prior — even though it was totally amazing, and you can ask anyone?”', 'And to that I say yes, but I have moved on mostly, and so should you. (Also, thank you for your support; I’m nothing without the fans.)', 'Anyway, the first reason I would like the Oilers to win this year is that they were my favorite NHL team as a kid. I grew up on the mean streets of suburban Cleveland, and, since we didn’t have an NHL team of our own, I had no choice but to offer my allegiances elsewhere.', 'The fact that the Oilers had cool blue and orange jerseys and a young Wayne Gretzky in their lineup — along with fellow future Hockey Hall of Famers Mark Messier, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri — made it a no-brainer. My dad even took my brother and me to see the Oilers play the Penguins at the Civic Arena (the first major sports venue in the world with a retractable roof, for all you retractable roof enthusiasts) in Pittsburgh, and I got my program signed by all four of those guys outside the players entrance and everything.', 'Gretzky still had a perm at the time, which made it all the more exciting. In fact, I would like to think it was my own youthful enthusiasm combined with that perm that helped lead the team to Stanley Cup victories in ’84, ’85, ’87 and ’88. (The Oilers won one more Cup in 1990, but Gretzky had already been traded to the Los Angeles Kings and had sadly adopted a more close-cropped, chemical-free look by then, foreshadowing his future as an online gambling shill, among other things.)', 'Another reason I would like the Oilers to win this year is that — despite the fact that it is my dream for hockey to become the No. 1 sport in the United States and the presence of the sport in as many areas of the country as possible is crucial to that development — as a quarter-Canadian (my grandfather was from Clinton, Ontario) I struggle to accept the playing of professional hockey in regions where snow and ice don’t naturally occur. I’m not a religious man, but I just think it goes against God. And the fact that the Panthers’ logo looks like it was meant for a life insurance company or something makes the very concept of a South Florida Stanley Cup champion just unacceptable to me.', 'This year’s Stanley Cup is bigger than just the game of hockey.', 'But the biggest reason, with geopolitical importance, that I would like the Oilers to beat the Panthers is that we live in a time when the actual president of the United States — whose non-White House primary residence just so happens to be a resort/ex-wife cemetery in South Florida — suggests with disturbing regularity that Canada should become the 51st state. Aside from a handful of people I will (at the risk of sounding uncharitable) call Albertan lunatics, almost no one in Canada would ever entertain the prospect of being annexed by the neighbor to the South.', 'In light of this, this year’s Stanley Cup is bigger than just the game of hockey, sort of like how the U.S. men’s team’s facing off against the Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics was essentially the Cold War on ice (Note to self: Write musical titled “The Cold War on Ice.”)', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'I wouldn’t go as far as to say that the Oilers’ winning the sacred chalice of Canada’s Game would send a message to Donald Trump, as I’m not convinced he is capable of receiving such things. But I do think it would upset him. And I really like that idea.', '“The once great sport of hockey has been ruined by the foreigners of Edmonton, who are not very nice,” the president might say. “Brave men on very cold water, ice they call it, with knives strapped to their feet ... not butter knives but more like steak knives that you would use to eat Trump Steaks ... not that you would even need a knife to eat a Trump steak, because they were very tender, very tender, almost like liquid meat, many people have said, including chef Guy Fieri, who is a great friend, but the nasty Canadian Oilers will never know because they, just like my son Eric, will never be invited to the White House, this much I can tell you.”', '“Also hockey is canceled in Florida. Your tax dollars will not pay for Brad Marchand any longer. One more thing: If global warming is real, then why is there ice inside the arena?”', 'Go, Canada.

So, one of the biggest storylines early was that McDavid — inarguably the best player in the world — and his fellow scoring machine, Draisaitl, had gone silent on the biggest stage.', 'Of course, McDavid turned it on starting with an assist late in Game 3 and went on to score 11 points (3G, 8A).', 'However, that slow start from the superstars created that 3-0 hole to the Panthers that, while they almost got out of it in the end, was just too deep for the Oilers.', 'Now, smash-cut to 2025, and the one-two punch of McDavid and Draisaitl already have their fingerprints on this series, with Draisaitl potting the opener just over a minute into a regulation.', ""McDavid assisted on the tying goal from Ekholm in the third, and then, late in overtime, No. 97 teed up his old buddy Draisaitl for the latter's record-tying third overtime game winner this postseason."", 'This kind of production from McDavid and Draisaitl will be key with Zach Hyman out of the Oilers lineup.', ""There's a long way to go, and the Florida Panthers aren't the kind of team to roll over and die, but it looks like Edmonton has already overcome one of their biggest shortcomings from the last Stanley Cup Final."", '', ""You are agreeing to OutKick's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but don't worry we don't spam."", 'DISCLAIMER: This site is 100% for entertainment purposes only and does not involve real money betting.

START OF STANLEY CUP FINAL MEANS START OF SILLY SEASON,https://www.thefourthperiod.com/pagnotta/start-of-stanley-cup-final-means-start-of-silly-season,"['Photo by Darcy Finley/NHLI via Getty Images', 'TORONTO, ON — The rematch is set. For the second consecutive season, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers will duke it out for hockey’s Holy Grail.', 'As I pack my bags for Edmonton – and, yes, I’m praying this year’s back-and-forth travel will be smoother than last year’s adventures (first world problems) – the spotlight on the NHL shines bright on Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers’ revenge tour. With the Panthers looking to go back-to-back, the storylines surrounding their club is also front and centre.', 'But as we skate into June, the bright lights of the Stanley Cup Final will also point in the direction of the silly season, as 30 other NHL clubs begin to ramp up their off-season planning.', 'Trade chatter is about to pick up and with a shallow free agent pool, some teams may be more inclined to dive into the trade market in the weeks leading up to the NHL Draft in Los Angeles.', 'The smoke will start to thicken a week from now, when the NHL Scouting Combine gets underway in Buffalo.', 'The Sabres, who brought in Jarmo Kekalainen as a Senior Advisor, will be an intriguing team to watch in the weeks ahead. With multiple players uneased with the team’s lack of advancement, there is an opportunity for Kekalainen and GM Kevyn Adams to be active – it is time the organization takes the next steps in its progression.', 'We have already reported Bowen Byram is in play, again, in Buffalo. Ahead of the trade deadline, names like Owen Power, J.J. Peterka and Alex Tuch were also tossed around as the vultures circled their prey. Is there more of a willingness to make bold moves now?', 'I am curious to see if the Sabres circle back on Elias Pettersson in Vancouver.', 'The 26-year-old centre will see his no-movement clause kick-in July 1 and the belief across the NHL is the Canucks will continue to entertain trade calls. It does not sound like the price tag has changed much, if at all, so a team will have to pay up to pry him out of B.C. Do the Sabres take another swing? They surely won’t be the lone team to try.', 'Pettersson won’t be the only topic of discussion surrounding the Canucks over the next few weeks. Goalie Thatcher Demko appears open to a change of scenery and is expected to be in play as he enters the final year of his contract.', 'Demko, who has a $5 million cap hit and does not own any no-trade protection, has had health concerns, but he is excited to have a normal summer. I’m told he is not battling any issues and is already training for next season, and with the Canucks committed to Kevin Lankinen, teams evaluating their goaltending position will be an option for Vancouver.', 'The focus in Vancouver seems to be centred around adding more offence up front and replacing Brock Boeser, who will become an unrestricted free agent this summer.', 'Boeser, 28, is a “longshot” to re-sign with the Canucks, one team source confirmed to me this week. He is prepared to move on to the next chapter of his career and will attract significant interest this summer, especially given the limited market.', 'There are plenty of questions in Toronto, too, especially after GM Brad Treliving met with the media on Thursday. I was in attendance and understood Treliving’s apologetic tone when he offered little insight on multiple subjects since he and his staff haven’t fully mapped out their plan. Do I believe they don’t have an idea where they stand with Mitch Marner and John Tavares? Absolutely not. But I get where he is coming from.', 'An extension for Tavares is much more likely than one with Marner at this point in time. All indications are Marner is heading to free agency. He hasn’t closed the door on a return to Toronto, but he wants to evaluate his options. ', 'It has been widely reported which teams will come knocking on Marner’s door if/when he becomes available. I don’t subscribe to the sign-and-trade theory – it just won’t play out that way. Now, could the Leafs trade his rights for a draft pick to give a team a headstart in contract negotiations? That seems more plausible.', 'Just about every team will poke around, but I believe Marner has a list of seven or eight teams he prefers to go to if the offers are in place. Los Angeles and Vegas are two of those clubs. Teams with a boatload of cap space may be willing to go above and beyond financially, like Anaheim, Columbus and San Jose, but would Marner prefer to sign with a club closer to contention?', 'Speaking of Vegas, the Golden Knights have just over $9.6 million in salary cap space and a few decent holes to fill. Word on the street is they are entertaining calls on defenceman Nic Hague, who is set to become a restricted free agent July 1 and is due for a solid paycheck.', 'Multiple sources indicated this week that Vegas has already started to engage in trade discussions involving Hague, who brings size, accountability and a championship pedigree to any club looking to strengthen their defensive corps. Several teams will be poking around, and this should be something to keep an eye on leading up to Draft weekend.', 'We are two days from June and the action is just starting to percolate. Once Boston and Pittsburgh announce their Head Coach hirings in the coming days, we’ll start to hear more out of their camps, as well.', 'The silly season has returned. Let’s see how silly things get this year.', 'First order of business for Islanders GM Mathieu Darche: finalize the contract extensions for defenceman Adam Boqvist (one-year) and veteran winger Kyle Palmieri (two-years). Both players had “handshake” agreements under former GM Lou Lamoriello – I believe Palmieri’s deal was in place since the trade deadline – and both sought clarity after the team announced Lou wasn’t returning. Darche honoured both deals, with some say from up top.', 'Darche also indicated they plan on moving forward with the first-overall pick in the Draft, but I would not be shocked if the San Jose Sharks, holding the second-overall selection, make an attempt to move up to draft Matthew Schaefer.', 'As I reported Thursday on the social platform formerly known as Twitter, Brock Nelson is open to signing a contract with the Colorado Avalanche. The Avs and Nelson’s camp are expected to pick up discussions in the coming weeks, and while nothing is set in stone and he may very well hit July 1, there is mutual interest.', 'Luke Richardson, who interviewed for some of the Head Coach positions that were vacant out there, is under consideration for a role on Rick Tocchet’s bench in Philadelphia.', 'The Calgary Flames are making a change behind their bench. I reported earlier this month that Brad Larsen is sticking around. Yesterday, I tweeted (X’d?) that Dan Lambert is not returning next season. Not yet confirmed, but some whispers that Wranglers coach Trent Cull jump back to Calgary as an assistant coach.', 'Expect the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins to announce their Head Coach hirings at some point this weekend, possibly by Monday.', 'Edmonton inquired about Jeremy Swayman this season, well after he signed his deal with Boston, but with how much Stuart Skinner gets criticized, Stu seems to be doing fine in net for the Oilers.', 'It is still very fresh, and a lot of people are still dissecting Pete DeBoer’s goalie decision and post-game comments, but the Dallas Stars have less than $5 million in salary cap space this off-season. Some league sources believe Mason Marchment and his $4.5 million cap hit will be in play.', 'Plenty of chatter surrounding the New York Rangers these days. K’Andre Miller, Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad are just three names swirling around out there.', 'Reports suggesting Jonathan Marchessault is available are accurate, as far as I have gathered. But he has a 15-team no-trade list that was strategically put together, so we shall see if Nashville gets to the finish line on anything.', 'The Utah Mammoth are believed to be open to moving the fourth-overall pick. Some believe Utah GM Bill Armstrong will consider trading the pick for a young top-six, NHL-proven forward.', 'Past Columns:', 'May 19, 2025 - Wind of change blowing through Toronto', 'May 12, 2025 - Farewell tour for Malkin as Penguins rebuild?', '© 2025 TFP Media, Inc.

The overtime defeat was already a tough pill to swallow but even more so because of a critical error made by fourth-line center Tomas Nosek, who was assessed a delay of game penalty after hitting the puck over the glass while attempting to clear it from the defensive zone with 1:42 left in the overtime period.', 'Moments later on the ensuing power play, Draisaitl scored the game-winning goal on an assist from Oilers captain Connor McDavid. After the game, Panthers coach Paul Maurice defended Nosek, and had a resilient message for the 10-year NHL veteran.', '""You just remind him after the game of being down 0-2 to Toronto {Maple Leafs] when that line came in and changed everything for us,"" Maurice said. ""And how we\'re not here without Tomas. It\'s a tough break. So we\'ll just make sure he doesn\'t eat alone tonight. He\'s got lots of people sitting at his table and reminding him how good he\'s been to us.""', ""Entering Game 1, the Panthers' 87.1% penalty kill percentage was the best mark in this year's postseason, and Nosek was a big part of that. Trailing 0-2 in the second round series against Toronto, Maurice called Nosek's name and he, as well as the rest of the Panthers' fourth line, changed the tide for Florida in a 5-4 overtime win that ultimately spurred a series victory."", '""It\'s going to be tough,"" Maurice continued. ""He\'s going to eat that one for a day but from his penalty kill to, again, that line really changed the flow of that Toronto series. We\'ll remind him of that a whole bunch of times before the puck drops.""', 'Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final is on Friday at 8:00 p.m. ET.', ""Tim Capurso is a staff writer on the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.

Especially on the power play, you’re looking to finish it,” Draisaitl told reporters. “Again, some incredible plays that made it pretty easy for me to put that home. It’s a special feeling. It’s great for right now but we got to look ahead and get read for Game 2.”', 'McDavid, the three-time Hart Memorial Trophy winner, called his teammate Draisaitl “invaluable” to the team.', '“Does so many good things,” McDavid said. “Clutch, face-offs, you name it, he does it.

New to the Florida Panthers bandwagon?

Why is it OK to love a “villain,” but hate McJesus? What’s up with the flying rats? And where can I get the newest merch?', 'We’ve got you covered: Here is a crash course on things to know about the champs that will help make you sound like a seasoned Florida Panthers fan.', 'This series is likely to be a hard-fought replay of last year, when the Panthers and Oilers played in the 2024 Stanley Cup Final. The Panthers won the first three games in the best-of-seven series, and we were feeling giddy. The Oilers won the next three games, and we were feeling sick. But the Panthers won the series-clinching Game 7 at Sunrise’s Amerant Bank Arena in a tense 2-1 battle, securing South Florida’s first Stanley Cup. Oilers fans still seem to believe they didn’t lose that series.', 'It’s a tradition you need to know about to call yourself a Panthers fan, dating back nearly 30 years, when the team was about to play the first home game of a magical 1995-1996 season that culminated with their first Stanley Cup Final appearance. As the players waited to take the ice at their former Miami Arena home, a rat scurried among them until star Scott Mellanby sent it flying with a fatal slap shot.', 'Mellanby would go on to score two goals in the game and afterward the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported that goalie John Vanbiesbrouck — putting a humorous spin on “hat trick,” hockey slang for a three-goal game — said Mellanby should be credited with the NHL’s first “rat trick.” Less than a week later, on Oct. 13, 1995, fan Scott Celli was inspired to throw a rubber rat on the ice. Other fans joined in as the season went on, and Panthers games have never been the same.', 'The Edmonton Oilers are led by future Hall of Famer Connor McDavid, sometimes called McJesus, and other guys. The deification of the Oilers’ star continued recently when two McDonald’s franchises in Canada were briefly rebranded with golden-arches signs calling them “McDavid’s.” Meanwhile, the Panthers are a bunch of down-to-earth guys who go about their business as a collective. There is no Brad Marchand-branded Blizzard at Dairy Queen. Yet.', 'Nicknames are a sports tradition that spans generations. Some are cute, some are playful, some are intimidating and, well, some are just easier to pronounce than the player’s real last name.', 'Sure, you can find all of the important information a fan needs on the team’s official Instagram and Facebook accounts, such as game schedules, themed nights and giveaways, contests, community programs, announcements, interviews and photos.', 'But the best reason to follow? The creative memes and behind-the-scenes glimpses into the locker room.', 'For additional fan-friendly content, follow the FlaPanthersFC community group on Instagram run by David Rodriguez. With more than 35,000 followers, it celebrates the team’s journey with exclusive content, graphics and videos.', 'Keep track of the players by following some of their official Instagram accounts:', 'The official Florida Panthers app helps fans keep track of real-time scoring and stats, articles, promotions, tickets and in-arena services such as mobile ordering. Visit nhl.com/panthers to download.', 'When the Panthers decided to build a new practice facility, they created an accessible venue in Holiday Park that quickly embedded the team in the culture of downtown Fort Lauderdale. The $65 million Baptist Health IcePlex opened last spring with two NHL-quality ice rinks, one for team practices (many open to the public) and another dedicated to public skating, youth and adult club hockey leagues, skating instruction and packed-house watch parties. When the team is working at the venue, you’ll find groups of fans waiting by the parking lot, where many players will stop and sign autographs. Regular guys.', 'Fort Lauderdale beach dive bar the Elbo Room, already a famously historic Spring Break destination, reached a new level of immortality as the Lourdes of long-suffering South Florida hockey fans after the 2024 Stanley Cup win. It was there, just hours after the Cats had won Game 7, that star players Matthew Tkachuk, Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, Gustav Forsling and others began the venerable trophy’s tour of South Florida with a ceremonial bath of oceanwater and Bud Light. Fans gathered in such numbers that police closed the intersection of A1A and Las Olas Boulevard, and were rewarded when Tkachuk and others used the Stanley Cup to douse them with beer poured from the second-floor balcony. The moment went viral on ESPN and across social media, making the humble Elbo Room a pilgrimage site for hockey fans.', 'You will see that the Panthers’ style of hockey is, let us call it, inelegant. With a uniquely aggressive mission to separate the other team from the puck, the Panthers’ cirque-du-grenade act can leave the ice littered with fallen opponents, spinning helmets and broken sticks. While this barbaric ballet may look like chaos, it is actually an illustration of highly disciplined teamwork instilled by coach Paul Maurice over hours of practice. Do not apologize. Be proud of the effort. The Panthers play by the rules. And defense wins championships.', 'So you will hear media and opposing fans describe your team as “villains.” But Panthers’ captain Aleksander Barkov this week paired his third Frank J. Selke Trophy (as the NHL’s best defensive forward) with the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, given to the player “who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and who has made a significant humanitarian contribution to his community.” Barkov also is a past winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, which recognizes a player who exhibits “exemplary sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct while maintaining a high standard of playing ability.”', 'If you watch the games on TV, stick around. If you record them, add extra time. There is nothing like a Paul Maurice post-game interview. Maurice, who got his first NHL head coaching job with the Hartford Whalers nearly 30 years ago at age 28, is supremely confident in who he is. A precise wordsmith, candid but measured in his analysis, Maurice has a droll, dry sense of humor, his deadpan delivery sometimes betrayed by a furtive smile (think Norm Macdonald). If his jokes were a martini, the vermouth would be in the next room.', '', 'If you’re new to the Panthers fan base, you’re going to need some merch. There are several places in South Florida where you can find just about any item with a Panthers logo — from T-shirts, hats and jerseys to flags and signs for your yard. Keep in mind the team’s Reign Red playoff campaign this year encourages fans to wear red at the arena and out in the community.', 'Pantherland at Amerant Bank Arena: The official team store at 1 Panther Parkway in Sunrise is open during games and watch parties for ticketholders and extra hours for the public through Saturday, June 14.

The resulting penalty paved the way for Florida’s Brad Marchand to score the go-ahead goal on the power play.', 'Bennett scoring his second of the night early in the second period put the Panthers up 3-1.

Thursday's NHL: Oilers join hit parade in opener; Bruins hire coach Sturm,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/other/2025/06/05/thursdays-nhl-oilers-join-hit-parade-in-opener-bruins-hire-coach-sturm/84057016007/,"['Edmonton, Alberta – Connor McDavid had two hits on the opening shift of the Stanley Cup Final, and that was just the start of the Edmonton Oilers taking the body in Game 1 of their rematch against the Florida Panthers.', 'The series opener was a clear message that for all their skill and talent, the Oilers are eager to counter Florida’s physicality with some of their own. The teams combined for 102 hits, many of them bruising body checks sending opponents into the glass and to the ice.', '“We’re a team that has proven we’re going to play hard throughout the entire playoffs,” winger Evander Kane, who had a game-high nine hits, said Thursday. ""Just because we’re playing Florida, that’s not going to change.”', 'Doing so without injured forward Zach Hyman, the leading hitter in the playoffs, meant a team toughness, by committee approach. Guys like Kasperi Kapanen and Vasily Podkolzin who are not known for that aspect of hockey, showed they were more than willing to finish checks when available.', '“We’re a team built for a lot of the physical edge and whatnot,” defenseman Darnell Nurse said. ""Our team’s not afraid of that. (We are) playing a really, really good opponent that brings up the physicality each night, and we have to match that.”', ""Florida's Sam Bennett scored twice in Game 1, in the process breaking the franchise record for goals in a playoff year with 12. The first was trademark Bennett on the edge of the crease, showing why he's so good this time of year and is about to get paid – either by the Panthers or someone else – this summer as a free agent."", '“He’s got a nose for the net,"" winger Matthew Tkachuk said. “He’s at the net a lot. Good things happen when you go to the net. He’s confident. He’s hard to play against on both sides of the puck, and he wants the puck and demands the puck. He’s been playing really well.”', 'Bennett is second to Hyman in hits, and his goal total is the most of any player this postseason. Teammate Seth Jones, who played against Bennett for several years in Chicago, Columbus and Nashville, thought Game 1 was a display of “a little bit of everything” from the 28-year-old forward.', '“He’s been one of our best players through his playoffs and is capitalizing on a lot of big plays for us and timely goals,” Jones said. ""But as a defenseman, you see where he gets around that blue paint. He pushes off. He makes himself big, screens (for goals), as well. It’s just that constant body contact around the net that really elevates his game and makes it difficult to handle.”', 'For a second consecutive year, the final is being broadcast in American Sign Language, with some improvements and additions. David McGregor, a deaf professional referee based in Vancouver, is now an intermission correspondent, and the alternate telecast now includes player pre- and postgame interviews.', '“I’m very proud of our growth and our evolution and also a tip of the cap to the NHL for being bold and brave and buying into this and allowing this to grow,” said Brice Christianson, founder and CEO of P-X-P, which is doing the broadcasts. “We’re again making history. The NHL and PXP, every time we expand this, we keep on doing an unprecedented, groundbreaking, historic moment.”', ""P-X-P, a company that works to make sports more inclusive through interpretation, has been involved with the league since Christianson first did Commissioner Gary Bettman's annual pre-Cup final news conference in Denver in 2022."", 'This year, broadcasters Noah Blankenship and Jason Altmann got a hand from TNT play-by-play guru Kenny Albert, whose daughter Amanda is an associate producer for the NHL in ASL. Albert spent 40 minutes on a Zoom call with them, lending some of his expertise and answering their questions.', '“A lot of it was just talking about the preparation, some advice as far as calling the game,” Albert said. “It was great to meet with them over zoom and chat with them and just share some knowledge that they can hopefully use in their broadcasts.”', 'The teams combined to ice the puck 21 times in Game 1, including nine in overtime alone. Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch chalks that up a little to the pressure and players not having as much time as they thought to make a decision, along with human nature', '“It was Game 1 and it’s a little bit of nerves, feeling out what the other team’s doing and where that pressure’s coming from and not wanting to make a mistake,” Knoblauch said. ""It was something that we would like to stay away from but understand that’s part of the game.', ""Florida counterpart Paul Maurice splits up icing into three categories: smart ones to stay out of trouble, maddening ones when players don't get to the center red line to avoid it and ones where stretch passes just get missed."", ""He also has fond memories of the puck sailing down the ice several times late in the Panthers' Stanley Cup clincher last year."", '“I think we had 42 in the third period in Game 7 last year,"" Maurice said with a chuckle. ""We iced that puck 1,000 times.”', 'Edmonton, Alberta – Going into this Stanley Cup Final rematch, confidence oozed from the Florida Panthers just like last year when they won – and also this time from the Edmonton Oilers because they felt prepared for the moment.', 'After losing Game 1 in overtime after a puck over the glass penalty put Edmonton on the power play, the Panthers have not lost any of the belief they carried into the series. In a third consecutive final, the defending champions are unfazed by their deficit and appear well equipped to bounce back in Game 2 on Friday night.', '“We’ve got a lot of battle scars on us from the last few years, and we’ve been through way worse,” winger Matthew Tkachuk said Thursday. ""We can be better, we can adjust a few things and come out tomorrow and try to get a win here and get some momentum going back home.”', 'A win would even things up and put the pressure right back on reigning playoff MVP Connor McDavid, Game 1-winning goal-scorer Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers with play shifting to Sunrise next week. Even a loss would not put the Panthers into desperate straits.', ""They dropped the first two in the second round against Toronto and trailed 2-0 and 3-1 in Game 3 before rallying to win that night and beat the Maple Leafs in seven. Even for Florida's newcomers, it was evidence that this team doesn't go down easy."", '“You’re going to have moments in the game and moments in a series that you’re going to be riding a roller coaster,” defenseman Nate Schmidt said. “This team, I think, has an incredible ability to be able to not only learn from what they’ve done and apply their experience into situations like this.”', 'Coach Paul Maurice downplayed it as “just experience,"" as though every team in the NHL or any sport knows what it is like to make this many deep playoff runs in a row and look borderline unstoppable. Because of that success, the Panthers are who they are, and not a lot of major adjustments are expected.', '“It’s almost always an adjustment back to form: We were a little off here, we can be a little bit better,” Maurice said. ""Nobody’s changing a major system. It takes months and years to do that. You’re (talking about) adjustments back to form, but I think they have a pretty strong understanding of their foundation.”', ""Panthers players seem to have a pretty strong understanding of how playoff hockey works. They've won 10 of 11 playoff series since Maurice became coach and Tkachuk arrived in a trade from Calgary in the summer of 2022."", ""The only time they've been on the wrong side of a handshake line during this stretch was the 2023 final against Vegas, when Tkachuk was sidelined by a broken sternum and several others were playing with significant injuries. The memories of that and falling behind in series along the way stick with them."", '“We learn more from adversity than we do from winning,” forward Carter Verhaeghe said. “Every time you lose games or go through series where you’re down 2-0 or losing in the Cup final a couple of years ago, you learn a lot. It’s just sticking with it and being mentally strong.”', ""Tkachuk said he and his teammates are plenty strong mentally, so the tweaks will be more tactical. They won't look too different but have some areas to clean up."", '“Maybe a little bit more offensive zone time, some things we look at, but they played a good game,” defenseman Seth Jones said. ""They were solid defensively. They blocked a lot of shots. And we kind of knew that coming in there’s not a lot of space out there, not a lot of plays to be made, really. So, when we do get those opportunities, try to hold on to the puck and capitalize.”', 'The Oilers turned the puck over several times in Game 1, with goaltender Stuart Skinner saving them a few times from the score getting more lopsided than the 3-1 deficit they overcame. They figure to be much improved in those areas.', ""Coach Kris Knoblauch knows his team has to raise its level “because we know how good Florida is.” The blueprint has been out there for several years, and it's an imposing one."", '“They’re pretty confident with their identity, and they play to that identity very well,” Knoblauch said. “They have a lot of confidence that they’ll play their game and they should come out on top. For us, we need to just be ready for it – that they are going to be better.”', 'Boston – The Boston Bruins hired Marco Sturm as coach on Thursday to help the Original Six franchise get back to the playoffs after missing them for the first time since 2016.', 'The Bruins picked the 46-year-old German to replace interim coach Joe Sacco, who took over from Jim Montgomery in November and led the team to a 25-30-7 record – much of it after a trade deadline roster purge. Sturm, who spent the past three seasons as head coach of the AHL’s Ontario Reign and coached Germany to a silver medal at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, is a former Boston player – just like Bruins president Cam Neely and general manager Don Sweeney.', '“Boston has always held a special place in my heart, and I know how much this team means to the city and to our fans,” said Sturm, who was a Bruins left wing from 2005-10. ""I’ve felt that passion as a player, and I can’t wait to be behind the bench and feel it again. I’m excited to get to work and do everything I can to help this team succeed.”', ""A three-time Olympian and first-round NHL draft pick who played most of his 14 seasons for the San Jose Sharks and Bruins, Sturm scored 242 goals with 245 assists in 938 career games and is No. 2 on the league's all-time scoring list for players born in Germany. As a coach, he worked as a Los Angeles Kings assistant guiding the Reign, the Kings' AHL affiliate, to a 119-80-11-6 record and three playoff appearances."", '“His path – playing for multiple NHL teams, coaching internationally, and leading at both the AHL and NHL levels – has shaped a well-rounded coach who’s earned this opportunity,"" Sweeney said. ""As a former Bruin, he understands what this team means to the city and our fans. We’re embracing a new direction with Marco behind the bench and are confident his energy, standards, and commitment to a competitive, hard-nosed brand of hockey reflect exactly what Bruins hockey should be.”', 'Sacco, a Bruins assistant and former Colorado Avalanche head coach, replaced Montgomery 20 games into this season, but with the team unable to challenge for a playoff berth Sweeney traded away captain Brad Marchand and other veterans, and the Bruins stumbled to a 33-39-10 record overall, tied for the worst record in the Eastern Conference.', 'Only three teams in the league were worse, and CEO Charlie Jacobs said after the season that the results were “absolutely unacceptable” and apologized to the fans for the performance.', '“We owe you a better team, and we aim to deliver a better team,” he said after the season. “I share your disappointment and, frankly, embarrassment on how poorly things played out over the course of this season.”', 'Sacco was a candidate for the permanent job. Others who reportedly received consideration were Washington Capitals assistant Mitch Love, former Chicago Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson and Bruins assistant Jay Leach.', 'Montgomery, 55, was 120-41-23 in two-plus seasons in Boston. The Bruins finished with more than 100 points in each of his first two years – including a record-setting debut, when their 65 wins and 135 points were both the most in NHL history.', 'But the team lost in the first round of the playoffs that season and advanced to only the second round last year. The struggles carried over into an 8-9-3 start this season before Montgomery was fired. He was hired five days later by the St. Louis Blues and was given a five-year contract; the Blues reached the playoffs and lost in the first round in seven games to the Winnipeg Jets.', 'Heading into the trade deadline with a three-game losing streak that left them at 28-28, the Bruins traded Marchand – the only remaining member of their 2011 Stanley Cup championship team – along with forwards Justin Brazeau, Marc McLaughlin, Trent Frederic and Charlie Coyle and defenseman Brandon Carlo.', 'And they left Sacco on the bench to ride it out.', 'The depleted roster lost 10 straight games – the team lost only 12 in its record-setting 2022-23 season under Montgomery – and fell from possible playoff contender to the NHL draft lottery.', 'Despite the disappointment, the Bruins signed Sweeney to a two-year contract extension, with Neely saying it would help to have stability in the front office during the coaching search.', '“I am confident in the plan he has followed these past few months – and excited for what’s to come for our team,” the former Bruins forward said of the former Bruins defenseman. “The expectations in Boston have always been clear. It’s about winning championships.”', '(Edmonton leads 1-0)', 'Game 1: Edmonton 4-3 (OT)', 'Game 2: Friday at Edmonton, 8', 'Game 3: Monday at Florida, 8', 'Game 4: Thursday, June 12 at Florida, 8', 'x-Game 5: Saturday, June 14 at Edmonton, 8', 'x-Game 6: Tuesday, June 17 at Florida, 8', 'x-Game 7: Friday, June 20 at Edmonton, 8', 'x-If necessary']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9OMmhhTVdaR1kwbE9aUzAxVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhZElvQkpLZ2M=-w280-h168-p-df

Florida Man v Canada: how the Stanley Cup final became a proxy war,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/04/stanley-cup-oilers-panthers-hockey,"['Edmonton face the Panthers in the NHL title showdown for the second season in a row. But there are plenty of talking points off the ice too', 'T\nhis time last year the story of the Stanley Cup final between Florida and Edmonton was mostly about Connor McDavid, hockey’s generational talent, getting the chance to bring the Cup back to hockey’s generational home. And it almost went his way, after the Oilers overcame a three-game deficit to force a deciding Game 7. Instead, McDavid’s win came a little later. His series-winning goal against the US in February’s Four Nations Cup amid the febrile nationalism created by Donald Trump’s annexation threats and tariffs seemed to quiet the doubters about where hockey both belonged and who rightly owned its highest honours. But here we are again, on the eve of the final, with Edmonton facing Florida for the second season in a row – Game 1 is on Wednesday night – and with a team from that state contending for the Cup for the sixth straight year.', 'The easiest way to explain why the Tampa Bay Lightning (2020-22) and Florida Panthers (2023-25) have each reached the Stanley Cup final as Eastern Conference champions in three consecutive seasons is that, well, they have both been very good teams. You can point to some common elements between the two, like scoring depth, a certain level of tenacity and grit, elite Russian goaltending, and Carter Verhaeghe. But there has also been something less obvious or quantifiable about these teams. Some characteristic that they share, beyond the on-ice talent and performance. It may be Florida itself.', 'There’s the income tax rate, for one thing, in that there isn’t one. Given that, the common refrain goes, Florida teams have an inherent advantage when free agents are looking for a new place to play. Indeed, Lightning general manager Julien BriseBois confirmed it last summer, telling reporters that Florida’s “favourable tax situation” had helped entice players to sign. The Associated Press ran the numbers on Sam Reinhart’s new deal at $8.625m per year. In Florida, he will owe $3.15m in annual taxes – $1.1m less than if he lived in California, and $1.4m less than if he was in Toronto. Then again, there are no state income taxes in Tennessee, either, and Nashville finished third-last in the NHL last year. None in Texas, either. No Cups there recently. Nor in Washington. So, maybe there’s more to it – less bureaucratic and more geographic reasons, like the beach and the weather. Or it could be the vibe.', '“Nothing in Florida is ever quite what it seems,” former Tampa Bay Tribune reporter Craig Pittman wrote in his book about the state, adding that “in Florida, the crimes tend to be weirder and the scams bigger.” Florida is where all the “nation’s unctuous elements tend to trickle down as if [it] were the grease trap under America’s George Foreman grill,” Kent Russell wrote in the New York Times. Both writers made those assessments in the summer of 2016. Since then, Florida has had quite the decade. And even for what was already America’s strangest state, it’s been an interesting few years. Much of that is due to Donald Trump’s ascension to the US presidency – twice – not in his original big-suited, big-dealing New York City tycoon form, but as something much weirder, angrier, and noticeably more sunkissed: that is, as a kind of alpha Florida Man.', 'Of course, all of that might have had little or nothing to do with hockey had it not been for Trump’s personal vendetta against Canada this year, all but vowing to annex it as the 51st state. Or if Wayne Gretzky wasn’t such a staunch Trump supporter – a fact that has made him persona non grata in the country he once led to Olympic gold. Or if Gary Bettman (and Gretzky) hadn’t been hanging out with Trump-nominated FBI director Kash Patel at Capitals games. Or if a Panthers minority owner hadn’t called a Toronto Maple Leafs supporter an “51st anti semite loser” on X last month. But all that stuff did happen, both setting and capturing the tone of the season, hounded at every turn by a Florida Man. To no small degree, it would make an Oilers win all the more satisfying for many Canadians.', 'Still, even if none of that off-ice stuff had happened, there is still undeniably a high level of that brash, unapologetic, and moderately crazed Florida attitude in the Panthers. They might not all be men from Florida, but they sure feel like Florida Men. It’s by sheer coincidence that the Panthers’ spirit animal is not the team’s namesake cat but is instead a rat. But let’s be honest, it fits with how many see the team (and not just because Brad “the rat” Marchand plays there now – that’s just fate). Because, as much as you might respect the rat’s hustle or its capacity to survive against long odds – as the Panthers did during their 2023 Cup run, beating the seemingly unbeatable Boston Bruins in the first round – most of the time you want them to go away for ever.', 'Yet, the life of a rat is also a story of a certain kind of success. It’s no easy feat to find your way when everyone hates you. Still harder to do it more than once. “Part of Florida’s appeal is that it’s the Land of a Thousand Chances, the place where people go who have screwed up elsewhere and need to start over,” Pittman wrote. He was thinking of guys like Carlo Ponzi, creator of the Ponzi scheme. But you could just as easily point to someone like Verhaeghe, who spent six years in the AHL and ECHL after being drafted before the Lightning and Panthers gave him a chance. Now he’s a two-time Cup winner.', 'Connor McDavid and the Oilers have a second chance in Florida now, too. Another opportunity to make the rats go away. Of course, that won’t be easy. The Panthers are relentlessly tenacious, with an aggressive offensive pinch. They’re gritty, some may even say dirty. And they’ve proven that they can scrape and scramble to the top. Just like the state they call home.', 'This article was amended on 5 June 2025 to clarify that Game 1 of this year’s Stanley Cup final was played in Edmonton.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9OMmhhTVdaR1kwbE9aUzAxVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhZElvQkpLZ2M=-w280-h168-p-df

In a third consecutive final, the defending champions are unfazed by their deficit and appear well equipped to bounce back in Game 2 tonight.', '“We’ve got a lot of battle scars on us from the last few years, and we’ve been through way worse,” winger Matthew Tkachuk said Thursday. “We can be better, we can adjust a few things and come out tomorrow and try to get a win here and get some momentum going back home.”', 'A win would even things up and put the pressure right back on reigning playoff MVP Connor McDavid, Game 1-winning goal-scorer Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers with play shifting to Sunrise next week.', 'Even a loss would not put the Panthers into desperate straits.', 'They dropped the first two in the second round against Toronto and trailed 2-0 and 3-1 in Game 3 before rallying to win that night and beat the Maple Leafs in seven. Even for Florida’s newcomers, it was evidence that this team doesn’t go down easy.', '“You’re going to have moments in the game and moments in a series that you’re going to be riding a roller coaster,” defenseman Nate Schmidt said. “This team, I think, has an incredible ability to be able to not only learn from what they’ve done and apply their experience into situations like this.”', 'Coach Paul Maurice downplayed it as “just experience,” as though every team in the NHL or any sport knows what it is like to make this many deep playoff runs in a row and look borderline unstoppable. Because of that success, the Panthers are who they are, and not a lot of major adjustments are expected.', '“It’s almost always an adjustment back to form: We were a little off here, we can be a little bit better,” Maurice said. “Nobody’s changing a major system. It takes months and years to do that. You’re (talking about) adjustments back to form, but I think they have a pretty strong understanding of their foundation.”', 'Panthers players seem to have a pretty strong understanding of how playoff hockey works. They’ve won 10 of 11 playoff series since Maurice became coach and Tkachuk arrived in a trade from Calgary in the summer of 2022.', 'The only time they’ve been on the wrong side of a handshake line during this stretch was the 2023 final against Vegas, when Tkachuk was sidelined by a broken sternum and several others were playing with significant injuries. The memories of that and falling behind in series along the way stick with them.', '“We learn more from adversity than we do from winning,” forward Carter Verhaeghe said. “Every time you lose games or go through series where you’re down 2-0 or losing in the Cup final a couple of years ago, you learn a lot. It’s just sticking with it and being mentally strong.”', 'Tkachuk said he and his teammates are plenty strong mentally, so the tweaks will be more tactical. They won’t look too different but have some areas to clean up.', '“Maybe a little bit more offensive zone time, some things we look at, but they played a good game,” defenseman Seth Jones said. “They were solid defensively. They blocked a lot of shots. And we kind of knew that coming in there’s not a lot of space out there, not a lot of plays to be made, really. So, when we do get those opportunities, try to hold on to the puck and capitalize.”', 'The Oilers turned the puck over several times in Game 1, with goaltender Stuart Skinner saving them a few times from the score getting more lopsided than the 3-1 deficit they overcame. They figure to be much improved in those areas.', 'Coach Kris Knoblauch knows his team has to raise its level “because we know how good Florida is.” The blueprint has been out there for several years, and it’s an imposing one.', '“They’re pretty confident with their identity, and they play to that identity very well,” Knoblauch said. “They have a lot of confidence that they’ll play their game and they should come out on top. For us, we need to just be ready for it — that they are going to be better.”', 'AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl', 'Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

He shares the record with two other players participating in this series: Corey Perry (three in 2017) and Matthew Tkachuk (three in 2023).', 'Making the moment that much sweeter for Draisaitl was the fact that his parents, Sandra and Peter, were sitting directly behind the glass at the end of the rink where their son blasted the winner into the net, releasing a burst of euphoria for all parties concerned.', '“That’s everything,” he said, grinning from ear to ear. ""You know, they’re just like any hockey parents that are in that situation.

Edmonton dominated 46-32 on shots on goal -- and it was 24-8 after the second period.', '“They were pushing hard in the third [period] and we stepped back a little,” said Sam Bennett who scored two of Florida’s goals. The lesson? “Just not let up. Don’t sit back. We’ve been good all year not sitting back with a lead.
