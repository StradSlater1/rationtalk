KSR's five best candidates to take the New York Knicks job,https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/ksrs-five-best-candidates-to-take-the-new-york-knicks-job/,"['The New York Knicks had their best season in 25 years, knocking out the Detroit Pistons and defending champion Boston Celtics en route to the Eastern Conference Finals, coming up just two wins short of the NBA Finals — somewhere they haven’t been since Bill Clinton was in office. They had two NBA All-Star starters and All-NBA members in Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns.', 'What do you do when you come so close to glory with that entire ECF core signed on for next season and beyond? You fire the head coach, of course. Why wouldn’t you can the guy who led the Knicks to the playoffs in four of five years on the job — especially when you can pay him $30 million guaranteed after signing him to a three-year extension last July? The grass is always greener in the Big Apple, a city spinning in a hamster wheel of mediocrity, always convinced the next guy will be the one to get them over the hump.', 'This time will be different, I’m sure of it — and it won’t be because of Michael Malone, Mike Budenholzer, Mike Brown, Darvin Ham or any of the other obvious retreads connected to the job. Instead, KSR has gathered the real list of top candidates to take over the Knicks after Tom Thibodeau was fired on Tuesday.', 'He didn’t seriously consider the Kentucky job because he wanted to pursue a three-peat at UConn, then he did seriously consider the Los Angeles Lakers before ultimately turning that down (and the six-year, $70 million offer that came with it). That led to a Round of 32 loss and the Knicks job opening up a few months later — the one he’s always had his eye on as a lifelong fan and Jersey City native. If there was ever a time and opportunity to prove himself as the ‘best coach in the ****ing sport,’ it’s now and there, hanging tight in the Northeast as the face of arguably the biggest brand in basketball.', 'His wife, Andrea, would certainly appreciate staying home — one of the major talking points regarding Hurley’s candidacy last offseason.', 'The bigger question is whether the Knicks are interested in taking a risk on a college coach while in obvious win-now territory, no matter the two-time championship coach’s credentials.', 'Fayetteville was always the move before the move, John Calipari built for the biggest brands and cities, not calling the hogs with The Trough in front of a Wal-Mart slinging Razorback Nuggets. The Hall of Fame coach deserves better than Arkansas, and with Knicks president Leon Rose and Executive Vice President World Wide Wes leading the charge, bringing in a longtime friend in Coach Cal to team up with Karl-Anthony Towns and push toward the franchise’s first championship since 1973 is a no-brainer.', 'Plus, it gets him away from the SEC and one step closer to his return to Lexington as program ambassador. You know it’s coming eventually.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'It’s bad timing with Kentucky set to play St. John’s in the CBS Sports Classic this season — the 30th anniversary of the 1996 national championship — but Madison Square Garden is already home, and there is no one more New York than Rick Pitino.', 'I mean, you don’t even have to photoshop the NYC native coaching from the bench in royal blue and orange. He already led the Knicks to their first division title in two decades the first time around back in 1989 before resigning and making his way to Lexington. Could a return be on the table?', 'Pitino, now 72, has revived his image and career coaching St. John’s in that same building every home game. The darling of college basketball this past season, maybe he does the same transitioning back to the NBA? It’d be a full-circle move for a fanbase that knows nothing but nostalgia.', 'If he’s serious about this presidential run in 2028, becoming the Mayor of New York is a good place to start. There is no louder voice more passionate about the Knicks than the self-proclaimed expert, and if he wants to swing voters, a single championship run would do the trick. Smith called Leon Rose a “coward” for putting out a “weak-ass statement” after pulling the plug on Thibs, but maybe it was a calculated move to grab the franchise’s attention in what could be a very public job interview over the next several days. He gets to share his vision with all of the answers on the biggest platform on television whenever he wants, and now, there is a reward waiting for him if he wants it.', 'If Doug Gottlieb can do it, why can’t Stephen A?', 'I get it, maybe the white-knuckle coaching approach isn’t working for the Knickerbockers. Why get a screamer to replace a screamer? All four of the previous candidates could simply be more of the same. If the franchise wants a real change of pace, they’d get a young up-and-comer who gets it. He’s had the best seat in the house all year long, watching this core develop and come together up close — arguably closer than anyone, even Thibs. Surely he’s learned a thing or two along the way. And as one of the biggest rising superstars in the entertainment industry, he knows what it means to be a superstar in New York. At just 29, he’ll be able to relate to his players in ways no other coach could.', 'I’ll see your Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson and raise you Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner.', 'Best of luck, Knicks.

It's a challenging job in the biggest city in the NBA, and New York expects this next coach to pick up right where Thibs left off. There will be little time, if any, for excuses of acclimation to work."", ""While some possible names are splashy, a first-time head coach could also be on the table if it's the right fit.

Bryant is certainly an option after not landing the Suns gig, but Wright may already be off the table. CBS analyst Seth Davis recently posted on social media that it's incredibly unlikely he's interested in making the leap to the NBA."", 'Current NBA coaches Ime Udoka and Jason Kidd have been mentioned, though Houston isn\'t interested in giving the Knicks permission to interview Udoka. As far as Kidd goes, it\'s unclear where the Mavericks stand in giving New York permission, but according to an ESPN report, he ""would not dismiss the possibility"" of Dallas allowing him to interview for the job.', 'Some coaches who currently don\'t have jobs could be candidates for the position, like former Nuggets coach Michael Malone, Mike Budenholzer and Jeff Van Gundy.

It wasn’t just rotations.

It was an outdated formula. And the deeper they got into the playoffs, the clearer it became. The margin for error in today’s NBA is too thin for predictable offense.', 'But Thibodeau isn’t alone, either.', 'In fact, the NBA’s recent coaching carousel reads like a cautionary tale for anyone still clinging to old-school ideals. Just look at the last five NBA Coaches of the Year:', 'Three out of five are gone. And none were fired because they suddenly forgot how to coach.

He was then replaced by Paul Westphal. Years later, after nine seasons with the Nuggets, Karl was let go after the team won 57 games in the 2012-13 season.', ""Thibodeau spent five years with the Knicks, leading the franchise to the playoffs in four of those seasons. He logged a record of 226-174 across 400 regular season games in New York, but failed to achieve the team's goal of reaching the NBA Finals.

That includes his 2½ years with the Timberwolves, a period that ended with the tumult of Jimmy Butler forcing his way out, but also featured a trip to the postseason in 2018 after 13 straight years of missing the playoffs. It took a few seasons and a spectacular 2020 draft that netted Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels, but the Wolves did find their footing post-Thibs.', 'The Bulls were a 41-win team the year before Thibs arrived in 2010-11 and hadn’t made a conference finals since the last of their six NBA titles in 1998. He got them that far in his first year and two more conference semifinals, reaching the playoffs all five years with the Bulls before being fired. They have made the playoffs just twice and haven’t won a series in the decade since he departed.', 'And now the Knicks are gambling on this being true: Thibodeau is a coach that can make you better, but he’s not going to help you win it all. While he’s become flexible enough to amend his coaching priorities on offense and defense, his style is still to play a very limited number of players the maximum minutes possible.', 'It’s akin to grinding a pencil down so low that it can no longer be sharpened, which Knicks President Leon Rose said in PR-speak in announcing Tuesday’s move: “Ultimately we made the decision we feel is best for our organization moving forward.”', 'His tenure in New York was remarkably similar to his five years in Chicago. His Wolves career might have ended in similar fashion had Butler not blown things up.

He grew up listening to Knicks games on the radio and driving from his family's home in Connecticut to go to home games with his father. In the 1990s, he was a young assistant coach on Jeff Van Gundy's staff, arriving early each morning and afraid to be anything but the last one to leave the building at night."", '""I loved being here in the \'90s,"" Thibodeau told ESPN in 2021, during his first season as the franchise\'s head coach. ""There was nothing better than the environment at the Garden. We had great players. We had a great coaching staff. There were so many big games, whether it was Chicago, Miami or Indiana. But you know how life is. It goes by. You blink and all of a sudden, it seems like the \'90s was yesterday.', '""But I always knew how lucky I was to be with the Knicks.""', 'In his first season at the head of the bench, the Knicks failed to deliver on a promising regular season, one in which Thibodeau was named NBA Coach of the Year and Julius Randle was elevated into the MVP discussion, losing a first-round playoff series to the Atlanta Hawks.', '""I love the challenge of it all,"" Thibodeau said. ""When I went to Chicago, it was a .500 team and everyone said, \'Don\'t go there.\' But I loved it there. When I came here, everyone said the same thing. \'The Knicks, it\'s a tough job.\' But that\'s never scared me.""', 'He had spent decades building a reputation as a relentless grinder, which fueled his rise to lead benches in Chicago and Minnesota but also served as his downfall in both.', ""No one knew Thibodeau's strengths and weaknesses better than Knicks president Leon Rose and executive vice president William Wesley, both of whom had built a relationship with him through shared connections at CAA. Knicks owner Jim Dolan convinced them to leave their roles at the agency in 2020, making Thibodeau one of their first hires."", '""We meet after just about every game,"" Thibodeau said of Rose and Wesley back in 2021. ""They\'re going to always be truthful with me, I\'m going to be truthful with them. And I feel like I have a voice. That\'s all I need is to have a voice.', ""Like Thibodeau, Rose had grown up a Knicks fan. It was the only franchise for which he'd consider leaving the blue-chip client roster he had built at CAA. And he was also uniquely qualified for the job, having built a strong relationship with Dolan over the years."", ""The key to success in this role was first and foremost talent acquisition, which Rose had proved to be expert at as an agent. That's obviously different from how teams acquire talent, but Dolan bet that those relationship-building skills would translate to the front office. Equally important, though, was being able to manage the famously irascible Dolan and the famously brusque and hard-charging Thibodeau."", 'Rose was uniquely well positioned to do so, having worked closely with Dolan when his client Carmelo Anthony starred for the Knicks and having built a two-decades-long relationship with Thibodeau.', ""For five years, that's exactly what Rose did. Those who know them well marveled at how Rose kept Thibodeau from spiraling over minor issues and focused on the bigger picture. Thibodeau's tendency to wear himself out was fine, as one source put it. But Rose largely kept him from wearing out other people."", ""Managing Dolan was a different feat altogether. Rose did that by earning Dolan's trust with his methodical approach to team-building and by being right about when to go all-in and when to wait for the next hand."", ""Dolan said as much in an appearance on Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson's podcast in March."", '""There were times when [we\'ve] sort of reached for that shiny, sparkly object. \'Maybe this is what we need.\' Especially when things weren\'t going well,"" he said.

You really have to do the fundamentals, the basics. You\'ve got to build a team, you\'ve got to build an organization. There is no waving a wand over a team and all of a sudden make it a great team. It doesn\'t happen.""', 'Only Rose and Dolan know what changed from that statement in March and the decision to fire Thibodeau on Tuesday. Yes, Thibodeau had gotten the team within two wins of its first NBA Finals in a quarter century. Yes, he was the most successful Knicks coach in a generation, winning 50 games in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1994-95.', 'But they also had lost a series to the Indiana Pacers that many in the organization believed they should have won.', 'And eventually Rose, the man Thibodeau met with after every game, delivered the kind of honest assessment that Thibodeau once said he appreciated so much.', '""Our organization is singularly focused on winning a championship for our fans,"" Rose said in a statement announcing the firing.', 'The implication was clear: He and the organization did not believe Thibodeau could deliver them one.', '""This pursuit led us to the difficult decision to inform Tom Thibodeau that we\'ve decided to move in another direction. We can\'t thank Tom enough for pouring his heart and soul into each and every day of being the New York Knicks head coach. He led us not only with class and professionalism for the past five seasons, but also to tremendous success on the court with four playoff berths and four playoff series victories. Ultimately, we made the decision we feel is best for our organization moving forward.""', ""IN THE DAYS before Thibodeau's firing, Rose met with several key players and members of the coaching staff, sources told ESPN."", 'Ostensibly similar to the kind of exit meetings teams hold with players after each season, in this case, only a handful of players -- essentially the top rotation players -- were summoned to meet with Rose and Dolan to give their opinions on the state of the franchise and how the team should move forward.', 'Game 1: Pacers-Thunder | Thursday, 8:30 p.m.\nGame 2: Pacers-Thunder | Sunday, 8 p.m.\nGame 3: Thunder-Pacers | Wed., June 11, 8:30 p.m.\nGame 4: Thunder-Pacers | Fri., June 13, 8:30 p.m.\nGame 5*: Pacers-Thunder | Mon., June 16, 8:30 p.m.\nGame 6*: Thunder-Pacers | Thu., June 19, 8:30 p.m.\nGame 7*: Pacers-Thunder | Sun.

""We\'re great with him on the floor. We\'ve all got to be willing to sacrifice for the betterment of the team.""', 'While Thibodeau did pull some key levers to help the Knicks rally to extend the series to six games, they were far too late to change the course of the series -- or the rather public questioning of Thibodeau and his decisions.', 'It was not the first public critique one of his players made this season.', 'From the play-in tournament to the NBA Finals, ESPN has you covered throughout the postseason.', '', ""• NBA finals: Preview\n• Shelburne: Inside the Dorture Chamber\n• Collier: What's fueling Haliburton's run\n• Kram/Pelton: Seven things that will decide the finals\n• Kram: Why the NBA should be terrified of OKC\n• Pelton: Are the Pacers the best comeback team ever?\n• Marks: Offseason guides for 28 teams"", ""Earlier in this year, forward Mikal Bridges, one of the league's most durable players, went public with a complaint about how many minutes the starters were playing and said he believed the bench players should play more."", '""We\'ve got a lot of good guys on this team that can take away the minutes, which helps the defense, helps the offense, helps tired bodies being out there and giving up all these points,"" Bridges told reporters before a mid-March game in Portland. ""It helps us keeping fresh bodies out there.""', 'Bridges said that he had talked with Thibodeau and that the longtime coach understood.', '""Yeah, no, he\'s not really, he\'s not arguing about it,"" Bridges said. ""Sometimes I think he just gets in his ways and he gets locked in and he just wants to keep the guy out there. Sometimes you have to tell him like, Landry [Shamet], for example, or somebody, keep them out there, they\'re playing well.""', 'It is a criticism that has plagued Thibodeau for decades -- and one he has never reconciled.', ""That two of the team's marquee players went so public with critiques of their coach was alarming, sources said."", 'Then there were more general concerns about how much Thibodeau relied on Brunson. The Brunson-Towns pairing was initially wildly successful. Entering February, the Brunson and Towns pick-and-roll was the second-most-efficient pick-and-roll combination in the NBA, averaging 1.22 points per direct play. But after February, that dropped to 0.88 points per direct pick as opponents started putting a wing on Brunson and switching a center onto the inconsistent-shooting Hart.', 'Thibodeau never came up with an effective counter -- often forcing Brunson to bail the team out at the end of possessions.', ""He won the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year award because he happened to be very good in those situations. But Brunson's usage, which under Thibodeau has been the highest of his career, raised concerns."", 'One league source suggested history could serve as a warning precedent -- that Brunson, who missed games this season because of ankle and calf injuries, would struggle to hold up long term without a more layered or balanced offensive system, just as Derrick Rose had faltered when he played for Thibodeau in Chicago.', 'Stephen A. Smith tells Scott Van Pelt some of the names that he feels are capable replacements for Tom Thibodeau as the next coach of the New York Knicks.', ""ALL OF THAT might've been forgiven if the Knicks had beaten the Pacers, a team with less top-level talent but more depth and shooting, a fact plainly evident in that epic fourth-quarter collapse in Game 1, when Aaron Nesmith and Tyrese Haliburton conjured Reggie Miller's best Knicks-killing performances from the 1990s as New York blew a 14-point lead in the final 2 minutes and 50 seconds of that game."", 'None other than Miller was on the broadcast to rub salt in those wounds.', ""The Knicks went from seeing street signs around the city renamed in their honor and Mayor Eric Adams releasing economic impact reports on how much money the team's playoff run was generating for the city to abject dejection in one night."", 'All the hope and goodwill Thibodeau and the Knicks had built up after upsetting the defending champion Boston Celtics in the second round had disintegrated.

Thibodeau finishes his tenure in New York with 24 playoff wins, 17 more than the team's past 13 coaches combined, according to ESPN Research."", ""Why fire Thibodeau now, and where could the front office turn in its search? Which high-profile coaches could be available? And what other moves might follow now that one of the most successful runs in franchise history has ended without a title, extending the Knicks' championship drought to 52 seasons?"", ""Our NBA insiders examine every angle of Thibodeau's firing, including what could be next for the 67-year-old coach."", ""The theory of Occam's Razor says that when trying to solve a problem, the simplest solution is likely the correct one."", 'In this case, Thibodeau\'s time in New York ended because of the first line of the statement the Knicks released in response to his firing: ""Our organization is singularly focused on winning a championship for our fans.""', 'That, sources around the league said, is why a change was made. The Knicks decided a new voice was needed to lift this franchise to the next level, despite Thibodeau leading the Knicks to their best stretch of play this century, including winning a playoff series in three consecutive seasons and advancing to the conference finals for the first time in a quarter century.', 'After making a pair of splashy moves to land Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns last summer, New York often seemed like it was less than the sum of its parts. The starting lineup of Bridges, Towns, Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby was outscored from Jan. 1 through the end of the regular season and by 31 points in over 300 minutes in the playoffs.', ""The defense was at times an issue -- particularly against the Pacers in the conference finals -- though that shouldn't come as a huge surprise with Brunson and Towns operating as the team's point guard and center. New York could also shoot more 3-pointers and adopt a faster pace offensively."", 'Plenty of teams have made the same choice New York has. In the cases of Steve Kerr replacing Mark Jackson with the Golden State Warriors in 2014 or Nick Nurse replacing Dwane Casey with the Toronto Raptors in 2018 -- it resulted in championships. Others, such as when Adrian Griffin replaced Mike Budenholzer with the Milwaukee Bucks or when Fred Hoiberg replaced Thibodeau with the Chicago Bulls, went in very different directions.', '-- Tim Bontemps', ""The most obvious candidate is Michael Malone, who led the Denver Nuggets to the 2022-23 title before a surprise firing with three games left in the regular season in April. Over the past eight seasons, Malone's Nuggets led all Western Conference teams with 401 wins -- 28 more than the second-place LA Clippers -- which emphasizes his consistency as a coach. Malone wouldn't be able to rely on Nikola Jokic in New York, but his success working with offensive stars who have defensive question marks would make him a solid fit for the Knicks' roster."", ""It must be said, however, that the demanding Malone has a similar personality to Thibodeau, which could be a point against him if Knicks management wants to go in a new direction.

""You can stop one action, but then it\'s the next action, and the next action,"" Josh Hart said of the Pacers\' game plan.', ""New York scrambled to stay connected. In many cases -- the Game 2 loss, in particular -- Towns seemed lost trying to stay with Indiana's fast-paced, spaced-out attack. If this rotation is back fully next season, the next coach will need to consider changes to the starting lineup. Mitchell Robinson would give Towns a back-end defender more along the lines of Rudy Gobert. Or perhaps there's another rangy wing defender who could help Bridges and Anunoby cover for Towns' and Brunson's shortcomings."", ""Either way, the fix on defense figures to be a heavier lift than what's necessary on offense."", '-- Chris Herring', ""There is an old mantra in sports that you can't fire the players, so you fire the coach. The Knicks' decision to fire Thibodeau is the latest example."", 'A change at coach does not absolve New York of its roster flaws, which were evident despite a 51-win season and became glaring in the conference finals loss to Indiana.

Smith voices his disappointment in the Knicks for firing Tom Thibodeau.', ""Finding capable role players could prove to be difficult for New York this offseason. While the team's top two reserves, Miles McBride and Robinson, are under contract next season, New York has only the veteran minimum exception and part of the $5.7 million tax midlevel exception available to use in free agency. The Knicks will need to convince established veterans to sacrifice money elsewhere for a chance at competing for a championship."", 'The trades to bring in Bridges and Towns last summer left the Knicks depleted in draft assets and top heavy in salary, making a more seismic change difficult.

', ""It's a surprising move considering the Knicks are coming off of two seasons in which they won at least 50 games, and they went on to surpass expectations in the playoffs, knocking off the reigning champion Boston Celtics in the second round before falling to the Indiana Pacers in six games a few days ago. "", 'Thibodeau, who has been at the helm of the Knicks since 2020, transformed them from a team that missed the postseason seven seasons in a row into one that made the playoffs four times under his tenure.', 'But when a celebrated franchise such as the Knicks comes close to reaching the mountaintop but falls short, including blowing a 14-point lead with under 3 minutes left in Game 1 of the Conference Finals, heads are going to roll – and Thibodeau is the first domino to fall. ', 'Michael Malone', 'Michael Malone is arguably the best coach available after being let go by the Nuggets in April. (Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)', ""Thibodeau isn't the only coach who seemingly got the rug pulled under him this season. Another surprising coaching move was made shortly before the playoffs began, when the Denver Nuggets fired their longtime coach with three games left in the regular season. Malone knows how to win. He led the Nuggets to an overall record of 471-327 during his 10 seasons at the helm, including seven straight playoff appearances and a championship in 2023. Not to mention, Malone is a New York native. "", 'Mike Budenholzer', ""The Knicks clearly believe the franchise is close to being great, so it seems logical that they'd want someone with championship experience to help them take the next leap. Budenholzer is also available and fits that bill after leading the Milwaukee Bucks to the championship in 2021. Budenholzer was fired as the Phoenix Suns coach after a stunningly disappointing regular season, in which his team had so much talent in Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, yet greatly underperformed, failing to even reach the playoffs. But Budenholzer is a respected mind on both ends of the court and has a 520-363 record in 11 seasons as head coach. "", 'Jay Wright', ""Could former Villanova men's basketball head coach Jay Wright be the right person to wrangle the Nova Knicks? (Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)"", ""Even though Wright doesn't have any NBA coaching experience, this move could make a lot of sense. He was the head coach at Villanova from 2001-2022 and has strong ties to Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges, who all played for the Wildcats. Wright led Villanova to two national championships in 2016 and 2018. "", 'Mike Brown', 'The Sacramento Kings made waves when they fired Brown following a 13-18 start this season, despite him being named the unanimous Coach of the Year in 2023 and snapping a 16-year playoff drought that year. Brown is a defensive specialist who has been up for Knicks coaching gigs before. ', 'The reason why the word ""controversial"" was used above in reference to Thibodeau is because he has drawn a lot of criticism for playing his starters heavy minutes. Bridges, who averaged 37 minutes a game in the regular season, acknowledged that was taking a toll on him in March.', '""Sometimes it’s not fun on the body,"" Bridges told reporters. ""But you want that as a coach, and also talked to him a little bit knowing that we’ve got a good enough team where our bench guys can come in and we don’t need to play 48 [minutes], 47. ""', 'Five different Knicks averaged more than 35 minutes per game last season.

So, under a different coach, the starters could benefit from getting more rest, something that has been emphasized in recent years as an important measure to take to prevent injuries. Meanwhile, the reserves will get more of a chance to develop and prove themselves.

"", 'While the Knicks exceeded expectations this postseason, it needs to be noted that they beat a Celtics team that lost Jayson Tatum to an Achilles injury. Not to mention, the Knicks were third this season behind Cleveland and Boston and were 0-8 against those teams.

Tom Thibodeau is gone,https://www.thestrick.land/strick/tom-thibodeau-is-gone,"['The firing of Tom Thibodeau was not remotely surprising, though it was shocking. ', 'As much as Jalen Brunson’s defense or Karl-Anthony Towns’ Mr. Hyde or Josh Hart’s fear of shooting or Mitchell Robinson’s free throw shooting or the bench’s lack of more bench-ness, the Knick head coach’s stubbornness was as big of an issue as any going forward. And yet I never thought they’d fire him, certainly not less than three weeks after his Knicks knocked off the Celtics, less than 72 hours after his Knicks were playing Game 6 of the Eastern conference finals. Thibodeau’s gone.', 'If you’re a New York Rangers fan, you might be used to such whiplash. But for all his well-earned criticisms, both as a nepo baby cosplaying bluesman and a human being, James Dolan has not, over 25 years as Knick owner, made a habit of impulsively firing head coaches. This is pretty new.', 'Dolan signed off on Isiah Thomas firing Don Chaney and bringing in Lenny Wilkens right after acquiring Stephon Marbury, which always seemed unfair to Chaney. Wilkens returned the Knicks to the playoffs after a then-unthinkable two-year hiatus, then was fired midway through the following season. Larry Brown was fired for talking to the press and doing a lousy coaching job, in that order. Mike D’Antoni was fired because Carmelo Anthony was the new man in charge. Mike Woodson was fired because Phil Jackson was. Derek Fisher was fired after he [REDACTED]. Jeff Hornacek was fired and nobody cared. David Fizdale is the guy a good woman stumbles into at her low point in life. Nobody wants Mike Miller, but everyone needs him, often at their low point in life.', 'So Dolan canning Thibs now, especially, would be weird. Less weird than thinking Leon Rose all of a sudden, only this very season, realized – for the very first time! – that Thibodeau leans more toward the inflexible end of the coaches continuum. Or that Jalen Brunson, all but coronated King of The Knicks one year ago thanks to his basketball and financial efforts, went from cocksure regarding Thibs’ job safety a few days ago to signing off on it between now and then – or that Brunson was lying when he said this?', 'Whatever the truth is, it’s weird. Either presumably Rose and Brunson both supported Thibs’ firing, which would be stunning given everything we’ve ever seen or heard – why would they extend him last year, see him lead them past Boston and within two games of the Finals and then decide he’s gotta go? – or Dolan fired him despite one or both Rose and Brunson supporting him, truly the darkest of timelines. And what happens when a coaching candidate says it’s non-negotiable they’re bringing in their own staff and they don’t want Rick Brunson on it?', 'Some people think the Knicks, upright and ascendant and now trying to fly without their most — their only — successful coach this century are inviting an almost-certain backslide. Others feel they’d grown as much as they were gonna with Thibs, that moving forward meant moving on, with someone new. They’re both right. ', 'You’d think the Knicks making this move now so soon after their season ended means they have someone in mind who they don’t want to risk losing. You’ll find better odds of the next pope being Muslim than the Rose front office giving the public/media any leads on who that is. While I can’t imagine who it could be they’re risking it all for – Mike Malone? Jeff Van Gundy? – it’s hard to think it isn’t some big name. I wouldn’t think they’re shopping in the Johnnie Bryant aisle. ', 'Marc Stein says they like Ime Udoka. I like Bryce Dallas Howard. That doesn’t mean anything. I have no presence nor power in her universe. Stein also says they like Jason Kidd. Let’s move on. ', 'If Malone or Van Gundy were interested – both men have Thibodeau bonds – there are fears the new boss will be too much like the old, particularly in their non-Fizdalian levels of intensity and their love of big minutes workloads. Fair. On the other hand, sometimes the right culture is worth carrying on. Sometimes what’s needed is a new voice, but not a new direction. ', 'The Knicks followed Pat Riley with Don Nelson, which is like dating Michael Corleone and then Columbo. It didn’t work. It was almost immediately apparent it didn’t work. Tom Hagen took over and before you know it, the Garden is chanting Jeff Van Gundy’s name. As a lover of stories, I’m rooting for JVG to be the new JVG, the culture carry on-er. Fingers crossed Legs clutched.   ', 'I’ll miss Thibodeau’s brass, blaring sideline barks. The dignity of his rages, their humanity, a volcano always erupting but never in any direction where it might hurt someone; there’s something charming about a man who is constantly cursing, constantly talking to the refs, never getting technical fouls and in fact being one of their favorites. The importance of his quest, of one man with a vision being free to pursue it, however extreme, based solely on its merits. Another Doug Moe has left the center stage, quite possibly for good, and we as a basketball-viewing people are poorer for his absence. ', 'Thibs wasn’t the answer, but he was good for his half of the rent, and he cooked – breakfast, mostly, but they were good eggs – and he was pretty clean. Now the Knicks are sassy and single again. Welcome to the dating world. Hope they had someone specific in mind, ‘cuz if they’re just out here playing the field they’re gonna find – Thibs would appreciate this – the roster gets pretty thin pretty quick out here. ', 'But there is a depth of breath you only know when you go from suffocating alongside someone you know doesn’t fit anymore and breathing easier after leaving it behind. How often do we think “The answer’s obvious, but there’s no one who’ll do anything about it”? Well, someone, did. Gulp down that air while you can.

It all just depends on how wide the Knicks want to cast the net.', 'As the 2024-25 NBA season winds to a close, focus around the league (other than the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers) has shifted to the offseason. And with that, the trade talk rumor mill churns.', 'The Athletic’s Kelly Iko recently reported that “Phoenix is aggressive in pursuit of trading Kevin Durant”, according to team sources.', 'Durant is currently on an expiring contract and will be 37 years old to start the next NBA season. His most recent campaign was cut short when he suffered a sprained ankle during a game on March 30. He struggled to put weight on the leg as he was helped off the floor and did not return for the final seven games of the Suns’ season.', 'That’s not to say Durant is “cooked” or “washed”, though, by any means. Durant played 62 games for the Suns this season, scoring at least 30 points in 21 of those contests. He averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game shooting 53.7% from the floor and 43.0% from three-point range.', 'But, all things considered, the 15-time All-Star should come with a significantly lower price tag than he did back in 2023. In fact, it sounds like the ask may be coming down as we speak.', 'Iko’s report adds that sources also said that “Since the conclusion of the season, Houston has fielded several calls from Phoenix, who have since gradually lowered their asking price for Durant.”', 'Now, we don’t exactly know what the starting asking price was from the Suns, so it’s hard to guess what the updated price would be. What we can say is that it certainly sounds like Phoenix is trying to move the forward, if at all possible, and the Houston Rockets seem to be a frontrunning option for a landing spot, at least right now.', 'The trio of voices you’ll hear commentating the upcoming NBA Finals might sound a lot different next season.', 'With Game 1 approaching this Thursday, the three-person commentator team of Mike Breen, Doris Burke and Richard Jefferson is set to call the series for ESPN. The network, however, is reportedly considering changing things up after this NBA season, according to The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand.', '“While ESPN intends on re-signing Jefferson, it has not yet locked him up with his contract expiring, according to sources briefed on the talks. Amazon Prime Video has expressed some interest in Jefferson, according to the same sources,” the report says. “Meanwhile, Burke’s spot is not guaranteed for next season, according to sources familiar with ESPN’s preliminary plans. While Breen, the Basketball Hall of Famer under a long-term deal, is not going anywhere, ESPN will evaluate its entire roster.”', '(Certainly sounds like Burke is most likely of the three to be on the chopping block.)', 'ESPN’s NBA team has been through a tumultuous few years, mostly of their own doing. Back in the summer of 2023, 16-year network veteran and lead NBA analyst Jeff Van Gundy as well as former player and coach Mark Jackson were both laid off by ESPN, chalked up to budget cuts. The duo had called 15 NBA championships alongside Breen, and the trio had become an expected part of the finals festivities. ESPN had other plans though, apparently.', 'Doc Rivers was then hired by the network and ultimately joined Breen and Burke on the lead NBA team… for a little while. Just months after joining the desk, Rivers would leave broadcasting to take the head coaching job with the Milwaukee Bucks. Rivers was replaced on the analysts desk by JJ Reddick, who also left the post after just a few months to become head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.', 'The merry-go-round of partners has led to a commentary flow and fluidity that violently pales in comparison to that of Breen, Van Gundy and Jackson. It’s an awkward carousel, almost entirely of ESPN’s own making – and it’s time for another go-around!', 'Another Phoenix Suns update!', 'The franchise is hiring Jordan Ott, Cleveland Cavaliers assistant coach, as its next head coach. ESPN’s Shams Charania first reported the move Wednesday.', '“A pair of Cavaliers assistants, Ott and Johnnie Bryant, emerged as finalists for Phoenix’s coaching job this week and met with Suns owner Mat Ishbia, CEO Josh Bartelstein and general manager Brian Gregory in Michigan on Tuesday,” Charania wrote. “Team officials focused in recent weeks on Ott and Bryant, who joined the Cavaliers last summer as Coach of the Year Kenny Atkinson’s first hires, and ownership and the front office aligned on the hiring of Ott on Wednesday.”', 'Ott also reportedly has an important endorsement amongst the team, from Suns’ cornerstone Devin Booker, who has been involved in the search process. Charania added that Ott was “[Booker’s] top choice as well”.', 'Ott has been an NBA assistant coach since 2012 and was with the Cavaliers for 2024-25. The Cavs led the Eastern Conference with a 64-18 regular season record before being ousted from the playoffs in the second round by the Indiana Pacers. Before that, he had served as an assistant with the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets as well as a video coordinator for the Atlanta Hawks.', 'It is a tumultuous era for the Suns franchise, however, with Ott coming in as the fourth head coach in as many seasons for the team. The vacancy this time around came from the firing of Mike Budenholzer about a month and a half ago, the day after Phoenix’s 36-46 regular season ended. It was the team’s first time missing the playoffs and finishing under .500 since 2019-2020.', 'Now, focus shifts to the offseason that will determine what Suns roster Ott will have in front of him.', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

The Knicks Ran Out of Gas—So They Lit the Car on Fire,https://www.theringer.com/2025/06/04/nba/tom-thibodeau-new-york-knicks-firing-coach-offseason-rumors,"['The NBA playoffs are, broadly speaking, a Sisyphean exercise, and for the past seven weeks no team felt it more than the New York Knicks. They toed a thin line between joy and pain, fortitude and humility, enjoying some of the most incredible comeback wins you’ll ever see and then suffering through one of the most gut-wrenching meltdowns in league history. ', 'They barely squeaked by the Detroit Pistons, slayed the defending champion Boston Celtics, and then finally ran out of gas against the Indiana Pacers, for the second season in a row—this time in the conference finals. People can debate how good this team really was, whether championship expectations were ever that realistic. It’s hard, though, to zoom all the way out and not see them as resilient overachievers.', 'More on the NBA Finals', '2025 NBA Finals Primer: The Thunder-Pacers Track Meet', 'The Unlikely Symmetry of SGA and Haliburton', 'The 2025 NBA Finals Entrance Survey', '', '', '', '', 'On Tuesday, that perception curdled when New York abruptly fired Tom Thibodeau, a coach whose fingerprints were all over the Knicks’ deepest playoff run in 25 years—along with so much of the incremental growth that transpired over the past few seasons to make it possible.', 'There’s a world in which this decision works out well for New York; a scenario in which a more open-minded, strategically adaptable people person comes in and leads pretty much the same roster to even higher ground. It’s all technically possible, and we’ve seen it before, pending myriad unknowable variables, a bunch of luck, and the tactical wherewithal of whoever becomes the Knicks’ next head coach.', 'The reactionary nature of this move, though, is reminiscent of everything that came before Leon Rose was hired as Knicks president in 2020. When Rose was brought in, his first move was to tab Thibs as head coach, which then led to the most successful Knicks era in multiple generations. Thibodeau just led the Knicks to back-to-back 50-win seasons for the first time since the ’90s. But now we’re seeing a pinch of impatience. A dash of dysfunction. A sprinkle of self-sabotage. Thibodeau has his flaws, but he was also the essential stabilizing force this organization hadn’t had since the 1990s, when Jeff Van Gundy—and Pat Riley before him—walked up and down Madison Square Garden’s sideline. ', 'Initial reports after New York was eliminated last week indicated that Rose had Thibodeau’s back. But not even 48 hours later, Rose released a statement through the team’s PR department and confirmed the contrary. So what happened in that window? It’s not hard to connect the dots back to James Dolan—ESPN’s Shams Charania said as much on television on Tuesday—which is as disheartening as it is predictable. A well-tempered owner who leaves basketball decisions up to basketball decision-makers would not do this. But those who remember how embarrassing and retrograde basketball was in New York before the Thibodeau era began are sadly nodding their heads. ', 'We don’t have time to cover 20-plus years of futility and rejection here, but from 2014 to 2020 the Knicks were 184-374—a putrid 33.0 winning percentage that ranked dead last out of 30 teams. This was a raging dumpster fire of a franchise that played zero postseason games and employed six head coaches (Mike Woodson, Derek Fisher, Kurt Rambis, Jeff Hornacek, David Fizdale, and Mike Miller) over seven years. Then: Thibs! New York won 20 more games than the previous season when he came aboard. It jumped from 23rd to fourth in defensive rating, earning Thibodeau his second Coach of the Year trophy. Only seven teams won more games during his five-year tenure with the Knicks, and four of them (Boston, Denver, Milwaukee, and Golden State) won a championship. The guy clearly knows what he’s doing, and what he was doing brought the Knicks back to relevancy.', '', '', 'The case for letting Thibs go now essentially boils down to a belief that the inherent stubbornness that helps him raise just about any group’s floor can also lower its ceiling. He knows what it takes to win in the NBA, but (according to his noisiest detractors) can’t see the forest through the trees when it’s time for a philosophical shift. Rigidity can be extremely frustrating when absorbed for half a decade. His style is grating, rigorous, and, often to his own players, unreasonable. He played his starting lineup 226 more minutes than any other five-man unit in the NBA this season. Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart finished first and second in total minutes, and OG Anunoby was ninth. The rotation was tighter than most and every regular-season game was treated as a contest that had to be won instead of an opportunity for self-examination.', 'In reality, coaches who oversee a team that’s built to contend usually spend October through March tinkering with different lineups and combinations, trying stuff out just to see what works and doesn’t, with the long view in mind. ', 'As the rest of the league treasures versatility and switch-heavy schemes, Thibodeau’s Knicks routinely finished last (or near it) in the percentage of picks that see a screener’s defender switch onto the ball. That’s not a death knell, but speaks to a level of inflexibility—either with the team’s personnel or his own steadfast conviction—that can cause problems when the rubber meets the road and adjustments become mandatory.', 'But the Knicks did switch a ton in the playoffs against matchups that demanded it. Thibodeau did expand his rotation and alter his starting lineup when it was needed. To look at this particular situation and the job he did during this specific run, then believe he was the reason New York fell short, is a little silly. “Our organization is singularly focused on winning a championship for our fans” is how the Knicks’ statement began. Some of the criticism of Thibs is fair, but it should also be acknowledged he squeezed more than enough juice from every imperfect roster he was paid to lead.', 'The Knicks finally tasted real success this year, with Karl-Anthony Towns awkwardly entering the fray right before training camp began, and the immediate response to making a miraculous run to the Eastern Conference finals is self-entitled regression? Why? What was the expectation before these playoffs even started? Championship or bust? With a flawed roster that was spread thin and won more games than anyone believed they would? ', 'It’s easy to frame Thibodeau as a hindrance because he can always be replaced. Towns and Jalen Brunson are awesome, All-NBA talents in the prime of their careers. At the same time their individual weaknesses—as two of the worst defenders in the league at their respective positions—are amplified when they share the court. It’s a limiting dilemma Thibodeau tried to solve by keeping one on the bench during the fourth quarter of a couple of big games. And it might’ve worked had Aaron Nesmith never had an out-of-body experience. ', 'There was absolutely nothing wrong with keeping Thibodeau, running it back with the same core, and then using the $5.6 million taxpayer midlevel exception to add one more rotation player. Spencer Dinwiddie, Jake LaRavia, Al Horford, Trey Lyles, Kelly Oubre Jr., Chris Paul, Luke Kennard, and Tyus Jones are just a few names expected to be available at that number who might work and could bolster New York’s rotation.', 'Again, the decision to fire Thibodeau could work out, depending on who is hired to coach New York next and how the players react. It’s more likely, though, with the benefit of hindsight, that this move will be remembered as malpractice. Sometimes you move on from a head coach and watch their replacement implement a new system that infuses life into the same group. And sometimes you’re smacked with regret after failing to realize how good things really were until you shoved one of the biggest reasons for your success right out the door.\nEnd of article', 'Yep, we have one too', 'By submitting, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.', 'Most Read', 'The 2025 NBA Finals Entrance Survey', '2025 NBA Finals Primer: The Thunder-Pacers Track Meet', 'The Knicks Ran Out of Gas—So They Lit the Car on Fire', 'The Knicks’ Thrill Ride Ends—or Is It Just Beginning?', 'How the Gen Z Takeover Is Changing the NBA', 'Latest in NBA', 'Topps Wax Crisis With BCW Tim.

The decision comes three days after the Knicks were eliminated in the Eastern Conference finals by the Indiana Pacers in six games. The Knicks entered the season hoping to win their first championship since 1973 after spending six first-round picks, a first-round swap, Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo to acquire Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns in the offseason. However, despite their best postseason run since 2000, they ultimately failed to reach the NBA Finals despite having home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference finals.', 'Thibodeau won 56.5% of his regular-season games as Knicks head coach, going 226-174 overall over five seasons.', '""Our organization is singularly focused on winning a championship for our fans. This pursuit led us to the difficult decision to inform Tom Thibodeau that we\'ve decided to move in another direction,"" Knicks president Leon Rose said in a press release. ""We can\'t thank Tom enough for pouring his heart and soul into each and every day of being the New York Knicks head coach. He led us not only with class and professionalism for the past five seasons, but also to tremendous success on the court with four playoff berths and four playoff series victories. Ultimately, we made the decision we feel is best for our organization moving forward. Tom will always be a part of our Knicks family and we truly wish him nothing but the best in the future.""', 'The Knicks hired Thibodeau in 2020 to take over a team that had not reached the playoffs in the seven previous seasons. He proceeded to immediately change that, winning Coach of the Year for a 2020-21 campaign that saw the team post a 41-31 record. The Knicks missed the playoffs in 2022, but reached the second round in consecutive seasons afterward thanks to free-agent addition Jalen Brunson. With Brunson in place, the Knicks felt as though they had a foundational piece and were ready to go all-in.', 'Bridges, who played collegiately with Brunson and fellow Knick Josh Hart at Villanova, was supposed to arrive for the 2024-25 season as a second 3-and-D star alongside OG Anunoby. He wound up having his worst 3-point shooting season since his rookie year and declining considerably on defense. Towns proved to be a defensive issue in his own right despite thriving on offense.', 'Meanwhile, years of playing his starters more than any other coach began to catch up to Thibodeau. Bridges said publicly in March that playing so many minutes sometimes isn\'t ""fun on the body."" Yet Thibodeau did not relent and, partially as a result, the Knicks never developed a reliable bench. ', ""They didn't experiment with nearly enough lineups, either. One major problem that developed throughout the season was Hart's poor shooting. The Knicks couldn't successfully run pick-and-roll between Brunson and Towns because defenses were putting their centers on Hart so that they could serve as extra help-defenders. The Knicks could have countered this by inserting a shooter into Hart's place in the lineup, with Deuce McBride frequently mentioned as a candidate. But the starters minus Hart played only 82 regular-season possessions with McBride. All other Knicks combined played only 91 possessions alongside the four-man unit of Brunson, Towns, Anunoby and Bridges.

It wasn't always easy, but they managed to get by the Detroit Pistons in six games in the first round and then stun the defending champion Boston Celtics in six games in the second. With Boston defeated and the 64-win Cleveland Cavaliers eliminated on the other side of the bracket, New York had its clearest path to the Finals in decades."", ""Those hopes were dashed by the eventual Eastern Conference champion Pacers, and much of what went wrong in that series has been laid at Thibodeau's feet. Despite Josh Hart suggesting a starting lineup change in private during the Boston series, Thibodeau stuck with the most-used lineup in the NBA for the first two games against Indiana. "", 'The Knicks lost both at home, and their starters lost their minutes by 29 points. That unit was ultimately outscored by 31 points in the postseason. They were on the floor as the Knicks stunningly blew a nine-point lead in the final minute of Game 1, the loss that may have cost them the series. Thibodeau adjusted as the series progressed, even getting good minutes out of seldom-seen reserves Landry Shamet and Delon Wright, but that led to further questions about why it took two losses for him to use his bench in the first place. In the end, New York lost a winnable series in six games.', 'Thibodeau -- who signed a contract extension last summer that was set to run through the 2027-28 season -- leaves New York as the fourth-winningest coach in Knicks history behind Red Holzman, Joe Lapchick and Jeff Van Gundy. Now the Knicks re-enter the coaching market with a strong roster and a proven front office. ', 'The job should be fairly attractive, and with so much coaching turnover around the league over the past few years, there is no shortage of qualified candidates. But the bar is high here. Thibodeau came six wins short of the championship. Anyone replacing him will take the job knowing that the Knicks are in championship-or-bust mode.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Knicks coach odds: Here are the betting favorites to replace the fired Tom Thibodeau,https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/nba/knicks/2025/06/04/new-york-knicks-coach-odds-favorites-jay-wright-michael-malone/84027128007/,"['For the first time since 2020, the New York Knicks are looking for a new head coach.', 'In a somewhat stunning move, the Knicks fired head coach Tom Thibodeau just days after he led the franchise to its first Eastern Conference Finals appearance in 25 years.', 'In his five seasons in New York, Thibodeau compiled a 226-174 record and was named the NBA’s Coach of the Year for the 2020-21 season after he led the franchise back to the playoffs for the first time in eight years in his first season on the bench.', 'Thibodeau led the Knicks to the postseason in four of his five years with the team, making it to the second round or beyond in each of the last three playoffs. He posted back-to-back 50-plus win seasons, the first time that’s happened for the organization since the mid-90s when legendary coach Pat Riley did so.', 'Now the question at hand is who are the Knicks front office going after? It seems like you only make this type of move if there’s someone you’ve zeroed in on to be Thibodeau’s replacement.', 'With a hiring potentially coming sooner rather than later, here are the betting odds from DraftKings Sportsbook as to who will be the next Knicks head coach:', 'Odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook as of Wednesday, June 4:', 'Michael Malone: +125 (bet $10 to win $22.50)', 'Johnnie Bryant: +400 (bet $10 to win $50)', 'Jay Wright: +1500 (bet $10 to win $160)', 'Mike Budenholzer: +1500 (bet $10 to win $160)', 'Rick Brunson: +1500 (bet $10 to win $160)', 'Monty Williams: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210)', 'Taylor Jenkins: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210)', 'John Calipari: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210)', 'Dan Hurley: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210)', 'Analysis: There should be no surprise here with Malone as the runaway odds-on-favorite to be the Knicks next head coach. He also was surprisingly let go by the Nuggets with only three games left in the regular season. Malone has spent the last decade in Denver building the organization up as a legitimate contender, posting a 471-327 record (59% winning percentage), a 44-36 record in the playoffs (55% percent winning percentage) and ultimately leading the Nuggets to their first NBA title in franchise history in 2023.', ""Furthermore, Malone's also a native of Queens, New York and started his coaching career over two decades ago as an assistant coach and scout for the Knicks in 2003."", 'Behind Malone comes Bryant, who was the Knicks associated head coach from 2020-24 before leaving to join the Cleveland Cavaliers coaching staff last offseason.', 'Perhaps the most noteworthy names in the middle of the back are Jay Wright and Rick Brunson, who are both currently at 15/1 odds.', 'Wright was the leader at Villanova for 20 years, leading the Wildcats to two national championships in 2016 and 2018. A part of those championship teams were Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges, who make up a large majority of the core for this current Knicks team.', ""Rick Brunson is notably Jalen Brunson's father and has served as an assistant coach on Thibodeau's staff for the past three seasons while also having experience on the sideline with multiple other organizations on before Jalen signed with the Knicks in 2022. This option to me seems less feasible to me as I believe the Knicks will hire someone like a Malone, Bryant, etc. from this list or someone else who already has previous head coaching experience or was an associate head coach prior."", 'Gambling involves risk.
