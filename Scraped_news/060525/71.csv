Kennedy Says ‘Charlatans’ Are No Reason to Block Unproven Stem Cell Treatments,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/health/kennedy-stem-cells-experimental-treatments.html,"['Trump Administration', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '', 'The U.S. health secretary said people should have access to experimental therapies including unregulated uses of stem cells. But some methods have resulted in blindness, tumors and other injuries.', 'By Christina Jewett', 'Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently declared that he wanted to expand access to experimental therapies but conceded that they could be risky or fraudulent.', 'In a podcast with Gary Brecka, who describes himself as a longevity expert, Mr. Kennedy vowed to end what he called the Food and Drug Administration’s war with alternative medicine. He said that would include stem cells, vitamins, peptides and chelation therapy, which involves removing heavy metals from the blood.', '“If you want to take an experimental drug — you can do that, you ought to be able to do that,” Mr. Kennedy said.', '“And of course you’re going to get a lot of charlatans, and you’re going to get people who have bad results,” he added. “And ultimately, you can’t prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.”', 'Mr. Kennedy cited his own experience at a clinic in Antigua, where he said he received a stem cell treatment that “enormously” eased his neurological condition, spasmodic dysphonia, which affects his voice and has few treatment options.', 'If Mr. Kennedy does permit broader use of unauthorized or experimental therapies, he would be reversing longstanding efforts by the F.D.A. to monitor and sometimes police the emerging field. Experts, including some who support alternative medicine, worry that without safeguards, an expansion of such treatments could undermine legitimate development of new therapies.', '', 'Thank you for your patience while we verify access.', 'Already a subscriber?

Kennedy emphasized that the presence of fraudulent practitioners in the field should not serve as a justification for restricting access to such treatments. His remarks come amid ongoing debates about balancing patient autonomy with regulatory oversight in emerging medical technologies.', 'Stem cell therapies, which remain largely unregulated in certain contexts, have been linked to serious adverse effects in some cases. Reports have documented instances where patients experienced blindness, tumor formation, and other injuries after undergoing experimental procedures. Critics argue that insufficient oversight has allowed unscrupulous providers to exploit vulnerable patients seeking alternative treatments. Proponents of broader access contend that experimental therapies offer hope for individuals facing conditions without established cures or effective treatments. The issue continues to raise questions about how best to regulate innovative medical practices while ensuring patient safety and informed consent.', 'Newsflash | Powered by GeneOnline AI', 'Source: GO-AI-ne1', 'Date: June 5, 2025', 'Subscribe to receive updates.', '', '', '', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHhXR3AwY0RWclZuRlpkMHBTVFJEZ0FSalFBaWdLTWdaQlU0WXlLUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

And the FDA was kind of slow to pick up on this as well. And so what do we do about that?” he told me on this episode of the “First Opinion Podcast.”', 'That’s just one of the questions he says is currently facing regenerative medicine during a time of both scientific and regulatory upheaval. We discussed how to balance safety and efficacy, why Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is such a fan of stem cells, how the FDA can support the biotech industry, the forceful marketing of cord blood banking companies, and much more — including how to build a dragon using CRISPR.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '', 'Our conversation was inspired by Knoepfler’s STAT+ column, “Lab Dish,” where he writes about regenerative medicine.', 'Be sure to sign up for the weekly “First Opinion Podcast” on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.
