Musk’s job is to clean up the mess, even though some inside Tesla think he is part of the problem.', 'Today, President Donald Trump officially saw Musk off with a press conference in the Oval Office. “I want to thank Elon for helping,” Trump said, while Musk made clear he’s not done with Washington — a city where he has left plenty of appointees burrowed into the federal bureaucracy, and where his companies have a lot of regulatory and contracting business to conduct. “I’ll continue to be visiting here,” he said.', 'Musk’s track record as a government cost-cutter is up for debate. His bold pledges of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget when he started the Department of Government Efficiency have shrunk to about $150 billion, and even that is contested.

Nope, we’re not talking about a Cybertruck actually being sold – rather, that CEO Elon Musk has decided he’s attended enough dinner parties at Mar-a-Lago and it’s time to head back to more familiar pastures.', '', '', 'After his brand-destroying exploits as the chainsaw-wielding arm of the Trump administration, Musk has brought his political activities to a close (for now). Musk officially stepped down from his position in the Trump administration last Wednesday night, bringing to an end a controversial and widely criticized tenure as a senior adviser to the president and the unofficial leader of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).', 'That, says Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, is “music to the ears of Tesla shareholders.”', '“While Trump mentioned that Musk will stay on as an advisor, we believe that Musk’s days in politics are essentially over after this experiment that clearly morphed into brand damage for Tesla and took on a life of its own,” the 5-star analyst said. “With the rollout of robotaxi launch coming up on June 12th following the recent announcement that TSLA has been testing driverless Model Ys for several days already, it was the best possible news Tesla investors could have heard with TSLA’s most important asset now fully focused on the autonomous/robotics path.”', 'Musk’s involvement with the White House was responsible for a “20% overhang on the stock,” yet that has now been lifted. Ives thinks this “dark chapter” can now be put to rest, and from hereon in, Musk is all set to lead “this autonomous and robotics future.”', 'In fact, Ives believes Tesla is still “the most undervalued AI play” out there. It’s true, he says, Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision, just like Rome, will not be built in a day. Setbacks are inevitable, but Tesla’s unparalleled global scale and reach position it to lead the autonomous vehicle market – and potentially license its technology to other automakers both in the U.S. and internationally in the future. And that should set Tesla stock on a path to reach a $2 trillion valuation over the next 12 to 18 months.', '“We see the true autonomous winner as Tesla and over the coming year more investors will recognize this AI vision with Musk back in the driver’s seat,” Ives summed up optimistically.', 'All told, Ives assigns an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating to TSLA shares, along with a Street-high $500 price target. The implication for investors? A potential upside of 44% from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)', 'That exuberant take contrasts with most current TSLA theses. The stock only claims a Hold (i.e., Neutral) consensus rating, based on a mix of 16 Buys, 10 Holds and 11 Sells. Meanwhile, the $282.7 average price target implies shares will shed 17.5% over the coming months.

Dan Ives: This is going to be a golden era for Tesla,https://www.webpronews.com/dan-ives-this-is-going-to-be-a-golden-era-for-tesla/,"['Tesla is not just a car company; it is a technological juggernaut poised to redefine the future of transportation, automation, and human-robot interaction. With innovations spanning self-driving vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots, Tesla is on the cusp of what Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calls a transformative period. “This is really going to be a golden era for Tesla,” Ives declared in a recent interview with CNBC, encapsulating the boundless optimism surrounding the company’s trajectory. Under the visionary leadership of Elon Musk, Tesla is not merely innovating—it is reshaping the very fabric of how we live and move in the world.', 'At the heart of this revolution is Tesla’s unmatched ability to scale its technologies. Ives emphasized, “Tesla is unmatched when it comes to its ability to scale robotaxis,” highlighting the company’s engineering prowess and execution capabilities as key differentiators. While competitors like Waymo have made strides in limited markets, Tesla’s global vision and infrastructure position it leagues ahead. As Ives noted, “On the world stage, when Tesla gets to scale, everyone else will pay rent.” This isn’t just about market dominance; it’s about setting the standard for autonomous technology worldwide.', 'The Dawn of Autonomous Innovation', 'The upcoming robotaxi launch on June 12th in Austin, Texas, marks a pivotal moment. “June 12th in Austin is just the start of what’s going to be the autonomous vision,” Ives told CNBC, signaling the beginning of a broader rollout. He predicts rapid expansion, stating, “A year from now, Cybercabs are going to be in 10-20 cities.” This ambitious timeline reflects Tesla’s commitment to turning science fiction into reality, with self-driving vehicles poised to transform urban mobility by reducing congestion and enhancing safety.', 'Tesla’s investors have every reason to celebrate. “It’s a pop the champagne moment for Tesla investors,” Ives exclaimed, pointing to Musk’s renewed focus on the company after stepping back from government roles. This refocus is seen as a catalyst for growth, with Ives projecting, “We’re looking at a $2 trillion market cap for Tesla.” Such a valuation underscores the market’s belief in Tesla’s disruptive potential, not just in automotive but across multiple tech sectors.', 'A Broader Technological Ecosystem', 'Beyond robotaxis, Tesla’s ambitions extend to humanoid robots and broader AI applications, positioning it alongside another tech industry giant. “Tesla, along with Nvidia, are going to be the best disruptive technology companies in the world,” Ives asserted on CNBC. Projects like the Optimus robot hint at a future where Tesla’s innovations permeate daily life, from industrial automation to personal assistance. Ives sees Tesla as the linchpin of Musk’s empire, stating, “I think ultimately the golden goose, the hearts and lungs of the Musk ecosystem is Tesla.”', 'The road ahead is not without challenges, but Tesla’s track record suggests it will overcome them and likely exceed expectations. “The biggest chapter of Tesla’s growth story is ahead of us,” Ives concluded, capturing the electric anticipation by many surrounding the company. Tesla isn’t just building cars or robots; it’s crafting a future where technology serves humanity in unprecedented ways.

So these are very exciting things, and he is spending his time trying to do it. And when you get back to Tesla and what he is doing now, really, this interview was so interesting—it was almost talking about a reset, if he’s putting the on/off button on the Tesla experience for the year. Because he’s telegraphing to the investor that he’s back, there’s a huge challenge ahead that could change the conversation about the company, and that is the rollout of the driverless cars, of robotaxis. This is a gamechanger potentially for Tesla if he can execute, if he can pull it off.”', 'Investors are awaiting the Tesla robotaxi launch later in June. While the event can generate buzz, it is unlikely to resolve the company’s key issues in the short term.', 'Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.', 'Hadrian / Shutterstock.com', 'Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:', '“The underweight in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) contributed to performance in the first quarter of 2025. Tesla’s automobile sales declined in the quarter, in part due to factory changeovers that were required for updates to the company’s best-selling vehicle, the Model Y. This resulted in slower sales volume in the quarter. Competition from China’s BYD is causing market share losses for Tesla in several non-U.S. markets. The CEO’s position as an advisor to President Trump has damaged Tesla’s brand image among a cohort of traditional electric vehicle buyers.”', 'While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

"For Dan Ives, Tesla Outpaces Waymo in the Race for Autonomous Dominance",https://www.techi.com/waymo-stock-vs-tesla-stock/,"['There are two kinds of individuals in the self-driving race, those who are still gawking at robotaxi demos in trial cities and those who are strapping themselves in for Tesla’s highway domination. As Waymo continues to edge along with caution and city approvals, Elon Musk is looking toward a future where a vehicle doesn’t merely drive itself, it basically operates the software from the dashboard.', 'As the autonomous vehicle competition heats up around the world, investors are always in search of the most exciting companies to invest in. While Alphabet’s self-driving division, Waymo, keeps making news with its robotaxi tests, Wedbush senior analyst Dan Ives considers Tesla the true long-term value player. From scalability to engineering strength, Ives contends that Tesla’s advantage extends far beyond flashy demonstrations and into the arena of sustainable disruption.', 'Waymo has drawn attention to itself for rolling out robotaxis independently in very few selected cities of the U.S. Dan Ives identifies one critical limitation, which is its scalability. He said,', '“Waymo essentially operates in four cities … the question is: can it scale?”', 'Through years of development and research under Alphabet’s broad umbrella, Waymo still has not seen past niche deployments. It has a limited reach, which questions whether the company can transition from pilot to operational at scale. Though their technology is great, the business model and market traction are up in the air.', 'Tesla, on the other hand, is not starting with a clean sheet on its autonomous play. It has a worldwide fleet of millions of vehicles on the road, all providing real-time feedback back into its network. This closed loop enables Tesla to iterate on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system on an ongoing basis, based on real-world conditions, not test rigs.', 'Dan Ives attributes this system of learning in the real world as a major differentiator. He said,', '“When it comes to scale, I view TSLA as unmatched relative to engineering talent and the ability to scale. I believe we’re sitting here a year from now and Cybercabs are going to be in 10, 15, 20 cities”.', 'Tesla’s vertically integrated manufacturing, in-house chip design, and internal software provide it with a multi-faceted superiority over industry rivals still dependent on external suppliers and bounded tests.', 'Tesla shareholders welcomed Elon Musk’s recent withdrawal from his political advisory position in the Trump campaign as a pivotal moment. The move was declared by Ives as a “pop-the-champagne moment for Tesla investors,” indicating that Musk has his full attention on the company once again.', 'Musk’s return to Tesla’s operations is likely to speed up critical projects, such as the expansion of autonomous driving capabilities and the rollout of “Cybercabs,” a name given to Tesla’s future fleet of robotaxis. As per Ives, in the next year, these self-driving cabs might be in use in “10, 15, 20 cities.”', 'Wedbush is still very bullish about Tesla, giving it an “Outperform” rating with a brave price target of $500. It is much higher than the current consensus of EV stock, which currently sits at “hold” with a price target of  $309. The company views Tesla not just as an automaker, but as a revolutionary AI and robotics giant in the making.', 'Ives said,', '“I think we’re going to look at the next year or two as the golden era for Tesla.”', 'The June 12 Investor Day in Austin is likely to provide more insight into Tesla’s vision for FSD and its humanoid robot aspirations, which are two of the areas most likely to reshape the company’s image and market profile.', 'While Chinese rivals such as BYD keep closing the gap with low-cost vehicles and technology-enabled features, Ives asserts that Tesla’s global size, software capabilities, and brand value provide it with a superior advantage. Tesla’s capacity to innovate at scale and deliver across the globe positions it in a class of its own. Its vehicles aren’t mere cars, they are intelligent, upgradable platforms that become better over time, it is an advantage no incumbent carmaker or new player has so far equaled.', 'For investors willing to put their money on the autonomous revolution, Waymo’s narrow market penetration and absence of commercial scalability restraint its potential. Tesla, on the other hand, is already setting the infrastructure in place for mass-market rollout of self-driving technology, supported by information and manufacturing capabilities. Dan Ives said,', '“Leaders lead, the biggest chapter of Tesla’s growth story is ahead of us. Biggest asset for Tesla is Musk, and this ends what was really a dark chapter for TSLA investors.”', 'In the intensely competitive surge towards autonomy, Waymo may be the refined academic, with glossy theories, pilot projects, and an exemplary safety record, but Tesla is the street smart troublemaker making headlines and devouring market share in real time. Yes, Waymo may pass the test track, but Tesla is already making its way through the gritty corners of reality across the globe. With tens of millions of rolling data centers powering its neural net and Musk once again focusing on his technology, Tesla isn’t simply reaching for the future, it’s building it at scale. As the world of EVs travels toward full self-driving capability, for those who want to get in on the next wave of innovation in mobility, Tesla could be the ticket.', 'Disclosure: Some of the links in this article are affiliate links and we may earn a small commission if you make a purchase, which helps us to keep delivering quality content to you.', 'AUTHOR', 'Fatimah Misbah Hussain is a tech journalist at TECHi.com, specializing in government policy, cybersecurity, and digital user experiences.

Tesla would argue we should not be looking at May’s figures but what is happening this month with larger order fulfilment of the new Model Y.

The company hit a six-year low on Trump’s “liberation day”.', 'Discover IE made it plain: its model means it is flexible enough to switch output to the US; and its Asian rivals would be hurting far more from tariffs than it would.

Musk’s tenure was marked by ambitious goals to streamline federal operations and reduce spending. While the administration claims DOGE achieved approximately $170 billion in savings, critics argue that the cuts adversely affected community services and led to legal challenges regarding the authority and impact of the department.', 'Musk’s departure from DOGE has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters praise his efforts to bring private-sector efficiency to government, while detractors highlight the disruption caused by abrupt budget cuts and the lack of substantial reform . In a recent interview, Musk acknowledged the challenges faced during his tenure, describing the federal bureaucracy as “much worse” than anticipated and labeling the experience as an “uphill battle”.', 'Following his exit from public service, Musk has indicated a renewed focus on his private ventures, particularly Tesla. This shift comes at a critical time, as Tesla faces significant sales declines in key markets. In China, Tesla’s second-largest market, sales have dropped amid intensifying competition from domestic  EV manufacturers like BYD and NIO. Similarly, in Canada, Tesla’s sales in Quebec plummeted by over 85% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter, partly due to the suspension of federal EV incentives.', 'Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock has remained resilient, buoyed by investor optimism surrounding the company’s advancements in autonomous driving technology and the anticipated launch of its robotaxi service. Musk’s return to Tesla’s helm is seen as a strategic move to navigate the company through its current headwinds and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the EV market.', 'As Musk refocuses on Tesla, the broader implications of his brief foray into government service continue to unfold. While his efforts at DOGE sparked debate over the role of private-sector leaders in public administration, the lasting impact of his policies remains a subject of scrutiny and discussion.', 'Looking forward, analysts predict that Musk’s renewed leadership at Tesla will coincide with a broader realignment of the company’s sales strategy. Tesla is reportedly doubling down on affordability and domestic manufacturing, aiming to maintain market share in North America while regaining ground internationally.', 'With new gigafactories coming online and cost-cutting innovations underway—such as structural battery packs and simplified vehicle platforms—the company may be positioned to roll out a new, lower-cost EV aimed at competing with offerings from Chinese rivals.Still, skeptics warn that these changes may take years to bear fruit, leaving Tesla vulnerable in the short term.', 'Meanwhile, Musk’s public image continues to be a double-edged sword.His involvement in politics through DOGE alienated some longtime Tesla supporters who viewed the move as a distraction, while endearing him further to conservative and libertarian factions.', 'As he exits the political stage, questions remain about whether his controversial stances and policy experiments will impact consumer sentiment—and by extension, Tesla’s brand.', 'Add AUTO Connected Car News to your Google News Feed.', 'X ""Twitter"": @aconnectedcar', 'LinkedIn']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW1kRkZ2VTBWSGExUklkR0ZSVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtQlFKSW9HbWxNN1FF=-w280-h168-p-df

Nope, we’re not talking about a Cybertruck actually being sold – rather, that CEO Elon Musk has decided he’s attended enough dinner parties at Mar-a-Lago and it’s time to head back to more familiar pastures.', '', '', 'After his brand-destroying exploits as the chainsaw-wielding arm of the Trump administration, Musk has brought his political activities to a close (for now). Musk officially stepped down from his position in the Trump administration last Wednesday night, bringing to an end a controversial and widely criticized tenure as a senior adviser to the president and the unofficial leader of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).', 'That, says Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, is “music to the ears of Tesla shareholders.”', '“While Trump mentioned that Musk will stay on as an advisor, we believe that Musk’s days in politics are essentially over after this experiment that clearly morphed into brand damage for Tesla and took on a life of its own,” the 5-star analyst said. “With the rollout of robotaxi launch coming up on June 12th following the recent announcement that TSLA has been testing driverless Model Ys for several days already, it was the best possible news Tesla investors could have heard with TSLA’s most important asset now fully focused on the autonomous/robotics path.”', 'Musk’s involvement with the White House was responsible for a “20% overhang on the stock,” yet that has now been lifted. Ives thinks this “dark chapter” can now be put to rest, and from hereon in, Musk is all set to lead “this autonomous and robotics future.”', 'In fact, Ives believes Tesla is still “the most undervalued AI play” out there. It’s true, he says, Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision, just like Rome, will not be built in a day. Setbacks are inevitable, but Tesla’s unparalleled global scale and reach position it to lead the autonomous vehicle market – and potentially license its technology to other automakers both in the U.S. and internationally in the future. And that should set Tesla stock on a path to reach a $2 trillion valuation over the next 12 to 18 months.', '“We see the true autonomous winner as Tesla and over the coming year more investors will recognize this AI vision with Musk back in the driver’s seat,” Ives summed up optimistically.', 'All told, Ives assigns an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating to TSLA shares, along with a Street-high $500 price target. The implication for investors? A potential upside of 44% from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)', 'That exuberant take contrasts with most current TSLA theses. The stock only claims a Hold (i.e., Neutral) consensus rating, based on a mix of 16 Buys, 10 Holds and 11 Sells. Meanwhile, the $282.7 average price target implies shares will shed 17.5% over the coming months.

KEEP KILLING TESLA EVEN AS MUSK EXITS THE SCENE.,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/6/2/2325269/-KEEP-KILLING-TESLA-EVEN-AS-MUSK-EXITS-THE-SCENE,"['So now that Elon Musk is running off into a ketamine-fueled sunset to preside over his failing business empire, leaving government presumably forever, it might be tempting to shift our attention away from him. Musk would probably like nothing more than to publicly distance himself from politics—maybe even convince a few wavering Californians that, since he’s no longer openly riding shotgun with Trump, it’s safe to buy a Tesla again. Or at least okay to stop the Tesla takedowns. ', 'Don’t fall for it. Don’t let him off the hook.', 'Musk isn’t likely retreating from politics—he’s repositioning. Recently, he’s floated a few tame criticisms of Trump’s big beautiful bill, almost certainly in an attempt to appear apolitical and distract from his well-documented role as the GOP’s financial superweapon. This is the oldest trick in the Leonard Leo playbook: go quiet in public, let the money do the talking in private.', 'The truth is this: as long as Tesla stands, Musk remains a billionaire fascist ATM—an unchecked financial engine fueling the authoritarian takeover of American democracy. This isn’t just about ugly trucks and cringey memes. It’s about billions in overvalued Tesla stock enabling a single man to destabilize our institutions, fund extremist candidates, and shape our politics to serve his ego and ideology.', 'A few months ago, Rick Wilson of The Lincoln Project was banned from the Xitter by Musk for publishing an article entitled “Kill Tesla, Save the Country.” That censorship wasn’t about rules or decorum—it was a sign of real vulnerability. Musk knows Tesla is the linchpin of his empire. He just doesn’t want anyone saying it out loud.', 'Wilson’s piece lays out how Musk used Tesla’s bloated valuation to finance his hostile takeover of Twitter, transforming it into a propaganda outlet for the far right and how he funneled hundreds of millions into Republican PACs—$239 million to prop up Trump in Pennsylvania, $20 million to soften the GOP’s image on abortion, and $10 million to Mitch McConnell’s Senate fund. That’s not political engagement. That’s state capture, bought and paid for with speculative capital.', 'Tesla’s stock is Musk’s war chest. Every dip in value weakens his grip. Every blow to Tesla’s brand chips away at his ability to carpet-bomb the political landscape with dark money  And right now, that stock is teetering—down more than 50% from its peak and slipping fast.', 'Tesla’s image is already bleeding out. Consumers are waking up to the reality that the Cybertruck is a shoddily built meme-mobile, glued together and incapable of surviving basic conditions like rain. Tesla’s aging vehicle lineup hasn’t meaningfully improved in years. Meanwhile, even Tesla’s own board members—including Musk’s inner circle—are dumping shares like they’ve seen the iceberg and are already fighting over the lifeboats.', 'Musk’s erratic, fascist-curious behavior is turning Tesla into a radioactive brand, Nobody wants to drive a car that screams “I’m tight with America’s alt-right cosplay king.”', 'And here’s where things get even more fragile: if Tesla goes down, Musk’s hold on Twitter/X could falter too. He used Tesla stock to fund and secure the acquisition, and as the platform continues to bleed cash and ad dollars, it’s clear Musk depends on Tesla’s value to keep the whole thing afloat. A Tesla crash wouldn’t guarantee Twitter’s collapse—but it would shake the foundation of his empire and may force some hard exits.', 'This is the keystone. The golden goose. Tesla is what allows Musk to play culture war kingmaker—if we break Tesla—we break the machine that’s bankrolling America’s slide into authoritarianism. Even is Musk is outed as CEO his wealth is tied up in the stocks.  Tesla must die. ', 'Continuing to Take Tesla down could also serve as a potent warning, to other business men cozying up to Trump.  It’s bad for business. Since the only thing these assholes seem to care about is money, I think in the longterm it is one of our most potent weapons. ', 'But first thing is first. We don’t get to pretend Musk is beaten, just because we won’t be hearing from nearly as much.  He’s still a threat. ', 'Letting him drift off into space without consequences would be a historic mistake. If we want to save the republic. ', '', 'Was anyone planning to stop?', 'Not me !', 'I hope not. But just in case I wanted to remind everyone. ', 'It’s for sure a timely reminder for some people that it’s the value of this company which is a huge reason why he is so rich — on paper.', 'Tesla may have been a darling of many on the Left at one time but principles are principles. And, anyway, the shareholders had a very long time even before the election during which they could have done something about that asswipe. Fuck all of them.', 'We should also be thinking about a class action suit (possibly a civil RICO suit, since the standard of proof is lower and treble damages are allowed), naming Muskrat, among others, for damages from our private data breaches, plus all the excess, unintended costs from their DOGE-y activities. \n ', 'Since he wasn’t elected and wasn’t a gov’t employee, he would be personally responsible for his portion of the damages. That could end up putting all that dosh to much more productive use, like rebuilding the Social Security computer system right, and from scratch.', 'Agree.', 'We need to signal that behavior like his is NOT acceptable, and we DO NOT forget. Want to behave like a pariah? Then be a pariah. We don’t buy or patronize any of your businesses.', 'Maybe in the long term companies will think twice before supporting and/or hiring people like Musk.', 'This is WIRTHLESS if you’re driving a gas car.   Your still funding the oil war on the EPA. your still helping the Heritage Foundation.  \nSo no. ', 'Tesla is not the only EV on the market. Far from it, in fact. ', 'I think the X9000 glitched. Dave', 'The green revolution does not need Elon Musk.  He is not some sort of hostage in this.', 'Thankfully, i DO NOT drive a gas car. And its not a Telsa. So take the faux outrage somewhere else.', 'It appears someone did. Tesla stock has recovered quite a bit from the March low (when Rick Wilson wrote that Substack piece). Not sure why.', 'Some people have observed that every time it reaches a certain low share value, large transactions push the price up again. I don’t know if that’s true, but it’s significantly higher now than it was in mid-March.', '“And right now, that stock is teetering—down more than 50% from its peak and slipping fast.”', '1. Tesla stock peak was $436 it’s now $342, that’s not a 50% drop from peak, that’s around a 20% drop from peak.', '2. Tesla stock is up 40% since April 2025 and up 130% since April of 2024.

He was already predicting Cybertruck failure (although it actually failed much worse than he was predicting) and was commenting how Tesla was no longer the innovator it once was and how their cars were getting a bit stale while the competition was starting to really ramp up. He predicted that Tesla was going to have about only 15-25% of the EV market in about 5 or 6 years. He was even predicting that maybe Tesla may not survive too much longer after that. At the time I was skeptical, no longer. With the backlash Tesla is having due to Elon, to total failure of the Cybertruck and the massive growth of the legacy brands in the EV market, add to that the lose of the EV credit which hurt Tesla on EV and be just an inconvenience to the legacy brands, yup, maybe this is the swan song for Tesla.  ', 'Currently, only GM and Toyota have 17% and 15% of the U.S. car market for ICE cars, hybrids, and EVs. So if Tesla has 15% (much less 25%) of the EV market in 5 or 6 years when EVs will make up a much larger share of the total car market than they do now, that would put it far from bankruptcy. Tesla is definitely seeing lower sales even as EVs in general are seeing an increase.  But even so, for EV sales in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2025, among the top 10 best-sellers, at 131,000 of three models, Tesla sold more than twice as many of its as all the other models combined,  The next best seller, the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning for total sales of 18,794. ', 'All of what you wrote is true...and is a reminder that there is still lots of downward potential for Tesla if the car buyers in the U.S. were to start behaving as they are in Europe.  And with the declines in Europe and China, Tesla badly needs the U.S. market, so we do have a lot of power over the company.', 'And it’s not like it is a sacrifice to not buy one of their cars — exterior styling ranges from godawful hideous (Cybertruck) to bland (Model Y) to okay (Model 3), the interiors are spartan and overly dependent on the touch screen, and the company has largely quit innovating and allowed its product line to get stagnant while Musk makes ridiculous promises that the company repeatedly fails to deliver on.', 'I certainly encourage people to buy an EV.  If you want a compact SUV, you can choose a Chevy Equinox EV over the Model Y, saving close to $10k in the process while getting a better looking vehicle.  Or choose a Kia EV6 or Hyundai Ioniq 5 that will charge much faster than that Model Y.  If you’re looking at a sedan (some of us still want a car, not an SUV), The Hyundai Ioniq 6 offers distinctive styling (I have one and love it, but I know that not everyone feels the same way) and the same super-fast charging as the EV6/Ioniq 5 — and I can say from personal experience that it is a super-comfortable car that is responsive and fun to drive.  Mind you, there are also solid options from many other companies (Rivian, Lucid, Ford, VW) that you may want to consider — my list is not inclusive.', 'Nissan’s Araya is also an excellent car.  We love ours (better in every way than out last EV) and the lease deal was unbelievably good!', 'David OD', 'The Leaf+ is also very nice and the Leaf nicely exceeds it’s EPA range rating — by quite a bit if I go into ECO mode.  The local Nissan sales folks made it VERY clear that it did NOT have FSD and if you take your hands off the wheel the car starts complaining quickly.  That said, the driver assist/warning features are quite good (although I turn off the lane following feature if the road lines are faded or if there are a lot of exits).', 'Ioniq 6 here and love it', 'I’m definitely glad someone other than Tesla came out with one.  It might be my next car depending on if anyone else makes a sedan by the time I am shopping again.', 'The Kia EV4 is a sedan that is supposedly coming to the U.S. for (I think) the 2026 model year).   Other than that, I’m not aware of any other non-luxury EV sedans that are available or coming soon here (aside from the Ioniq 6 and Model 3).  ', 'Note that the EV4 is likely to be a little smaller and less expensive than the Ioniq 6, but also will not charge as fast since it will only have 400V architecture — but it should still charge about as fast as the Model 3.', ""I guess it's technically a sedan, but why did they try so hard to make it look like a hatchback?"", 'Since it is not a real common vehicle, it’s always nice to see one or hear from someone else that has one.', 'My favorite place for spotting another Ioniq 6 is now the one that I saw while visiting Germany recently.  My partner and I were staying in the small Bavarian town of Kochel and had walked down to the Kochelsee and were on our way back when an Ioniq 6 went zipping by.  The combination of a great car in one of the most beautiful places. ', 'I recently bought a Ford Mustang Mach E and love it. A couple years ago, I was planning to  buy a Tesla. I put that off when Elon warped twitter.  So I waited until the day before the tariff announcement and bought a different American brand. Better late than never.', 'Also a good choice.', 'I think that there are a lot of us who once saw Tesla as an aspirational vehicle.  What killed it for me was when the Model 3 came out and routed so many basic vehicle controls through that touch screen.  I didn’t like that from a usability standpoint, and I also found the spartan interior that resulted from removing so many other controls to be unappealing.', ""Musk has opened the company up for massive shareholder lawsuits by killing the Model 2 and then lying about it.
