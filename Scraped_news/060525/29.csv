Even more impressive was its adjusted earnings per share, which shot up 45.5% annually to $1.60, well above Wall Street’s forecast of $1.51. Adjusted EBITDA also surged 41% year over year, reaching $10.1 billion.', 'Breaking down the results, the infrastructure software segment saw revenue climb more than 47% to $6.7 billion. But the real growth engine was Broadcom’s booming AI business, which has become central to its performance. As a key supplier of AI data center infrastructure, Broadcom not only builds custom AI chips in partnership with Google but also provides the vital networking components that connect thousands of chips to power cutting-edge AI systems.', 'AI-related revenue alone reached $4.1 billion in the quarter, a jaw-dropping 77% year-over-year increase, helping propel its semiconductor solutions segment to $8.2 billion, up 11% from the previous year. This wave of strong results sent Broadcom’s stock soaring almost 8.6% on March 7.', 'As Broadcom gets set to release its second-quarter earnings after the bell on June 5, management is striking an upbeat note. CEO Hock Tan signaled strong momentum ahead, stating, “We expect continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue of $4.4 billion in Q2, as hyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.” ', 'The company is also projecting total revenue of approximately $14.9 billion for the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA expected to account for 66% of that figure, reflecting Broadcom’s robust operating model and the enduring strength of its AI-driven growth. Analysts tracking the company are eyeing a sharp 55.2% jump in Broadcom’s quarterly earnings compared to last year.  ', 'Broadcom recently scored a fresh vote of confidence from Redburn Atlantic, which initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating, citing the company’s dominant position in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) as a key growth catalyst. Analyst Mike Harrison set an ambitious price target of $301, the highest on Wall Street for now. And Redburn isn’t alone. ', 'With the company’s earnings on the horizon, AVGO is drawing broad support across Wall Street. Analysts continue to rally behind the stock, with the consensus firmly planted in “Strong Buy” territory, fueled by confidence in the company’s AI strength and robust fundamentals. Of the 34 analysts offering recommendations, 30 give it a solid “Strong Buy,” one suggests a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining three give a “Hold.” ', 'While the average analyst price target of $249.37 is below its current trading price, Redburn Atlantic’s Street-high target of $301 indicates that the stock can rally as much as 18% from here.

The members include some of the most popular in the market -- Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, and Berkshire Hathaway, just to name a few. Toward the end of the last year, the custom chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO -0.44%) went on a massive run and joined the exclusive club.', 'However, after the intense sell-off in April due to tariffs and the global trade war, Broadcom fell all the way below a $700 billion market capitalization. After the recent rally that has ensued since mid-April, Broadcom has now rejoined the $1 trillion club (as of May 28).', 'But one Wall Street analyst thinks the party has only just begun and that shares will soon hit a new all-time high.', ""While there will be no unseating Nvidia, long considered the king of the more general graphics processing unit (GPU) space, Broadcom has gained traction with its custom chips designed for more specific work loads. For instance, one of Broadcom's core products is its custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), referred to as XPU."", 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', 'The XPUs are supposed to be better for inference, which in AI means teaching large language models to leverage real-time data to see patterns and make forecasts that help solve specific tasks. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Meta Platforms and other key players in the AI sector like OpenAI to develop custom chips for their perspective businesses and AI workloads.', 'Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes views custom chips less as a competitor to Nvidia and more as a complement. ""Companies dual source compute from both Nvidia and Broadcom for flexibility around different workloads -- but all remain committed to both,"" Reitzes said in his recent research note. He also raised his price target on Broadcom from $198 per share to $283, implying another 19.4% upside from current levels.', ""Part of Reitzes' upgrade includes a rerating to value Broadcom at 30 times his projected 2027 earnings instead of a 22 multiple, because the analyst sees a realistic path to 43% compound annual growth in revenue from AI processors over the next decade. Broadcom has also announced new customers for its custom AI chip solutions, potentially increasing its overall market."", '""With 7 XPU customers now confirmed, the serviceable addressable market could arguably be increased later in the decade to a range of $140-$210 billion -- with Broadcom garnering well over $70 billion in AI revenue later in the decade given its market share at these 7 customers,"" Reitzes wrote. He also sees potential tailwinds as Broadcom scales its specialized networking chip business and implements larger-than-expected share repurchases.', 'The shares trade at around 36 times forward earnings, so a 30 multiple is not unrealistic if the company continues to add and retain customers. Broadcom continues to grow at a fast clip. In the first quarter of 2025, the company grew revenue by 25%, while earnings per share increased by over 300%.', ""Broadcom's customers also include some of the strongest names in the AI sector. Most of these customers are cash cows with massive capital expenditure (capex) plans. While capex may ebb and flow, the race to create the best AI solutions has only just begun and these large players are going to constantly need to innovate. I also think a stock that is working around or in tandem with Nvidia -- and not as a direct competitor -- is a good place to operate because then Broadcom can more or less feed off Nvidia's growth."", ""Sure, Nvidia will always be the main GPU player, but Broadcom's XPUs can be deployed alongside them and can help AI workloads hone in on specific tasks. For all of these reasons, I would have to agree with Reitzes and assume that a new all-time high for the stock is just a matter of time."", ""Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Earnings Preview: Can Broadcom Justify Its Sky-High Valuation?,https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/broadcom-avgo-earnings-preview-ai-vmware-focus,"['', 'EARNINGS PREVIEW: CAN BROADCOM JUSTIFY ITS SKY-HIGH VALUATION?', 'JUN 3, 2025', 'BY:GUS DOWNING', '', 'When you think about the 10 largest companies in the world, it’s likely the Magnificent Seven are the only ones that come to mind. Perhaps Berkshire Hathaway also makes the cut. But, rounding out that top tier of size is a stock that doesn’t get nearly enough attention relative to its $1 trillion market cap — Broadcom (AVGO). ', 'Broadcom is one of only 10 companies in the world to crack the elusive thirteen-figure market cap club, but investors tend to think more about Tesla (TSLA) or Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A) — two firms with comparable market caps. Be that as it may, Broadcom is scheduled to report earnings Thursday after market close, and the market is pricing in a serious move. ', 'Broadcom’s critical earnings test', 'Broadcom has been on an absolute tear as of late, currently trading up 85% year-to-date and pushing firmly through to a new all time high this week. Much of that gain has come in the past two months, with shares climbing on the back of demand for semiconductors and on investors’ enthusiasm for AI infrastructure. ', 'This move is not unjustified — Broadcom has been capitalizing on the AI boom in a big way, particularly through custom AI chips and networking aids. The most recent development, the Tomahawk 6 switch, boasts 102.4 terabits per second of ethernet switching capacity. Analysts project Broadcom’s AI-related revenue to grow by 42% year-over-year in the upcoming quarter. ', 'Broadcom’s forward P/E ratio has expanded to about 30x, which accurately reflects greatly heightened investor expectations in recent months. This hasn’t scared off analysts, most of whom have recently hiked their price targets for AVGO to the $275-$295 range, still 10%-15% higher than its current levels.', 'The options market is pricing in an implied move of about 6.5% after this earnings call (more on that later), and investors will be watching most pointedly for updates on AI revenue growth, the integration process of the VMware acquisition, and guidance on future quarters. ', '', '', 'Consensus analyst estimates for Broadcom’s Q2 report fall on earnings per share (EPS) of $1.57 and revenue of $14.97 billion, both marking a substantial increase year-over-year. Historically, Broadcom has a tendency to outperform these estimates, having beaten the EPS prediction in nine of the last 10 quarters. ', 'Historically, the semiconductor segment has accounted for around 75% of Broadcom’s revenue, and it is expected to remain dominant in this quarter. Investors will have their eyes on updates related to hyperscaler demand and custom AI chip development for major clients like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META). ', 'Broadcom has also been working to expand their infrastructure software segment, and the integration of VMware is anticipated to contribute significantly in that regard. Revenue estimates for VMware sit at over $2 billion for Q2. ', 'In their Q1 earnings report, Broadcom issued a forecast of $10 billion in AI-related revenue for this fiscal year. Any reaffirmation or upward revision to AI-specific guidance would likely be viewed very positively by investors. Conversely, indications of peaking or slowing AI demand could temper investor enthusiasm, regardless of quarterly results on their core numbers. ', '', '', 'Growth in AI revenue and hyperscaler partnerships: Analysts anticipate Broadcom’s AI-related revenue will reach $4.42 billion, marking a 42% year-over-year increase and a 7% sequential rise. The company is collaborating with major hyperscalers, and that could significantly boost revenue streams. Investors will be looking out for updates. ', 'VMware integration and software segment performance: The integration of VMware is expected to contribute approximately $6.5 billion in revenue in Q2, reflecting growth of 23% year-over-year in the infrastructure software segment. Updates on the process of this integration and its impact on Broadcom’s recurring revenue model could definitely move the stock. ', 'Enterprise networking and inventory challenges: Broadcom’s non-AI semiconductor segments, particularly enterprise networking, are facing headwinds because customers are managing existing inventory levels. However, improvements in the server storage business are expected to offset some of these challenges. The degree to which they offset them is a factor that could move the stock. ', 'Capital allocation and shareholder returns: In April, Broadcom authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program, signaling confidence in the company’s financial position and prospects. Commentary on the pace of the buybacks and any potential adjustments to dividend policies have the potential to move the share price. ', 'Forward guidance and market expectations: Broadcom’s revenue guidance of $14.9 billion for Q2 is almost perfectly aligned with analyst expectations. Any updates or changes to this guidance during the earnings call could significantly influence investor sentiment and stock performance. ', '', '', 'Broadcom is one of the top five AI-exposed semiconductor stocks, alongside Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Arm Holdings (ARM), which positions it as a key barometer for the strength of AI. If they beat expectations and raise guidance, it could trigger a bullish spillover into other AI-heavy names, particularly semiconductor stocks and software infrastructure companies. ', 'As a $1 trillion tech giant, Broadcom’s earnings report could also shape short term sentiment in tech-centric exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like XLK and QQQ. A beat-and-raise scenario could help sustain momentum in the current tech rally, while a miss may fuel profit-taking after this historic run-up. ', 'The options market is currently implying a 6%-7% move in either direction post-earnings, slightly above Broadcom’s historical average of 4.5%-5% in earnings weeks. With AVGO near all-time highs, it’s likely many traders will look to sell premium via short straddles or iron condors, while others may play directional breakouts with debit spreads or diagonals. ', 'Ultimately, this isn’t a call to buy or sell AVGO — just a look at what’s at stake for the company and the broader market as its earnings call looms. Whether you’re trading earnings season or simply observing, Broadcom’s report will likely ripple beyond just one ticker.', '', '', 'Gus Downing is host of the tastylive Network show Risk and Reward. @GainsByGus\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and #tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro. \nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.

Expectations are high across the board, and the stock has reflected that enthusiasm — surging over 30% in the past month to all-time highs, with investors pricing in both generative AI upside and a smooth VMware integration path.', 'Analysts are modeling $12.04B in revenue (+37.6% YoY) and $10.84 in adjusted EPS, with roughly $2.3B expected from VMware in its first full quarter post-acquisition. The remainder of the growth is expected to come from AI-enabling components — especially Broadcom’s switch ASICs, custom silicon, and Ethernet fabric interconnects, which are widely deployed by hyperscale customers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The company previously disclosed that GenAI-related sales were running at a $1B quarterly pace — and any update on that figure will be a core focus.', 'Broadcom’s results will serve as a high-stakes litmus test for enterprise AI infrastructure demand, especially given recent mixed signals from peers. Nvidia has flagged broad-based hyperscaler spend, while Marvell noted pushouts. Broadcom’s exposure is deeper in networking, and the expectation is for that segment to grow over 50% YoY, barring any cloud digestion pause.', 'Just as important is the VMware narrative. Management previously guided to 60% EBITDA margins on a combined basis and expressed confidence that early cost synergies would materialize faster than expected.
