Ukraine’s Drone Swarms Are Destroying Russian Nuclear Bombers. What Happens Now?,https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraines-drone-swarms-are-destroying-russian-nuclear-bombers-what-happens-now,"['Photo: @DefenceU via X https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1930259644317897100', 'Critical Questions by Masao Dahlgren and Lachlan MacKenzie', 'Published June 4, 2025', 'On June 1, Ukraine launched drone attacks against strategic airbases across Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that the strikes—dubbed Operation “Spider’s Web”—damaged or destroyed 34 percent of Russia’s strategic cruise missile–carrying bomber fleet. Ukrainian government sources subsequently reported that the attacks hit 41 and destroyed “at least 13” aircraft at four bases, including two facilities over 1,000 miles from Ukraine. Open-source satellite imagery and videos suggest that the attacks destroyed and damaged multiple strategic aircraft, but the attacks’ full impact will likely become clearer as additional imagery becomes available over the coming days.', 'The fact that cheap drones destroyed a significant fraction of Russia’s nuclear-capable bomber force is almost impossible to ignore. Past events suggest that Russia may respond with nuclear threats if it perceives Western involvement, but the scale of the attack may elicit a forceful response regardless. Further, the strikes underscore how other large militaries, like that of the United States, may be vulnerable to drone attack. Despite the attention paid to procuring new counter-drone systems, changes to organization, training, and legal authorities are equally important to filling the defensive gap. Guerilla warfare is now possible by air.', 'Q1: How did Ukraine strike Russia’s nuclear bombers?', 'A1: The operation involved 117 small, first-person view (FPV) drones, which Ukraine smuggled into Russia and launched from commercial cargo trucks near Russian airbases. The SBU—Ukraine’s internal security and intelligence agency—claimed responsibility for the attacks, which struck four locations: Dyagilevo Air Base in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo Air Base in Ivanovo Oblast, Olenya Air Base in Murmansk Oblast, and Belaya Air Base in Irkutsk Oblast.', 'Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed that attacks were repelled in Amur, Murmansk, and Ivanovo oblasts, but acknowledged that drones caused several aircraft to catch fire in Murmansk and Irkutsk. Commercial satellite imagery and videos of the attacks suggest that Ukraine destroyed or damaged at least four Tu-95 Bear and three Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers at Belaya Air Base, four Bears and an An-12 Cub cargo plane at Olenya Air Base, two A-50U Mainstay airborne warning platforms at Ivanovo Air Base, and an uncertain number of Backfire bombers at Dyagilevo Air Base.', 'Ukraine’s attack follows a series of record-breaking Russian drone and missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. The night before the attack, Russia conducted the largest wave of strikes to date, using 472 drones. The weekend prior, Russia launched a multi-day strike with over 1,000 drones and missiles that killed 15 and injured dozens more. Russian strategic bombers—including the Bear and Backfire—have played key roles in past strikes, and Operation Spider’s Web partly serves as retaliation for those attacks. The planning for the operation, however, took over 18 months, and the decision to launch the attacks on June 1 may have been more a matter of tactical opportunity than retaliation for any specific Russian attack.', 'Q2: Will Russia make nuclear threats?', 'A2: So far, Russia’s public response to the attacks has been muted. Russian media reporting on the incident has been limited, and Kremlin officials have been slow to comment. On June 4, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov urged the United States and United Kingdom to “react in such a way as to stop further escalation,” and the spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry alleged that the West provided support for Ukraine’s attacks. On a call with President Trump, however, Putin pledged to respond to the attacks.', 'Ukraine’s latest strikes serve as a case study on how Russia reacts to attacks on its nuclear forces. Kremlin responses to past Ukrainian strikes on nuclear-capable systems have been muted, provided they were conducted with Ukraine’s own drones. When Ukraine destroyed nuclear-capable Backfire bombers in July and August 2023, for example, the Kremlin responded with unremarkable MoD statements. The Kremlin’s reactions to Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil and gas infrastructure have been similarly restrained. Notably, while Ukraine’s latest strikes meet Russian doctrinal conditions for a nuclear response (Russia’s nuclear doctrine lists “actions by an adversary affecting elements of critically important state or military infrastructure of the Russian Federation, the disablement of which would disrupt response actions by nuclear forces” as a condition justifying the use of nuclear weapons), there are no public indications that Russia has changed its nuclear posture.', 'On the other hand, Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with Western support (real or perceived) have elicited more forceful reactions. Following Ukrainian strikes on Russian early warning radars (used for detecting nuclear launches) in May 2024, for example, Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov warned that Russia’s response could be “asymmetrical” and that the United States was “underestimating the seriousness of the response they may receive” for supporting such attacks. And after Ukraine struck conventional targets in Russia with Western missiles in November 2024, the Kremlin sent a clear nuclear signal to Ukraine and its Western supporters by launching a dual-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into Ukraine.', 'If the Kremlin concludes that Operation Spider’s Web benefited from U.S. support (as it seems to have done), Russia may attempt to coerce the West into restraining future Ukrainian strikes with intensified nuclear signaling, such as by using dual-capable munitions like the Oreshnik IRBM. And given the scale of Ukraine’s strikes, Russia may feel compelled to send a nuclear signal regardless of Western involvement.', 'Q3: How will this affect Russia’s military?', 'A3: The loss of even 11 aircraft would be a major blow to Russia’s strategic bomber fleet, which has played a central role in missile strikes against Ukraine. As of 2025, the Russian Air Force is thought to operate 126 strategic bombers, including 55 Tu-22M3 Backfires, 58 Tu-95MS Bears, and 13 Tu-160 Blackjacks. In addition, Russia operates only seven A-50U Mainstay airborne radar aircraft, used for detecting Ukrainian aircraft, missiles, and drones and commanding friendly aircraft.', 'Only a portion of the bombers that Russia has available are equipped for and employed in the strategic nuclear mission. Russia’s strategic nuclear bomber force consists of roughly 52 Bears and 13 Blackjacks, making the loss of 11 or more bombers a substantial challenge for Russia’s strategic airborne nuclear forces. Russia’s bomber leg, however, was already the smallest component of its nuclear triad: air-launched weapons account for only 586 of Russia’s estimated 2,832 strategic warheads, the bulk of which are deployed on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and ballistic missile submarines.', 'These aircraft losses are more significant when considering that not all of Russia’s bomber inventory can be easily regenerated. Both the Backfire and Bear bombers, the mainstays of Moscow’s bomber force, are long out of production, and constructing new Blackjacks to replace them has proven exceptionally costly.', 'It is also crucial to recognize that not all of Russia’s bombers are available for combat. In the United States, for instance, roughly half of the bomber fleet is under maintenance or otherwise unavailable at any given time. After strikes in 2023, Ukraine’s intelligence chief estimated that Russia possessed only 27 Backfires “that can actually fly.” If the aircraft Ukraine hit were combat-ready, the strike would disproportionately impact Russia’s air operations.', 'Q4: Is the United States prepared for similar kinds of attacks?', 'A4: The United States, like Russia, has long leaned on its geographic depth to secure itself against threats. Attacks such as these are a reminder that this protection only extends so far.', 'Though drone incursions have continued for years, low-flying, low-cost, and unanticipated air threats remain a challenge for air defenders. In January 2024, drone incursions inflicted the first deadly air attack on American soldiers since the Korean War, killing three in Iraq. Between August 2023 and April 2024, just one Army Brigade Combat Team faced 170 drone attacks. While U.S. forces abroad now possess first-generation systems for countering small drones, dense, comprehensive coverage of homeland infrastructure remains further off.', 'These concerns have persisted long before drone attacks became frequent. Two decades ago, U.S. forces in Kuwait struggled to intercept Saddam Hussein’s inaccurate, low-flying cruise missiles, lacking the sensors to detect them at range. In 2015, a disgruntled postal worker flew a low-flying gyrocopter onto the Capitol lawn, penetrating protected airspace undetected. The event, which took place after years of stalled investment in cruise missile defense, prompted soul-searching over the United States’ readiness to detect low-flying drone and cruise missile threats.', 'Since then, the Department of Defense has rushed to deploy countermeasures for small drone threats, particularly for forces stationed abroad. After the earliest counter-drone exercises in 2013, the Army and Marine Corps have outfitted their air defense units with new weapons, like M-LIDS, a radar-and-cannon-equipped truck, or the Coyote interceptor, purchasing 690 rounds at $130,000 apiece in fiscal year 2025. These and other systems have now seen frequent use in the Middle East.', 'However, gaps remain in defending bases and critical infrastructure within the United States. While the Pentagon has started new efforts to scale homeland defense, new widgets alone are insufficient. Deploying systems domestically will demand careful coordination between the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration, and state and local governments, requiring new legal authorities.', 'Further, while the Department of Defense designated the Army, and its Joint Counter-Small UAS Office (JCO), to synchronize activities and test potential solutions, each military service acquires systems and develops doctrine individually. Increased coordination, however, may be needed when considering more ambitious approaches for homeland drone defense.', 'Finally, efforts to build more training infrastructure, courses, and personnel must be accelerated. As Army Major General Scott Naumann has emphasized, counter-drone training must not be limited to specific personnel, but taught to all—“as routine as drawing our rifles.”', 'Q5: What could this mean going forward?', 'A5: In some respects, the strike is a watershed moment for air warfare. Such a coordinated air attack, covertly launched from deep in enemy territory, has not been performed at such a scale before. Moreover, key elements of the attack were automated. Drones independently located and struck targets, with artificial intelligence trained to visually recognize Russian aircraft. As military strategist T.X. Hammes predicted over a decade ago, off-the-shelf drones achieved strategic effects against larger, traditional air forces.', 'In other dimensions, however, the attack is better understood as a culmination of existing trends. The level of autonomy employed, for instance, has established precedents. The United States has long experimented with automated one-way attack drones, prototyping munitions like the Low Cost Autonomous Attack System (LOCAAS) and related concepts over 20 years ago. Indeed, large militaries already field automated one-way attack drones in the form of anti-ship missiles, which can automatically detect and discriminate targets without external direction.', 'What has changed is perspective and scale. Where wealthier militaries have often viewed drones as complements to ships, aircraft, and other manned platforms, Ukraine has been forced to develop concepts for using them independently. As other CSIS experts have observed, low-cost unmanned systems have allowed Ukraine to employ novel doctrines for special operations. Moreover, the scale of the attack underscores how traditional notions of air superiority break down. Suppressing enemy air forces no longer assures that skies will be safe; there is now an “air littoral”—a domain of lower-altitude, lower-end drone threats—that must be secured. The June 1 attack highlights an ongoing revolution in asymmetric warfare by air.', 'Masao Dahlgren is a fellow with the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

Security officials say the shock incursion took 18 months to plan and saw many drones smuggled into Russia.', 'The SBU video is almost five minutes long and consists of edited footage taken by drones in the process of conducting attacks on Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya airbases.', 'In each shot the feed cuts out before any explosion, but in some instances we see other planes on fire in the background.', 'At no point do we see any indication of defensive measures from Russian forces, even after the attack was clearly well underway.', 'Many of the aircraft are covered in tyres - a Russian tactic said to be aimed at mitigating against drone strikes.', 'Some of the aircraft are seen apparently loaded with cruise missiles and well fuelled - judging by the extent and spread of fires. This suggests they were prepared to conduct strikes.', '', 'The clearest satellite imagery covers Olenya and Belaya and shows five damaged or destroyed planes at the former and seven at the latter.', 'Olenya is a major Russian airbase in the north-west of the country.', 'The SBU footage shows smoke pouring from three aircraft, identified as Tu-95 strategic bombers and an approach to a fourth.

The Guardian view on Ukraine’s spectacular attack: 21st-century tactics still require support from allies,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-spectacular-attack-21st-century-tactics-still-require-support-from-allies,"['The strikes on Russian airbases are further evidence of Kyiv’s innovation. Imagination and skill can bolster external backing – but can’t replace it', 'S\nince Donald Trump scolded Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the words “You don’t have the cards right now,” Ukraine has been keener than ever to demonstrate that it has a few up its sleeve. On Sunday it showed its hand with an extraordinary, audacious drone attack on multiple bases deep inside Russia, which it says damaged 41 aircraft.', 'Operation Spiderweb, which saw the smuggled drones released from their hiding places in wooden sheds and remotely piloted to their targets, was swiftly followed by another attack on Crimea’s Kerch bridge using underwater explosives. Kyiv – often coy in such cases – was unusually swift to claim both incidents, but has not taken responsibility for two railway bridge attacks which Russia says led to the deaths of seven passengers at the weekend.', 'There is obvious satisfaction in hitting Russian bombers and surveillance planes used against Ukrainian civilians, and Spiderweb’s unexpected method will surely force Russia to think harder about defence. But the greater significance lies in its potential impact on domestic morale and international support. Ukraine has repeatedly surprised both its enemy and its allies throughout this war. Unexpected successes such as the Kursk incursion have changed the narrative at critical moments. Meticulously planned, and reportedly 18 months in the making, the latest operation must make Russia wonder what else may be on the way.', 'It was also spectacular enough to make Mr Trump pay attention. The US president reportedly judged the attack to be “badass”. But his cosy phone chats with Vladimir Putin appear to be locking in his tilt towards Moscow. On Wednesday he said that, in a “good” conversation, Mr Putin had said he would have to respond. It did not appear to have occurred to the US president that discouraging retaliation might be desirable. He should be challenging Kremlin talking points instead of amplifying them. If Ukraine hoped to dispel the nuclear spectre which Russia has repeatedly summoned up, Mr Trump seems to be still in its thrall – with some of those around him talking up the threat again.', 'The Center for Strategic and International Studies argued in a report this week that Russia’s military performance has been notably poor in this war, with gains coming at a strikingly high cost in terms of both equipment and personnel – hitting an estimated million casualties this summer. But Russia still has many more cards. It continues to grind out its advance, and in late May it launched its largest drone and missile assault on Ukraine to date. Its war of attrition may look old-fashioned compared with Kyiv’s innovations, but it still hurts. Meanwhile, talks in Istanbul have produced agreement on a prisoner exchange but no movement towards peace.', 'There appears to be growing support in the US Senate for further sanctions on Russia, but Lindsey Graham is unlikely to move without Mr Trump’s acquiescence, and there is little sign of progress in the House. Pete Hegseth did not attend the session on Ukraine at Thursday’s gathering of defence ministers ahead of this month’s Nato summit – a telling absence, though the Pentagon blamed scheduling issues. Kyiv needs and deserves increased support from Washington, but damage limitation looks like a more realistic aspiration.', 'Ukraine continues to surprise, and to shift its approach as circumstances demand. Unfortunately, there is little sign of the US president, capricious as he is, changing course on this conflict.', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No title found,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/after-ukraines-innovative-airbase-attacks-nowhere-in-russia-is-safe/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'UkraineAlert', 'June 3, 2025 • 4:55pm ET', 'By David Kirichenko', 'Ukraine carried out one of the most audacious operations in modern military history on June 1, using swarms of smuggled drones to strike four Russian airbases simultaneously and destroy a significant portion of Putin’s bomber fleet. While the full extent of the damage remains disputed, open source evidence has already confirmed that Russia lost at least ten strategic bombers and possibly many more.', 'The attack highlighted Ukraine’s innovative use of military technologies and confirmed the country’s status as a world leader in the rapidly evolving art of drone warfare. Crucially, it also underlined Kyiv’s ability to conduct complex offensive operations deep inside Russia. This will force the Kremlin to radically rethink its domestic security stance, which could lead to the diversion of resources away from the invasion of Ukraine.', 'According to Ukrainian sources, preparations for Operation Spider’s Web had been underway since late 2023. Ukraine was able to move a series of modified cargo containers into Russia along with more than one hundred first-person view (FPV) drones. The containers were then loaded with the drones and mounted on lorries before being moved into position close to Russian airbases. On Sunday morning, the green light was given and the drones were remotely activated, emerging from their containers to strike nearby Russian bombers.', 'The bombers targeted in these drone attacks play a key role in Russia’s air war and are regularly used to launch cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities. While Ukraine’s June 1 success will not bring this bombing campaign to an end, it may help save Ukrainian lives by reducing the number of available planes and forcing Russia to disperse its remaining strategic bombers to locations further away from Ukraine.', 'While any reduction on Russia’s ability to bomb Ukrainian civilians is welcome, the impact of Ukraine’s airbase attacks on the future course of the war is likely to be far more profound. Sunday’s Ukrainian strikes at locations across Russia have transformed the situation on Putin’s home front. Since the onset of Russia’s full-scale invasion more than three years ago, Russians have grown accustomed to viewing the war as something that is taking place far away. That sense of security has now been shattered.', '', '', 'This was not the first time Ukraine has struck deep inside Russia. For much of the war, Ukraine has been using its growing fleet of long-range drones to target Russian military bases and the country’s oil and gas industry. Russian Air Force hubs such as the Engels airbase in Saratov Oblast have been hit multiple times.', 'Ukraine’s attacks have gained momentum as the country’s long-range drone fleet has evolved and as Kyiv has developed its own missile capabilities. This mounting proficiency has not gone unnoticed internationally. Indeed, China reportedly asked Ukraine to refrain from attacking Moscow during the recent Victory Day parade on May 9, as Beijing was apparently unsure whether the Russians themselves could provide sufficient protection for the visiting Chinese leader.', 'Sunday’s operation represents a new stage in Ukraine’s efforts to bring Putin’s invasion home to Russia. By deploying large numbers of drones surreptitiously across the Russian Federation and activating them remotely, Ukraine demonstrated an ability to strike anywhere without warning. The consequences of this are potentially far-reaching. Russia must now increase security at every single military base, military-industrial site, command center, and transport hub throughout the country.', 'In addition to ramping up defensive measures around military infrastructure, Russia must also introduce further checks at the country’s borders and closely monitor all activity along endless highways stretching from Europe’s eastern frontier to the Pacific Ocean. This is a logistical nightmare. For example, thanks to Ukraine’s attack, all cargo containers must now be treated with suspicion. There are already reports of bottlenecks emerging at locations across Russia as alarmed officials inspect lorries in the hunt for more Ukrainian drones.', 'Given the colossal size of the Russian Federation, addressing the threat posed by Ukraine’s Trojan Horse tactics is a truly Herculean task. Russia’s vastness has traditionally been viewed as one of the country’s greatest strengths. The new form of warfare being pioneered by Ukraine could now turn this size into a major weakness. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that Ukraine does not “have any cards” in its war with Russia, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may just have played the ace of drones.', 'David Kirichenko\u202fis an associate research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society.', 'UkraineAlert\nMay 29, 2025', 'By David Kirichenko', 'Russia’s emphasis on fiber optic drones is giving it a battlefield edge over Ukraine and may help Putin achieve a long hoped for breakthrough in his coming summer offensive, writes David Kirichenko.', 'UkraineAlert\nMay 27, 2025', 'By Kateryna Odarchenko', 'Throughout occupied Ukraine, the Russian authorities are seeking to consolidate their control by eradicating all traces of Ukrainian statehood and national identity while imposing a reign of terror on the civilian population, writes Kateryna Odarchenko.', 'UkraineAlert\nMay 29, 2025', 'By Peter Dickinson', 'UN investigators have concluded that a coordinated Russian campaign of deadly drone strikes targeting civilians in southern Ukraine’s Kherson region is a crime against humanity, writes Peter Dickinson.', 'The views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.', '', 'UkraineAlert is a comprehensive online publication that provides regular news and analysis on developments in Ukraine’s politics, economy, civil society, and culture.', 'The Eurasia Center’s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.', 'Image: EYEPRESS via Reuters Connect', ""Sign up to receive expert analysis from our community on the most important global issues, rapid insights on events as they unfold, and highlights of the Council's best work."", '© 2025 Atlantic Council\nAll rights reserved.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVJXVUYwUTB4M1lVZDBTRXhSVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

The conflicting claims couldn’t be independently verified and video of the assault posted on social media showed only a couple of bombers hit.', 'But the bold attack demonstrated Ukraine’s capability to hit high-value targets anywhere in Russia, dealing a humiliating blow to the Kremlin and inflicting significant losses to Moscow’s war machine.', 'While some Russian military bloggers compared it to another infamous Sunday surprise attack — that of Japan’s strike on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in 1941 — others rejected the analogy, arguing the actual damage was far less significant than Ukraine claimed.', 'A look at what warplanes were reported hit:', 'For decades, long-range bombers have been part of the Soviet and Russian nuclear triad that also includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and atomic-powered submarines carrying ICBMs. The strategic bombers have flown regular patrols around the globe showcasing Moscow’s nuclear might.', 'During the 3-year-old war in Ukraine, Russia has used the heavy planes to launch waves of cruise missile strikes across the country.', 'The Tupolev Tu-95, which was code named Bear by NATO, is a four-engine turboprop plane designed in the 1950s to rival the U.S. B-52 bomber. The aircraft has an intercontinental range and carries eight long-range cruise missiles that can be equipped with conventional or nuclear warheads.', 'Before Sunday, Russia was estimated to have a fleet of about 60 such aircraft.', 'The Tupolev Tu-22M is a twin-engine supersonic bomber designed in the 1970s that was code named Backfire by NATO. It has a shorter range compared with the Tu-95, but during U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in the 1970s, Washington insisted on counting them as part of the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal because of their capability to reach the U.S. if refueled in flight.', 'The latest version of the plane, the Tu-22M3, carries Kh-22 cruise missiles that fly at more than three times the speed of sound. It dates to the 1970s, when it was designed by the Soviet Union to strike U.S. aircraft carriers. It packs a big punch, thanks to its supersonic speed and ability to carry 630 kilograms (nearly 1,400 pounds) of explosives, but its outdated guidance system could make it highly inaccurate against ground targets, raising the possibility of collateral damage.', 'Some Tu-22Ms were lost in previous Ukrainian attacks, and Russia was estimated to have between 50 and 60 Tu-22M3s in service before Sunday’s drone strike.', 'The production of the Tu-95 and the Tu-22M ended after the 1991 collapse of the USSR, meaning that any of them lost Sunday can’t be replaced.', 'Russia also has another type of strategic nuclear capable bomber, the supersonic Tu-160. Fewer than 20 of them are in service, and Russia has just begun production of its modernized version equipped with new engines and avionics.', 'Russia lost a significant part of its heavy bomber fleet in the attack “with no immediate ability to replace it,” said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, noting that Moscow’s announced plan to develop the next generation strategic bomber is still in its early phase.', '“Ironically this might give impetus to that program, because if if you want to keep your bomber fleet up to size, then you’re going to have to do something at some point,” he said.', 'The A-50, which Ukrainian officials also said was hit in the strikes, is an early warning and control aircraft similar to the U.S. AWACS planes used to coordinate aerial attacks. Only few such planes are in service with the Russian military, and any loss badly dents Russia’s military capability.', 'Repeated Ukrainian strikes on the Engels air base, the main base for Russian nuclear capable strategic bombers near the Volga River city of Saratov, prompted Moscow to relocate the bombers to other bases farther from the conflict.', 'One of them was Olenya on the Arctic Kola Peninsula, from where Tu-95s have flown multiple missions to launch cruise missiles at Ukraine. Several bombers at Olenya apparently were hit by the Ukrainian drones Sunday, according to analysts studying satellite images before and after the strike.', 'Other drones targeted the Belaya air base in the Irkutsk region in eastern Siberia, destroying a few Tu-22M bombers, according to analysts.', 'Ukraine said 41 aircraft — Tu-95s, Tu-22Ms and A-50s — were damaged or destroyed Sunday. in the attack that it said was in the works for 18 months in which swarms of drones popped out of containers carried on trucks that were parked near four air bases.', 'U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was briefed on the attack, which represented a level of sophistication that Washington had not seen before, a senior defense official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.', 'The Russian Defense Ministry said the attack set several warplanes ablaze at air bases in the Irkutsk region in eastern Siberia and the Murmansk region in the north, but the fires were extinguished.', 'It said Ukraine also tried to strike two air bases in western Russia, as well as another one in the Amur region of Russia’s Far East, but those attacks were repelled.', 'The drone strikes produced an outcry from Russian military bloggers, who criticized the Defense Ministry for failing to learn from previous strikes and protect the bombers. Building shelters or hangars for such large planes is a daunting task, and the military has tried some impromptu solutions that were criticized as window dressing.', 'Satellite images have shown Tu-95s at various air bases covered by layers of old tires – a measure of dubious efficiency that has drawn mockery on social media.', 'Associated Press Pentagon correspondent Tara Copp and Emma Burrows in London contributed.', 'Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.', 'Left: The Russian flag flies on the dome of the Kremlin Senate building in Moscow.

Confirmed Losses Of Russian Aircraft Mount After Ukrainian Drone Assault,https://www.twz.com/air/firm-evidence-of-russian-aircraft-losses-after-ukrainian-drone-strikes,"['THOMAS NEWDICK', 'UPDATED JUN 4, 2025 1:06 PM EDT', 'SATELLITE IMAGE ©2025 MAXAR TECHNOLOGIES', 'The TWZ Newsletter', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy', 'New satellite imagery and an official video have revealed more about the scale of destruction and damage inflicted on Russian airfields in Ukraine’s unprecedented drone attacks last weekend. Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, which carried out the drone attacks, published previously unreleased drone footage showing the raid underway. At the same time the SBU video was released, Ukraine also announced more details of the drone attacks, which were carried out under Operation Spiderweb.', 'You can catch up with our previous reporting about the operation and its aftermath here.', '', 'The SBU claims that its drones used artificial intelligence (AI) during at least some aspects of the operation. “During the operation, modern UAV control technology was used, which combines autonomous artificial intelligence algorithms and manual operator intervention,” the SBU said. “In particular, some UAVs, due to signal loss, switched to performing the mission using artificial intelligence along a pre-planned route. After approaching and contacting a specifically designated target, the warhead was automatically triggered.”', 'While we cannot confirm this, TWZ has, in the past, detailed exactly how AI can be harnessed for lower-end drones.', '', 'Initially, Ukrainian authorities claimed to have hit a total of 41 aircraft, including Tu-95MS Bear-H and Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers, as well as A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft. However, these were clearly not all destroyed or even damaged.', 'Subsequently, Andriy Kovalenko, an official with Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said that “at least 13 Russian aircraft were destroyed.”', 'Among those aircraft, the new video confirms that several of the Tu-95MS bombers were already loaded with Kh-101 conventionally armed cruise missiles, ready for launch against Ukraine, as seen in the image below. This fact underlines how big a threat these aircraft are to Ukraine and reinforces the fact that they are legitimate targets.', 'Now, with the new satellite imagery, verification of at least some of these previous claims is becoming somewhat easier. Here’s what we know so far for each of the airfields targeted:', 'Soon after the drone strikes, ground-level videos of Belaya, which is situated in Russia’s eastern Irkutsk region, began to appear online, showing smoke rising from the base, confirming that at least something was hit.', '', 'Thereafter, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery obtained by TWZ from the U.S.-based ICEYE US pointed to at least four Tu-95MS bombers having been destroyed or at least damaged at Belaya. However, the resolution and the nature of SAR, which does not show the same kinds of details that would be available in visual spectrum imagery, made it difficult to definitively determine the state of any of the aircraft. That has since changed.', 'Now, with new satellite imagery from Maxar, we can clearly see the remains of three destroyed Tu-95MS and four destroyed Tu-22M3 bombers at Belaya. While we cannot be certain of the operational status of the aircraft that were destroyed, most were arranged along the flight line or in blast pens among active aircraft, so there’s a high possibility that these were frontline assets.', '', '', '', 'On June 1, video footage emerged showing Olenya, located in far northwestern Russia near the Barents Sea, from the perspective of cameras on first-person-view (FPV) type drones. This earlier footage suggested that Olenya was among the hardest-hit bases, with the drone videos showing that Tu-95MS bombers and an An-12 Cub cargo aircraft had been targeted.', 'A satellite image of Olenya taken on June 3 from Planet Labs appeared to show three Tu-95MS and one An-12 damaged and/or destroyed, but was too low-resolution to be conclusive.', 'Now, additional satellite imagery from Airbus Defense and Space, Maxar, and Planet Labs provides a better understanding of the destruction at Olenya, with telltale burn marks on the tarmac consistent with the destruction of five aircraft, at least three of which can be confirmed as Tu-95MS bombers.', 'At opposite ends of the same flight line are further scorch marks, as seen in the oblique image in the embedded tweet below. Here, the nearest aircraft destroyed was likely the An-12, supported by a comparison with previous satellite imagery showing the transport intact in this location. It’s not clear what aircraft might have been targeted at the other end of the flight line from the An-12 (the area seen at the very top of the frame in the oblique image). The most likely candidate is another Tu-95MS, which would appear to be consistent with some of the original video footage from the attack.', '', '', 'Clear satellite imagery that might definitely show damage to aircraft at Ivanovo has yet to emerge, although a video released today by the SBU shows two A-50 being targeted. The location was presumably Ivanovo, where these radar planes are home-based.', 'Based on lower-resolution satellite imagery, there have been claims that two A-50s were at least hit at Ivanovo, although it’s by no means certain that this is the case. If the aircraft were hit, there is currently no evidence that they were destroyed outright.', '', 'At the same time, it’s worth bearing in mind that Russia’s fleet of A-50s — two examples of which have already been destroyed in the air by Ukraine — normally conducts its wartime operations from forward bases closer to Ukraine. While A-50s rotate in and out of Ivanovo periodically, examples that might have been hit there could also be inactive aircraft, which are known to be stored at the base.', '', 'Indeed, the aircraft seen in the SBU video may well have been non-operational, with highly weathered radomes, while at least one aircraft doesn’t have a full set of engines fitted.', 'Prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was estimated to have nine A-50s, including a number of modernized A-50Us, in active service. As well as the two combat losses since then, one of these aircraft was damaged in a drone attack while on the ground at a base in Belarus, and its current status is unknown. Any further losses to the A-50 fleet will be very keenly felt.', 'A high-resolution satellite image of Dyagilevo from Planet Labs, taken on June 2 and reviewed by TWZ, showed no obvious signs of damage to any aircraft there. Still, some aircraft may have been damaged by shrapnel, against which relatively thin-skinned aircraft are notably vulnerable, and this would not necessarily be visible even in higher-resolution imagery.', '', 'Clear satellite imagery showing potential damage to aircraft at Ukrainka is yet to emerge. What little visual evidence we have of this airfield after the drone strikes is inconclusive, although there are claims, at least, of a single Tu-95MS having been hit. For now, these claims need to be treated with caution.', '', 'It’s also worth noting that the tires, frequently scattered over the wings and upper fuselages of Russian bombers and other combat aircraft, and which are employed in this manner to confuse image-matching seekers on incoming munitions, appear to have been misidentified by some observers as evidence of damage or scorch marks.', 'While cloud cover has hindered the opportunity for more rapid and verifiable analysis of the results of Operation Spiderweb, we can now say, with certainty, that at least six (and more likely seven) Tu-95MS and four Tu-22M3 bombers were destroyed. While far short of some of the earlier Ukrainian claims, this still represents a significant loss to Russia, not least because it’s impossible to replace the Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3, both of which have been out of production for decades, as you can read more about here.', 'While the new SBU video shows multiple drones landing on their targets before presumably exploding, it is possible that some made it to their final destinations and failed to detonate.', 'Additional satellite imagery could well reveal more aircraft destroyed or damaged, although, with each passing day, Russia is better able to conceal the results of the raid, disposing of wreckage and moving aircraft around to make it that much harder to create an accurate tally.', '', 'At the same time, Russian aircrews are already making clear their reaction to the drone strikes, referencing the destroyed aircraft in the form of slogans on glide bombs launched by tactical combat aircraft, as seen below:', '', 'Whatever the final losses to the Russian Aerospace Forces, the Ukrainian drone strike will also have sent a shockwave all the way to the top of the Russian leadership, as well as military planners around the globe. The carefully planned operation visibly exposed the vulnerability of some of Russia’s prime strategic assets. For now, at least, there appears to be no quick-fix solution to protecting these high-value aircraft. This may well force Russia toward an even more highly dispersed positioning model, which will severely limit the bombers’ effectiveness for Ukraine operations.

Relative Superiority in the Drone Age: McRaven’s Playbook Meets Ukraine’s Airfield Assaults,https://www.csis.org/analysis/relative-superiority-drone-age-mcravens-playbook-meets-ukraines-airfield-assaults,"['Photo: kirkikis/Adobe Stock', 'Commentary by Benjamin Jensen', 'Published June 2, 2025', 'Before dawn on June 1, 2025, Ukrainian intelligence and special-operations planners initiated truck-launched first-person-view (FPV) drones they had hidden in trucks delivering goods near four Russian strategic bomber bases scattered across Russia. In a matter of minutes, multiple bombers, including Tu-160, Tu-95, Tu-22Ms, and A-50 early warning aircraft, were burning on their parking stands in what Kyiv code-named Operation Spider Web. According to the Ukrainian president, 117 drones were used in the operation to knock out over 30 percent of Russia’s bomber fleet capable of launching deadly attacks on Ukrainian cities.', 'The raid is a reminder of the enduring utility of special forces during large-scale conventional conflict as well as a call to arms to further help Kyiv deny Russia the ability to sustain a coercive air campaign designed to break Ukraine’s will.', 'In his 1993 master’s thesis at the Naval Postgraduate School, Admiral William McRaven described how small raiding forces could achieve disproportionate battlefield outcomes. Through speed, surprise, and tailored tactics at a pivotal moment in an engagement, these teams could generate disproportionate combat power. In this theory of special operations, the resulting “relative superiority” allowed smaller forces to play critical roles in major campaigns. To make his case, McRaven used a mix of cases ranging from Operation Chariot (British commando raids on St Nazaire, France, in 1942) and Operation Source (British midget submarine attacks on the Tirpitz in 1943) to the German attack at Ében-Émael in 1940 and Operation Jonathan (the Israeli raid on Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976).', 'The logic applies across domains. As seen in Operation Spider Web, small land and air littoral forces (i.e., drones) can be used to hold other domains at risk. This idea is not new. In 1942, the British Special Air Service and Long Range Desert Group conducted raids on German airfields in Egypt. A closer look at the history of war illustrates a recurring theme: The best place to kill aircraft is on the ground. There is a long track record of ground-based attacks against airbases. Ukraine just brought the concept into the drone age, complementing its earlier series of long-range strikes on Russian airbases.', 'Initial reports suggest Ukraine developed the operation for over a year, hiding in plain sight and likely using a mix of open-source intelligence assets like commercial satellite and transponder aggregators as well as special reconnaissance to plan the attack. The operation likely also involved a mix of electromagnetic spectrum and cyber operations to set conditions for the raid, which comes just one week after Russia’s largest air and missile attack on Ukraine and in the midst of stalled peace negotiations.', 'By demonstrating it can hold Russian airbases at risk, Ukraine achieves multiple campaign objectives. First, it forces Russia to increase security around its airbases, thus pulling forces from the frontline and creating a compounding psychological effect. Now, Ukraine has demonstrated it can hold both bomber and fighter airbases at risk using a mix of drones. Second, the asymmetric attacks limit the ability of Russia to use its advantage in air power to attack Ukrainian cities, critical infrastructure, and major military hubs that supply the frontline. In fact, the attack comes as the battlefield has seen an increase in Ukrainian air sorties along the front lines and even air assault missions behind Russian lines. Combined with the recent lifting of restrictions on long-range strikes by major European states and the United States, the net result could be an operational air campaign that slows down the impending Russian summer offensive. Russia will have to worry about both more drone raids and cruise missile attacks on its airfields.', 'That is, the June 1 drone raid should not be viewed in isolation from broader defensive campaign objectives. The best way to use special operations and intelligence operatives is in support of a larger campaign. That campaign is seeking to offset Ukraine’s manpower shortage with a mix of drones, air power, and bold use of maneuver.', 'The stunning success and longer history of special forces raids against airbases suggest a need to rethink aspects of offensive and defensive campaign designs in large-scale combat operations.', 'First, the United States and its allies will need to reconsider how to defend air bases in the new drone age. Airbases are operational targets difficult to defend from every domain, given their large (land) size, fixed character (easy to see and hard to move), and reliance on the electromagnetic spectrum to coordinate sorties. The new concept will need to build on foundational concepts like defense-in-depth to ensure adversaries are denied the ability to launch drone raids as well as long-range missile strikes. This approach will likely involve a mix of hardened shelters, decoys, mobile jammers, and other capabilities designed to counter unmanned aircraft systems alongside traditional point air defenses and security forces.', 'Second, the June 1 airbase attack is a reminder of the utility of special forces in large-scale combat operations. U.S. military planners and leadership should ensure they are generating unorthodox and unconventional approaches to conventional combat scenarios and using them to test new tactics and capabilities. The case is a reminder that not every operation requires an expensive missile to achieve the desired effect.', 'Third, while the mission was a success, it still carries the risk of significant escalation, which, while manageable, should be understood. This creates a need for more wargaming on the modern escalation ladder and understanding how even unconventional attacks on nuclear facilities could change the character of the conflict. As seen outside Russia in the recent limited conflict between India and Pakistan, there appear to be shifting norms against targeting nuclear-capable assets and installations with conventional and special forces. The latent risks need to be better understood to avoid inadvertent escalation spirals.', 'The logic of the unconventional air-base raid endures. FPV drones compress McRaven’s window of relative superiority from hours to seconds and make every flight line on the planet a potential kill zone. Survivability now hinges on seeing the raid before it launches—or launching one’s own. In the age of autonomy, the side that masters the art of the air-base raid will own the runways—and the skies above them—in the wars to come.', 'Benjamin Jensen is director of the Futures Lab and a senior fellow for the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.', 'Commentary is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Russia has said little about the attacks, although its Defense Ministry acknowledged in a statement that some planes caught fire.', 'The strikes have highlighted the increasing importance of drones for both Russia and Ukraine in the war, which entered its fourth year in February. And experts told NBC News that both sides are increasingly turning to cheap, commercially available first-person view or quadcopter drones that can often be purchased from online retailers and easily converted into deadly weapons — simple technology that is having a huge impact on the battlefield in Ukraine and farther afield.', 'Their use is “going to become very, very common,” Robert Lee, a senior fellow at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank, said in an interview.', 'Drones were used when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime was overthrown in December, he said. “They’re here ... because they’re ubiquitous, because they are quite useful, and they’re demonstrating that every day in Ukraine,” he said.', '“There’s no doubt that they’re going to be used by all sorts of groups, whether it’s criminal groups or terrorist groups, and they pose a quite significant threat,” he said, adding, “I think we’re a little bit behind the power curve on this and actually getting ready to counter them.”', 'Anastasia Pavlenko, 23, said she noticed a drone “hunting” her as she was riding her bicycle to a cosmetology appointment in Antonivka, a rural community in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region.', '“It took off, followed me, and I zigzagged on the bike,” Pavlenko, the mother of two, said of the attack in September, adding that a second drone suddenly appeared with “a shell attached to it.”', 'Despite her best attempts to escape, she said, the second drone dropped the shell “right on my head,” and it bounced down onto her thigh and exploded on the asphalt next to her.', '“Blood was coming from my neck, and there were fragments under my ribs,” Pavlenko said, adding she somehow managed to keep cycling and take cover under a bridge, where she screamed for help until she started to lose consciousness.', '“I just had a small purse, shorts, a T-shirt and long loose hair, so it was clear that I was a girl,” she said, adding that she was not wearing military colors or carrying any weapons when she was hit.', 'Doctors were unable to remove shrapnel fragments from her neck, ribs or leg, she said, adding she had been unable to return to work at her coffee shop because she “can’t handle physical stress.”', 'Russia has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about whether its forces or groups allied with them had used commercial drones to carry out strikes on nonmilitary targets in the Kherson region.', 'But drone video posted on a Russian military blogger’s Telegram channel appears to show the attack on Pavlenko.', 'NBC News was able to determine that the video was taken in late September and geolocate it to a specific section of a road in Antonivka where Pavlenko said everything went dark.', 'The strike on Pavlenko was one of at least 45 Russian attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine from June to December that Human Rights Watch has documented.', 'Belkis Wille, an associate director in the nongovernmental organization’s Crisis, Conflict and Arms Division, said it was the first time it had “ever documented the use of these commercial quadcopter drones used at wide scale in a precise campaign to target civilians.”', 'The majority of the attacks were carried out with modified commercial drones manufactured by the Chinese companies DJI and Autel Robotics, according to a report co-authored by Wille and released Monday, called “Hunted from Above: Russia’s Use of Drones to Attack Civilians in Kherson, Ukraine.”', 'Lee, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, analyzed pictures of some of the drones posted to Telegram channels associated with bloggers affiliated with Russia’s military.', 'Some were “all homemade” munitions, he said, adding that some of the parts, including a plastic tail, could be created with 3D printers. Another photo showed parts of a rocket-propelled grenade attached to a drone with duct tape, Lee said.', 'But despite their DIY appearance, he said, “you have a guided weapon that operates at significantly greater distances, and this can be operated at a very tactical level, in a very cheap way.”', 'Both Autel Robotics and DJI have policies on their websites that explicitly prohibit using their drones in combat. Autel Robotics say all customers are required to sign a “compliance commitment letter” and “end-user statement” to that effect. DJI says that, as part of its terms of use, users “agree not to: attempt to ‘hack,’ ‘crack,’ reverse engineer or modify the product.”', 'Both companies stopped direct sales in Russia when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, and DJI says it stopped direct sales in Ukraine. Autel Robotics says it added geofencing restrictions “to prevent the operation” of Autel drones “in Russia, Ukraine, and other embargoed regions.”', 'DJI did not respond to a question about geofencing capabilities of its drones. It said in a statement that it “does not manufacture military-grade products, nor does it market or sell its products for use in combat,” and that it strongly opposes “any outside attempts to modify our products for combat.”', '“Just like any global consumer electronics company selling off-the-shelf products, we cannot control how our products are used once purchased,” the statement added. “However, we have taken proactive steps to mitigate the use of our products for harm.”', 'Autel Robotics did not respond to a request for additional comment.', 'Since Russian forces invaded it in February 2022, Ukraine has also been retrofitting cheap and readily available commercial drones so they can be deployed on the battlefield.', 'While Russia has accused Ukrainian forces of targeting civilians, HRW has said there was no verifiable evidence of their doing so.', 'Lee and Wille said the availability of cheap, easy-to-use drones is changing the nature of warfare, making once-expensive strikes far easier to pull off. They also expressed concerns that criminal organizations, like Mexican drug cartels, were able to use them for nefarious purposes, too.', '“They’re changing the nature of the fight,” said Lee, adding that in the future, artificial intelligence could lead to a point “where one pilot can operate maybe four or five UAVs at a time.”', 'He added that AI could “replace some of those targeting functions where AI can locate a target on its own,” with a pilot operating it.', 'For Wille, the fear is that others will be able to copy the methods used by Russians and Ukrainians to create drones “cheap and easy to operate” and subject them to similar attacks.', '“These drones are ubiquitous,” she said.', 'Abigail Brooks is a producer for NBC News.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVJXVUYwUTB4M1lVZDBTRXhSVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Ukraine's Audacious Drone Attacks Are a Recipe for Russian Paranoia,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/06/02/ukraines-audacious-drone-attacks-are-a-recipe-for-russian-paranoia-a89297,"['In his classic book ""Catch-22,"" Joseph Heller coined the maxim, ""Just because you’re paranoid doesn\'t mean they aren’t after you."" The phrase acknowledges the difference, but also the occasional overlap, between perception and reality, fear and fearsomeness, manufactured threat and genuine menace.', 'The Russian leadership, led by President Vladimir Putin and instrumentalized by the Federal Security Service, has fostered a societal paranoia of spies, saboteurs, terrorists and ""foreign agents."" That paranoia is useful for maintaining the patriotic fervor that the government requires to keep the Russian people aligned behind the war in Ukraine.', 'Institutional paranoia is part of the Russian government’s philosophy that political unity is strength while political division is weakness. If leaders can maintain unity of mind and purpose amongst the Russian population, especially concerning Ukraine, then Russia appears strong, and appearing strong is the objective.', 'However, paranoia is fragile. To maintain it, the Russian security system must portray itself as invincible, catching genuine and imagined malefactors and broadcasting their arrests to blur the line between real and illusion. That includes televising arrest operations showing officers wearing jackets emblazoned with the letters ""FSB."" It includes arresting people for espionage or terrorism, but keeping the evidence secret.', 'There is a fine line between sustaining paranoia and allowing it to get out of hand. Sustaining it requires communicating a contradictory message, keeping threat perceptions at a shrill pitch but simultaneously presenting the image of having everything under control. With its authority to stage sudden arrests, summon people for prophylactic interviews, recruit donositeli — ""snitches"" — and conduct ubiquitous monitoring of internal communications, the FSB must be the object of greater fear than the real threats to Russia’s national security. The security service must appear to have the upper hand, or its repressive methods are unnecessary, ineffective and even extreme.', 'The Russian security system becomes tautological: it only works if it works. Any cracks in the system bring the whole house of cards crashing down.', 'What happens when real attacks occur, and the bona fide threat becomes more fearsome than the security system itself? Such is the case with drone attacks on four Russian air bases spread across thousands of kilometers on June 1. Local officials downplayed the damage and the FSB reported immediate arrests. Simultaneously, the FSB announced arrests of Ukrainian “saboteurs” in the Primorsky region, claiming to have thwarted a planned attack, as if to say, “Everything is under control — look over here instead.”', 'Nevertheless, Ukraine’s audacious drone attack undermines the Russian security system itself just as much as it poses a military threat. The reality of the threat risks exposing the security system as incompetent. Heavy-handed security measures didn’t work.', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky challenged that perception head-on in his public statement about the attacks. Despite FSB reports of arrests, Zelensky said ""all the people who helped us"" were withdrawn from Russian territory in time and are safe. Although he did not say it explicitly, he implied that local Russians were involved in supporting the operation. Ukrainian media subsequently claimed that the ""office"" where one of the attacks was organized was located next to an FSB regional directorate.', 'Those statements are calculated to portray the Russian security system as vulnerable. Zelensky showed that Ukraine can take control of Russian societal paranoia.', 'The situation is analogous to the March 2024 terrorist attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue in Moscow. The FSB’s response was to conduct immediate arrests, leaking videos of FSB officers beating suspects and cutting off the ear of one of them. A real terrorist attack threatened to take control of societal paranoia, but the FSB responded by displaying its viciousness, recapturing the initiative. ', 'Putin regularly lauds the FSB publicly for being in control. He addresses the FSB Collegium in February or March each year, where he spells out the threats that Russia faces. Оn March 19, 2024, Putin praised the FSB for ""confirming its high status and authority as a key link in the system of providing Russia’s state security and sovereignty… All attempts by sabotage-terrorist groups to penetrate our territory … have failed."" That speech came three days before the Crocus City Hall attack, in which 145 people died and over 500 were injured.', 'In his annual speeches to the FSB Collegium between 2012 and 2019, Putin cited statistics of arrests of foreign intelligence officers and spies. The numbers rose each year until 2019, when Putin claimed that the FSB had made nearly 600 arrests. The number dropped in 2020, but only because of the global pandemic. ', 'Putin stopped citing statistics after that but continued to urge the FSB to increase its vigilance. In his speech on Feb. 27, 2025, Putin’s language was nearly identical to that he used in 2024: ""The FSB is a strong, reliable, and effective link in the system of providing national security,"" he said. Although he cited no statistics, he continued: ""Regular summaries and informant reports show that the activity of foreign special services during the special military operation has grown.""', 'After the Crocus City Hall attack, Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine. According to the FSB’s logic, the attack must be the work of the Ukrainian enemy, thus justifying the violence wrought on Ukraine and the repressive tactics applied inside Russia to protect against Ukrainian spies. Those claims turned out to be fiction — Ukraine was not involved. The façade of Russian societal unity, especially amongst religious confessions, was not as impenetrable as Putin made it sound.', 'Though they produce a similar paranoia, drone attacks on Russian air bases on June 1 reached an entirely new level. They were spread across the country, not just in Moscow. They targeted the Russian military, not civilians. And the Ukrainian government took public credit for the attacks, with Zelensky calling them ""justified and deserved.""', 'The FSB will crack down hard on Russian society and marshal its domestic security powers in response to these drone attacks. But the FSB itself was the victim. If it cannot monitor threats under its own nose, what can it do? Are the FSB’s repressive KGB-like tactics meaningless? The Ukrainian drone attack forces the FSB and the Russian people to face such questions.', 'Social paranoia is a fickle partner. When it is under control, it can be useful in maintaining a compliant population. But it can turn on its master when they are unable to control it. The Ukrainian drone attacks could be a turning point in that sense of control, convincing the Russian people, as Heller said, that the FSB is not protecting them from the forces that may be after them.', 'A Message from The Moscow Times:', 'Dear readers,', 'We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia\'s Prosecutor General\'s Office has designated The Moscow Times as an ""undesirable"" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a ""foreign agent.""', 'These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work ""discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership."" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.', 'We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.', ""Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact."", ""By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression.
