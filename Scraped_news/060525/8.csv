Harvard challenges Trump’s proclamation to suspend visas for new international students in amended lawsuit,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/us/harvard-trump-proclamation,"['Harvard’s leadership has asked a court to stop the Trump administration’s latest attempt to block international students — over a fourth of its student body — from coming to the university, according to a new court filing less than 24 hours after the latest move by President Donald Trump against the university.', 'The filing amends an existing lawsuit against the Trump administration over the move to ban its ability to enroll international students, which initially prompted a judge to stop the administration from revoking Harvard’s student visa program.', 'The amended lawsuit claims Trump’s proclamation, which suspends international visas for new students at Harvard, violates the First Amendment by temporarily blocking the entry of nearly all new international Harvard students under visas most use to study at US universities or participate in academic exchange programs. International students make up about 27% of the student body at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.', 'Trump’s proclamation directs the Secretary of State “to consider revoking” those visas – known as F, M and J visas – for current Harvard students who meet the proclamation’s “criteria,” the White House said in a statement.', '“With the stroke of a pen, the DHS Secretary and the President have sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission and the country,” the amended complaint reads.', '“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” it says.', 'Trump signs proclamation to suspend visas for new Harvard international students', 'The visa program, which allows international students “to enter the United States on nonimmigrant visas to enroll at Harvard and thousands of other schools, have boosted America’s academic, scientific, and economic success and its global standing,” the lawsuit says.', 'In its amended lawsuit, Harvard rebutted claims by the White House that the proclamation is an attempt to “safeguard national security” and said it represents “a government vendetta against Harvard.”', '“It escalates and intensifies the campaign of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment,” the amended suit reads. “… Just as the revocation unconstitutionally intrudes on academic freedom, the Proclamation unconstitutionally intrudes too.”', 'Trump’s proclamation hinges on a statute that gives the president authority to protect the nation from “any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental” to the interests of the US, according to the document. But Harvard argues Trump is not suspending entry for any such class: “To the contrary, nonimmigrants may enter the country unabated, as long as they do not attend Harvard,” the lawsuit reads.', 'CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.', 'Harvard’s initial complaint pushing back against the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict foreign students, filed May 23, argued the revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program by the Department of Homeland Security was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government’s ideologically rooted policy demands.', 'Hours after the initial complaint was filed, US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs temporarily blocked DHS’ decision to drop Harvard from SEVP, which would have made it impossible for the university to host any international students. Burroughs said she would issue an indefinite order preventing DHS from making any changes to Harvard’s international student visa programs.', 'The amended complaint says the proclamation “is a patent effort to do an end-run around” the judge’s order. “What the DHS Secretary has purported to take away on the back end by revoking Harvard’s certifications to host foreign students, the President purports to take away on the front end by preventing the students and scholars invited to Harvard from gaining entry into the country in the first place,” the complaint reads.', 'While Harvard has argued in legal filings that White House orders were behind the DHS move to revoke its ability to host international students, Wednesday’s proclamation marked the first time Trump has became directly involved in the dispute at the center of his broader battle against elite US academics.', 'Harvard “will continue to protect its international students,” its spokesperson told CNN following the president’s proclamation. “This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”', 'Harvard is battling the White House on two fronts – both of which are being overseen by Judge Burroughs. The university filed its first lawsuit against the Trump administration for cutting more than $2.2 billion in federal funds and threatening billions more, as well as Harvard’s tax-exempt status.

On Wednesday, he had more to say on the matter still.', '""Harvard\'s got to behave themselves,"" he told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. ""Harvard is treating our country with great disrespect, and all they\'re doing is getting in deeper and deeper and deeper.""', ""When combined with other administration attempts – freezing more than $3bn in research grants and suspending foreign students from enrolling in Harvard – Trump's directives represent a frontal attack on one of America's most prestigious, and wealthy, institutions of higher education."", 'Even if court challenges overrule some of these actions – some have already been put on hold – the impact is being felt across the landscape of American higher education.', '""They\'re doing multiple things every single day, some of those things are sneaking through,"" says Greg Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors. ""But more importantly, they\'re changing the culture. They\'re changing people.""', 'At Harvard\'s commencement ceremonies on Thursday, students said there was a ""palpable concern"" on campus.', '""People sort of knew Trump was trying some of these moves but [they were] shocked when it happens,"" admits one graduate, a British national who requested anonymity because he was concerned public comments could threaten his US work visa. ""It feels like the nuclear option.""', '""If this can happen to Harvard it can happen to any university in the country,"" he adds.', 'But the repercussions of this apparent Harvard-Trump fight run far deeper than the management of a single Ivy League university. Could the measures Trump is taking mark, as some suggest, the latest, albeit most ambitious, step by conservatives to erode some of the traditional pillars of support for the Democratic Party?', ""If that is the case, the campus has become a pivotal battle in shaping America's cultural and political landscape."", ""Trump and his administration have offered various explanations for their actions, including a perceived lack of conservatives among the ranks of Harvard's professors, along with suggestions of admitting too many foreign students and financial links to China."", ""But according to the White House, the most immediate cause has been the university's apparent failure to address antisemitism on campus, in the wake of anti-Israel protests at universities across the US since the start of the Gaza war."", 'In December 2023, three prominent university presidents - including the then-president of Harvard, Claudine Gay - struggled to answer whether calling for the ""genocide of Jews"" violated their student conduct codes on bullying and harassment, sparking a firestorm of criticism.', 'Dr Gay, who was asked the question at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on US college campuses, answered that it depended on the context. She later apologised, telling the student newspaper: ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don\'t know how you could feel anything but regret.""', 'On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to cut off federal funding and government accreditation for colleges that he said were engaging in ""antisemitic propaganda"". Once Trump returned to the White House in January, he began following through on this.', 'Several universities - including Columbia, which saw some of the most high profile protests - agreed to sweeping changes in campus security rules and closer supervision of its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies departments.', ""In April, Harvard released the results of a university task force review (commissioned before Trump's election) of antisemitism and anti-Muslim prejudice on its own campus. It found that many Jewish and Muslim students faced bias, exclusion and alienation from the university curriculum and its community."", 'However, the administration\'s demands go well beyond calls to address antisemitism. In a letter to the university, its ""Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism"" laid out a laundry list of changes that Harvard must make, including terminating diversity programmes, reforming admissions and hiring, screening foreign students for views hostile to ""American values"", and expanding and protecting ""viewpoint diversity"" among students and faculty.', ""Trump's shock-and-awe strategy of rapid and aggressive pressure has stunned many in higher education, who never imagined the scope of the demands or the force behind them."", '""It\'s not about higher education,"" argues Mr Wolfson. ""Higher education is one of the levers they see as critical to transforming our society.""', ""But the potential for a long-term transformation could largely depend on whether the majority of American universities choose to accommodate the administration's demands - or whether it stands and fights, as Harvard is trying to do."", ""While Harvard has been the most prominent target of the administration's ire, and the most visible in its resistance, it is just one of many high-profile American universities that has received funding cuts or been subject of investigations."", 'Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have reported that the administration has suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in their research grants.

In a recent survey by the polling company Civiqs, non-college graduates were split on the job Trump is doing in office, with 49% disapproving and 47% approving."", ""College graduates, on the other hand, had a significantly different view, as 58% disapproved of Trump's performance in office versus only 38% who approved."", '""I think a lot of this blowback is from the sense that they have become the universities of blue [Democratic] America, and that this is the consequence,"" says Rick Hess, senior fellow and director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.', 'In recent years, according to Mr Hess, American higher education has become more closely tied to the government and more reliant on government funding.', 'He says that the new Trump team has simply adopted levers of control over higher education employed by recent Democratic administrations – including civil rights investigations, federal anti-discrimination laws and control over funding.', '""In classic Trump form,"" he added, ""it\'s absolutely the case that these levers have been turned up to 11.""', 'And there are fewer procedural and legal safeguards than there were under the Joe Biden and Barack Obama presidencies.', '""It\'s both an evolution and a revolution,"" says Mr Hess.', ""But it is one, he argues, that universities have brought on themselves by being overtly political during Trump's first term and making elite school the face of American higher education."", '""The price for collecting billions a year in tax dollars is that institutions should both honour the promises they make, such as enforcing civil rights law, and hew to a mission in which they explicitly serve the whole nation,"" says Mr Hess.', 'Withholding federal funding from universities may be a new challenge for higher education, but to some this is just the latest in a long effort by conservatives to undercut key traditional pillars of liberal power.', 'Through a combination of legislation and court rules, the influence of labour unions – which had provided the Democratic Party with volunteer personnel and funds – had diminished long before Trump succeeded in winning over white working-class voters in his three presidential runs.', ""State-level lawsuit reforms have also curtailed the vast sums that trial lawyers could contribute to Democratic coffers. And ongoing efforts to shrink the government workforce – which reached a peak with Elon Musk's Doge reductions – have eroded another traditionally Democratic bloc."", ""However, Mr Wolfson fears that something greater could be lost if some of the Trump administration's measures are enforced."", '""The fact that we have multiracial, multicultural, multinational universities is a boon to our universities,"" he says. ""It creates really diverse communities, really diverse intellectual thought.""', ""Harvard - perhaps best known for its renowned law school - has turned the courts into its principal tool to resist Trump's pressure."", ""On Thursday, a federal judge indefinitely suspended the administration's attempts to prohibit foreign students from receiving visas to attend the university."", 'The university has also sued to prevent the Trump administration from terminating more than $2.2bn in federal grants, although that case is pending.', '""The trade-off put to Harvard and other universities is clear,"" Harvard wrote in its complaint filed with a Massachusetts federal court. ""Allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardise the institution\'s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.""', 'Harvard\'s president, Alan Garber, has also defended his university, saying that Harvard would be ""firm"" in its commitments to education and truth, during an interview with NPR.', '""Harvard is a very old institution, much older than the country,"" he continued. ""As long as there has been a United States of America, Harvard has thought that its role is to serve the nation.""', 'Trump, meanwhile, has shared strong words of his own. ""Harvard wants to fight,"" he said on Wednesday. ""They want to show how smart they are, and they\'re getting their ass kicked.""', ""Opinion polls show that Trump's political base supports his efforts, and the underlying message. Yet those same polls suggest a majority of the general population support American universities and don't approve of his proposed funding cuts."", ""And opinion aside, the practicality of achieving such a fundamental reordering of America's system of higher education, even with all the tools at the federal government's disposal, is a daunting task."", 'According to Mr Wolfson, however, repairing what he says is the damage being done to academic independence will be equally challenging.', 'A growing number of members of the American Association of University Professors fear the consequences of expressing political views or conducting disfavoured research.', '""The destruction is real,"" argues Mr Wolfson. ""Even if the courts step in, there will still be a massive undermining of the higher education project in this country due to Trump\'s reckless, reckless moves.""', ""Mr Hess, who has pushed for conservative education reform for years, is less concerned. He believes that Trump's chaotic, scattershot approach - including last week's comments - could end up less effective than a more methodical restructuring of American universities."", '""This is all an ambitious experiment,"" Mr Hess said. ""Whether it\'s a strategy that\'s going to work is very much an open question.""', ""One thing seems clear, however. Even if American universities resist - or outlast - Trump's efforts, they are no longer insulated from the scorched-earth warfare of American politics.

The move follows what the Trump administration described as Harvard’s “failure” to comply with Department of Homeland Security requests for information regarding alleged criminal and disciplinary activity involving international students.', 'The suspension is set to last six months, with the potential for extension.', 'The order suspends the entry of future international students and exchange visitors who planned to begin studies or research at Harvard, effectively halting new admissions under F, M, and J visa categories.', 'It also places current international students and researchers at Harvard under review, directing the Department of State to consider revoking existing visas on a case-by-case basis.', 'More than 10,000 international students and scholars study at Harvard — and admitted students for Harvard’s incoming classes largely have yet to travel to campus for the fall semester.', 'Trump’s proclamation comes less than three weeks after the DHS attempted to strip Harvard of its certification to enroll international students through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, a decision that would have effectively barred the University from hosting any foreign students.', 'Harvard sued the federal government just one day later, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the DHS action, allowing the University to continue enrolling international students.', 'But Trump’s Wednesday order attempts to circumvent the ruling through presidential authority.', 'In a fact sheet supporting the order, Trump cited an oft-repeated set of grievances against Harvard, including allegations of campus antisemitism, support for diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, rising campus crime rates, and a failure to comply with the DHS’ records request.', 'Harvard swiftly clapped back, arguing that the entry ban on University affiliates was unlawful.', '“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,” University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in a statement. “Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”', 'On Wednesday evening, Trump also signed an order banning entry from 12 countries — mostly in Africa and the Middle East — and limiting entry from seven more.', 'In his proclamation on Harvard, Trump pointed to the University’s financial ties to foreign governments, especially China, citing The Crimson’s reporting that the University received more than $150 million in contributions from foreign governments since 2020. In recent weeks, Trump — whose administration revoked more than 1,000 visas belonging to Chinese students and scholars during his first term — has ramped up his anti-Chinese rhetoric, suggesting that Chinese students pose a national security risk.', 'Trump alleged that the contributions could enable adversaries to exploit U.S. academic institutions, like Harvard, for strategic gain.', ""In particular, he accused Harvard of partnering with individuals and groups linked to the Chinese military and of “repeatedly hosting and training” members of a Chinese Community Party-affiliated paramilitary organization. He also noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping's daughter attended Harvard under an alias from 2010 to 2014, citing it as further evidence of the University’s ties to the Chinese political elite."", 'Harvard is currently under congressional investigation by the House Committee on the CCP over similar allegations of ties to the Chinese government.', 'In the order and an accompanying fact sheet, Trump wrote that crime at Harvard had jumped in recent years. In 2023, the Harvard University Police Department responded to nearly twice as many crimes on Harvard’s Cambridge campus as it did in 2021, according to statistics released under the Clery Act. But almost all of the rise was attributable to a spike in motor vehicle theft — which, in turn, was driven mostly by stolen electric bicycles and scooters.', 'A jump in aggravated assaults also helped spur the increase. And the number of hate crimes on Harvard’s campus rose from three in 2021 to 10 in 2023, the most recent year for which Clery Act data is available.', 'But international students have not driven campus crime. The University wrote in response to the DHS’ request that it was not aware of any criminal convictions involving international students during the past two academic years.', 'Trump, in his order, suggested the fact the University did not report any crimes committed by international students showed it was withholding information.', 'While the DHS’ earlier effort to decertify Harvard’s SEVP status would have impacted both current and incoming international students equally, Trump’s order draws a sharper line: it immediately blocks entry for new students while subjecting current visa holders to review. In practice, the order halts Harvard’s international admissions pipeline, while allowing some room — albeit discretionary — for existing students to remain under “national interest.”', 'The legal authority cited in the proclamation — Sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act — has historically been used to restrict the entry of foreign nationals based on nationality, security status, or public health concerns. But Trump’s Wednesday order is unusual in that it applies to individuals solely based on their affiliation with a single academic institution, rather than their country of origin or visa classification.', 'If Harvard sues over the Trump administration’s latest move, it might face headwinds at the Supreme Court, even if it secures a temporary block.', 'During Trump’s first term, he repeatedly tried to ban entry from Muslim-majority countries, eventually excluding North Korean and Venezuelan nationals as well. The first two versions of his ban were stymied in court, but a third version was upheld by the Supreme Court in a victory for expansive presidential authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act.', 'Immigration lawyer Ian A. Campbell wrote in a text message that Trump’s Wednesday proclamation relied on the same authority as the travel ban that was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.', '“Even though Trump said repeatedly that he would ban entry of all Muslims,” Cambell wrote, “the Court said that because the order itself doesn’t actually ban all Muslims explicitly, it doesn’t violate the Constitution.”', 'Campbell wrote that, if Harvard challenges the proclamation, it may face an uphill battle — unlike the earlier travel bans, the Harvard order does not appear to disfavor a religion, which would directly implicate First Amendment rights.', '“I think Harvard will ultimately have difficulty challenging this. I am sure they can get an injunction in the lower courts, but I am doubtful the Supreme Court would rule in their favor if they take the case,” Campbell wrote.', 'But Mary S. Hoopes, a professor at Pepperdine University with experience in immigration law, said she expected the order to be overturned in court as it violated Harvard’s First Amendment rights — the same argument that Harvard invoked in its lawsuit to preserve its SEVP status.', '“This is just further retaliation against academic freedom, which is considered a special concern of the First Amendment,” she said.', '—Staff writer Dhruv T.

"Trump Restricts Legal Immigration, Blocks Student Visas For Harvard",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/06/05/trump-restricts-legal-immigration-blocks-student-visas-for-harvard/,"['', '', 'ByStuart Anderson,', 'Senior Contributor.', 'President Donald Trump speaks to reporters after signing a proclamation in the Oval Office at the ... More', 'In two new presidential proclamations, Donald Trump restricted legal immigration to the United States and blocked visas for international students who want to attend Harvard University. The proclamation bans immigration to the United States, with some exceptions, from 19 countries. Lawful permanent residents sponsoring family members will be most affected. The measure will reduce legal immigrant admissions and lower the number of visas issued for tourists, students and exchange visitors from the identified countries. The action against Harvard represents another blow to the university and international students seeking to enroll at the school.', 'On June 4, 2025, Donald Trump issued a proclamation banning immigrant and temporary visas from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The proclamation also bans immigrant visas and visas for tourists and business travelers, students and exchange visitors for an additional seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The proclamation contains an exception for the spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens, known as immediate relatives, which limits the personal impact for many Americans. Among the other exemptions are for adoptions, Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans, visas for most athletes and “immigrant visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran.” These exceptions will not help most people who previously could have entered the country on temporary visas from the 19 countries or through other immigration categories.', 'While the Trump administration framed the proclamation as necessary for national security, it did not offer evidence that the travel ban enacted in Donald Trump’s first term enhanced security or that the Biden administration removing the travel ban diminished America’s security. Analysts noted the proclamation suspending refugee admissions was also framed as a security measure, even though refugees are the most vetted and screened individuals to enter the United States.', 'According to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis, the proclamation will likely block approximately 25,000 legal immigrants a year from the 19 countries. Family-sponsored immigrants will be the most affected by the proclamation, with the burden falling primarily on lawful permanent residents in the United States who sponsor close family members, particularly from Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Yemen.', 'A lawful permanent resident can sponsor a spouse, minor child or an unmarried adult child. Employment-based immigrants from the 19 countries unable to adjust status inside the United States will also be prevented from immigrating. Individuals from the 19 countries will not be allowed to immigrate via the Diversity Visa lottery.', 'Based on FY 2023 data, approximately 100,000 fewer B1/B2 visas for tourism or business, 10,000 F-1 student visas and 2,400 J-1 visas for nationals of the 19 countries will be issued annually due to the proclamation, according to an NFAP analysis. The proclamation would prevent growth in those numbers. The ban applies to visas to enter rather than people already inside the country, unless they leave and need a new visa to reenter.', 'CEO: C-suite news, analysis, and advice for top decision makers right to your inbox.', '', '', '', 'The administration sought to justify the bans on student and other visas by citing figures from the DHS annual overstay report. However, analysts note the DHS reports do not accurately measure overstays. “The DHS figures represent actual overstays plus arrivals whose departure could not be verified,” according to demographer Robert Warren. In other words, the report includes many unrecorded departures that may not be actual overstays.', 'DHS has problems with its systems correctly identifying individuals who changed status inside the U.S. or left the country, which renders its reports inappropriate for policy purposes. That is particularly the case with students, and it’s a long-standing problem. The “suspected in-country overstay” rate for student and exchange visitors in FY 2018 dropped by 60% over the course of a year, from 2.11% to 0.84% 12 months later, according to DHS, as the agency’s systems caught up.', 'The problem is most evident when a student obtains a different immigration status, such as a green card, and the student is withdrawn from the SEVIS system. In March 2025, when DHS arrested a pro-Palestinian protest leader, Mahmoud Khalil, agents thought he was on a student visa even though Khalil was married to a U.S. citizen and had been a lawful permanent resident for months.', 'The proclamation selectively cites overstay data. It omits Venezuela’s low overstay rate of 2.7% for F-1 student and exchange visitor visas. Iran’s low rate for F-1 student and exchange visitor visas is also not listed in the proclamation.', 'The proclamation criticizes Haiti, Venezuela and Afghanistan for lacking a reliable or functioning government even though the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status for the three countries and claimed it is safe for Haitians, Venezuelans and Afghans to return.', 'A view of the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

[with an F or M visa] or to participate in a [J-1] exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University is suspended,” according to the proclamation. The proclamation, which lasts six months, though it could be extended, “shall apply to aliens who enter or attempt to enter the United States to begin attending Harvard University through the SEVP [Student and Exchange Visitor Program] after the date of this proclamation.”', 'The Trump administration has engaged in a months-long battle with Harvard after the university refused demands for the federal government to take over the school’s hiring, admissions and governance policies. In retaliation, the Department of Homeland Security removed Harvard’s ability to enroll international students through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. A federal judge blocked the Trump administration and will need to decide the legality of attempting to accomplish the same goal via a presidential proclamation.', '“They first tried to suspend SEVP and that failed, so now they are using an unsubstantiated threat to national security to halt the issuance of visas,” said Jonathan Grode of Green & Spiegel. “So, it is like, if we cannot stop you from issuing I-20s to students, then we will stop the State Department from issuing them visas.”', 'Attorneys and educators expect the latest administration move to have a further chilling effect on international students seeking to attend U.S. universities.', 'Although the latest salvo against Harvard may have multiple objectives, the travel ban proclamation has one primary goal.

"ENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY BY ADDRESSING
RISKS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY",https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/enhancing-national-security-by-addressing-risks-at-harvard-university/,"['BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n \nA PROCLAMATION', 'Admission into the United States to attend, conduct research, or teach at our Nation’s institutions of higher education is a privilege granted by our Government, not a guarantee.  That privilege is necessarily tied to the host institution’s compliance and commitment to following Federal law.  Harvard University has failed in this respect, among many others.', 'The Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) depends fundamentally on academic institutions’ good faith, transparency, and full adherence to the relevant regulatory frameworks.  This is for crucial national-security reasons.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries and competitors take advantage of easy access to American higher education to, among other things, steal technical information and products, exploit expensive research and development to advance their own ambitions, and spread false information for political or other reasons.  Our adversaries, including the People’s Republic of China, try to take advantage of American higher education by exploiting the student visa program for improper purposes and by using visiting students to collect information at elite universities in the United States.', 'Protecting our national security requires host institutions of foreign students to provide sufficient information, when asked, to enable the Federal Government to identify and address misconduct by those foreign students.  In my judgment, it presents an unacceptable risk to our Nation’s security for an academic institution to refuse to provide sufficient information, when asked, about known instances of misconduct and criminality committed by its foreign students.  This principle is one reason why SEVP regulations require foreign students to obey Federal and State criminal laws and require universities to keep records about foreign students’ studies in the United States — including records relating to criminal activity by foreign students and resulting disciplinary proceedings — and furnish them to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on request.', 'Crime rates at Harvard University — including violent crime rates — have drastically risen in recent years.  Harvard has failed to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus.  Given these facts, it is imperative, in my judgment, that the Federal Government be able to assess and, if necessary, address misconduct and crimes committed by foreign students at Harvard.', 'Despite the risks described above, Harvard University has refused the recent requests of the DHS for information about foreign students’ “known illegal activity,” “known dangerous and violent activity,” “known threats to other students or university personnel,” “known deprivation of rights of other classmates or university personnel,” and whether those activities “occurred on campus,” and other related data.  Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students, and the data it provided was so deficient that the DHS could not evaluate whether it should take further actions.  Harvard’s actions show that it either is not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.  In my judgment, these actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government’s ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law.', 'These concerns have compelled the Federal Government to conclude that Harvard University is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.  When a university refuses to uphold its legal obligations, including its recordkeeping and reporting obligations, the consequences ripple far beyond the campus.  They jeopardize the integrity of the entire United States student and exchange visitor visa system, compromise national security, and embolden other institutions to similarly disregard the rule of law.', 'Harvard University has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign countries, including our adversaries.  According to The Harvard Crimson, Harvard has received more than $150 million in total contributions from foreign governments over the last 5 years, and over $1 billion from foreign sources.  Over the last 10 years, Harvard has received more than $150 million from China alone.  In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, “repeatedly hosted and trained members of a Chinese Communist Party paramilitary organization,” according to a probe by the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.  Harvard researchers have also partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization, according to the same probe.', 'Finally, Harvard University continues to flout the civil rights of its students and faculty, triggering multiple Federal investigations.  Harvard’s discrimination against disfavored races in admissions was so blatant that the Supreme Court decision ending the practice nationwide bears Harvard’s name.  Yet even after that Supreme Court decision, Harvard and its affiliated organizations on campus continue to deny hardworking Americans equal opportunities.  Instead of those Americans, Harvard admits students from non-egalitarian nations, including nations that seek the destruction of the United States and its allies, or the extermination of entire peoples.  It is not in the interest of the United States to further compound Harvard’s discrimination against non-preferred races, national origins, shared ancestries, or religions by further reducing opportunities for American students through excessive foreign student enrollment.', 'Considering these facts, I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.  Such restrictions are authorized under sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers.  Until such time as the university shares the information that the Federal Government requires to safeguard national security and the American public, it is in the national interest to deny foreign nationals access to Harvard under the auspices of educational exchange.', 'NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.  I hereby proclaim as follows:', 'Section 1.  Suspension of Entry.

Operational Action to Implement this Order.  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall coordinate to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement this proclamation.  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall also consider using their respective authorities under the INA to impose limitations on Harvard University’s ability to participate in the SEVP and the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

If the university didn’t comply, it risked losing $9 billion in funding, the federal government said.', 'Sending a wave of resistance through higher education, Harvard rejected the demands and set the stage for a historic showdown. The school stated that the Trump administration looked to “invade university freedoms long recognized by the Supreme Court.”', 'The federal government froze an initial $2.2 billion on April 14, a number that has only grown since.', 'On May 16, a wave of nearly 1,000 federal research grant terminations began, amounting to more than $2.4 billion, according to an analysis by Nature.', 'Next, the Trump administration said it would bar Harvard from acquiring new federal grants. And then just a few days later, eight federal agencies cut $450 million in grants, followed by the Department of Health and Human Services cutting $60 million.', 'All federal agencies were then ordered to cut off existing contracts with Harvard or transfer them to other vendors, according to a letter from the U.S. General Services Administration.', 'In response, Harvard has established a new Presidential Priorities Fund, asking for donations in the midst of Trump taking a hatchet to the school’s funding.', 'The funding cuts, according to Harvard, have threatened research that includes:', 'Simultaneously, some professors say they are opting out of teaching certain courses due to fears of content-based retaliation and fears for their students’ safety. The Trump administration has gone on a national tirade against “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion) since the president took office for his second term in January.', 'Harvard University filed its first lawsuit in Boston federal court against the Trump administration on April 21 over what was, at the time, $2.2 billion in funding freezes.', 'Harvard has amended its lawsuit to include new losses that have been introduced since.', 'This week, Harvard asked a federal court judge to order the government to declare the freeze orders and termination letters unlawful and to “vacate” them. The university also asked the judge for summary judgment by Sept. 3. Lawyers for the federal government will have an opportunity to file a response to the request.', 'Court proceedings in the lawsuit are expected to continue through the summer.', 'Harvard also filed a second lawsuit against the Trump administration in May over its revocation of a key certification allowing the school to enroll international students. The administration had given Harvard an ultimatum: submit detailed records regarding foreign students or lose the certification.', 'Some foreign students at Harvard University say they’ve become a bargaining chip in Trump’s attacks on the school.', '“It’s part of a bigger battle between authoritarianism and democracy and we are kind of in the middle of it right now and we’re the most recent victim,” Karl Molden, a rising junior Harvard student from Austria, told MassLive last month.', 'About 27% of Harvard’s undergraduate and graduate students are international, according to 2024 to 2025 data.', 'The university has offered incoming foreign students the opportunity to accept admission at Harvard as well as a foreign institution as a “backup plan” following the threat of revocation.', 'While a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction in May, allowing Harvard to continue enrolling foreign students, Trump’s attacks have since escalated.', 'This week, Trump moved to bar Harvard University’s international students from entering the U.S., while asking Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider revoking the visas of Harvard students already in the country.', '“Admission into the United States to attend, conduct research, or teach at our Nation’s institutions of higher education is a privilege granted by our Government, not a guarantee,” Trump wrote in his Wednesday proclamation. “That privilege is necessarily tied to the host institution’s compliance and commitment to following Federal law.

So we took a look at where foreign college students in the United States are based. Here's what we found:"", 'The latest data available from Immigration and Customs Enforcement is from 2023 — it gives details of people receiving an F-1 visa, which is the most common type for international students, scholars, and trainees. While private schools such as Harvard do receive large numbers of students, so do major public universities.', 'As many as 1.5 million international students were in the United States in 2023 using F-1 or M-1 visas, based on a count of records in a system managed by the Department of Homeland Security. Just under 1.4 million of those were seeking degrees in 2022, and there could be duplicates due to people seeking more than one degree at the same time.', 'A big portion of these international students were not enrolled that year, but instead participated in post-graduate training programs. For example, Columbia University wrote in its 2023 annual report that it had just under 14,000 enrolled international students, plus about 6,500 students in training programs, and about 3,000 scholars.', ""Of the universities granting the most F-1 visas, the top 500 had more than 1.2 million international students combined, according to USA TODAY's analysis. This is the type of visa required to enroll in a degree program, including associates degrees, bachelor's degrees, masters degrees, and doctorates. The vast majority are pursuing bachelor's and masters degrees, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Foreign nationals can also receive F-1 visas to work in their field of study for up to three years, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services."", 'The college campus with the most international students that year was New York University, with nearly 25,000 F-1 visas issued at its main campus, and about 7,500 issued at its Brooklyn campus. Other campuses with high international populations were in other major cities — Northeastern University (Boston), Columbia University (New York), and the University of Southern California (Los Angeles).', 'Arizona State University had nearly 18,000 international students in 2023, the data shows, placing it fifth on the list. Other public universities with major international student populations were the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; the University of North Texas, and Purdue University in Indiana.', 'In 2023, Harvard did not rank in the top 20 of U.S. colleges for foreign students, according to the data. The university ranked No. 21 nationwide, and third in the Boston area, behind Northeastern University and Boston University. The school had about 9,700 F-1 visa students in 2023, according to the data.', ""The Trump administration on May 22 attempted to rescind Harvard's participation in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which certifies schools to allow them to enroll international students, including F-1 visa holders. The administration eased up a week later and introduced a process to allow Harvard to argue that it should be able to use the program.""]",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNVRibHBNVHpOc05GRm9kemRMVFJDN0F4aTBCU2dLTWdNTjRnZw=-w280-h168-p-df

He and other admitted students around the world are anxiously tracking the school’s feud with the Trump administration, which is seeking to keep it from enrolling international students.', 'On Thursday, Harvard challenged President Donald Trump’s latest move to bar foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend the college, calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands. In an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. Last month, a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard’s certification to host foreign students.', 'Increasingly, the nation’s oldest and best-known university has attracted some of the brightest minds from around the world, with international students accounting for one-quarter of its enrollment. As Harvard’s fight with the administration plays out, foreign students can only wait to find out if they’ll be able to attend the school at all. Some are weighing other options.', 'For Nuguse, 21, the war in Ethiopia forced schools to close in many parts of the province. After schooling resumed, he then took a gap year to study and save money to pay for his TOEFL English proficiency test in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.', '“The war affected me a great deal and when I found out the news that I was accepted to Harvard, I was ecstatic. I knew it was a proud moment for my family, teachers, mentors and friends, who were instrumental in my achievement,” he said.', 'The following months have been filled with uncertainty. On Wednesday, Trump signed a directive seeking to block U.S. entry for Harvard’s international students, which would block thousands of students who are scheduled to come to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for summer and fall terms.', 'Harvard’s court challenge a day later attacked Trump’s legal justification for the action — a federal law allowing him to block a “class of aliens” deemed detrimental to the nation’s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn’t qualify as a “class of aliens,” Harvard said in its filing.', '“The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” the university wrote.', 'The standoff with Harvard comes as the administration has been tightening scrutiny of student visas nationwide. Thousands of students around the country abruptly lost permission to be in the U.S. this spring before the administration reversed itself, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week the U.S. would “aggressively revoke” visas for students from China.', '“It is one blow after another,” said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services, who works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students. “At this point, international student interest in the U.S. has basically dropped to nil.”', 'The future of Harvard’s more than 7,000 international students has been hanging in the balance since the Department of Homeland Security first moved to block its foreign enrollment on May 22.', 'For many, the twists and turns have been exhausting. Jing, a 23-year-old master’s student, is currently completing an internship in China this summer, and unsure if he can reenter the U.S. for the fall semester.', '“It is tiring, we all feel numb now. Trump just makes big news headlines once every few days since he got back to the White House,” said Jing, who agreed to speak under his family name out of concern about retaliation from the Trump administration.', 'Jing said he is going to watch and see what happens for now, in case the move against international students is a negotiating tactic that does not stick.', 'The possibility that Trump could block foreign enrollment at other colleges only raises the uncertainty for students planning to pursue their education overseas, said Craig Riggs, who has been working in international education for about 30 years and is the editor of ICEF Monitor. He said he urges families to consult carefully with advisers and not to overreact to the day’s headlines.', '“The rules under which students would make this huge decision to devote years of their lives and quite a bit of money to studying at Harvard have been shown to change quite quickly,” Riggs said.', 'An aspiring economist, Nuguse was the only student accepted to Harvard this year from Kalamino Special High School, which caters to gifted students from underprivileged backgrounds from across Tigray.', 'After receiving acceptances also to Columbia University and Amherst College, Nuguse chose Harvard, which he had long dreamed of attending. He said he hopes it will work out to attend Harvard.', 'Nuguse was granted a visa to study at Harvard, and he worries it might be too late to reverse his decision and attend another university anyway. He received an email from Harvard last week, telling him to proceed with his registration and highlighting a judge’s order in Harvard’s favor in the dispute over foreign enrollment.', '“I hope the situation is temporary and I can enroll on time to go on and realize my dream far from reality in Ethiopia,” he said.', 'Associated Press writers Collin Binkley, Jocelyn Gecker and Cheyanne Mumphrey contributed to this report.', 'The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

It also directs the Secretary of State “to consider revoking” those visas – known as F, M and J visas – for current Harvard students who meet the proclamation’s “criteria,” the White House said in a statement.', 'The move throws Harvard’s ability to enroll international students – which make up about 27% of the student body – into doubt once again just days after a federal judge blocked the administration’s last attempt targeting foreign students at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.', 'While Harvard has argued in legal filings that White House orders were behind the Department of Homeland Security’s effort to revoke its ability to host international students, this is the first time Trump has gotten directly involved in the dispute at the center of his broader battle against elite US academics.', 'Harvard “will continue to protect its international students,” its spokesperson told CNN. “This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.”', 'Trump briefly mentioned his fight with Harvard on Friday during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, repeating that the administration wants a list of Harvard’s international students – information the government already has.', '“I think they’re starting to behave actually, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said, referring to Harvard.', 'Harvard is battling the White House on two fronts, as the university also has sued the Trump administration for cutting more than $2.2 billion in federal funds and threatening billions more, as well as Harvard’s tax-exempt status. That money remains frozen as the case is pending in court, scheduled for arguments next month.', 'The White House said the latest move is an attempt to “safeguard national security,” accusing Harvard of having “concerning foreign ties and radicalism.” The announcement also cited the university’s alleged failure to “provide sufficient information” about foreign students and “reporting deficient data on only three students.”', '“Harvard is either not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students,” the White House said. It also accused the Ivy League institution of failing to address antisemitism on campus as well and persistently “prioritizing” diversity, equity, and inclusion – designed to advance racial, gender, class and other representation in public spaces – that Trump decries as “illegal and immoral discrimination.”', 'The new proclamation “exempts aliens whose entry is deemed in the national interest” and does not apply to international students attending other US universities through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, known as SEVP, run by the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit, or ICE.', 'The president’s order is scheduled to last six months unless extended, states the proclamation, which gives the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security 90 days to make a recommendation on whether it should be extended.', '“Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” the proclamation reads.', 'The proclamation immediately drew condemnation from China, the second-largest sender of international students to the US. “China-US educational cooperation is mutually beneficial.

The school argued it had turned over all the information it had, saying the government’s demand included records it doesn’t keep.', 'Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute', 'Harvard has accused the government of failing to follow its own requirements for removing a university from the SEVP program and argued the revocation was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government’s ideologically rooted policy demands, including banning masks at campus protests and expanding “viewpoint diversity” within the university community, subject to third-party auditing.', '“This is really like sentence first and verdict afterwards, so there continues to be a different set of rules for Harvard, a different set of procedures for Harvard, a different set of laws for Harvard,” said university attorney Ian Heath Gershengorn in court last week.', 'Although the administration had previously agreed to follow procedures giving Harvard 30 days to contest the loss of its international program, Gershengorn told Burroughs that a court order was still necessary. He said he feared the government might attempt a new strategy.', '“We want to make sure there are no shenanigans between now and then,” he said last week.', 'The Department of Education has warned US colleges and universities of possible consequences if they don’t take adequate steps to protect Jewish students and separately threatened federal funding of any American academic institution that considers race in most aspects of student life.', 'US Education Department threatens Columbia University’s accreditation over campus antisemitism concerns', 'The administration also escalated its fight with Columbia University on Wednesday, declaring the school doesn’t meet accreditation standards because of its failure to protect Jewish students.', 'The White House has homed in on foreign students and staff it believes participated in contentious campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war. The administration’s attacks on Harvard began March 31, when Trump officials sent Harvard a letter advising they would review all roughly $9 billion of the Ivy League institution’s contracts and grants.', 'Last week, the White House directed federal agencies to cancel all remaining contracts with Harvard University – about $100 million in all, two senior Trump administration officials told CNN.', 'Some Harvard staff worry draining the university of its foreign students would debilitate the academic prowess of both the institution and, potentially, American academia as a whole.', '“This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission,” university spokesperson Jason Newton said last month after the administration moved to ban Harvard from enrolling foreign students.', 'In the 2024-2025 academic year, there were 6,793 international students enrolled at Harvard, and its international academic population is comprised of 9,970 people, according to the university.', 'International students are more likely to pay full tuition at US colleges, in part because most aren’t eligible for federal financial aid, bringing significant funding to colleges, CNN has reported.', 'More than three-quarters of international students primarily fund their education themselves, through their family or through current employment, the Institute of International Education found.

Contact him at authorvdh@gmail.com.', 'Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.', 'Hello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. Recently, President Donald Trump has escalated his struggle with Harvard University. Remember what the issues were. Harvard had not really followed the letter of the law according to the 2022 Supreme Court ruling, which it and the University of North Carolina had lost.', 'In other words, they were, by court order, to stop giving preference in admissions, in hiring, in promotion, in retention on the basis of race, gender, etc., what we would call DEI. Harvard has been skirting that. And I think the data’s pretty clear how they have and no question that they’ve been doing it.', 'The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you. Donate now', 'Second, they have also been getting a lot of money from foreign governments, not always fully accounted for, that is reported to the Department of Education, specifically Communist China and Qatar, over the years.', 'You could make the argument that there have been, in the past, graduations, dorms that have a racial basis, almost a segregation element to them.', 'You can make the argument that they don’t fully honor the First Amendment when you have guest speakers. Sometimes when they want to give a presentation at a formal lecture or even an informal class, students—while they may be officially discouraged from it—they are allowed, de facto, to shout the speaker down or to protest.', 'I think there’s no question that there is a climate of antisemitism throughout Harvard. Recently, two Harvard students who assaulted a Jewish student—one of whom was kind of rewarded with a $65,000 honorarium through the auspices of the law school, another one was given an honorific title at a graduation at the Divinity School of marshal. That sent the wrong message.', 'What I’m getting at is there was a lot of cause for Donald Trump to suggest, “I don’t need this, the country doesn’t need this.” But in his bill of complaints that were contingent on Harvard making compromises, he also got into elements of instruction, curriculum, and hiring.', 'He said, “Why are you hiring people from only one point of view?” Which I think is indisputable. Very few conservatives. Or one particular take on the American history, i.e., negative. That prompted the Council on Higher Education and other venues that have published it to solicit letters from people who would be called center-right—some of my colleagues at Hoover. And they objected to what Donald Trump’s add-ons were. And I think that’s reflected in The Wall Street Journal column by Jason Riley.', 'Essentially, they’re saying: We understand when Harvard’s clearly violating laws or charging too much for individual research grants—60% overhead. But now you’re entering the inner domain of the Harvard complex and you’re trying to micromanage and that’s wrong.', 'I’m not a constitutional lawyer, but I don’t know whether my colleagues and friends on the right have characterized it the way in which the argument is coming from the Trump administration.', 'They are saying, “This is analogous to immigration. When somebody is a guest and applies to come here in a visa, that’s an invitation. And we don’t have to give reasons why we don’t want a particular person to come to the United States. What the federal government does with its money vis-a-vis private education is kind of like an invitation. They invite us to give them money. And sometimes we don’t wanna do it. Maybe we say, ‘We don’t like Harvard. We like Fresno State.’ And we don’t have to give you a reason at all because it’s not a requirement. It’s a privilege. Some colleges like Hillsdale don’t take any money. They don’t want us to give them money.”', 'And so, I think the argument from the administration that maybe our right-wing friends are missing is not that the Trump administration doesn’t have a right to go in and micromanage. They’re just saying, “I don’t really wanna give Harvard any money. They’ve got $53 billion. They’re private. They’re not public institutions. But you know, if they ask us and they want money, then we have to look at why we would give it to them.”', 'And it’s kind of like Mr. Smith coming from Korea or Mr. Jones coming from Sweden. We look at them and we don’t really think they add to the Americans. So, we don’t have an invitation.', 'It’s kind of like foreign aid. Maybe Denmark wants foreign aid. Maybe Ghana wants foreign aid. And we look at it and then, we’re under no—we can say, “Well, Denmark, you have to give us Greenland—if we want—before we give you foreign aid.” We’re under no requirement to explain every decision we make for an optional gift.', 'So we would apply that logic. I think that’s what the Trump administration is doing: “Harvard, here’s some money. We don’t really care if you want it or not. But if you do want it, we would suggest that you broaden your curriculum, you give both points of view, and just try to hire more conservatives to balance out. And if you don’t want to do that, don’t worry about it. We’ll just give the money to trade school.”', 'This is as simple as that.', 'We publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.', 'Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government.', 'The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government.', 'In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.', 'You can read the first chapter of this new book for FREE in this eBook, The Woketopus: Chapter One using the secure link below.', '© 2025 The Daily Signal Media Group, Inc.

This also affects TUM students.', 'She wishes to remain anonymous. Others who are currently studying or working at Harvard University no longer respond to inquiries. This is understandable, as attracting negative attention from the U.S. government could result in the loss of one\'s visa. The young woman talking to us is studying in a master\'s program at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology. Until a few days ago, she was a visiting researcher as part of a study program at Harvard Business School. She came to the USA at the beginning of the year with a ""J1 Student Internship"" visa, i.e. a residence permit for a student internship. Harvard had already recommended that she entered the country before Trump\'s inauguration on January 20. ""It was anticipated early on that there could be difficulties.""', 'However, when entering the country, it also depends on which border officials you meet. The TUM student left and re-entered the country once over Easter. ""The border officer was very friendly and congratulated me on Harvard."" But she had also heard of completely different experiences. She has since left the country, a plan she had already made earlier.', 'Since Trump took office, there has been a great deal of uncertainty on campus, particularly among students from countries that the president deems hostile, including China, communist countries, Muslim countries, and some African countries. Then, at the end of May, the bombshell came: According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Harvard would no longer be permitted to enroll new international students. Those already enrolled would have to transfer to another university or risk losing their residence status. The university has filed a lawsuit against this decision. However, the U.S. government is not backing down. According to U.S. media outlets, the government has ordered checks of the online activities of all visa applicants to study at Harvard. This would affect researchers and guest speakers as well. And most recently, the US administration imposed an entry ban for all international students at Harvard.', 'Many do not know if they can legally remain in the country for the foreseeable future. They are looking for alternatives and trying to have a plan B in place. ""In addition to uncertainty, there is, of course, also despair and sadness at missing out on a great opportunity that has been worked toward for a long time,"" says the young TUM student who spent a few months in Cambridge. She is also in contact with full-time German students at Harvard via WhatsApp groups, where she observed downright panic. ""If an immigration officer gets hold of your cell phone and you haven\'t deleted your social media accounts, it\'s too late,"" says another TUM student who also wishes to remain anonymous because she might want to continue working in the U.S. She is conducting research at a hospital that sponsored her visa and the rules against Harvard don´t apply to her. However, she has friends who have already had their residence permits revoked because they applied for them through the university.', 'The Harvard International Office supports international students and researchers by providing updates, informational calls, and legal advice. The office recommends that students and researchers avoid conspicuous behavior, such as participating in protests, posting criticism on social media, or committing traffic offenses, so as not to attract the attention of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office. The German Academic Exchange Service also offers support. In the coming days, it intends to discuss current developments with its member universities and also expand its information and advice services on developments in the USA. German students and doctoral candidates in the USA can also contact the DAAD office in New York, according to a press release issued this week.', 'Technical University of Munich', 'Corporate Communications Center', 'TUM alumnus embarks on charity ride from Munich to Accra', 'TUM LEAP wins funding for innovative teaching architecture', 'Students assess engineering subjects in CHE Rankings', '', 'Technical University of Munich\nArcisstraße 21\n80333 München', 'Phone: +49 (0)89-289-01\nFax: +49 (0)89-289-22000', 'Airbus · Altana · Audi · Bayerischer Bauindustrieverband · BMW · Bosch · Busch Vacuum · Clariant · Dräxlmaier · Evonik Industries · Google · Herrenknecht · HUAWEI · Infineon · Linde · MAN · Nestlé · Rohde & Schwarz · RWE · SAP · SGL Carbon · Siemens · TRUMPF · TÜV-Süd · Vereinigung der Bayerischen Wirtschaft · Volkswagen · Wacker Chemie']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNVRibHBNVHpOc05GRm9kemRMVFJDN0F4aTBCU2dLTWdNTjRnZw=-w280-h168-p-df

He and other admitted students around the world are anxiously tracking the school's feud with the Trump administration, which is seeking to keep it from enrolling international students."", ""On Thursday, Harvard challenged President Donald Trump's latest move to bar foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend the college, calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands. In an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. Last month, a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard’s certification to host foreign students."", 'Admission to Harvard, then months of uncertainty', ""Increasingly, the nation’s oldest and best-known university has attracted some of the brightest minds from around the world, with international students accounting for one-quarter of its enrollment. As Harvard’s fight with the administration plays out, foreign students can only wait to find out if they'll be able to attend the school at all. Some are weighing other options."", 'For Nuguse, 21, the war in Ethiopia forced schools to close in many parts of the province. After schooling resumed, he then took a gap year to study and save money to pay for his TOEFL English proficiency test in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.', '“The war affected me a great deal and when I found out the news that I was accepted to Harvard, I was ecstatic. I knew it was a proud moment for my family, teachers, mentors and friends, who were instrumental in my achievement,” he said.', ""The following months have been filled with uncertainty. On Wednesday, Trump signed a directive seeking to block U.S. entry for Harvard's international students, which would block thousands who are scheduled to come to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for summer and fall terms."", ""Harvard's court challenge a day later attacked Trump’s legal justification for the action — a federal law allowing him to block a “class of aliens” deemed detrimental to the nation’s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn’t qualify as a “class of aliens,” Harvard said in its filing."", '“The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” the university wrote.', 'In the meantime, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni.', '“Each of us is part of a truly global university community,” Garber said Thursday. “We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.”', 'Crackdown on international students affects interest in the US', 'The standoff with Harvard comes as the administration has been tightening scrutiny of student visas nationwide. Thousands of students around the country abruptly lost permission to be in the U.S. this spring before the administration reversed itself, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week the U.S. would “aggressively revoke” visas for students from China.', ""While many admitted students say they're waiting to find out if they can come to the U.S., prospective students still in high school are starting to look elsewhere, said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services."", '“It is one blow after another,” said Henniger, who works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students. “At this point, international student interest in the U.S. has basically dropped to nil.”', ""The future of Harvard's roughly 7,000 international students has been hanging in the balance since the Department of Homeland Security first moved to block its foreign enrollment on May 22."", 'For many, the twists and turns have been exhausting. Jing, a 23-year-old master’s student, is currently completing an internship in China this summer, and unsure if he can reenter the U.S. for the fall semester.', '“It is tiring, we all feel numb now. Trump just makes big news headlines once every few days since he got back to the White House,” said Jing, who agreed to speak under his family name out of concern about retaliation from the Trump administration.', 'Jing said he is going to watch and see what happens for now, in case the move against international students is a negotiating tactic that does not stick.', ""The possibility that Trump could block foreign enrollment at other colleges only raises the uncertainty for students planning to pursue their education overseas, said Craig Riggs, who has been working in international education for about 30 years and is the editor of ICEF Monitor. He said he urges families to consult carefully with advisers and not to overreact to the day's headlines."", '“The rules under which students would make this huge decision to devote years of their lives and quite a bit of money to studying at Harvard have been shown to change quite quickly,” Riggs said.', 'An aspiring economist, Nuguse was the only student accepted to Harvard this year from Kalamino Special High School, which caters to gifted students from underprivileged backgrounds from across Tigray.', 'After receiving acceptances also to Columbia University and Amherst College, Nuguse chose Harvard, which he had long dreamed of attending. He said he hopes it will work out to attend Harvard.', ""Nuguse was granted a visa to study at Harvard, and he worries it might be too late to reverse his decision and attend another university anyway.

Some 4,000 student workers represented by unions at Harvard who would be impacted.', '“The Trump’s administration’s threat to international scholars is a huge attack on thousands of UAW-represented workers on Harvard’s campus. We are seeing escalations against immigrant workers across the country and this is no different,” said the director of the United Auto Workers Region 9A, Brandon Mancilla. “The labor movement must see these attacks as what they are – an attempt to divide workers and create false enemies in a time of rampant corporate greed.”', 'Sudipta Saha, a fourth-year PhD candidate in population health sciences at Harvard who holds citizenship with Canada and Bangladesh, and is a member of the executive board of the Harvard Graduate Students Union, explained the fears the move has instilled in international student workers on campus who are worried about their visa status, education and research.', '“Even if Harvard wins this particular case, the broader authoritarian turn that this represents is still being successful, because a lot of people are worried about whether they can actually speak out,” said Saha. “International students who have been asking me, have been asking each other, is it safe to go on the record? Is it safe to even write an op ed? And I think when people are asking questions like that, that kind of shows how already, how successful this kind of crackdown has been.”', '“We do a lot of vital work. There are people working on robotics, cancer drugs and Alzheimer’s research. All of that is impacted when they’re forced to stop,” he added. “All of this research work is tangled with a ton of other industries that are not necessarily within the university, from development of these pharmaceutical drugs to research equipment, all of those things are affected if they were forced to stop their work and leave.”', 'The Trump administration has also halted interviews for all student exchanges and visas and secretary of state Marco Rubio has vowed to begin revoking visas of students from China with ties to the China Communist party or working in critical fields.', 'Ellen Yi, a Rhodes scholar from China who was admitted to a doctoral program at Harvard, was set to join Harvard in fall 2025, but is now looking for different options.', '“I feel a strong sense of insecurity and uncertainty. The policy keeps swinging back and forth and we don’t know what is the next step of the government,” said Yi. “I’m very pessimistic about the future and I’m looking for some safer options.”', 'In response to Rubio’s threats of revoking visas from Chinese students, she said: “I was not very surprised, but still very disappointed, frustrated and kind of panicked, because the policy statement was very unclear,” adding it remains unclear how the Trump administration will define connections to the Chinese Communist party or critical fields.', '“I find this absurd,” said Ozan Baytaş, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School from Turkey. “There’s a clear attack on the universities, freedom of speech, academic freedom and science, and there’s a clear intention to purge the current system of many non-citizen workers who are very talented.”', 'He cited Maureen Martin, the director of immigration services at Harvard, who wrote in a court declaration that the revocation notice has made students afraid to attend graduation ceremonies, have forced international students to reconsider their futures at Harvard and inquire about transferring, and that incoming international students have already reported experiencing issues in obtaining visas.', '“Many internationals, non-citizen workers are afraid to speak out. Many want to leave. Many don’t want to come back to the US, because they think their future plans may be interrupted by a whimsical move from the government at any moment,” Baytas added. “The best of the best in the world wants to come here to Harvard because there are opportunities. There are many good research labs, and they simply won’t come here, and the science here will suffer.”', 'Despite the policies and rhetoric coming from the Trump administration, Baytaş argued that student workers and unions, in and out of the legal system, intend to fight back.', '“People in the US here say stand up, fight back, so I am confident academic freedom will rise,” he concluded. “I’m very hopeful, despite all the failings of the current administration.”', 'Harvard and the White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNVRibHBNVHpOc05GRm9kemRMVFJDN0F4aTBCU2dLTWdNTjRnZw=-w280-h168-p-df

Does Palestine Fit In?', 'NEWS', 'Strings Attached: How Harvard’s Wealthiest Alumni Are Reshaping University Giving', 'Updated June 5, 2025, at 7:33 p.m.', 'Harvard filed an amended complaint in federal court Thursday evening, accusing the Trump administration of unlawfully retaliating against the school by barring international students from entering the United States on visas to attend Harvard.', 'The filing comes less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending entry for foreign nationals intending to study at Harvard — a move the University alleged was designed to sidestep a judge’s temporary block on the government’s earlier attempt to strip Harvard of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification.', '“When the Court enjoined the Secretary’s efforts to revoke Harvard’s certifications and force its students to transfer or depart the country, the President sought to achieve the same result by refusing to allow Harvard students to enter in the first place,” Harvard’s lawyers wrote. “That was an unlawful evasion of the Court’s order.”', 'The University’s amended complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, described the harm caused by the proclamation as immediate and irreparable. It asked the judge overseeing the case, Allison D. Burroughs, to enjoin the federal government from enforcing Trump’s proclamation.', 'Harvard has also requested a preliminary injunction to keep its SEVP status in place until the lawsuit is resolved. Burroughs has not yet ruled on the preliminary injunction but decided last week to extend the temporary restraining order preventing the Department of Homeland Security from stripping Harvard’s SEVP status.', 'Harvard’s amended complaint was accompanied by a request for a TRO to immediately block the Wednesday proclamation. The filing also asked for an extension until June 20 on the existing TRO, saying that the proclamation had thrown a wrench in Harvard’s negotiations with federal agencies to agree on the terms of a preliminary injunction.', 'Thursday’s filing adds the proclamation to the list of actions Harvard has described — across two lawsuits — as a coordinated federal campaign to punish the institution for refusing to comply with sweeping federal demands over its governance, admissions, and academic programming.', 'Harvard alleged that the actions violate the First Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and long-standing immigration law. Harvard is seeking immediate injunctive relief to restore its ability to host international students under the F-1 and J-1 visa programs and to block enforcement of the proclamation.', 'Trump justified his Wednesday order as a national security measure, asserting without evidence that Harvard’s international students were driving rising rates of crime on campus.', 'But Harvard’s lawyers shot back in the 101-page filing, writing that the order was simply the latest in a campaign against Harvard.', '“The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” they wrote.', 'Trump’s order came just days after a federal court reinstated Harvard’s SEVP certification, which the Department of Homeland Security had attempted to revoke on May 22. The revocation threatened the legal status of more than 7,000 international students and scholars at Harvard and prompted an emergency legal challenge by the University.', 'Rather than comply with the court’s ruling, Harvard argued, the administration escalated its campaign.', 'In the filing, Harvard’s lawyers claimed that the legal statutes cited in Wednesday’s executive order are “plainly inapplicable” because the order does not suspend entry for a group of nonimmigrants, but rather for individuals associated with a particular institution.', '“The President is not suspending entry for any ‘class of aliens’; to the contrary, nonimmigrants may enter the country unabated, as long as they do not attend Harvard,” they wrote.', 'The University’s lawyers argued that rather than attempting to protect national interests through the ban, Trump was using it to punish Harvard — which, they said, overstepped his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act.', 'Harvard’s lawyers painted the proclamation as part of a broader pattern of politically motivated retaliation, pointing to a string of public statements by senior administration officials, including Trump himself, who sought to punish Harvard for resisting federal oversight.', 'In particular, the University cited remarks made by Trump during an April 30 cabinet meeting in which he said, of Harvard, that “the students they have, the professors they have, the attitude they have is not American.”', 'Shortly after the complaint was filed, University President Alan M. Garber ’76 assured affiliates in an email that “contingency plans” were being developed to allow students to continue their work during the summer and the upcoming academic year. Garber wrote that the Harvard International Office would be in touch with students directly affected by the proclamation or by Trump’s travel bans on 12 countries, also announced Wednesday.', 'Garber reaffirmed the importance of international students to Harvard’s campus and his commitment to defending their place in the University.', '“International students and scholars make outstanding contributions inside and outside of our classrooms and laboratories, fulfilling our mission of excellence in countless ways,” he wrote. “We will celebrate them, support them, and defend their interests as we continue to assert our Constitutional rights.”', '—Staff writer Samuel A.

Why Trump is really going after Harvard,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/01/trump-harvard-authoritarianism-democracy,"['If the US’s oldest university bends the knee, the door to authoritarianism opens and democracy fades, experts warn', 'In mortarboards and crimson-fringed gowns, thousands of students were joined by smiling families for the centuries-old ritual of graduation day. But this year was different.', 'Alan Garber, the president of Harvard University, received a standing ovation and welcomed graduates “from down the street, across the country and around the world”, drawing applause for the last words: “Around the world – just as it should be.”', 'It was a nod, subtle but firm, to the international students who are part of the lifeblood of Harvard but now a target for Donald Trump: his administration is seeking to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll students from overseas. It is just one front in an escalating battle between a US president with authoritarian ambitions and the country’s oldest, wealthiest and most prestigious university.', 'Since taking office more than four months ago, Trump has used executive power to take aim at Congress, law firms, media organisations, cultural institutions and leading universities. Some have resisted but many have capitulated. In Harvard, the man who urged his supporters to “fight, fight, fight” faces a resilient foe unlike any he has taken on before.', 'Its emergence as a bulwark of the opposition to Trump was summed up by this year’s Class Day speaker at Harvard, the former basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: “After seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the US constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom.”', 'Harvard was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1636, a century and a half before the nation itself. Its alumni include the former presidents John F Kennedy and Barack Obama, supreme court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, tech entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, actors Matt Damon and Natalie Portman and writer Margaret Atwood.', 'Now it is in Trump’s crosshairs. The administration claims its actions are aimed at tackling issues such as antisemitism on campus, discrimination – particularly against white, Asian, male and straight individuals – foreign influence from China, and perceived “woke” or “leftist” ideology in academia.', 'The administration launched its offensive in April, sending a letter to Harvard demanding that it make far-reaching changes in how it operates. The list included external audits of campus viewpoints, achieving “viewpoint diversity” as determined by the government and potentially terminating certain programmes.', 'Garber publicly rejected the demands, stating they amounted to ceding control of the university to the government and were an unconstitutional attack on academic freedom.', 'Within hours, the Trump administration announced it was freezing more than $2bn in federal contracts and grants with Harvard, which mostly fund scientific and medical research. This has since risen to a total of $3bn. Harvard is fighting the funding cuts in court.', 'In May, Trump turned the screws further. He said he was considering taking previously awarded grant money for scientific and engineering research away and giving it to trade schools. The White House urged federal agencies to cancel any remaining contracts with Harvard, worth an estimated $100m.', 'The administration also announced that it would revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll international students and force current foreign students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal immigration status. In a chilling statement, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”', 'More than a quarter of Harvard’s students come from outside the US and serve as a vital revenue source at the Ivy League school. Critics warned that Trump’s actions would represent a spectacular own goal, driving the world’s best talents away from the US and into the arms of its competitors.', 'Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, wrote on Substack: “Had Trump’s anti-foreign student policies been in place decades ago, Oxford grad Elon Musk would have built Tesla in the United Kingdom, Tsinghua University alum Jensen Huang would have built Nvidia in the People’s Republic of China or Taiwan, and Moscow State University grad Sergei Brin would have built Google in Russia.”', 'Harvard sued the administration and won an emergency block on the action. This week, a judge said she would extend the order as the two sides continue to thrash it out in court.', 'Trump is also using the tax system as a cudgel. Most universities, including Harvard, are exempt from federal income tax because they are deemed to be charitable organisations operated exclusively for public educational purposes. The administration is now threatening Harvard’s tax-exempt status, which experts say saves the school hundreds of millions of dollars each year.', 'Trump’s huge spending bill before Congress would drastically hike taxes that Harvard and other elite schools pay on the profits their massive endowment investments make. Critics say that would weaken the ability of Harvard and other rich schools to provide generous financial aid packages to poorer students.', 'What are the White House’s motives? Some observers detect the hand of JD Vance and the deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. In 2022, Vance told Vanity Fair magazine: “I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left. We need like a de-Baathification programme, a de-woke-ification programme.”', 'And on Thursday, Miller told Fox News: “Harvard has engaged in decades of invidious, unlawful and illegal race-based discrimination against American citizens ... The Democrat party’s philosophy right now is for foreigners, everything – for Americans, nothing.”', 'Jason Johnson, a political scientist at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, said: “Their goal is to intimidate and break down institutions of higher learning in America because that is where most of the resistance to their authoritarian tendencies is going to come from.', '“They figure, if we can bankrupt Harvard, if we can embarrass Harvard, if we can put Harvard in a position of weakness or at least get them to bend the knee, then all the other institutions in America will follow. That’s why they’re doing this.”', 'Johnson warned: “Trump is not going to meet his match because he has the entire resources of the federal government at his disposal. Regardless of what Harvard does, there will be other universities who simply see the attack and comply in advance, and that ultimately would still be a victory for the Trump administration.”', 'Other commentators detect an element of class warfare. Trump won election last November with a base drawing largely on non-college-educated white men. Now he is stoking hostility towards the ivory towers of the US’s most elite university.', 'Brendan Boyle, a Democratic representative who graduated from Harvard in 2005, said: “Part of Trump’s political skill is figuring out how to portray himself as this working man’s populist hero even though he’s a billionaire who pisses in gold toilets.', '“Beating up on Harvard will probably help him among some in his base, but I do think most Americans recognize this for what it is: an attempted government takeover of higher education. That’s something that should actually worry all of us.”', 'The onslaught against Harvard is typical of an administration that, in its opening weeks, sought to overwhelm opponents with shock and awe. Columbia University made sweeping concessions, hoping to claw back $400m of withdrawn federal grants.', 'But Harvard’s substantial $53bn endowment provides it with greater capacity to withstand pressure and engage in legal battles compared with less well-endowed institutions. It has refused to buckle to Trump’s demands. Instead, it has challenged the administration’s actions in court and achieved some temporary victories.', 'Boyle, who spoke with Harvard’s Garber recently, said: “I personally expressed to him how proud I am to see Harvard standing up and not backing down from this fight the way, unfortunately, some other universities had backed down. In standing up to this administration, Harvard is waging a battle not just for the future of Harvard but for the future of American higher education.”', 'Asked whether he was confident that Harvard will win, Boyle replied: “Harvard has been around for hundreds of years before Donald Trump and it will be around for hundreds of years after Donald Trump.”', 'Trump has long styled himself as a fighter. He waged legal battles during his business career. He has feuded with celebrities ranging from Rosie O’Donnell to Taylor Swift to Bruce Springsteen. He has railed against media outlets such as CNN and the New York Times. In the political arena, he took on the entire Republican party establishment and won. He also waged bitter campaigns against Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.', 'But both Trump’s first and second presidential terms have run afoul of a robust judiciary finding many of his actions unconstitutional. This week, a federal court blocked him from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. He won a temporary reprieve from an appeals court a day later but his signature set of economic policies remains in doubt.', 'Academics at Harvard trust that the rule of law will prevail in their own case. Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law emeritus, said: “I think we’re going to win the battle in the courts. These are open-and-shut cases.', '“In fact, in the federal courts in the month of May, there were a lot of battles involving Trump against various individuals and institutions, and you know what his record was? He lost 96% of them. The percentage that he lost was not very different depending on which president appointed the judge, because these are easy legal questions.”', 'Holding firm is crucial, Tribe believes, because Trump is trying to pick off universities one by one, just as he did with law firms. At stake is a stand against authoritarianism and the hope that courage will be contagious.', '“If they can’t control the university, they want to disband it because the first thought of a tyrant is to suppress the power of reason and the citadel of freedom,” Tribe said. “That is the university. It’s been true since the Middle Ages. Harvard has an emblematic significance that makes it stick in Donald Trump’s craw. Its motto ‘veritas’ must irritate the hell out of him because truth is his enemy.”']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNVRibHBNVHpOc05GRm9kemRMVFJDN0F4aTBCU2dLTWdNTjRnZw=-w280-h168-p-df
