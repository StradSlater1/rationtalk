With the official Android 16 release date near and the first Samsung Galaxy Android 16 (One UI 8) betas arriving, here's what you need to know and expect."", 'While Samsung had a rough go with the One UI 7 release, which faced countless delays, things are moving along much faster with this next software update. In a surprise turn of events, Samsung sent out the first One UI 8 beta (based on Android 16) for the Galaxy S25 in May, and the official release could be right around the corner.', ""Now that we know Google plans to release Android 16 in June instead of sometime in August or later, the Samsung Galaxy One UI 8 update should arrive sooner, too. The update will deliver an improved software experience, more AI goodies, home and lock screens improvements, better security, tighter privacy, and more. So, here's which Samsung Galaxy phones will get Android 16 and when."", ""The moment we've been waiting for."", 'Before Samsung officially releases the One UI 8 update (Android 16) for its Galaxy phones and tablets, owners in select regions with specific models can beta test the software early.', ""While internal testing started in March, Samsung's first Android 16 beta didn't arrive until the end of May 2025. Currently, One UI 8 is available for the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, with select foldables and older models next in line. Models and availability vary by region, but the phone maker will slowly expand its offering as the release date nears."", 'Next, we imagine the latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 will join the One UI 8 beta, followed by the Galaxy S24 series sometime in late June, then the Galaxy S23 series in July, and so on. Several rumors already suggest that exact timeline.', ""But the bigger question isn't which devices will get the beta, but when will the official release of Android 16 and One UI 8 arrive? Google is ahead of schedule this year, with its arrival slated for June, rather than August or September. Once Google releases the software, Samsung will follow suit."", ""Given how far along Samsung is with the One UI 8 beta, we assume it'll arrive shortly after Google releases it. Plus, the company has already confirmed that the all-new Galaxy Z Fold 7 will launch with Android 16, and it will probably be announced in July and released within the first few weeks of August."", ""So, if you're not interested in being a beta tester, look for Samsung's official Android 16 One UI 8 update to start rolling out as soon as August to somewhere in mid-September."", 'However, keep in mind that the official release will vary by model, region, and even carrier. Then, Samsung will slowly issue updates for budget models like the Galaxy A-series and tablets.', ""The One UI 8 update, based on Android 16, will offer a combination of new features from Google and countless changes by the developer teams at Samsung. So far, the first beta didn't deliver a ton of changes, but we expect more to arrive in upcoming releases."", 'So far, Samsung has delivered enhanced AI capabilities throughout, app redesigns, better split-screen multitasking, Quick Share improvements, a more intuitive Reminder app, upgrades to the Samsung Internet browser, changes to the Calendar, Now Bar, Gallery, and more. Android 16 also added notification cooldown back to Android, better battery health management, live update notifications, and other changes.', ""Overall, the experience is very similar to what you already have with One UI 7, with more polish, better performance, and AI. Remember that we're still on the first beta, and Samsung will continue to fine-tune the release and integrate more features as it releases additional beta versions. One UI 8 isn't a huge update in terms of visuals, but under the hood, a lot will change. We'll update this list as more features arrive."", ""Samsung isn't ready to share a complete list of its phones and tablets that will receive the official Android 16 update yet. Still, we know it'll all start with the launch of the new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 in July or August. As for updates, the first device that will get the One UI 8 update will be the latest flagship Galaxy S25 series."", 'Once the Galaxy S25 gets Android 16, Samsung will quickly expand the rollout to the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold/Flip 6, Galaxy S23, A-series, tablets, and work down its expansive list of devices.', ""As a reminder, Samsung now supports phones with seven years of OS updates, but older models are still on track to get at least four major updates and five years of software patches and maintenance releases. For example, the aging Galaxy S22 should see Android 16, but don't expect that older Galaxy S21 Ultra to get it."", ""Until Samsung makes it official, here's an unconfirmed list of Galaxy devices that'll get Android 16 and One UI 8."", '', 'If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone released in the last 2–3 years, expect to see the latest One UI 8 release based on Android 16 sometime before the end of 2025. Things should move much quicker this year than it did with One UI 7 in 2024/2025.', '', ""Again, this is only an estimated list, and we'll confirm more devices once Samsung shares its update plans. That said, essentially, all Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets that launched with Android 13 (or released in 2022) should receive an upgrade to Android 16 and One UI 8."", ""Newer phones and tablets are the first priority, so those with older models may be waiting until Q4 of 2025 for the software. Additionally, if your device is too old to receive OS updates, it'll still get security patches."", 'Everything depends on when Google releases Android 16 and how long it takes for Samsung to complete its beta testing period and start an official rollout. But considering how early the betas started this time around, get ready for One UI 8 to be one of the quickest updates in recent history.', ""With the One UI 8 beta officially underway, expect more details soon. We'll update our list with models, timelines, and expectations as we learn more. Now, let's just hope the release doesn't face any setbacks or delays like we saw last year. Finally, remember that rollouts will arrive in waves on different models and regions, and models from U.S. carriers are usually even slower."", ""So, just because you see a Galaxy S24 getting One UI 8 in one country doesn't mean it'll arrive for your device that same week. Be patient, stay tuned, and get ready for the next big Android release on your Galaxy device."", 'We want to hear from you!
