It is based on Qi 2.1, but brings further improvements not only in speed, but also in charging efficiency and magnetic alignment accuracy.', ""Essential informationmacis that the new MagSafe chargers are rated for output power 45 W (15 V at 3 A), which is significantly more than the current 15W ceiling for Qi 2 and even more than 25W maximum, which can be taken iPhone 16 when using a 30W adapter. Of course, full power will only be available on devices with a corresponding power chip, similar to Samsung's Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC)."", 'The test documents also confirm that the new chargers will be compatible with iPhones backwards up to series 11. However, it is clear that older models will not be able to fully utilize the higher power, and will remain at their standard charging limits.

New Apple MagSafe charging pucks could double iPhone charging speeds,https://www.cultofmac.com/news/magsafe-50w-charging-pucks,"['BY DAVID SNOW • 6:15 AM, JUNE 5, 2025', 'The iPhone could soon take a big leap in wireless charging technology, with new MagSafe 50W charging pucks that support the upcoming Qi 2.2 standard. A well-known leaker found regulatory filings that reveal two new MagSafe charger models from Apple that could enable dramatically faster wireless charging speeds, at least for newer handsets.', '', 'The new chargers — designated A3503 and A3502 — maintain Apple’s familiar white puck design with braided USB-C cables, available in both 1-meter and 2-meter lengths (which might be the only difference between the two models). What sets these pucks apart from current MagSafe chargers is their support for the Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, which represents a substantial upgrade over existing technology in terms of power, according to the leak by 91mobiles. It found the filings on Taiwan’s National Communications Commission website.', 'The most compelling aspect of Qi 2.2 is its potential charging speed. While the current Qi 2 standard maxes out at 15W, and iPhone 16 models can achieve up to 25W with MagSafe charging using a 30W adapter, the new Qi 2.2 standard technically supports up to 50W of charging power. This represents a doubling of wireless charging speeds compared to what’s currently available on the latest iPhones.', 'Testing documentation indicates these new chargers are compatible with devices ranging from the iPhone 16 back to the iPhone 11, suggesting broad compatibility across Apple’s recent iPhone lineup. However, older devices will be limited by their existing charging capabilities and won’t achieve the maximum speeds. iPhone 17 models will get the boost.', 'Beyond raw charging speed, Qi 2.2 brings several other improvements. The standard features enhanced magnetic alignment that should ensure devices snap into chargers more quickly and precisely. This improved alignment contributes to better charging efficiency by reducing unnecessary power loss and heat generation.', 'The new standard also maintains backward compatibility with older Qi 2 and original Qi chargers. That ensures users won’t lose functionality with existing accessories.', 'While Apple hasn’t officially announced these chargers, their appearance in regulatory databases suggests a public release is likely in the coming months. More importantly, this development strongly hints that the iPhone 17 lineup, expected around September, will support significantly faster wireless charging speeds.', 'However, achieving the full 50W charging potential would require corresponding hardware improvements in the iPhone itself, including advanced power management circuits similar to those found in high-end Android devices. Apple’s history of gradual charging speed increases suggests the iPhone might not immediately jump to the maximum 50W capability.
