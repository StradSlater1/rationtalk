"The Billy Joel movie premiere was sad, sweet and yet incomplete",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/billy-joel-movie-premiere-sad-164002187.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'NEW YORK — A documentary about the life and career of Billy Joel, premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival at the legendary Beacon Theatre — it’s hard to get more New York than that.', 'Yet what was long planned as a night of career celebration took on unexpected poignance after Joel, 76, revealed two weeks ago that he has been diagnosed with a brain disorder — and canceled all of his concerts scheduled over the next 13 months.', 'He also had to miss the opening night of the festival, which kicked off its 24th year Wednesday with a screening of Part 1 of “Billy Joel: And So It Goes,” a sprawling film airing on HBO in July. Festival co-founders Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal made a brief appearance praising the singer-songwriter for five decades of capturing the rhythm and spirit of the city. De Niro dubbed the Long Island native as the “poet laureate of New York.”', '“Billy wanted to be with us tonight. But as you may have heard, he is dealing with a health issue and had to postpone his performances, including this one tonight. We know you join us in wishing him a speedy recovery,” Rosenthal said. A few moments later, directors Susan Lacy and Jessica Levin read a message from Joel that he wanted to convey to the audience in his classic wry manner: “Getting old sucks, but it’s still preferable to getting cremated.”', '“He will be back,” Lacy said, to loud applause from the crowd.', 'In an increasingly fractured culture, Joel’s music and lyrics unite the generations, the filmmakers said, with a relatability that made him one of the top-selling musical acts in history. Just ask his ex-wife.', '“Bill can take a kernel of something that happened and create a story that is universal, and he would get to the DNA of the human experience,” Elizabeth Weber, who was also the star’s manager back in the day, says in the film.', 'Nearly 55 years after his debut album, Joel was still filling stadiums — before the tour cancellation, he was scheduled to play another 17 shows in the United States and Britain, alongside a rotating crew of partner acts: Rod Stewart, Stevie Nicks and Sting. And for a decade, fans packed his monthly concerts at Madison Square Garden, until the unique residency ended this past summer.', 'He never had to change up the act much. The familiarity of the repertoire — “Piano Man,” “New York State of Mind,” “Uptown Girl” — was the big draw for attendees who hollered along to every word.', '“There’s a handful of folks that can both play and compose and write the lyrics to these songs that, I’m sorry, as soon as you hear a couple of phrases, you’re singing the whole damn thing,” Tom Hanks, one of the executive producers of the documentary, told the AP at the screening.', 'The rigorous tour schedule took its toll. Joel’s recent diagnosis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, was “exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,” his team said in a statement. During his last show in February, he took a startling fall.', 'Joel is a more complicated celebrity than fans might expect from his songbook of karaoke staples. Levin told the audience that when she met him, she proudly told him how much she loved his lesser-known “Streetlife Serenade” record from 1974, confident that he would clock her as a true fan. Instead, he said, “That’s probably my least favorite album.”', '“His response was my first clue that there was a lot more to Billy Joel,” Levin said. Lacy, who said she had a “cursory knowledge” of him before the film, found Joel to be a complex and layered figure.', 'Part 1 — which ran about 2½ hours, with interviews with Joel’s family, friends, band members and fellow stars, including Bruce Springsteen and Garth Brooks — chronicles his struggle to break through as a solo artist, his move to California and then back to his beloved New York. When he experienced life-changing fame with the 1977 smash album “The Stranger,” he found himself mocked for being too popular, an uncool “balladeer” in an era of anti-authoritarian punk rock. The criticism stung Joel, who saw himself as a scrappy kid from Hicksville, Long Island, scratching his way out of a tough childhood.', 'He always felt like he was struggling, he says in the film, even while enjoying astonishing success.', '“I learned life is a fight,” he says.', 'The Beacon audience cheered every New York reference in the documentary — such as the introductions of Joel’s Long Island-bred backup musicians — as well as moments when the hometown hero triumphed over the music-label suits. Like the time he declined to work with a Beatles producer because it would have meant replacing his band. Or when then-manager Weber insisted that unenthused record executives release “Just the Way You Are” as a single. It went on to win record and song of the year at the 1979 Grammy Awards.', 'Joel famously endured some dark moments — depression, rehab, divorce — and his loved ones describe them unflinchingly. While in the late-1960s duo Attila with his close friend Jon Small, Joel had an affair with the drummer’s wife. That was Weber. When the love triangle self-destructed, the piano player was so consumed by guilt and heartbreak that he tried to end his life. After a stint in a psychiatric facility, he recovered by channeling his emotion into songs — and reconnected with Weber, who helped guide him to superstardom. Small, who has moved past the affair debacle, joins their mutual ex-wife as one of the primary talking heads interviewed in the film.', 'Part 1 ends with Weber and Joel’s own explosive breakup in the early 1980s, after he started drinking heavily and using drugs to cope with the pressures of fame. But Joel has always been candid about his mistakes and trying to learn from them — another reason fans have remained so devoted for so long, and why it’s difficult to imagine him out of the spotlight.', 'The film opens with Joel talking about his early days working on an oyster boat, when he would gaze with envy at an enormous beachfront mansion. Years later, he bought that very house, though it was still undergoing construction.', '“It’s not finished yet,” Joel said. “But neither am I.”']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNDFTbkpCZWtOQ01uTnJVek5hVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdzVkFvYW5FcXMxNC1wY1BR=-w280-h168-p-df

And right now, I can’t do a squat on my foot. I can’t do a one legged squat, I fall.

I was telling him I’m enjoying playing classical music on the guitar.”', 'The original statement from last month read:', 'Billy Joel has announced that he will be cancelling all scheduled concerts following a recent diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance. Under his doctor’s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health. He is grateful for the support from fans during this time and looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage.', 'The new Piano Man documentary And So It Goes opens the Tribeca Film Festival tonight.', '', 'The 50 Best Albums Of 2025 So Far', 'Premature Evaluation: Turnstile Never Enough', 'Talking Heads Share “Psycho Killer” Video Starring Saoirse Ronan To Celebrate 50th Anniversary Of Their First Concert', 'The most important stories and least important memes, every Friday.', 'Stereogum Media']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNDFTbkpCZWtOQ01uTnJVek5hVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdzVkFvYW5FcXMxNC1wY1BR=-w280-h168-p-df

There’s Never Been a Better Time to Love Billy Joel,https://www.vulture.com/article/billy-joel-and-so-it-goes-documentary-premiere.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'If Robert De Niro wants to call Billy Joel the “poet laureate of New York,” then it’s probably safe to say that Billy Joel is the poet laureate of New York. De Niro was at the Beacon Theatre to introduce the Tribeca Film Festival’s opening-night screening of Susan Lacy and Jessica Levin’s Billy Joel: And So It Goes. Joelaphilia was alive and well for the two-and-a-half-hour first half of the documentary, which will be accompanied by a Part Two of similar length, arriving on HBO in July. A handful of celebrities — including executive producer Tom Hanks, as well as Whoopi Goldberg and Hank Azaria — were spotted in the crowd, but mostly the room was packed with Joel fans who acted like they were at an actual Madison Square Garden show every few minutes of the screening.', 'The renewed fervor in Joel may be due in part to the singer’s recent health struggles. He canceled a string of upcoming concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain disorder that causes fluid to build up in the brain, affecting his mobility, balance, and vision. The notion of a “brain disorder” is scary in and of itself, though Joel assured Howard Stern that he is “not dying.” Despite Joel’s absence from the screening last night, he told Lacy and Levin that “getting old sucks, but it’s better than being cremated.” It’s a small relief that however much fluid has built up in Joel’s brain has not disrupted his sharp, petulant sense of humor. Joel himself is present in the documentary, almost always seated behind a piano with a vape in hand, if not place nearby.', 'As to whether Billy Joel: And So It Goes is about his music or his life, the answer is: yes. What Billy Joel: And So It Goes argues is that Joel’s life is his music. His albums — especially the early ones — are mostly autobiographical. Piano Man’s title track is about Joel’s time as a lounge pianist in Los Angeles; Streetlife Serenade’s “The Entertainer,” on the other hand, is about how much Joel resented the popularity of “Piano Man.” A song like “You May Be Right” off his album Glass Houses, which features lyrics like “Even rode my motorcycle in the rain / And you told me not to drive / But I made it home alive” is about … well, when his ex-wife and then-manager Elizabeth Weber Small got mad at him for riding his motorcycle in the rain. It’s never been that deep with Joel’s music, but it’s never had to be. Through extensive archival footage, Lacy and Levin are able to show that Joel has always been one of the country’s best showmen. The music is good, his penchant for melody is undeniable, but what made Joel the artist we think of him as is how he is in front of a live audience. He’s hammy and energetic. Per his former Attila bandmate and longtime friend Jon Small, there’s an inherently corny quality to Joel that makes it hard not to love him.', 'I’ve seen Joel twice during his Madison Square Garden residency (including one of his late October shows where he serenaded a skull onstage to celebrate Halloween), and the applause in the audience after each number in Billy Joel: And So It Goes was indistinguishable from seeing him live. People go nuts for Billy Joel in New York. “Piano Man” got applause. Then “She’s Always a Woman” got applause. “New York State of Mind” got what might have tipped into a standing ovation if the documentary ended there. The enthusiasm wasn’t just about the music either — at the introduction of each other of Joel’s bandmates as talking heads in the film, the crowd went crazy. These guys are an extension of all that makes Joel great: his lifelong loyalty to them as emblematic of what’s so meaningful about this type of working-class New York City artist. He stayed true to his Long Island roots no matter what the label or a producer said. Corny as he is, Joel is consistent in who he is and what he stands for. People applauded when Joel won Grammys in the film. The excitement in the room never wavered. It was as if the audience thought if they were loud enough, Joel might be able to hear them in real life.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNDFTbkpCZWtOQ01uTnJVek5hVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdzVkFvYW5FcXMxNC1wY1BR=-w280-h168-p-df
