Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here."", 'Author J.K. Rowling, who has been one of Khelif’s most outspoken critics since the Paris Olympics, reposted 3 Wire Sports’ story on X and called World Boxing’s sex testing requirement a “win for women.” Former collegiate swimmer-turned-right-wing lightning rod Riley Gaines said a cheek swab, one of the ways World Boxing’s sex test can be conducted, is “less invasive than being punched in the face by a man.”', 'If the IOC plans to institute similar testing requirements for boxing athletes in the 2028 Olympics, which will take place in Los Angeles. The IOC did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment on the matter of testing requirements for the next Olympic games.', 'Controversy around Khelif’s Olympic eligibility began after she defeated Italian boxer Angela Carini in a preliminary match via withdrawal. Carini bowed out of the match after 46 seconds and later told reporters she had never felt a strike like one of the ones she took from Khelif. Carini’s withdrawal and Khelif’s physical appearance became the focal point of questions about the boxer’s eligibility. Critics pointed out Khelif’s disqualification from the 2023 International Boxing Association’s World Boxing Championships, as she allegedly failed to meet eligibility requirements for the women’s competition. IBA President Umar Kremlev claimed a test administered on Khelif showed heightened testosterone levels, though a statement from the IBA later said she did not undergo a testosterone test and instead, was “subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.” The IOC did not require eligibility testing for Khelif and defended her participation in the Olympic games, with IOC president Thomas Bach telling reports the Olympics would “not take part in a sometimes politically motivated, cultural war.” Khelif entered her final match as the No. 5 seed and won the gold medal in the women’s 145-pound division. She will presumably defend her medal in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.', 'Boxer Imane Khelif Wins Gold Medal As Gender Eligibility Debate Rages (Forbes)', 'What To Know About Olympics Gender Debate As Imane Khelif Wins Women’s Boxing Final (Forbes)', 'One Community.

World Boxing enacts sex-testing policy as Olympian Imane Khelif is set to compete,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/05/30/olympic-gold-medalist-boxing-imane-khelif-world-boxing/83948401007/,"['World Boxing, the new organization slated to run the boxing events at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, announced Friday it had enacted a mandatory sex-testing policy with Algerian gold medalist Imane Khelif slated to return to competition next week at the Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands. ', 'Khelif became one of the main storylines of last summer’s Paris Games when the International Boxing Association alleged she had been disqualified from an event in March 2023 because she did not pass a chromosome-based gender verification test.', 'The International Olympic Committee, which stripped the IBA of its governing body status after a corruption investigation, questioned the credibility of the IBA’s testing process and allowed Khelif to compete in the female category on the basis of being listed as a female on her Algerian passport.  ', 'Amid several days of international controversy, the 26-year-old Khelif won the gold medal in the welterweight division and said afterward: “I am a woman like any other woman. I was born a woman, I have lived as a woman, I compete as a woman. There is no doubt about that.”', 'Controversy bubbled up again in recent days when Khelif was entered in Eindhoven, prompting World Boxing’s rush to introduce sex testing under “special or emergency circumstances,” even as the organization acknowledged that its “Sex, Age and Weight” policies were still in development. ', '“In light of plans to introduce this policy and the particular circumstances surrounding some boxers that competed at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing,"" according to the release.', 'Last fall, the French publication Le Correspondant published what it claimed was a leaked 2023 medical report on Khelif showing that she was born with a rare genetic trait called 5-Alpha reductase type 2 deficiency, which is essentially an intersex condition or so-called difference in sexual development that showed in the presence of XY chromosomes, testosterone levels higher than the typical woman and internal testes.', 'Though some individual sport governing bodies like World Aquatics and World Athletics have developed participation policies on issues like transgender athletes and athletes with DSDs, the IOC stopped mandatory chromosome testing prior to the 2000 Olympics. That 25-year-old policy change was made at the urging of scientists and geneticists who did not endorse the so-called cheek swab method as precise enough to portray a full biological picture, given the vast array of mutations and conditions that could cause chromosomal anomalies without conferring an obvious or problematic competitive advantage.', 'The IOC cited this history, as well as the IBA’s opaque testing process and lack of due process afforded to Khelif, in explaining why she was allowed to compete in Paris. ', 'Khelif had competed on the international boxing circuit for years before the 2024 Olympics without controversy, including at the Tokyo Games in 2021, where she lost in the quarterfinals. ', 'World Boxing’s announcement Friday said that national federations would be responsible for testing and to confirm the sex of their boxer, and that failure to do so could lead to sanctions against the country and the athlete. The organization also says it reserves the right to do its own testing to confirm certification. ', '“Where test results for boxers that want to compete in the female category reveal Y chromosome genetic material and a potential DSD, the initial screenings will be referred to independent clinical specialists for genetic screening, hormonal profiles, anatomical examination or other valuation of endocrine profiles by medical specialists.” ', 'Though World Boxing says an appeals process will be available to boxers who fail chromosome testing, it’s unclear whether it will include some type of policy like World Athletics, which allows track and field athletes with DSDs to compete in the female category if their testosterone is lowered below 2.5 nanamoles per liter for at least six months.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognizes WBC as the global governing body of boxing, meaning that Khelif needs its approval in order to possibly participate in the 2028 Olympic Games.', 'The claims that Khelif was born biologically male were initially started by the International Boxing Association (IBA), an organization that previously promoted Imane Khelif prior to 2023. That year, the IOC stopped recognizing the IBA as the governing body of worldwide boxing — the IOC oversaw the boxing competition in the 2024 Paris Olympic Summer Games.', 'During the Paris Olympics, Khelif won Algeria the gold medal for Women’s heavyweight boxing by defeating Chinese competitor Yang Liu — all five judges scored the match in Khelif’s favor.', 'However, during the games, IBA president Umar Kremlev told a Russian state news agency that Khelif had been found to have “XY chromosomes” and was one of two Olympic boxers who had “pretended to be women” and “tried to deceive their colleagues.” Neither Kremlev nor the IBA specified what tests led them to this conclusion, and even if Kremlev’s claims are true, an XY chromosome wouldn’t automatically make Khelif “male,” as some women with rare genetic conditions also have XY chromosomes.', 'An IOC spokesperson refuted the IBA’s claims and said that Khelif had complied with the rules of eligibility to compete in 2024, adding, “This is not a transgender issue. I should make this absolutely clear.” Even Khelif’s father showed her birth certificate to Reuters to get people to stop saying she was assigned male at birth.', 'Nevertheless, many conservative politicians in the U.S. took Kremlev’s claims as facts, including Utah State Gov. Spencer Cox (R) and the current U.S. president; others claimed that Khelif should be disqualified and her victories erased. Khelif said these claims — and the resulting widespread online harassment — caused immense pain and harm to her career. She filed legal complaints for harassment against many notorious transphobes, including J.K. Rowling, who made numerous tweets harassing her, and Elon Musk in his official capacity as the owner of X.', 'On Friday, World Boxing released a statement declaring it is in the “final stages” of implementing “mandatory sex testing” to determine the eligibility of all fighters in competitions sanctioned by World Boxing. In compliance with its new policies, the organization had sent a letter to Algeria’s Boxing Association, informing them that Khelif will be barred from competing in any fights arranged by the organization until Khelif submits to a test determining her biological sex.', 'Starting with next week’s Eindhoven Cup in the Netherlands. World Boxing states these tests are necessary to ensure the “mental and physical health of all participants in light of some of the reactions that have been expressed in relation of the boxer’s potential participation in the Eindhoven Cup.”', 'The organization did not comment as to whether these measures were in response to the accusations that Khelif is transgender or as to whether or not Khelif would be able to take a test and have the results back by June 5.', 'World Boxing’s policies state that if a fighter’s sex is challenged in a match sanctioned by World Boxing, then the boxer will be ineligible until the dispute is resolved.', '“This decision is designed solely to ensure the health and safety of all participants in World Boxing competitions (including Imane Khelif) and is not deemed in any way to pre-judge the outcome of any testing that will be introduced as part of the new policy on sex, age and weight,” The World Boxing Committee said in a statement. ', 'Khelif, who hasn’t competed since the Paris Olympics, has expressed her intent to continue boxing and expresses an interest in making a return for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.', '“I am a woman. I was born a woman and was raised a woman, and I compete as a woman,” she states after her gold medal win.', '“They hate me, and I don’t know why. I sent them a message with this gold medal, and I say my dignity has been restored and my honor is above anything else.” Khelif comments expressing anger towards the IBA, an organization that has previously respected her participation in the sport.', 'Pro-trans sports advocates have said that the right-wing movement to ban trans female athletes from women’s sports will result in cisgender female athletes being forced to undergo invasive testing to prove their gender, hurting cis athletes and discouraging other girls and women from participating at all.', 'Subscribe to the LGBTQ Nation newsletter and be the first to know about the latest headlines shaping LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.', 'See all articles by Arin Waller.', 'See more: Politics, Imane Khelif, Olympics, trans sports ban', 'Angry pridegoers force administration to cave after it tried closing a queer park during WorldPride', 'Elon Musk reportedly shoved gay treasury secretary during heated White House argument', 'These Republicans tried to ban the Pride flag.

The commitment to continual improvement in testing standards underscores our shared vision for an inclusive and transparent boxing environment.’', 'Mr. Roberts OBE stressed that IBA cares about all boxers in the first instance and wishes that the highest standards of integrity are maintained wherever our boxers are competing.', '‘In tandem with sex testing, we are encouraged by the announcement of comprehensive age and weight testing protocols; surprisingly over the past few years, we have seen boxers from certain countries who have indeed attempted to falsify age and passport credentials. These measures, again already aligned to IBA, promise to further reinforce fair competition for all athletes with standardized benchmarks. We look forward to this collaborative approach, knowing that this will undoubtedly benefit our National Federations and the boxers they represent,’ Mr. Roberts continued.', 'Regarding the contentious issues that emerged during the Paris 2024 Olympics, the IBA remains unwavering in its decisions. We stand firmly by our assessments and intentions. Notably, as World Boxing is set to receive identical results from these evaluations, we anticipate a forthcoming gesture of accountability – a formal apology from those athletes whose actions, inadvertently or otherwise, diverted well-deserved Olympic accolades away from our rightful female boxers.', 'Over the nearly three years of painstaking experience and insight in navigating these complex issues, IBA’s governance and commitment to integrity have only strengthened. We continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our athletes, championing decisions that uphold fairness, respect, and the true spirit of competitive sports.', '‘Our endorsement of collaborative initiatives reflects our deep-rooted commitment to enhancing athlete safety and competitive integrity. Through meticulous testing protocols, we are working to create an environment where fairness prevails, and every participant is respected.

This directly challenges the account of IOC spokesman Mark Adams, who in a tense news conference at the Paris Olympics described the results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate”.', 'Thomas Bach, the IOC president, has gone even further, claiming that the results are the product of a Russian-led misinformation campaign. He pointed out in an interview earlier this year that the IBA, headed by Russia’s Umar Kremlev, had been stripped of IOC recognition in a row over ethics and financial management. The official authentication of the Indian laboratory that conducted the tests on Khelif increases the pressure on the IOC to explain why it believes the results are illegitimate.', 'It also makes any potential comeback by Khelif far more complicated. Outwardly the 26-year-old has been defiant, even vowing to win a second successive Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles in 2028. But World Boxing has ruled that Khelif is ineligible to enter future events as a woman without first submitting to the same chromosome testing that has already triggered the boxer’s disqualification at global level.', 'The governing body, provisionally approved to run Olympic boxing in LA, has announced that all athletes in its competitions over 18 years old must undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex. The test detects chromosomal material through a mouth swab, saliva or blood. Khelif, who was allowed to box in Paris because of female passport status, has failed to provide any evidence of having female chromosomes in the nine months since the scandal erupted.', 'World Boxing’s tougher stance on the issue comes in response to widespread outrage at the scenes in Paris, where both Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting swept to Olympic titles, despite having been banned by the IBA the previous year on the grounds that they did not have XX chromosomes. Italy’s Angela Carini, the first opponent beaten by Khelif, described how she had been punched so hard that she feared for her life.', 'Mexico’s Brianda Tamara Cruz, who fought Khelif in 2022, said: “I don’t think I had ever felt like that in my 13 years as a boxer, nor in my sparring with men.” Latin American federations ultimately proved highly influential in persuading World Boxing to prioritise the reality of sex, in order to uphold fairness and safety for women.', 'In correspondence seen by Telegraph Sport, the Honduran federation told the Women’s Rights Network that “necessary measures should be taken so that only women by birth can compete in women’s competitions”.

Imane Khelif scandal brings everlasting shame on the IOC,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2025/06/03/imane-khelif-sex-tests-scandal-everlasting-shame-on-ioc/,"['Sport’s most powerful administrators became so seduced by gender ideology that they were prepared to put the lives of female boxers in peril', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '“I can sleep well tonight,” said Nicola Adams, the first British woman to win an Olympic boxing title, a few hours after Imane Khelif’s test results were leaked into the public domain. She deserved to feel at peace. After all, she had been one of the highest-profile critics of the Algerian’s involvement at the Paris Olympics last summer, writing: “People not born as biological women should not be able to compete in women’s sport.” For this she was pelted like some medieval miscreant in the stocks, accused by many of her former supporters of ignorance and misinformation. Except now, with the release of chromosome analysis from an Indian laboratory revealing that Khelif has “male karyotype”, it turns out Adams was right all along.', 'The Khelif scandal should be ranked among the worst in Olympic history, a saga where the sport’s most powerful administrators became so seduced by gender ideology, so in thrall to the lie that womanhood was reducible to some frivolous passport detail, that they were prepared to put the very lives of female boxers in peril. A woman could, as a direct consequence of a profoundly flawed official policy, have died in that Paris ring. That is the stark truth. The International Olympic Committee knew about Khelif. It had been told in 2023 about the test results in New Delhi indicating that Khelif was biologically male, with spokesman Mark Adams publicly admitting as much. But it did nothing, disdaining the tests – with no evidence – as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate”.', 'Its spin was that it was all some Russian stitch-up. This version of events, after all, suited president Thomas Bach’s personal squabbles with Umar Kremlev, Russian chief of the International Boxing Association. And it was swallowed by far too many credulous observers in Paris. When the IBA called a press conference, in the wake of Khelif’s 46-second battering of Angela Carini, it was blocked by legal threats from revealing the boxer’s test findings as it intended. As such, the occasion dissolved into a slanging match: at one point, apropos of nothing, a reporter demanded to know the salary of Chris Roberts, the IBA chief executive.', 'It felt, then as now, like a huge exercise in misdirection. Yes, the IBA had questions to answer over its ethics and finances. But the core element of its case – that women’s sport should only be for those with XX chromosomes, that male advantage was immutable – was sound. And now we see its argument that it disqualified Khelif from the 2023 World Championships for being XY – a verdict, crucially, against which the athlete did not appeal – substantiated in writing, with a report carrying the letterhead of Dr Lal Path Labs in New Delhi summarising the genetic testing in two telling words: “abnormal” and “male”.', 'I spent much of Monday pursuing the IOC, asking firstly for a response to the document and secondly for a sign of whether it would be apologising to the women denied Olympic medals. Eventually, on Tuesday morning, the following word salad arrived from Lausanne: “The IOC has always made it clear that eligibility criteria are the responsibility of the respective international federation. The factors that matter to performance are unique to each sport, discipline and/or event. We await the full details on how sex testing will be implemented in a safe, fair and legally enforceable way.”', 'This statement, somehow managing to avoid either question posed, is risible in myriad ways. For a start, the attempt to pass the buck to the federations is directly contradicted by the IOC’s actions at the Paris Games. It took over running Olympic boxing from the IBA, establishing the so-called “Paris Boxing Unit” and applying its own fatuous logic that Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who had also failed tests, could compete because of the “F” in their passports. As for its comment about rules being different depending on the sport? Clearly, it still believes men can be women in certain circumstances. In boxing, though, there was only one by which it needed to abide: to ensure women would not be smashed in the head by biological males. And it failed to uphold even that most basic duty of care.', 'It is a monumental dereliction, to which the only natural response is anger. The IOC has caused havoc with its ridiculous 2021 framework on “fairness, inclusion and non-discrimination”, stating that “athletes should be allowed to compete in the category that best aligns with the self-determined gender identity”. In 2024, it decided to test this fallacy in boxing, the most lethal Olympic sport. Except boxers do not compete with their feelings, but with their fists. In its desperation to advertise supposedly progressive credentials, it placed women in mortal danger. Could there be a greater betrayal?', 'Those who cheered this on in Paris, who painted anybody doubting Khelif’s claims to be a woman as a bigot, should take some time to reflect. And that includes many journalists. On Sky Sports News on Friday, an Olympics reporter, reacting to news that World Boxing would compel Khelif to undergo further sex testing to compete in the female category again, said flatly: “There were no tests. There were no test results.” And yet there were. We knew of their existence in Paris nine months ago, and now we have seen them with our own eyes.', 'In a curious way, there is some comfort in this. When people accuse anybody disagreeing with them on this subject of “hate”, it is a sure sign that they have lost the plot. And those insisting that Khelif’s mental health matters more than the physical well-being of women have emphatically lost any moral argument. Think of it this way: in men’s sport, people devote inordinate amounts of time to railing against the tiniest example of unfairness, to decrying the entire VAR system if Erling Haaland’s toe happens to be offside. How can the same judges make their peace with women being denied the right to safety, the most basic fairness of all? “Non è giusto”, Carini kept saying to her corner in Paris after the Khelif bout, weeping that she had never been punched so hard in her life. “It’s not fair.” Let that plaintive cry stand as a monument to the IOC’s everlasting shame.', 'RECOMMENDED', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNW1iWGczVlRack1HeEdNRFZXVFJEVkFSakFBaWdLTWdhMUk0cHdsUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

The IOC knew this. And still it permitted Khelif, and Yu Ting Lin of Chinese Taipei, whose tests turned up the same markers, to compete in Paris. Lin also won gold.

In January, a Qatari public relations agency, Kotinos, announced Khelif had joined up; a few days ago, anticipating a first-since-Paris appearance at a boxing tourney next week in Holland, the Kotinos Instagram account posted, again, about Khelif.', 'In Paris, Khelif said, “I am a woman, like any other woman.

', 'The IBA’s current chief executive, Chris Roberts, has suggested repeatedly that Khelif ought to do so.', 'IBA president Umar Kremlev is Russian. In June 2023, the IOC, just days after being informed of what was what with Khelif, banned the IBA. A complete picture would suggest that, despite a lengthy IOC analysis, the move was driven in some measure by a personality dispute between IOC president Thomas Bach and Kremlev amid the complexities of Russia’s participation in the Olympics, and particularly in the wake of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.', 'The IOC oversaw boxing at the 2024 Games. Eligibility for the female category was based not on biology but identity – a passport declaring “female.”', 'An IOC statement issued during the Games about the controversy makes no note of the IBA notification just weeks before.', 'It does note that the decision to disqualify Khelif and Lin from the 2023 worlds was taken by the IBA secretary general and chief executive at the time, the federation board ratifying it afterward. The IOC called this turn of events “arbitrary,” declaring, “Such an approach is contrary to good governance.”', 'At a Paris news conference, IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a news conference, “Those tests are not legitimate tests. The tests themselves, the process of the tests, the ad hoc nature of the tests are not legitimate.', '“The testing, the method of the testing, the idea of the testing, which happened kind of overnight. None of it is legitimate and this does not deserve any response.”', 'The 2023 IBA championships were held in New Delhi.

But. They. Are. Not.”', 'There is no “Russian-led misinformation campaign.” The issue is not whether Khelif (and Lin) are transgender. ', 'Facts are facts. ', 'Last October, in an account that built on what I wrote from Paris, a French outlet, citing a June 2023 medical report, reported that Khelif has a difference in sexual development – formally called 5-alpha reductase type-2 deficiency – with XY chromosomes, internal testes and a “micropenis.”', 'A hormone test showed a “male-type testosterone level of 14.7,” the French story said, “while the female gender does not exceed the maximum level of 3.”', 'As an official U.S. government website, the National Library of Medicine, explains, many people with 5-alpha reductase are “assigned female at birth” but are “genetically male.”', 'The internal testes in such individuals — though they do not descend from the abdominal cavity — produce testosterone. In turn, androgen receptors read and process that testosterone. During puberty, that testosterone typically confers masculine traits that can translate into a huge advantage in sports.', 'The French outlet, Le Correspondant, goes on to refer to Mustapha Berraf, an IOC member from Algeria, declaring Berraf “used his connections and ‘pushed the file,” signing the Khelif letter of admission to the Paris Games. ', '“Contacted, Berraf defends himself against any unilateral decision, which would not have obtained the agreement of the IOC presidency, but acknowledges having ‘supported the candidacy of his fellow citizen … out of patriotism. While forgetting to specify that he was very aware of [Khelif’s] sexual anatomy.”', 'Friday’s World Boxing statement, meanwhile, says the federation’s Congress typically amends its competition rules. “However,” it says, “under special or emergency situations, the World Boxing Executive Board holds the authority to make immediate amendments when a rule is deemed no longer functional or when evolving conditions necessitate a change.”', 'This is precisely what happened with the IBA action at the 2023 worlds – evolving conditions, the results of the chromosome testing becoming known amid the championships, necessitating a change.', 'Last October, a United Nations expert, in a report about “violence against women and girls,” noted the Paris boxing charade, observing the IOC “refused to carry out a sex screening.”', 'The report declared, “Current technology enables a reliable sex screening procedure through a simple cheek swab that ensures non-invasiveness, confidentiality and dignity.”', 'Once more:', 'This is precisely what World Boxing is now mandating – a PCR test, as it is formally known, that can be conducted with a cheek swab and, as the federation said in a news release, “reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex.”', 'One more time:', 'With Khelif said to be intent on taking part in the Holland event, the June 5-10 Eindhoven Box Cup, World Boxing, having leveraged IOC outrage against Kremlev, finds itself in the same position – precisely – the IBA was in back in 2023, ', 'Careful readers of the World Boxing release will note it does not use the pronoun “she” when referring to Khelif. Six times the statement mentions Khelif. In every instance it is “Imane Khelif,” both names. ', 'The World Boxing release goes on to say, without offering a specific date, that its board adopted the new sex testing procedure in May 2025. It says it sent a letter to its member federations on May 30 outlining the new procedure: “These new eligibility rules were developed with the express purpose of safeguarding athletes in combat sports, particularly given the physical risks associated with Olympic-style boxing.”', 'So what about a passport for purpose of eligibility? ', 'In November 2021, the IOC issued a lengthy document entitled, “Framework on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity and Sex Variations.” That same article from Centro Machiavelli takes the position this IOC document was “clearly inspired by the tenets of gender ideology.”', 'The IOC white paper, as detailed in “Principle 3,” says athletes should be allowed to compete “in the category that best aligns with their self-determined gender identity.”', 'It would be OK, the paper says, to “test athletes’ performance and physical capability.” But, it says, “No athlete should be subject to targeted testing because of, or aimed at determining, their sex, gender identity and/or sex variations.”', 'One more disconnect:', 'The new sex-test policy, the World Boxing release says, will take effect July 1. But “World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup,” scheduled well before July 1, “or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing.”', 'The release also says athletes with a Y chromosome or “with a difference of sexual development (DSD) where male adrogenization occurs, will be eligible to compete in the male category.”', 'The IOC provisionally recognized World Boxing in February 2025, having made clear it was done with Kremlev and Russia, citing IBA finance and governance matters even though the IBA had – again – offered evidence documenting it had enacted reforms. World Boxing is due to supervise the sport in Los Angeles in 2028.', 'Let the record be clear: ', 'The IOC purports to be about fair play. Kremlev and the IBA sought to ensure fair play.

Yet the IOC has taken no action against FIE, the international fencing federation, whose members have voted repeatedly for another Russian, Alisher Usmanov, most recently last fall. ', 'After a Kremlev election victory in May 2022, the IOC promptly issued a statement that said it merits “careful analysis” and reinforced “questions and doubts around IBA’s governance.” When, at a special assembly later that year, the IBA voted not to hold a new election, 106 national federations opting against a re-run against 36 in favor, support for Kremlev manifest, the IOC said it was “extremely concerned” and noted the “chaotic circumstances of the voting procedure.”', 'A few days ago in Doha, elections at the table tennis federation devolved into such chaos when Sweden’s Petra Sorling, an IOC member, retained the presidency that Sorling claimed she needed the help of Swedish embassy staff to get out of Qatar safely. In a statement, the table tennis federation condemned the “disruption.” ', 'Has the IOC, as it did with the IBA, jumped in?', 'The answer is no.

Let me palpate an individuals crouch and I can tell you if that individuals is man or women."", 'Same thing happened to Chris Cyborg in MMA. I mean Imane may have a lot of male chromes but she looks and sounds like a woman except for her manly nose, which I think is perfectly fine, and her muscle mass, which I have seen bigger on other more modelesque women. If they are to give gender or chromes tests they need to do it for all athletes. That way its fair, and then they can find out whether the expense is worth the results.', 'The suggestion that the IBA arranged fake testing results is utter lunacy, for one simple reason: it would cost around a hundred bucks for an individual to get an independent test to disprove it. After that, the IBA could have been sued for millions. Faking genetic test results is a nefarious scheme that could NEVER WORK.', 'As we know, Khelif’s team DID get their own independent test done, in Paris.

Test Results Confirm How Bad the Fact-Checking Was on Algerian Boxer Imane Khelif,https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/test-results-confirm-how-bad-the-fact-checking-was-on-algerian-boxer-imane-khelif/,"['National Review', 'What on Earth Is Wrong with 60 Minutes?', 'William F. Buckley Jr.: The Most Influential Journalist in American History', 'Springsteen’s Quisling Concert', 'Get Ready for the ‘Trump Is Senile’ News Cycle', 'Why the Media Keep Getting It Wrong', 'D\nuring the Paris Olympics last summer, I wrote a news article for National Review about Italian boxer Angela Carini quitting 46 seconds into a boxing match against Algeria’s Imane Khelif, one of two competitors in the women’s boxing division who was previously disqualified from the 2023 International Boxing Association Women’s World Boxing Championships after failing a sex-identification test. The International Boxing Association president said in 2023 that Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting were ineligible for the women’s championship title because DNA tests “proved they had XY chromosomes.” The association’s leader, Umar Kremlev, added that the two athletes “attempted to deceive their colleagues and passed themselves off as women.”', 'After the world watched Carini suffer Khelif’s powerful blows to the face, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) strained itself defending “inclusive” policies and its lack of sex-verification screening. The Paris 2024 Boxing Unit and the IOC asserted that, like previous competitions, “the gender and age of the athletes are based on their passport.” The International Olympic Committee’s “Portrayal Guidelines” in 2024 stated that “a person’s sex category is not assigned based on genetics alone.” National Review was among many outlets that insisted women’s divisions must be women’s divisions, and all available evidence suggested that Khelif and Lin are male; it didn’t matter how they were perceived by doctors at birth, how they were raised, or how they identify. As we said in an editorial at the time, “genetics do determine sex — regardless of what we ‘assign’ or what letter is printed on a passport.” Ultimately, both Khelif and Lin were permitted to continue competing in the women’s division, and each won a gold medal in their respective weight class.', 'Well, nearly a year after the controversy began, an important document was leaked. Alan Abrahamson — a seasoned American journalist and member of the International Olympic Committee’s press committee — just published an excerpt of Khelif’s 2023 test results from a certified and accredited lab that stated “chromosome analysis reveals male karyotype.” Such a claim is consistent with reports from last summer that Khelif had a difference in sexual development (DSD) condition, and test results revealed a testosterone level befitting that of a male. It is also consistent with the statements of several previous opponents that Khelif threw unusually hard punches. And it is consistent with Khelif’s mysterious withdrawal after initially appealing the International Boxing Association’s decision. Abrahamson’s document also neatly explains why Khelif has never personally released test results to counteract the fierce public criticism. Most important, the leaked excerpt confirms what we see with our own eyes.', 'Despite the overwhelming evidence that was available last summer, the mainstream media churned out “fact checking” articles insisting that Khelif is a woman, biology doesn’t matter, and conservatives were pouncing on this poor athlete to advance draconian “transphobic” policies.', 'USA Today, a paper that demoted its deputy opinion editor after he acknowledged the fact that “pregnant people” are in fact “women,” suddenly developed the ability to distinguish exactly who qualifies as a woman. During the Paris Olympics in 2024, USA Today published an article titled “Fact check on Algerian fighter Imane Khelif, DSDs, biology and Olympic boxing” that states unreservedly, “Khelif is a woman, who is not transgender, nor identifies as intersex.” The extremely reliable, wholly unbiased sources provided for that claim are GLAAD, a nonprofit organization that focuses on media representation of LGBTQ+ characters, and InterACT, an organization that aims to “empower intersex youth.” What other flimsy claims are attributed to these sources and presented as incontrovertible truth in the “fact check” article? Here’s one: “Transgender inclusion has had no negative effect on gender parity at the Olympics, according to GLAAD and InterACT.” Of course, the publication didn’t neglect the opportunity to disparage people who hold “anti-LGBTQ” positions, asserting in a subheading that “conservatives seize on boxing to spread anti-trans rhetoric.”', 'GLAAD itself issued a “fact check” article in August 2024 to provide guidance for “media and journalists covering the Olympics.” The organization stated that “Imane Khelif is a cisgender woman,” and “it is not verified that Imane Khelif has a variation in sex traits or DSDs.” But any stringent sex-verification test to prove the former claim would have disproved the latter. GLAAD also asserts the following “fact”: “Cisgender women of color, such as Caster Semenya and Serena Williams, often become targets of transphobic rhetoric due to white essentialism and supremacy that narrowly define femininity.” Putting aside the commentary on race and “transphobia,” the statement is demonstrably false and self-defeating because Semenya — who has won gold medals in Olympics women’s running — is a man. The Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed that Semenya has a DSD condition known as 46 XY 5-ARD (5-alpha-reductase deficiency). Semenya has XY chromosomes and testes, as well as testosterone levels within the normal range for an adult male. In an interview, Semenya declared that “being born without a uterus or with internal testicles” doesn’t “make me less of a woman,” but I beg to differ.', 'Although examples related to Khelif are plentiful, I need not cite them all here to demonstrate that the mainstream media print propaganda under the guise of “fact checking” while accusing critics of “spreading misinformation.” Perhaps the issue is that supposedly reputable journalists and publications simply do not understand the word “fact,” in the same way they cannot define “woman.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 National Review', 'Newsletters', '', 'Free Articles Left This Month', 'Enjoy full access with an NRPLUS membership.', 'Already a member?

Expert Reveals If Imane Khelif Is At Risk Of Losing Olympic Boxing Gold Medal,https://www.yardbarker.com/boxing/articles/expert_reveals_if_imane_khelif_is_at_risk_of_losing_olympic_boxing_gold_medal/s1_17676_42289388,"['', 'A massive piece of news within the boxing community was released last week, when World Boxing announced that they would be mandating athletes who are 18 and older to undergo genetic testing (which will require a cheek swab) if they want to compete in women’s boxing events, starting as soon as this month.', ""It's no secret that this stems from the backlash regarding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's inclusion in the Paris 2024 Olympic games. Khelif won an Olympic gold medal in Paris, despite being subject to intense scrutiny regarding her eligibility because her abnormally high testosterone levels made many members of the boxing community (and the mainstream sports and pop culture sphere, given how big this story became) question whether it was fair for her to compete against women."", ""Now, with this new mandate from World Boxing, some are wondering whether Khelif could get her gold medal from the Paris Games taken away if this new genetic testing doesn't come out in favor of her being eligible to compete against women."", ""This question has been addressed by Doraine Lambelet Coleman, a Thomas L. Perkins Distinguished Professor of Laws at Duke Law School, who has a better understanding than most about how this potentially tricky testing situation and verdict will be handled. And she spoke about what she believes will happen with Khelif's medal during a June 3 interview with Newsweek."", '""The IOC would not revoke medals won by athletes who were eligible according to the rules it set for the boxing competition in Paris. Unlike the eligibility rules set by the IBA and now WB, those rules did not require competitors to be biologically female,"" Coleman said.', ""In other words, because the testing was not part of any mandate during the Paris Games, the fact that it's being instituted now wouldn't have any bearing on Khelif potentially losing her gold medal."", ""While this verdict seems to make sense, that doesn't mean it won't cause additional controversy around Khelif's success at the Olympic level. However, it could impact her standing at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, where Khelif has gone on record saying she wants to defend her gold medal."", '', 'This article first appeared on KO on SI and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', ""While the day was filled with snippets of Shedeur Sanders‘ reps at the Browns' organized team activities Wednesday, the real news happened off the field as third-round rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel signed his rookie contract, according to a team announcement. No contract details have been released. With Deshaun Watson dealing with injury and the quarterback room consisting of only a 40-year-old Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett on his third team in as many years, the Browns were constantly linked to a rookie quarterback in the 2025 NFL Draft. While many assumed that that quarterback would in some way or another end up being Sanders, a historically strange slide led to five other passers hearing their names called before Sanders. One of those names was Gabriel’s, which came at No. 94 overall. After six years playing college football (three at UCF, two at Oklahoma and one at Oregon), Gabriel only got better and better, even after a left clavicle injury ended his time with the Knights. Overall, Gabriel proved to be an elite producer who could protect the ball and score with his arm or his legs. He went 46-17 as a starter with the Knights, Sooners and Ducks, showing an impressive ability to pick up new systems quickly and effectively. That, contrasted with Sanders, who has worked under the same offense under the same coach since high school, could be a reason that Gabriel’s name has been seeing much more run in recent days as a contender for a role as QB1 or 2. One of the latest reports we’d seen saw Gabriel seemingly looking like the QB2 behind Pickett. The lefty seems to be making quick progress as he learns his fourth new offense in five years. There will still be plenty of time for Gabriel to challenge Pickett or for Sanders to challenge them both or even for Flacco to get back in the picture. Regardless, Gabriel can now get his mind off contract negotiations and put all his efforts into football. Gabriel is only the third Browns rookie to put pen to paper so far. Here’s how the rest of the draft class is looking: Round 1, No. 5 (from Jaguars): Mason Graham (DT, Michigan) (signed) Round 2, No. 33: Carson Schwesinger (LB, UCLA) Round 2, No. 36 (from Jaguars): Quinshon Judkins (RB, Ohio State) Round 3, No. 67: Harold Fannin Jr. (TE, Bowling Green) (signed) Round 3, No. 94 (from Bills): Dillon Gabriel (QB, Oregon) (signed) Round 4, No. 126 (from Vikings through Jaguars): Dylan Sampson (RB, Tennessee) Round 5, No. 144 (from Patriots through Seahawks): Shedeur Sanders (QB, Colorado)"", 'Mitch Marner\'s future in the NHL could dictate many things in free agency this summer, and now, it appears a shocking team has emerged as a contender to land him. The Toronto Maple Leafs appear ready to lose Mitch Marner in free agency this summer, and before free agency officially opens, we\'ve had plenty of reports around the superstar forward. It seems as though almost every team with cap space could be in on No. 16. Now, insider Elliotte Friedman has dropped a bombshell, revealing that the Utah Mammoth, after just one season in the NHL are ready to make a splash and land the superstar forward. ""If there is one team everyone is watching and saying I\'m really curious to see what they do it is Utah. Teams believe that Utah is determined to introduce themselves to the NHL in a big way."" With a young core led by captain Clayton Keller, Dylan Guenther and Logan Cooley, Marner is exactly the type of player who would be a perfect fit for the Utah Mammoth. With the salary cap to land him, they could put in one of the biggest offers for him. On top of that, they are open to moving the No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft, suggesting this is a team that wants to make a genuine impact in 2025-26. While they may or may not land Marner, expect them to be in the bidding all the way until the end.', 'A major domino has fallen in 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports\' anti-trust case against NASCAR. On Thursday, the preliminary injunction that had granted 23XI and FRM to race as chartered teams during the 2025 Cup Series season was overturned by a federal appeals court. With the injunction overturned, the six entries between the teams — three from 23XI and three from FRM — could be open entries for the remainder of the season. That opens up the possibility, however low it might be, that they could miss a race if more than 40 cars show up to qualify. Open teams also earn significantly less money than their chartered counterparts. The good news? With a 14-day span in which the teams can ask for a rehearing and another seven-day period after that deadline, it will likely be June 26 at the earliest when the teams would no longer be chartered, making the June 28 race at EchoPark Speedway (formerly Atlanta Motor Speedway) the first race where 23XI and FRM compete as open entries. ""We are disappointed by today\'s ruling by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps,"" said lawyer Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney for 23XI and FRM. ""This ruling is based on a very narrow consideration of whether a release of claims in the charter agreements is anti-competitive and does not impact our chances of winning at trial scheduled for December 1. We remain confident in our case and committed to racing for the entirety of this season as we continue our fight to create a fair and just economic system for stock car racing that is free of anticompetitive, monopolistic conduct."" As far as the case itself goes, NASCAR now finds itself in the catbird seat after the ruling, which gives the sanctioning body significantly more leverage than it previously had.', 'The Kansas City Chiefs\' run game last season with Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt left a lot to be desired. Averaging just 101.2 yards per game (ranked 26th), Patrick Mahomes didn\'t get much help from the ground, although Hunt was good at picking up the tough yards, but there was no threat of a breakaway out of the backfield. That might change now with the addition of running back Elijah Mitchell, who has speed to burn, but is coming off an injury that kept him out of the 2024 season. For NFL Network\'s Steve Wyche, he thinks that Mitchell, if he can stay healthy, could be the difference-maker in the backfield the Chiefs have been looking for. ""The Chiefs\' running game has to step up,"" Wyche said. ""I think a player to look out for is Elijah Mitchell, who has not been able to stay healthy, but he was killing it before the first knee issue. This is somebody, the competition in the running back room and he stays healthy, I think he can make it very interesting because running back, they need explosive play."" Mitchell, in his rookie season, showed what kind of talent he has, rushing for 963 yards and five touchdowns for the San Francisco 49ers in 2021, but injuries have since derailed his progress and that led to Christian McCaffrey signing with the NFC West team with just 16 games played in the last two seasons for Mitchell. Now a Chief, he will hopefully bring a speed element to the run game, and that is something the offense has missed in the past couple of seasons. Hunt and Pacheco are servicable backs, but they don\'t possess the home-run threat that Mitchell does. Of course, as Wyche mentioned, health will play a major role in how effective Mitchell can be. But if, and that\'s a big if, he can avoid the treatment room, he might just be the ace up Andy Reid\'s sleeve in 2025.', 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
