ADA Issues New MASLD Guidelines,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/ada-issues-new-masld-guidelines-2025a1000esb,"['', '', 'June 02, 2025', 'A new consensus report from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides a practice-oriented framework for screening and managing metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in people with diabetes and prediabetes.', 'Published online on May 28, 2025, in Diabetes Care, the report is a comprehensive update to the recommendations the ADA released in 2023. It is intended for clinicians treating patients with diabetes — primarily type 2 diabetes (T2D) — but also type 1 diabetes with obesity and prediabetes. Topics covered include the rationale for the recent change in terminology, epidemiology, fibrosis risk stratification, monitoring, treatment, and referral guidance, with interprofessional team management emphasized throughout.', '“This will provide primary care doctors and anyone taking care of people with diabetes the tools to diagnose [MASLD] early and guide therapy…to prevent cirrhosis, and refer to the hepatologist as needed for additional therapy and monitoring,” lead author Kenneth Cusi, MD, professor of medicine at the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, told Medscape Medical News.', 'The guidelines recommend that clinicians routinely screen people with T2D or prediabetes for MASLD. “We explain that the liver should be incorporated into our management in the same way we do for chronic kidney disease, eye disease, and nerve disease as an end-organ damage that is particularly affected by diabetes,” Cusi said.', 'In the United States, at least 70% of people with T2D have MASLD, about half of whom have the more progressive form termed metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH). About 1 in 5 with T2D have advanced liver fibrosis. The presence of MASH increases the risks for complications including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and overall mortality, according to the new consensus report.', 'Liver disease has not been a focus of diabetes management until recently, Cusi noted. “We didn’t think about it. The epidemic of obesity, and with that, of diabetes, is driving this liver disease. The obesity epidemic has had a big worsening since the 1990s, so this damage in the past 20 or 30 years is just now becoming evident in the liver.” ', 'The document reviews the current nomenclature for SLD, which was officially changed in 2023 to remove the words “fatty” and “alcoholic.” Now, MASLD is defined as the presence of SLD with at least one metabolic risk factor such as obesity, hypertension, prediabetes, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or T2D, with minimal or no alcohol consumption (< 20 g/d for women; < 30 g/d for men).', 'The term “MetALD” is used for those with MASLD who also have increased alcohol consumption (20-50 g/d for women; 30-60 g/day for men). Steatosis in the setting of alcohol consumption above those levels is termed “alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).”', 'The term MASH is defined as steatohepatitis with at least one metabolic risk factor and minimal alcohol consumption. “At-risk MASH” refers to steatohepatitis with clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2 or higher).', 'The document recommends routine screening of people with T2D, prediabetes, and/or obesity with cardiovascular risk factors, with the goal of identifying those with high-risk MASH. Intervention is then aimed at preventing fibrosis progression and cirrhosis.', 'A graphic diagnostic algorithm advises initial use of the noninvasive Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) tool, which risk stratifies based on age, liver enzymes, and platelet count.', '“The FIB-4 is composed of very simple things that are already in the electronic medical record of all patients. We also discuss the role of electronic medical records to improve implementation,” Cusi said.', 'Those with a FIB-4 < 1.3 have a low risk for future cirrhosis and can be managed in primary or team care with optimized lifestyle and repeated FIB-4 every 1-2 years.', 'If the FIB-4 is > 2.67, direct referral to a liver specialist is advised. If FIB-4 is between 1.3 and 2.67, a second risk-stratification test is recommended. Ideally, this would be a liver stiffness measurement (LSM), most commonly with transient elastography. If that is unavailable, an alternative is the noninvasive enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test.', 'If the LSM is < 8.0 kPa or ELF is < 7.7, the fibrosis risk is low and routine management can continue with repeat testing in 1-2 years. But if higher, hepatology referral is recommended.', 'The report details lifestyle modification for MASLD, including nutrition plans; physical activity; behavioral health; and the role of diabetes self-management, education and support. The role of obesity treatment in people with MASLD, both metabolic surgery and pharmacotherapy, is also discussed at length.', 'No current pharmacologic treatments have been approved for MASLD, but both semaglutide and tirzepatide have demonstrated benefit in treating MASH and are approved for treating T2D, obesity, and other related comorbidities.', 'A thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, resmetirom, was approved in early 2024 for the treatment of MASH with fibrosis stages F2 and F3, but is extremely expensive at about $50,000 a year, Cusi noted. An older, generic glucose-lowering drug, pioglitazone, has also shown benefit in reducing fibrosis and may be a lower-cost alternative.', 'The document also includes a section on alcohol intake, which complicates the MASLD picture, Cusi noted. “We think that this is going to help doctors to consider alcohol, which is often overlooked and under-reported. If patients have moderate fibrosis, they should completely quit alcohol.”', 'Cusi has received research support (to his institution) from Boehringer Ingelheim, Echosens, Inventiva, Labcorp, and Perspectum, and has served as a consultant for Aligos Therapeutics, Arrowhead, AstraZeneca, 89bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, ProSciento, Sagimet Biosciences, Siemens USA, Zealand Pharma, and Terns Pharmaceuticals.', 'Miriam E.

Millions of Americans Have Undiagnosed Liver Disease,https://www.newser.com/story/369795/millions-of-americans-have-undiagnosed-liver-disease.html,"['', 'Some 17 million people across the US, UK, Germany, and France are living with the most aggressive form of fatty liver disease and have no idea, a new study suggests. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe progression of a broader condition now known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which typically affects those drinking little or no alcohol, per the Guardian. The disease is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, obesity, and conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. About 5% of the global adult population and 4% of the US population is estimated to have MASH, which leads to liver scarring and increases the risk of cirrhosis, kidney disease, and liver cancer.', '', 'Researchers found that fewer than one in five people with MASH actually have a diagnosis, which means the majority are unaware they have the disease. The study, published in Lancet Regional Health Europe, calls for diagnosis rates to double from 2022 levels to prevent a sharp rise in health costs and personal suffering. Non-invasive screening methods like blood tests and MRI scans are now available, leading researchers to recommend screening for people with type 2 diabetes, obesity plus risk factors, or persistently high liver enzymes.', ""Experts warn that if identification and treatment don't improve, both health and economic consequences will escalate. Calls for increased use of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro in MASH treatment are growing, as these medications can help curb calorie intake, prompt weight loss, and potentially reduce liver scarring. The study also notes that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin may help reduce liver fat and fibrosis, highlighting the growing potential of medication as part of the solution.

The publication emphasizes the importance of recognizing MASLD as a critical comorbidity in individuals with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes and outlines guidance for clinicians to improve early detection, risk stratification, and treatment strategies.', 'The episode begins by placing MASLD in historical context alongside other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. The hosts explain that MASLD, previously referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD, reflects a metabolic-driven pathology and is now better understood as a progressive condition that increases the risk of cirrhosis, liver transplantation, cardiovascular disease, and impaired quality of life. The more advanced form, MASH (Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), represents progression toward hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.', 'A major focus is the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, a noninvasive, cost-effective screening tool calculated from common laboratory tests (platelets and liver function markers) to assess fibrosis risk. The consensus report advises routine FIB-4 scoring in adults with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with central obesity. Based on risk thresholds, further evaluation may involve transient elastography (FibroScan), advanced imaging, or hepatology referral.', 'The hosts commend the ADA for offering a clear clinical algorithm for evaluation and referral, as well as pharmacotherapy recommendations tailored to disease severity. For individuals with early-stage fibrosis, lifestyle modification and diabetes therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, semaglutide) are first-line approaches. For advanced fibrosis (F2–F3), resmetirom is the only currently approved treatment for MASH. The report also highlights complications from hepatic dysfunction—including impaired hypoglycemia awareness and sarcopenia—underscoring the broader metabolic impact of MASLD.', 'Isaacs and Bellini stress that MASLD should be approached with the same clinical rigor as other diabetes-related complications.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) causes fibrosis (scarring) and can lead to cirrhosis and is linked to greater risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and liver cancer.', 'But the vast majority of people do not know they have the condition. An international group of researchers examined prevalence and diagnosis of aggressive fatty liver disease in the US, UK, Germany and France.', 'The researchers found that just under 3% of people in the UK, France and Germany, and 4% of those in the US have MASH, but diagnosis rates were below 18%. That means about 20 million people in the US, UK, Germany and France are living with MASH but only 2.5 million people have a diagnosis, leaving more than three-quarters – about 16.7 million people – unaware they have the condition.', 'The report, published in the Lancet Regional Health Europe and presented at the meeting of the global thinktank on steatotic liver disease in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday, calls for a doubling in diagnosis rates from 2022 levels. Traditionally, MASH was diagnosed through biopsy, but now non-invasive methods such as blood tests, ultrasound and MRI scans can be used. As a result, everyone with type 2 diabetes; obesity combined with one or more other risk factors; and those with persistently high liver enzymes should be screened for MASH, the researchers conclude.', 'Dr Jeffrey Lazarus, the lead author of the paper and a professor of global health in New York and Barcelona, said: “Undiagnosed MASH costs economies billions of pounds in lost productivity and poor health. Unless diagnosis rates are doubled, alongside similar increases in treatment and care, direct health costs alone are predicted to triple over the next 20 years.”', 'Responding to the findings, Emmanouil Tsochatzis, a professor of hepatology at University College London and a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Free hospital, said: “More than 15 million people across the US and Europe have the deadliest form of fatty liver disease – and don’t know it. Without faster diagnosis and access to treatment, the human and economic toll will skyrocket.”', 'The research has also prompted renewed calls for weight loss jabs to be used to treat MASH.', 'Dr Paul Brennan, a co-author of the Lancet paper and a hepatologist at NHS Tayside, said: “GLP-1s (including Wegovy and Mounjaro) offer the potential to resynchronise our metabolism, by introducing feelings of satiety – fullness – and delaying the time the stomach takes to empty. These effects often result in reduced calorie intake, and improvements in how the liver handles nutrients as a result of weight loss, thus reducing scar tissue formation in the liver.”', 'Michael Betel, the president of the Fatty Liver Alliance, said: “Too many people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity are never tested for MASH until it’s too late. We need a huge increase in liver health assessments in patients living with these diseases, alongside lifestyle changes and for some, when appropriate, weight loss drugs to reduce blood sugar and appetite. While weight loss drugs weren’t created to treat liver disease, trials suggest they could benefit multiple metabolic-related conditions, and improve our liver health.”', 'Separately a study published on Wednesday found that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin, which reduces blood sugar levels, can also reduce fat levels and fibrosis in the liver.']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVpNV3c0YkRSdFgwNXZWMmc1VFJEMEFoalJBeWdLTWdZZHdZU1BVUVE=-w280-h168-p-df
