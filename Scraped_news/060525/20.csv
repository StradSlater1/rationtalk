On Wednesday morning, the ADP Report on private sector hiring for May showed just 37,000 jobs created during the month. This was the fewest jobs shown as having been created by this report for any single month in more than two years. This shows a deceleration from April's creation of 60,000 private sector jobs and badly missed the consensus view for 110,000 jobs created. This does not necessarily mean that Friday's Bureau of Labor Statistics print will be weak, but it could. Anything this ugly on Friday will not pass unnoticed by investors."", 'The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index hit the tape at 49.9 (50 is the line in these surveys between expansion and contraction), just a few days after the ISM Manufacturing Index had crossed the tape at 48.5. The real worry for May is the component labeled ""New Orders,"" which is the single most important item in any business survey. For the month New Orders printed at 46.4 for Services and 47.6 for Manufacturing. That\'s nasty.', ""Inventories and Backlogged Orders both also showed decay. Didn't anything show expansion? Oh, you bet your tail something did. Inflation did. Prices printed at a red hot 68.7 for the services economy and a white hot 69.4 for the manufacturing economy. Does that mean that we'll see reacceleration of consumer level inflation for May? I would think this is likely. We'll almost certainly see that producer level inflation has come back to life."", ""The Federal Reserve released their Beige Book on Wednesday afternoon.

There is a real concern over passage in the Senate now, with a number of fiscal conservatives fretting that the budget cuts in the bill don\'t go far enough and other senators showing dismay that these cuts go too far.', 'I tend to agree with the fiscal hawks here, as that is my nature as an economist. That, my friends, is neither here nor there. What matters is that the U.S. Dollar Index traded lower on this news and that while Treasury securities showed strength due to weakness in the above economic news, that the long end of the spectrum of Treasury securities could become unanchored should the federal government continue to behave in a fiscally reckless manner. The weaker dollar would indeed be inflationary.', 'On Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed essentially flat (+0.01%), while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.32% thanks to a 1.39% run made by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.

While only five of these funds closed in the red, Energy (XLE) gave up 1.95% as exploration, refining and pipeline stocks all took a pounding, and the Utilities (XLU) gave back 1.75%."", 'Winners beat losers on the NYSE on Wednesday by just three issues. This was largely a 50/50 split. Winners did lead losers at the Nasdaq by a 6-to-5 margin. Advancing volume did take a nifty 65.5% share of composite Nasdaq-listed trade on Wednesday, but just a 45.8% share of composite NYSE-listed activity.', 'Most importantly, on a day-over-day basis, aggregate trade contracted across NYSE-listings by 5.2% and across Nasdaq-listed securities by 3.7%. Aggregate trade across the membership of the S&P 500 also fell 9% short of the trading volume 50-day simple moving average for the index on Wednesday after falling just 4% short of that line in the sand on Tuesday.', 'Does this render Wednesday\'s market as less significant that it might otherwise be?

Along with barbed attacks on the president and GOP leaders, he also agreed with a post on X this afternoon calling for Trump’s impeachment. Here’s our timeline of the feud.', '• Call with Xi: Earlier, Trump and China’s Xi Jinping held a long-anticipated phone call on trade, with Trump saying it “resulted in a very positive conclusion.” Both leaders extended invitations to visit their respective countries.', 'The Justice Department launched an investigation into Rhode Island today over the state’s diversity in hiring policies.', 'The DOJ in a news release accused the Democratic-led state of potentially violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which protects against employment discrimination.', '“The state of Rhode Island’s official hiring policy embraces racial discrimination, something the Supreme Court has long held to be unlawful,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who oversees the Civil Rights Division, said in the release. “Discrimination in the name of ‘diversity’ is not only fundamentally unjust, but it also violates federal law.”', '', 'The Justice Department launched similar probes last month into the Democratic-led city of Chicago for allegedly making “hiring decisions solely on the basis of race” and into Virginia’s Fairfax County Public Schools over the use of race in admissions to its top-ranked high school.', 'These investigations come as the administration has aggressively cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Last week, the administration issued new guidelines that barred federal agencies from considering race or gender in the hiring process.', 'House Republicans expressed uneasiness with the escalating feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk and called for cooler heads to prevail.', 'Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas demanded Musk stop attacking Trump and said “this tit-for-tat going back and forth, isn’t helping.” While he praised Musk as “very gifted and talented,” Nehls said, “But to start making statements like that, I think, are irresponsible and certainly not healthy. So stop. You’ve lost your mind.”', 'Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who voted against the bill last month, warned that the legislation is on “life support” and that the Senate could be “endangering” it.', 'Rep.

Warren Davidson of Ohio is hoping to play peacemaker — inviting Trump, Musk, Speaker Mike Johnson, Vice President JD Vance and Massie to a private dinner “to mend all these fences.” He declined to go into details about who he’s heard from in response to his invitation.', 'Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio told CNN that the bill will pass and “we’ll be just fine” despite Musk’s relentless bashing of the bill.', 'Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a hardline conservative who’s objected to parts of the bill, told CNN flatly “no” when asked if he was concerned about Trump and Musk’s public breakup. “I think maybe they should count to 10” Roy said when asked about Musk’s supporting calls for Trump to be impeached.', 'Press secretary Karoline Leavitt described Elon Musk’s claim that President Donald Trump is “in the Epstein files” an “unfortunate episode” in a new statement tonight.', '“This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.

Names being mentioned in the records are not necessarily a claim of wrongdoing.', 'Trump’s proximity to Epstein in the past is not exactly news; he’s been photographed with Epstein. But Musk’s accusation feeds into concern in some right-wing circles about the lack of transparency about Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.', 'House Oversight chair James Comer has subpoenaed former President Joe Biden’s White House physician to appear for a deposition later this month, according to a copy of the subpoena letter shared with CNN.', 'The subpoena to Dr. Kevin O’Connor marks an escalation of the Republican chairman’s probe into Biden’s mental fitness and decline.', 'In the subpoena letter, Comer said O’Connor was not complying with the committee’s initial voluntary request for a transcribed interview.', 'The letter from Comer states that counsel for O’Connor responded to the committee’s request for testimony, saying that the physician can’t appear for the requested interview, citing legal and ethical obligations as well as “physician-patient privilege.” The letter from Comer says that “these arguments lack merit.”', 'The subpoena comes as President Donald Trump ordered an investigation into Biden’s actions and autopen use in a memorandum yesterday that cites his predecessor’s “cognitive decline.”', 'Comer has ramped up his investigation into Biden’s mental fitness in recent days, requesting interviews with nearly a dozen former key aides.', 'Elon Musk’s posts are costing him a lot.', 'The world’s richest person lost $34 billion from his personal net worth at the end of the day, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.', 'That would make it the second-largest loss ever in the index’s history, according to Bloomberg, second only to Musk’s bigger dive in November 2021.', 'The loss is a drop in the bucket for the Tesla and SpaceX chief.

Though the Inter-American Foundation is a little-known agency, the case is among those testing Trump’s push to expand presidential power in his second term.', 'Appeals court Judge Gregory Katsas, who was appointed by Trump, wrote in a concurrence that the president “could not unilaterally appoint” Peter Marocco to the agency’s board and that it is “unlikely that either the President or Marocco permissibly removed” Sara Aviel, who had been serving as the agency’s CEO until her dismissal earlier this year.', 'Appeals court Judge Nina Pillard signed on to Katsas’ concurrence, while Judge Neomi Rao, also a Trump appointee, dissented from the court’s decision.', 'The court’s ruling keeps in effect a ruling issued in April by US District Judge Loren AliKhan in favor of Aviel that had voided any decisions taken by Marocco while he was overseeing the agency.', 'Marocco had sought to reduce the agency to the minimum statutory requirements, including by firing the vast majority of its workforce and cancelling all but one of its grants.', 'In a post on X, Speaker Mike Johnson hit back at Elon Musk’s attacks on President Donald Trump’s domestic policy bill, as the feud escalated between the tech billionaire and top Republicans.', 'Musk had posted on X asking, “where is the Mike Johnson of 2023!?” citing an older tweet where Johnson rails against the climbing national debt.', 'Johnson wrote back in response: “The Mike Johnson of 2023 is the SAME Mike Johnson who has always been a lifelong fiscal hawk - who now serves as Speaker and is implementing a multi-stage plan to get our country back to fiscal responsibility and extraordinary economic growth.”', '“It begins with the critically important One Big Beautiful Bill that includes the LARGEST mandatory spending cut to the federal government in history (by almost 400%), the LARGEST tax cut in history, the LARGEST investment in border security in a GENERATION, along with arguably the STRONGEST collection of pro-growth provisions EVER passed,” Johnson continued.', 'He concluded, “The same CONSISTENT Mike Johnson who has ALWAYS supported the America First Agenda.”', 'Johnson also told CNN that Musk’s attacks and feud with Trump are “not helpful.”', '“Look, Elon is a friend. I texted him, called him this morning as we were scheduled to speak and we haven’t yet. I sent him a lot of information by via text, hoping he reads it and considers it, and this isn’t personal. Policy differences should not be personal,” he told CNN, adding that Trump deserves credit for GOP victory in 2024.', '', 'Leaving the House floor later, Johnson acknowledged that “it clearly is personal” between Musk and Trump.', 'CNN’s Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju and Aileen Graef contributed to this post, which was updated with more reaction from Speaker Johnson.', 'Elon Musk added to his barrage of tweets against President Donald Trump today, saying on his platform X that “The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year.”', 'His post quoted somebody else on X who declared “can i finally say that trump’s tariffs are super stupid.”', 'JPMorgan economists lowered the risk of the US economy entering a recession to below 50% from 60% previously after the United States and China reached a trade breakthrough in Geneva last month.', 'Musk has been record saying he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between US and EU. In April, he called Trump’s senior trade adviser Peter Navarro a “moron” on social media, escalating the billionaire’s breakup from the administration on its economic policies.', 'The relationship between Trump and Musk imploded in spectacular fashion today, with each posting on their respective social media platforms increasingly acrimonious messages.', 'A public feud exploded today between President Donald Trump and his one-time ally, the tech billionaire Elon Musk.', 'It began this morning during a media event at the White House where Trump said he was “very disappointed” in the tech billionaire after Musk repeatedly blasted the president’s sweeping domestic agenda bill in recent days.', '“Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump told reporters, less than one week after the two exchanged effusive praise on Musk’s last day in the administration in which he was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.', 'Here’s how it all happened:', 'Musk steps back:', 'Criticized bill:', 'Trump’s response:', 'Musk hits back:', 'Elon Musk is calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment as the two men’s breakup reaches new heights.', '“Yes,” Musk posted on his social media platform X in response to another user who wrote “President vs Elon.

It was a SpaceX Dragon capsule that helped return the two NASA astronauts who got stuck on the International Space Station for nine months when a Boeing vehicle had issues.', 'SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'Tech billionaire Elon Musk claimed that President Donald Trump is “in the Epstein files” and that is the “real reason” those records have not been publicly released, without providing any evidence of where his information was coming from.', '“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.

The truth will come out.”', 'Musk did not detail how he would have gained access to unreleased files. CNN has reached out to the White House for a response.', 'Context on Epstein files: Myriad right-wing media figures have, for years, suggested that the government is hiding secrets relating to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. Many versions of the conspiracy theory have asserted that the government is covering up a list of powerful men who also committed heinous crimes.', 'This theory has often been shorthanded as an Epstein “client list,” even though the best-sourced reporter on this beat, Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald, said “those who have worked with the FBI on the case for decades say there is no evidence Epstein kept a ledger or a list of clients who were involved with his sex trafficking operation.” The inclusion of a person’s name in files related to the case does not by itself indicate they have been accused of any wrongdoing.', 'Nevertheless, Trump – who was friends with Epstein decades ago – talked during the 2024 presidential campaign about potentially releasing more governmental files about the disgraced financier.', 'And that’s what attorney general Pam Bondi sought to do earlier this month, saying Trump directed her to review government files about Epstein and provide transparency to the public. She released an initial tranche of files in February that largely duplicated information that had already been made public.', 'With previous reporting from CNN’s Brian Stelter.', 'Tesla shares plummeted 15% this afternoon as Elon Musk’s battle with President Donald Trump intensified.', 'Trump threatened in a social media post to target Musk’s business empire.', '“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.', 'The Tesla selloff has wiped off more than $150 billion off the market value of Telsa, which started the day worth nearly $1.1 trillion.', 'It has also erased a chunk off the net worth of Musk, the world’s richest person.', 'A program designed to flag travelers for potential extra screening and monitoring at airports and on airplanes will be discontinued, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced today.', 'The program recently came under attack from Republicans after it was revealed that prior to her appointment to lead US intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard was temporarily placed on the “Quiet Skies” list – a process that can occur from a number of different factors, including travel patterns.', '', 'Being on the list does not mean an individual is suspected or accused of wrongdoing.', '“It is clear that the Quiet Skies program was used as a political rolodex of the Biden Administration — weaponized against its political foes and exploited to benefit their well-heeled friends,” Noem said in her statement. “I am calling for a Congressional investigation to unearth further corruption at the expense of the American people and the undermining of US national security.”', 'The program was only one part of airport security and other screening lists still exist inside of the department.', '“TSA will continue performing important vetting functions tied to legitimate commercial aviation security threats to both ensure the safety of the American traveler and uphold its statutory obligations,” the department said.', 'President Donald Trump floated terminating Elon Musk’s companies’ government subsidies and contracts as a way of saving money, intensifying the two billionaires’ feud on Thursday.', '“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it,” the president wrote on Truth Social.', 'Musk then commented on a tweet about how that could end the International Space Station, writing, “This just gets better and better,” adding, “Go ahead, make my day …”', 'Minutes earlier, Trump wrote that he’d asked Musk to leave the White House, and claimed the Tesla CEO “just went CRAZY!”', '“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY,” the president said. (There has never been a federal mandate that prohibited Americans from buying gasoline-powered cars.)', 'The president’s social media posts come as he said in the Oval Office earlier Thursday that he was “very disappointed” with Musk as he continues to blast the president’s massive tax and spending cuts package.

The massive sum was rivaled by only a handful of competing mega donors.', 'Republicans senators are so far brushing off Elon Musk’s call to his massive social media following to turn up the heat on Republican elected officials.', '“I don’t know,” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN when asked if his office was receiving more pressure. “Nobody is calling me.”', 'GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio also said that he has not received an uptick of constituent calls, telling CNN, “No. I mean, honestly, as you know, most normal people don’t watch the inconsistencies of how the sausage is made.”', 'He said that usually those that do call have only seen “misinformation” about the bill. “There’s a difference in mandatory spending and discretionary spending. So once we explain to them what we’re actually doing, they buy into the whole process.”', 'Asked about Musk’s influence and platform, and how that could affect support for Trump’s agenda, Moreno shot back: “President Trump has the biggest platform on earth, and the platform that he’s advocating for is to prevent that $4 trillion tax increase, fund our military, secure our border and strengthen Medicaid.”', '', 'GOP Sen.

So this is the difference, and that’s the reason why we are trying to do more on Russia,” Merz added.', 'In a stunning real-time response on X, Elon Musk responded to President Donald Trump’s comments about him after the tech billionaire slammed his signature legislation.', 'Musk, until recently a White House special employee who oversaw the administration’s cost-cutting efforts, denied Trump’s claim that the Tesla CEO knew the inner workings of the president’s so-called “big beautiful bill.” Musk also countered that the elimination of America’s electric vehicle tax incentives has nothing to do with his opposition to the massive domestic policy bill.', '“False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” Musk wrote.', '“Whatever. Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,” Musk said in a separate post. “In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful.
