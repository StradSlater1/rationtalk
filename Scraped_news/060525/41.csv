Where Everybody Knows Your Name,https://www.aei.org/society-and-culture/where-everybody-knows-your-name/,"['By Samuel J. Abrams', 'AEIdeas', 'June 02, 2025', 'When I was in high school, I would try to complete all of my homework before 9:00 p.m. so that I could sit down with my Dad to watch Cheers on Thursday nights. Many of the characters on the show mirrored those I knew in my life. Norm Peterson—an accountant and painter—always had his stool along the bar and was one of the show’s anchors and most popular characters. At the series’ end, Cheers had become one of the most popular sitcoms in history, with 40 percent of Americans tuning in to the series finale. When George Wendt, who played Norm, recently passed, I had to pause and reflect and I felt a deep loss; his character was someone that I felt like I knew, respected, and appreciated for Norm was someone who cared and was always there for others like many in my synagogue community.  ', 'The many memorial words about Wendt and his character of Norm were kind and touching. Almost everything written about Wendt’s performance as Norm featured what became an iconic feature on every one of Cheers’ 273 episodes: Norm would walk through the door of the bar, saying good afternoon or good evening, everybody, and then everyone in the bar would yell “Norm.” As he walked from the door to his dedicated seat at the bar, one of the bartenders would ask him a question of some sort, which would then tee up a one-liner that always elicited a big laugh.', 'Commentators were quick to note that Norm represented the show’s theme song as the embodiment of the person in a bar where everyone knew a local’s name. As tributes poured in, all shared a variety of favorite Norm one-liners from when a baby was in the bar and yelled “Norm!” to more traditional lines like “What would you like, Norm?” “A reason to live. Keep ’em coming.” To, “What you up to, Norm?” “My ears.”', 'While these one-liners and yelling “Norm!” became a hallmark of the show, what the various homages to George Wendt and his character of Norm Peterson overlooked is that people loved Norm because he was a communal anchor and part of a vibrant third place. Cheers was a subterranean bar on the edge of Boston’s Beacon Hill neighborhood, which brought together a motley crew of characters from Harvard graduate professionals, former pro-athletes, and working-class Bostonians. Every guest in the bar sought deep friendships and supported each other through the highs and lows that so many Americans confront regularly.', 'The character of Norm was given the honor of a boisterous, regular greeting because he anchored Cheers as a third place—a space of camaraderie that was not home or work—and could be reliably counted on to be part of the group and was always available and open to others. Throughout the show’s 11 seasons, Norm was habitually at his stool—a unique place that he admitted to loving at the show’s conclusion—to meet, socialize, and support his friends, ranging from world-famous professors to mail carriers.', 'Norm’s candor often broke tension, lightened moods, and created a sense of continuity. Norm was always willing to grab a beer and lend an ear, no matter what was going on in his life. Though we often hear how “rough” things are with his job or wife, Vera, he rarely lets that stop him from being a steady friend. Norm’s approach to friendship was not overly sentimental or dramatic; he exemplified the kind of reliable, everyday companionship that makes the Cheers community feel like a family.', 'Countless episodes of the show illustrate this idea, too. In season three, Norm helps Frasier after Diane leaves him at the altar. After such a traumatic event, Norm helps Frasier get through his heartbreak with humor and lends an ear, giving Frasier a sense of social belonging. Norm served as a sounding board for other characters. For example, when the bar owner, Sam, is considering leaving the bar to work for a corporate job, Norm, despite joking around, gives heartfelt advice and expresses how much the bar—and Sam’s presence—means to him; Sam stayed at Cheers.', 'George Wendt’s character of Norm Peterson is so much deeper than the one-liners that made him famous and the show so deeply revered and appreciated. Wendt’s character anchored the bar community, and he helped make Cheers into a third place, earning the exclamation when he entered the bar. While I appreciate the outpouring of admiration of Wendt and his character now that he has passed, I want to remember the character as far more than a comic foil in a very popular show. Norm is a model of a good friend and a person who thinks well outside himself. Society would be better off if we emulated him.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVlNa1YzVFhKeWNURm1WVUpVVFJEX0FoaXBCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

""He\'s as fun and kind and as warm as any character he played on television or in films.

As Carla, I was often standing next to him, as Norm always took the same seat at the end of the bar, which made it easy to grab him and beat the crap out of him at least once a week.
