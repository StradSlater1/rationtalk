Their party said that the way it was being conducted was “grossly unjust” and that “this was not about process, this became personal.”', 'The committee said the lawmakers were being sanctioned not for performing the haka but for “the time at and manner in which it was performed.” It said the severity of the sanctions was intended to “leave members in no doubt that the behavior discussed is not acceptable.”', 'The votes had originally been scheduled for last month but were postponed so the three Māori lawmakers could participate in debate over the federal budget.', 'Performing the haka in Parliament is not uncommon, and it is typically seen when Māori members celebrate the passage of a particular bill. The dance is known abroad for being performed at matches by New Zealand’s rugby teams, and variations of it are also performed at funerals and formal welcomes.', '“It would have been clearly understood by everyone in the Parliament that this was a peaceful act of protest done in a way that aligns with Māori tradition,” said Julian Rawiri Kusabs, a Māori historian and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.', 'Kusabs said the suspension was a setback in decades of reconciliation efforts between the New Zealand government and Māori communities, whose members have had to navigate “a highly complex and frequently painful relationship” even to achieve representation in Parliament.', 'The suspension, he said, reinforces the long-standing perception that “Māori culture is not equally respected within New Zealand’s formal institutions of governance.”', ""Julia Zhong is an intern on NBC News's Asia Desk."", 'Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNUtUVTlUVnpoTGRUQm9SMjVLVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQkk0d25FZXVCTVFF=-w280-h168-p-df

Three days had been the longest ban for a lawmaker from New Zealand’s Parliament before.', 'The lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori, the Māori Party, performed the haka, a chanting dance of challenge, in November to oppose a widely unpopular bill, now defeated, that they said would reverse Indigenous rights.', 'The protest drew global headlines and provoked months of fraught debate among lawmakers about what the consequences for the lawmakers’ actions should be and the place of Māori culture in Parliament.', 'Why the punishment was so strict', 'Photo:', 'A committee of the lawmakers’ peers in April recommended the lengthy bans. It said the lawmakers were not being punished for the haka, but for striding across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while doing it.', 'Judith Collins, the committee chair, said the lawmakers’ behavior was egregious, disruptive and potentially intimidating.', 'Maipi-Clarke, 22, rejected that description Thursday, citing other instances when legislators have left their seats and approached opponents without sanction. The suspended legislators said they are being treated more harshly than others because they are Māori.', '“I came into this house to give a voice to the voiceless. Is that the real issue here?” Maipi-Clarke asked Parliament. “Is that the real intimidation here? Are our voices too loud for this house?”', 'Why this haka was controversial', 'Inside and outside Parliament, the haka has increasingly been welcomed as an important part of New Zealand life. The sacred chant can be a challenge to the viewer but is not violent.', 'As Māori language and culture have become part of mainstream New Zealand in recent years, haka appear in a range of cultural, somber and celebratory settings. They also have rung out in Parliament to welcome the passage of high-profile laws.', 'Some who decried the protest haka in Parliament cited its timing, with Maipi-Clarke beginning the chant as votes were being tallied and causing a brief suspension of proceedings. She has privately apologized for the disruption to Parliament’s Speaker, she said Thursday.', 'A few lawmakers urged their peers to consider rewriting rules about what lawmakers could do in Parliament to recognize Māori cultural protocols as accepted forms of protest. One cited changes to allow breastfeeding in the debating chamber as evidence the institution had amended rules before.', 'Who approved the suspensions', 'Normally the parliamentary committee that decides on punishments for errant lawmakers is in agreement on what should happen to them. But panel members were sharply divided over the haka protest and the lengthy punishments were advanced only because the government has more legislators in Parliament than the opposition.', 'One party in the government bloc wanted even longer suspensions and had asked the committee if the Māori party lawmakers could be jailed. Most in opposition rejected any punishment beyond the one-day ban Maipi-Clarke already served.', 'Speaker Gerry Brownlee urged lawmakers last month to negotiate a consensus and ordered a free-ranging debate that would continue until all agreed to put the sanctions to a vote. But no such accord was reached after hours of occasionally emotional speeches in which opposition lawmakers accused the government of undermining democracy by passing such a severe punishment on its opponents.', 'While the bans were certain to pass, even as the debate began Thursday it remained unclear whether opposition lawmakers would filibuster to prevent the suspensions from reaching a vote. By evening, with no one’s mind changed, all lawmakers agreed the debate should end.', 'Every government lawmaker voted for the punishments, while all opposition members voted against them.', 'The law that prompted the protest', 'Thursday’s debate capped a fraught episode for race relations in New Zealand, beginning with the controversial bill that the Māori Party lawmakers opposed.', 'The measures would have rewritten principles in the country’s founding document, a treaty between Māori tribal leaders and representatives of the British Crown signed at the time New Zealand was colonized.', 'The bill’s authors were chagrined by moves from Parliament and the courts in recent decades to enshrine the Treaty of Waitangi’s promises. Opponents warned of constitutional crisis if the law was passed and tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament last November to oppose it.', 'Despite growing recognition for the treaty, Māori remain disadvantaged on most social and economic metrics compared to non-Māori New Zealanders.', '', 'Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Three days had been the longest ban for a lawmaker from New Zealand’s Parliament before.', 'The lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori, the Māori Party, performed the haka, a chanting dance of challenge, last November to oppose a widely unpopular bill, now defeated, that they said would reverse Indigenous rights.', 'But the protest drew global headlines and provoked months of fraught debate among lawmakers about what the consequences for the lawmakers’ actions should be and whether New Zealand’s Parliament welcomed or valued Māori culture — or felt threatened by it.', 'A committee of the lawmakers’ peers in April recommended the lengthy punishments in a report that said the lawmakers were not being punished for the haka itself, but for striding across the floor of the debating chamber towards their opponents while they did it. Maipi-Clarke Thursday rejected that, citing other instances where legislators have left their seats and approached their opponents without sanction.', 'It was expected that the suspensions would be approved, because government parties have more seats in Parliament than the opposition and had the necessary votes to affirm them. But the punishment was so severe that Parliament Speaker Gerry Brownlee in April ordered a free-ranging debate among lawmakers and urged them to attempt to reach a consensus on what repercussions were appropriate.', 'No such accord was reached Thursday. During hours of at times emotional speeches, government lawmakers rejected opposition proposals for lighter sanctions.', 'There were suggestions that opposition lawmakers might extend the debate for days or even longer through filibuster-style speeches, but with the outcome already certain and no one’s mind changed, all lawmakers agreed that the debate should end.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.
