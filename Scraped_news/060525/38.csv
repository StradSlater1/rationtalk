But is it enough to buy right now?', 'I played a lot of Mario Kart World on the Switch 2, with both Pro Controller and Joy-Cons.', ""Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 is a lot more interesting when you can see your friend's face floating over the kart you're trying to beat. I'm sitting with some folks from CNET's sister site IGN and someone from Nintendo as I'm desperately trying to hang in a Knockout Tour competition, and we're playing with the Switch 2 Camera connected and tracking our faces. Each of our four faces ends up broadcast into the game, floating over our respective vehicles. It's live video, too: You can stick out your tongue or roll your eyes. Or, as one person did, zoom in on just your ear."", ""Nintendo is trying its best to show off how its new console is better than the first-gen Switch models. After a full day playing the Switch 2 a couple of months ago, I recently got a second full-day dive ahead of its June 5 launch -- more time with Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, Nintendo's only exclusive first-party Switch 2 games at launch. And I finally used GameChat, the console's new multiperson audio/video chat feature."", ""I don't have a Switch 2 to review yet, so I can't really nail down my feelings about the full experience just yet. But in these early looks, I'm getting a sense that the Switch 2 is a console that, while showing promise, is something you can also easily wait on. That said, GameChat's a welcome new feature; camera-connected play is surprisingly addictive (and sort of magical), and Mario Kart World is a blast, especially in wild multiplayer matches. After trying 24-player multiplayer, I don't know if I can go back."", ""Nintendo didn't let me capture my own GameChat photos and videos, but this image from Nintendo shows how shared video chat works during gameplay."", ""My 12-year-old tends to play games by starting a FaceTime chat with his friends, and then playing games while keeping his chat on. Sometimes they're playing together, sometimes they're not. I kept thinking about that when getting a brief chance to try Switch 2 GameChat at a Nintendo demo event, which basically aspires to do the same thing."", ""GameChat, which you start by pressing the right Joy-Con's new C button, connects up to 12 players via audio (or four with video) into a little group. Friends have to be preinvited to GameChat via your own friends list on the Switch 2, making it a deliberate process that's parent-friendly but not that spontaneous-feeling. Once that's done, though, chats are fast to start up. "", ""You can control turning your microphone, camera feed or game feed on and off while in chat. You can also hide your menu screens and just show your game once you're playing it. You're either just hearing friends, or seeing split-screen views of up to three others showing their faces, or the games they're playing, or both."", 'The $55 Switch 2 Camera is sold separately, and it adds your face. There are a few clever modes that can either show your whole background in a picture-in-picture, cut out your face and body to overlay onto the game footage or zoom in to frame your face (or another part of your face/body you want to track) in a circle. ', ""Video quality for both your face and game footage isn't great, but it's enough to feel connected to see what your friends are doing (and emoting). No one has to be playing the same game together, so it's more of a way to just share what you're up to at the same time. It's really more of a hangout room where you can chat and maybe also play games together."", 'I got a second demo of camera-connected multiplayer in Mario Kart World, which we did in the same room, but it shows the possibilities of GameChat and multiplayer in other ways. Cleverly, the camera could track and zoom in on all four of our faces at the same time, displaying them separately on-screen as overlays on our karts. It almost felt like augmented reality magic, and reminded me of some of the other tricks I saw in Mario Party Jamboree, which is getting a camera-focused update over the summer.', 'Mario Kart World has a lot of area to explore. I have no idea where all the secrets are.', ""I still don't know if any new Mario Kart game can truly top Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's 96 courses (including DLC), but Mario Kart World is a lot of fun… and something I can't wait to explore more."", ""I spent some time with Nintendo's big Switch 2 launch game in April, but got hours more to dive into wandering around, trying out all the modes, and playing online with 23 others. I got hooked."", ""Mario Kart World's best feature is its wandering style: Everything is spread across a huge land, and you can just tool around and discover secrets or suddenly end up on other courses, or parts of courses. In its Free Roam mode, I just kind of tried to find things, mainly P-Switch challenges, which start up little timed events to earn awards, similar to challenges in Super Mario 3D games. "", ""The courses I tried looked to be unique from lap to lap, unfolding over territory that eventually can lead to other courses if you're playing in Versus or Knockout Tour modes. Once a race is done, your trip to the other course is still part of the race. It adds variety and changes up how some races even feel, depending on which one you're heading to next, but also feels like it's a departure from the more static lap-based courses from older Karts. It's a lot more like Forza Horizon games in style, which I actually love."", ""Look, I'm a crab."", 'Multiplayer in 24-player modes is total chaos. Many of the courses are wider than previous Mario Kart games to accommodate all those karts, and it can get pretty Mad Max. It also makes surviving feel even more victorious. Knockout Tour is the star of the show. This new mode, which I tried in April, is a survival race that eliminates a certain percentage of players every course. It feels like a 99-player-type survival game, but I like this even better. I once made it to sixth place among a bunch of game journalists, which was enough of a win for me.', ""Also, the characters? I love them. I played as a cow. I played as a dolphin. I played as a crab. There are so many weird options. It's lovely."", ""I also tried Battle Mode, where 24 of us zoomed around pretty large course maps to either collect coins as fast as we could, or try to pop each others' balloons. It was fun too, but felt more random, less purposeful than the races."", ""I mostly played in TV-docked mode, which showed off the Switch 2's graphics quality: clearly better than Switch 1, but not shockingly so. I also tried handheld mode, and I'm impressed by the quality of the Switch 2's LCD 1080p display, even if it isn't OLED. "", ""As good as it all is, though, I don't think it's enough on its own to justify a Switch 2 purchase. Not yet. Still, if you're getting a Switch 2, this game is obviously your must-get, and it feels like it earns that label."", ""Welcome Tour is fun, but it shouldn't cost money."", 'I spent more time in the weirdly charming Welcome Tour (about an hour and a half), and still can\'t tell how much content this ""game"" has in it. Welcome Tour is literally a walk-through of the Switch 2\'s features, accompanied by quizzes, demos and some minigames to try. It clearly should\'ve been included on the Switch 2, much like Astro\'s Playroom on the PS5. Instead, Nintendo is charging $10 for it -- that\'s absurd.', ""Then again, I'd be tempted to get it at launch just to have some things to play with that show off the Switch 2 extras, like mouse mode. Welcome Tour also has lots of weird facts about the Switch 2's construction and design, like how its speakers are designed and housed. Lots of deep, nerdy stuff, and why is this presented in an app like this? I don't know, and I wish Nintendo had just made a weird collection of mini-games like 1-2 Switch instead. "", 'Just me playing a ""guess the frame rate"" game on Welcome Tour.', ""I unlocked some of the areas in the game, finished some quizzes, tested Joy-Con haptics, looked at frame-rate and HDR demos, and did some arcade-ish minigames using the Joy-Con as a mouse. I want to play it more, but I can't justify the existence of this as a standalone paid game at all. Neither should Nintendo. There's still time to change course and make this a free download."", 'One final note: I walked away from my day of play feeling like I\'d be happy to carry around a Switch 2, but unable to justify to friends why they should get one now. It doesn\'t feel like a console that demands to be bought yet, and it\'s too much of an ""enhanced Switch"" type of experience at the moment. That will certainly change once more exclusive and enhanced games emerge, but that could take another year. I\'ll have more thoughts when I review the Switch 2 soon, but I do see more potential in GameChat and the connected camera than I expected.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNDVhbEZhZWxZd1NYUkRhMGd5VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdzQlFJeGlQaVhCSzFvTGJB=-w280-h168-p-df

While experienced gamers will point to services like Discord or the now-ancient Xbox Live Vision camera as tech that already accomplished what Nintendo is doing with GameChat, the Switch 2 feature does it better than the competition — and Nintendo’s past efforts in the space — thanks to its simplicity.', 'I went hands-on with GameChat at an event in New York City last week, and walked away a convert. Or at the very least, someone who’s going to buy a camera for GameChat, when I hadn’t previously considered it.', 'GameChat is accessible through the right Joy-Con 2 controller’s new C button. Entering GameChat, users are presented with two options: start a chat session, where you’ll invite friends into your group; or join an existing chat session that you’ve been invited to. GameChat feels carefully cordoned off, because you have to approve your existing friends to have access to your circle of chat friends. There seems to be no danger of users encountering randos through GameChat, so it feels kid-friendly — as long as you know who you’re friends with via your Nintendo Account and you’re careful about whom you accept as a fellow GameChat user.', 'While in GameChat, it’s easy to tailor the experience to your liking (and your tolerance for other people) just by pressing the C button again. While the default view of GameChat is a smaller version of whatever you’re playing on Switch 2, with four other camera feeds spread across the bottom of the screen, you also have the option to increase the size of your personal screen feed, shrinking the others, or turn off other video feeds altogether (aka full-screen view). You can also choose to mute your personal audio and video, or turn off other players’ screens to avoid spoilers.', 'Better still, if you’re trying to focus while still being social with your Switch 2 friends, GameChat audio supports speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Switch 2 also includes support for USB keyboards, by the way. A Nintendo representative showed how GameChat turned what he was saying into real-time text for other players to read, and it was remarkably accurate.', 'After a brief demonstration of the simple-but-effective options for GameChat, I got to try it out myself in a game of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords, the four-player co-op multiplayer portion of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for Game Boy Advance, running on a Switch 2. Perhaps unsurprisingly, playing Four Swords was a perfect fit for GameChat, as the game requires collaboration and uses simple controls. And thanks to the chunky, old-school graphics, the video coming in from other players was quite readable. No doubt Nintendo is tailoring future cooperative multiplayer games that can be streamed through GameChat video to perform well through low resolution and low frame rate.', 'But graphical fidelity through GameChat is clearly not the point of Nintendo’s Zoom-like service. The voice and video chat feature is designed to bring friends and family together on Switch 2, and to do so as simply and as safely as possible.

And if you want to experience all this gen has to offer, grabbing one of the best Nintendo Switch 2 cameras is a breeze.\n\nThere's a plethora of Switch 2 cameras to choose from. From the plain all-black design of the official Nintendo model to HORI's Piranha Plant USB-C camera that takes inspiration from the iconic Super Mario series baddie, these accessories are taking all sorts of shapes and sizes. If that's not for you, the Switch 2 is also compatible with most USB-C cameras, according to Nintendo, so if you don't have the means to buy one of the best Nintendo Switch accessories, you can resort to using your regular PC webcam instead."", ""To make picking the right camera for your brand-new Ninty handheld easier, I've tested as many USB-C compatible options as I could and whittled them down to my top picks so you can GameChat with your friends in no time.

In the time I've been using it, I've collected a mass of accessories, everything from Nintendo-branded microSD cards to Pro controllers, which have pushed the Switch to be one of my favorite pieces of Ninty hardware out there. Picking the right Switch 2 camera, just like choosing the right Switch 2 accessory generally, can be a fine art, especially if you have a tight budget to stick to. So I'm using my all my years worth of Nintendo gaming and tech reviewing to ensure you get the right camera for your new Nintendo handheld setup."", '', ""The Nintendo Switch 2 is brand-spanking-new, so there isn't a huge batch of official cameras to choose from.

Sure, how well lit up your gaming environment is will also greatly affect your visual clarity, but the higher the resolution, the better you're going to look on-screen - the most important factor of any camera."", ""For now, the Nintendo Switch 2 camera is also the only first-party accessory of its kind to offer up that 1080p resolution, with both of Hori's officially licensed alternatives only reaching resolutions of 480p, respectively. It can also be used in handheld mode, which is great news for those of you who plan to spend ample time playing your Switch 2 on the go, but you'll still need to have a spare flat surface at your disposal."", '', ""The Hori USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 has the same $59.99 MSRP as the official Switch 2 camera, however, deals on the lead up to launch day have already seen it be marked down considerably less than its almost $60 price range in the US.

Instead of a typical privacy screen, the camera's mouth can be closed when you aren't using GameChat, and the stem can be adjusted so you can get that perfect viewpoint - this is truly one for the Mario fans."", ""Choosing the right Nintendo Switch 2 camera isn't that dissimilar to choosing the best webcam for your gaming PC. To begin, you need to consider your budget, as not everyone has the means to fork out a ton of cash, especially after the already pricey investment that is the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nIf you're sticking to the officially licensed options, the official Switch 2 camera has an MSRP of $54.99 / £49.99, whereas the HORI Piranha Plant Camera has an MSRP of $39.99 / £34.99. Hori also has another option, with the simply named USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2 for $59.99 / £29.99.\n\nIdeally, even if your budget is limited, you'll still want to gravitate towards the camera that's at least 1080p, to ensure you have the best image quality possible. For now, only the official Switch 2 camera is 1080p, with both HORI's options being 480p. In the UK, the HORI Switch 2 cameras are more affordable, and where they lack in the specs department, they make it up with their flashy designs and handheld mode compatibility.\n\nAlternatively, you could save even more cash by reusing an existing USB-C webcam you have lying around. Currently, we're putting our existing cameras through their paces to see what existing webcams, from brands like Razer and Elgato, are compatible with the Switch 2."", '', 'On the way up to launch, Nintendo stated that you may be able to use a USB-C camera accessory you already own"", but that some might not work as intended. There are loads upon loads of USB-C webcams out there, and all of them sport various USB-C cable requirements, resolutions, codecs, and more. It\'s a pretty broad claim to say that any old webcam will work, which is why we\'re going to test out as many of the best webcams as possible.\n\nIf you have a spare USB-C camera lying around, you can test it with your Switch by navigating to the system settings menu and testing it through the Test USB Camera feature. With the Switch 2 newly released, we\'re hard at work putting all of our existing USB-C cameras to the test to see what\'s actually compatible with the handheld.', 'So far, the only game to make use of the brand-new Switch 2 camera features is Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV.

Here's why it may be the console's most important innovation."", ""At first glance, the 'C' Button might look like just another control input. However, it serves a very specific and powerful function: instant access to GameChat, Nintendo's new integrated voice and video communication platform."", ""Unlike its predecessor, the Switch 2 does away with the need for external apps or clunky workarounds to connect with friends. The 'C' Button launches GameChat immediately, allowing players to chat in real time while gaming, without disrupting the action."", 'This marks a significant shift for Nintendo, a company previously hesitant to embrace open online voice communication, especially in family-oriented titles.', ""GameChat is more than just a basic chat feature. It's a comprehensive in-console communication hub that includes:"", ""All of these features are accessible with a single press of the 'C' Button, streamlining interaction in both casual and competitive multiplayer settings.

The introduction to the feature in the Switch reveal trailer looked choppy and poor quality. While I and others gave them credit for showing the feature in a ""warts and all"" state, it was a confusing choice to center so much of the presentation around a video-sharing function that looked, well, bad. Having now spent some time with GameChat at an extensive hands-on preview, I can\'t say I\'m confident that the final quality will be any better than we saw--but I am sure that the ease of use and system integration make it a nicer prospect than it first appeared.', ""Unlike our first hands-on with the Switch 2, GameChat was fully enabled for this session, which meant I was free to poke around the options and see how it all worked. GameChat is a main-menu option right alongside others like the Nintendo eShop and controller settings, so it's easy to find even without the dedicated button. But the C button does call up the menu quickly, which is nice for toggling its various options on and off."", '', '', '', '', 'Now Playing: Nintendo Switch 2 - Nintendo Switch Online Overview Trailer', ""Those options include voice, video, and game sharing--the latter being the less-than-stellar game feed from your friends. You can turn on any combination of these options, and as promised, you can bring up your friend's game screen to watch them. It came up after a short delay and ran more smoothly than the choppy video shown in the Direct, when it was the main video feed. I should say, though, that the game being showcased for this feature was Zelda: Four Swords Adventures running through the GBA Classics app, so it wasn't exactly a game that was taxing system resources like Mario Kart World. The connection was also running via LAN rather than Wi-Fi, so that could have also conceivably improved my experience."", ""We played a short tutorial of Four Swords Adventures across multiple consoles with GameChat on, and we were allowed to toggle whichever features we liked, as well as explore some of the various options. If you just want to chat and don't care about sharing video, you can go full-screen and still see your friends' voices lighting up in the corner when they speak. You can turn on voice-to-text and see a text box offering what is at least a close approximation (with some understandable typos) of what they've said, identified with their usernames. That feature is offered as an accessibility option but could also be useful for those of us who play with the volume low when family members are asleep. The system also does a decent job automatically raising and lowering the game volume to accommodate voices, if you have that option selected."", ""It also seems smartly targeted at ease of use and families, which you'd expect from Nintendo, and the company commented on it when it first debuted the feature. You can quickly turn off individual shared screens--for example, if a friend is playing an M-rated game and your young children enter the room. Nintendo has also detailed some of the kid-safe features to make sure your children are only interacting with whitelisted contacts. And if you see your friend playing a game you don't recognize, it's easy to hop into its game page for more information."", ""None of these features are exactly revolutionary, and in many ways GameChat and GameShare represent Nintendo catching up to the norms of online play on other platforms. But it is smartly implemented and user-friendly in a way that feels characteristic for Nintendo's general sense of ease, if not its history with online connectivity. I'm still not convinced GameChat is a marquee feature for the Nintendo Switch 2. But after eight years of playing on the first Switch, it's a solid nice-to-have that makes the successor that much more appealing."", '', 'Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Nintendo is way behind the curve on this one."", ""That said, I got to try the new Switch 2's GameChat functionality at a recent event ahead of the console's June 5 launch, and I came away pretty impressed, all things considered. I also got to spend six hours playing Mario Kart World, so all in all, a pretty awesome day."", ""Nintendo hasn't really invented anything new here but rather has synthesized its family-friendly, intuitive sensibilities with the way people hang out with each other on Discord in 2025. Thanks to a dedicated button on every Switch 2 controller, a slick interface, and some pretty thoughtful accessibility features (that's new for Nintendo), I expect Switch gamers are going to love GameChat."", 'SEE ALSO: Nintendo Switch 2 preorder guide: Track latest restocks, see our first-hand impressions', ""As originally outlined in the big Nintendo Switch 2 Direct livestream back in April, GameChat is Nintendo's version of something you've been able to do on Xbox consoles since I was roughly 10 years old and playing Halo 2. Put simply, it's a way to create voice chat parties for up to 12 Nintendo Switch Online users."", 'Take a moment to pick your jaw up from the floor. Nintendo is finally doing what Xbox Live users could do back in the Bush administration. Sarcasm aside, there are actually a couple of unique features that make GameChat stand out. One is that it\'s immediately accessible at any time via a new ""C"" button on every Switch 2 controller. This, of course, makes it very easy to bop in and out of chat rooms at will without having to go to the Home menu and spend a few seconds navigating a series of icons.', ""The interface for all of this could not be more straightforward, in a good way. There's a button for creating a room, a button for joining an existing room (made by someone you're friends with, not strangers), and some settings for you to fiddle with. It feels very Nintendo-like in its simplicity and elegance."", ""Another distinguishing characteristic of GameChat is that it's designed to be used with an open microphone that's built into the console itself. This has been, by far, my biggest worry with GameChat; some of us have to deal with noise complaints from neighbors, for example. I was also concerned this would inevitably create problems with game audio or miscellaneous real-life noises bleeding into voice chat."", ""Granted, I was in a demo environment set up by Nintendo, but it was a very loud room with a lot going on and I gotta say...it works. I could hear everyone clearly and, as far as I could tell, they could hear me without any problems. However, I'd like to acknowledge that I was told you can plug a regular headset into the Switch 2 Pro Controller's headphone jack and voice chat like you would on any other console. I will probably be doing that exclusively, to be honest."", ""It's like Discord on your TV. Credit: Nintendo"", ""There are a few other odds and ends I noticed during the demo. One is that you can stream a live feed of your gameplay to anyone else in the GameChat room, and they can do the same for you. If you've seen any promotional footage of GameChat, you probably noticed that those video feeds are pretty blurry and run at a very low frame rate. You can blow one up to full-screen, but I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, they live in a horizontal row at the bottom of the screen."", ""I can confirm that they look like that in practice, not just in marketing videos. I'm not sure how much I want to use that feature, especially given that it reduces the total amount of the screen I get to use for my gameplay purposes. With that in mind, though, there's something nice about being able to discern what your friends are doing at a glance. Our demo involved playing through a co-op level in The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords for Game Boy Advance, and it was kinda cool to know that one of my partners was in another room collecting Rupees without me needing to ask where he was. This feature seems built for that sort of cooperation, those little moments when you want to quickly check a friend's feed."", ""I also noticed a pretty neat number of customization options for GameChat. You can turn off a friend's video feed, adjust the size of your gameplay window, adjust individual users' volume levels, and just play in a regular full-screen mode, if you want. Most surprising was the inclusion of a speech-to-text window you can optionally display on screen for users with hearing issues. In the very brief demo I got of that feature, it seemed pretty good at picking up what the demonstrator was saying, and it actually labeled individual speakers in the text window."", ""Look, all of this could completely fall apart once it's in the hands of regular goobers like my friends and I, outside of an ideal demo environment. I also expect that parents will have a lot of questions about safety and CamgeChat parental controls. But I came away from my short time with GameChat feeling a lot better about the feature. The open-mic stuff works better than expected, but I'm also glad you can opt out of it. Streaming gameplay to other users does seem to have genuine use cases, but again, it's totally optional and decently configurable. And the inclusion of the speech-to-text window is so much more cognizant of accessibility issues than Nintendo has been in the recent past."", ""In other words, Nintendo put a lot more thought into GameChat than I expected. This is just how people (gamers and otherwise) interact with each other now, and Nintendo is meeting folks where they are. I'm excited to try it out in real-world settings, at the very least."", 'Advertisement']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNDVhbEZhZWxZd1NYUkRhMGd5VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdzQlFJeGlQaVhCSzFvTGJB=-w280-h168-p-df
