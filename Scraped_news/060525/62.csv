NASA’s future in the balance,https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4999/1,"['At the end of last week, the space community was gearing up for more bad news. While there was no formal announcement, NASA was widely expected to release more details about its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal. The White House had released top-level details in a “skinny” budget released in early May (see “Budget cuts and the fraying of international partnerships”, The Space Review, May 12, 2025), but NASA would go into details about how the cuts in the skinny budget would be implemented: which missions and programs would be cancelled or scaled back, and which few lucky ones would be increased.', 'The release of the detailed budget would help illustrate the magnitude of the reductions to the space community as well as to members of Congress who, in the coming weeks and months will consider, or cast aside, the proposal as they craft appropriations bills. It was also shaping up to be the first major challenge for NASA incoming administrator—until it wasn’t.', 'Normally NASA budget rollouts are events. In recent years, NASA administrators have given “State of NASA” speeches the day the budget is announced, with a briefing later in the day to discuss what was in, or cut from, the proposal.', 'This year was different. There was no “State of NASA” speech, no briefing, no press release, and not even a formal advisory in advance. Instead, at about 4 pm EDT on Friday the 30th, NASA posted the documents on its website with zero fanfare.', 'Looking at the document, one can understand why NASA didn’t want to publicize it. The budget cancelled missions and programs right and left to achieve the $6 billion in cuts from the agency’s 2025 budget of about $24.9 billion.', 'Those cuts were most visible in science. According to The Planetary Society, 41 individual projects, both standalone missions and contributions to other missions, are slated for termination in the 2026 budget proposal. They range from Mars Sample Return (MSR), the multibillion-dollar program that the skinny budget already disclosed would be canceled, to many ongoing missions in extended phases whose annual budgets are in the low millions of dollars each.', '“It’s generally pretty much what we expected,” Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, said in an interview shortly after the release of the budget. That was based on the overall budget reductions for science included in the skinny budget, which slashed science spending by 47% from 2025.', 'The skinny budget had listed only two missions, MSR and Landsat Next, for termination (Landsat Next, the document said, would be restructured in some way to lower its costs, with work continuing another line item.) The detailed budget showed how far-reaching the proposed cuts were,', 'Some of the missions slated for cancellation are large, like the Earth System Observatory line of missions, still largely in early phases of development. Also cancelled was the Astrophysics Probe program, also in its early phases now—NASA selected two concepts for further study last year—but which would have a full cost of about $1 billion.', 'The budget, released almost four years after NASA selected two Venus missions in its latest Discovery program competition, DAVINCI and VERITAS, would cancel them both. It would also cancel NASA’s contribution to EnVision, a European Space Agency mission to Venus launching around the same time.', 'However, small missions in development also got the axe, like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager as well as Ultraviolet Explorer missions in astrophysics. It also seeks to cancel NASA’s role in ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover mission to Mars, where NASA offered to provide thrusters for the landing platform, radioisotope heating units and a launch to replace components that Roscosmos had provided.', 'A wide range of missions already operating and in their extended phases would be terminated in the budget. The biggest of them is the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which a year ago NASA was considering budget cuts that astronomers warned were tantamount to cancellation. The new budget simply zeroes out the budget for Chandra. The Hubble Space Telescope would continue, but with some modest funding cuts.', 'The scale of those terminations surprised even Dreier. “I’d say some of the surprises were things like MAVEN, Juno, New Horizons; these really unique and arguably infrastructure-related assets,” he said. MAVEN, a Mars orbiter, is also used as a communications relay. Also terminated in the budget proposal is OSIRIS-APEX, the extension of the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission that will go to the asteroid Apophis just after its close Earth flyby in 2029.', 'He was also surprised that the budget would effectively end NASA support of plutonium-238 production needed for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and heating units. “The argument is that we no longer need a presence in the outer solar system, so we don’t need plutonium any more,” he said.', 'There was one bit of good news for science in the budget. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which leaked budget documents in April suggested would be terminated, is funded in the budget. However, it does do at a lower level than projected: $156.6 million for fiscal year 2025, versus a projected $376.5 million that NASA said last year the mission would need in 2026 as it worked towards a launch as soon as the fall of 2026.', '“NASA is actively evaluating cost-saving strategies and identifying schedule optimization opportunities to enable the mission to proceed with this reduced funding level,” the budget document said. But Dreier noted that the spacecraft is now nearly complete, with most of its overall budget already spent: “Cutting it in half and expecting to save money, that doesn’t make sense.”', 'Many of the other reductions in the NASA budget had already been telegraphed in the skinny budget: ending SLS and Orion after Artemis 3, cancelling the Gateway, potentially reducing the size of crew on the International Space Station, and slashing many space technology programs.', 'The skinny budget had hinted at new investments in Mars technology, and the budget does more than $1 billion for projects associated with human Mars exploration. That amount includes $200 million mission for “a near-term entry, descent, and landing demonstration for a human-class Mars lander” and another $200 million for commercial payload deliveries to Mars. The budget documents, though, provide few specifics about those new initiatives: the section on new Mars technology investments is less than a page.', 'The budget includes $864 million for a new “Commercial Moon to Mars (M2M) Infrastructure and Transportation Program”. That would go towards developing a commercial system to replace SLS/Orion as well as early work on “a space suit appropriate for use by astronauts on the Martian surface.” The program will also fund lunar and Martian relay satellites and be the new home of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, currently hosted by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.', 'With all those cuts come job reductions. A table tucked away in the back of the 462-page budget document notes that NASA has 17,391 civil servants in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2026, that would fall by a third, to 11,853. Some field centers would see even larger cuts: the Goddard Space Flight Center would lose nearly 50% of its civil servant workforce, while the Ames Research Center would lose nearly 40%.', 'The document, though, says little about those cuts. It makes only passing references to “workforce impacts” and “workforce reshaping efforts” without discussing how they would be implemented.', 'The budget proposal will likely face strong opposition from Congress. Some members, primarily Democrats, have criticized the budget. “This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement Monday. “Republicans need to join Democrats in fighting for the programs they once supported, and their communities thrive on.”', ""“We've heard from Republican offices that this is dead on arrival, absolutely deader than dead on arrival,” Dreier said."", 'For about 24 hours, the budget proposal appeared to be the first major challenge for NASA’s expected next administrator, Jared Isaacman. Just before the Memorial Day holiday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) filed cloture on Isaacman’s nomination, a procedural move intended to set up a vote on the nomination this week. By the end of this week, most expected Isaacman to be sworn in.', 'He would have faced strong questions about how much he supported this budget proposal, which would now be his. He had deflected questions about potential budget cuts during his confirmation process, stating that he was not involved in its development, but noted that a potential cut of neatly 50% to NASA science “does not appear to be an optimal outcome.” Did he still believe that now that he was running the agency and handed a budget with such a massive cut?', 'We won’t find out. While there had been no public issues that threatened his nomination, on Saturday afternoon Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist with some influence on the Trump Administration, posted that “Deep State operatives are trying to derail President Trump’s NASA Administrator pick” ahead of the confirmation vote, suggesting it was an effort to drive a wedge between Musk, who had lobbied for Isaacman to be nominated, and President Trump.', 'Within hours, the White House confirmed that Isaacman was out. “It’s essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon,” White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement.', 'That statement, though, gave no reason for why the White House was withdrawing the nomination, and even left open the chance that Isaacman had decided to withdraw.', 'Trump provided a few more details later Saturday evening. “After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” he stated.', 'Those “prior associations” were not identified, but appear to be a reference to Isaacman’s past donations to Democratic candidates and party offices. Those donations, though, were publicly known for months, which led to speculation again that the decision was linked to fraying ties between Trump and Musk, as the latter exited his formal role in the administration just a day earlier.', 'Whatever the reason, the decision leaves NASA without a permanent leader just as it faces the steepest budget cuts in its history. That has demoralized the agency’s workforce and sent shock waves of concern through the rest of the space community.', 'Isaacman “ran into the kind of politics that is damaging our country. Republicans and Democrats supported him as the right guy at the right time for the top job at NASA, but it wasn’t enough,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), himself a former astronaut, in a post Monday. “It’s incredibly frustrating that this administration did this to him and his family but I know he’s not done yet and he has a lot left to offer space exploration and our nation.”', 'Isaacman himself took the high road in his own online comments about the withdrawal, saying the six months since Trump announced his intent to nominate Isaacman “have been enlightening and, honestly, a bit thrilling.” He added, “I’ll always be grateful for this opportunity and cheering on our President and NASA as they lead us on the greatest adventure in human history.”', 'But right now, few other people are cheering on NASA as the one-two punch of the budget cuts and withdrawn nomination create a dark mood unlike any seen at NASA outside of spaceflight tragedies. The agency’s future is at stake as it enters uncharted fiscal waters with no one at the helm.', 'Jeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

What’s ahead for NASA?",https://www.cfpublic.org/podcast/are-we-there-yet/2025-06-03/slashed-budget-uncertain-leadership-whats-ahead-for-nasa,"['This past weekend, the Trump administration withdrew its nomination of Jared Isaacman for NASA Administrator. This sets back the nomination timeline by months, leaving NASA without a permanent leader.', 'The decision is reportedly political motivated and not related to Isaacman’s qualifications.', 'Eric Berger, senior space editor at Ars Technica, said the decision comes as a surprise. Isaacman had broad support inside NASA, had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to charity for cancer research and it was clear he was making efforts to reach out both to the private and public space community.', ""“So, I think there's just general disappointment,” Berger said. “Both for the fact that Isaacman was well liked, kind of younger, energetic, and really was coming to NASA at a time when it needed to take step forward, to modernize.”"", 'Additionally, NASA now faces a new uncertainty with the Turmp administration’s budget request – and no leader to advocate strongly for NASA.', ""Berger spoke with Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, ahead of the ninth test flight of the company's Starship spacecraft about the mission."", ""“I got the sense that he realizes that Starship is this, you know, hugely ambitious problem to solve, and that there are going to be setbacks along the way,” Berger said. “And I suspect he was hoping for more than what happened with the test flight, but at the same time, I think there's a recognition that they've still got a lot to learn and a lot of problems to solve before they really get a rapidly reusable rocket.”"", 'Just last week, SpaceX launched its mega-rocket Starship on its ninth test flight. There is some concern considering there are some fundamental issues that still need to be fixed, and NASA is counting on Starship for future moon landings.', ""“I think SpaceX is going to kind of go its own way,” Berger said. “You know, they do not need funding from NASA like they did five, 10, or 15 years ago, to survive. They're going to continue to work with NASA, but my sense is that Elon is going to be in a mode where he's ready to show the world what SpaceX can do. “"", 'NASA could face a significant budget cut—approximately 25%—under a new request from the White House, if approved by Congress.', 'If implemented, the budget would cancel about a third of NASA’s science portfolio.', 'Multiple solar system exploration missions including Juno at Jupiter, New Horizons in the Kuiper Belt, and various Earth and Mars expeditions would be discontinued.', 'Casey Dreier, the Chief of Space Policy for The Planetary Society, a science advocacy organization, anticipates that every single future science mission, as well as further development, will be canceled under this budget.', ""“And then, of course, major ramping down, ending the SLS and Orion programs, canceling the gateway Space Station, ending NASA's Education Outreach Program entirely,” Dreier said. “And then roughly, laying off about a third of NASA's remaining workforce.

Isaacman, with very close ties to Elon Musk, having purchased two space flights from SpaceX, conducting the first civilian space walk, among other things, owns a fleet of fighter jets, seemed kind of perfect for the job, went through his nomination hearings well, was well on his way to an up-vote in the Senate to become the next NASA administrator.', ""And then over the weekend, it got pulled by the White House. And the reason that's been given is that he has a history of giving to Democratic candidates over the years. I looked at the public records for that. He has indeed given to several Democratic candidates, also Republicans over the years, and he's not registered as a Democrat."", ""I'm told this information was known to the White House from day one, so it's rather mysterious why this nomination was pulled so suddenly this past weekend."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'And what do we know, Miles, about what his leadership would have meant for NASA?', 'Miles O’Brien:', ""It was a real generational shift. It's from old space to very new, to — from the commercial ventures were going to take center stage here. His close relationship with Elon Musk, his desire to explore using private rockets was quite obvious."", 'And many at NASA saw this as a real change of philosophy there, or at least pushing further into the commercial realm. There are some choices that are being bandied about to potentially replace him as a NASA nominee. And some of them are retired Air Force generals, which would indicate a shift in an entirely different direction.', ""Amna, many Republicans would like to see space being moved more into the militaristic sphere. So it'll be interesting to see how this plays out at NASA amid all these very draconian budget cuts."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'And NASA is now facing its largest ever budget cut.

Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP', 'The Trump administration wants to take NASA’s budget back to a time before the 1969 moon landing.', 'The proposed White House budget released late Friday would slash about a quarter of the agency’s spending and reduce NASA’s top-line budget to one of its lowest levels in 60 years when adjusted for inflation.', 'Much of the $6 billion cut from the current $25 billion annual budget would be achieved by decimating research — in particular NASA’s work on climate change.', 'The White House proposal also would target entire satellite programs for elimination and dramatically curtail U.S. cooperation with foreign science agencies. The number of NASA employees would be cut by about a third, from more than 18,000 down to fewer than 12,000.', 'NASA’s science division would bear the brunt of the blow. Its budget would be cut from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion, with major cuts to programs that monitor and process the ways human-caused global warming is transforming America and the world.', 'The proposal is an “extinction-level event” for one of the world’s leading science agencies, said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, which advocates for research and exploration in space.', '“It’s unprecedented, it’s a fundamentally different science program than what we’ve had for the last few decades, and one that I frankly think is a narrower and less ambitious representation of our national goals,” he said, “And frankly, it abandons a lot of our joint efforts with our key allies in the process.”', 'Dreier added that cutting climate-related monitoring of the planet will have immediate and negative effects on a broad range of industries, especially agriculture.', 'The cuts will hit communities across the country too, as NASA’s science division funds work in every state as well as roughly 80 percent of the nation’s congressional districts, according to the Planetary Society.', 'Some parts of the proposal would save a relatively small amount of money at the cost of impairing U.S. efforts to understand the way global warming is changing the planet, critics say. The White House proposal would cut off invaluable streams of data that have been collected during Democratic and Republican administrations.', 'The satellite division would be hard hit too, and those cuts appear aimed at any instrument that tracks human-caused climate change — even though they provide other useful data as well.', 'For instance, the Surface Geology and Biology mission — slated for elimination — keeps tabs on methane and carbon pollution but also uses sophisticated instruments to hunt for critical minerals.', 'Also on the chopping block: the next generation of the LandSat satellite program. LandSat tracks the ways global warming is altering Earth, but it also provides data on water levels and distribution.', 'Trump has not staffed the National Space Council, which provides guidance to the White House and federal agencies as well as the U.S. Space Force — though he may do so soon. It’s not clear if the budget is largely the product of the White House Office of Management and Budget or if it was crafted with input from NASA.', 'White House and NASA officials did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Most years, White House budget plans are treated as either a rough draft or a messaging document — as the presidential proposals are often dramatically altered by congressional appropriators.', 'But this year could be different, as congressional Republicans have shown little willingness to break with the White House at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.', 'Even if Republicans do attempt to undo some part of the White House plan for NASA, OMB Director Russ Vought has said his office may simply ignore congressional action and impound funds it does want to spend, which likely would draw a legal challenge.', 'The proposed NASA cuts come at turbulent time for the space agency.', 'The Trump administration recently withdrew its first pick for NASA administrator.

Space and Earth science missions would bear the brunt of the cutbacks, losing more than 53% of what was allocated to them in 2024.', 'If the budget is approved by Congress, opponents say, longstanding Nasa labs will close, deep-space missions, including many already under way, will be abandoned, and a new generation of exploration and discovery will never reach the launchpad.', 'Two of the most notable casualties will be the Mars sample return mission, which had been in doubt on cost grounds for a while, and the Davinci+ and Veritas projects. The latter two were announced during the Biden administration and planned for the early 2030s; they would have sent Nasa back to study Venus for the first time since 1989.', 'Advocates are highlighting the future discoveries that will not be made, as much as the loss of initiatives that were extensively planned years ago, as they ramp up their campaign to persuade Washington lawmakers to defy the president and preserve or even expand Nasa’s funding.', '“An extinction-level event is when something like an asteroid hits Earth and life that has been otherwise perfectly well-functioning, healthy ecosystems that have been balanced and functioning, are wiped out in large numbers. That’s functionally what this budget is,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, which is rallying Congress members to oppose the budget.', '“Projects that are functioning, that are on budget and on time, that are already paid for and returning good science, would be decimated. You’d see missions turned off mid-flight, extended missions put into hibernation or left to tumble in space. You’d see projects that could launch next year canceled summarily, and hundreds if not thousands of scientists and engineers and others laid off due to loss of research money and technology investments.', '“What this does is turn off the spigot of discovery, the investments we’re making now that are going to pay off in five years, 10 years, maybe 20 years, that may fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the cosmos, our origins.', '“Is Mars habitable for life? Is Venus? How many Earth-like planets are there? Those types of questions will not be answered because we just decided not to answer them. We’re abandoning literally decades of debate and discussion and justification.”', 'As well as the planetary missions, a significant number of other science projects that have been in the works for years face the axe. While the Trump administration proposes to slash Nasa’s overall budget, it also seeks to prioritize and grant extra funding to crewed spaceflight – particularly the first human missions to Mars, a stated focus of the president and his as-yet unconfirmed pick for Nasa administrator, the entrepreneur Jared Isaacman.', 'The advocates say a particularly acute loss to un-crewed science would be the $3.9bn Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, a successor to the James Webb and Hubble telescopes that have produced stunning images and unexpected insight into the origins of the universe.', 'If the telescope, which is nearing completion and set for launch before May 2027, is scrapped, 200,000 possible planets beyond our solar system may never be discovered, more than one billion galaxies might never be surveyed, and secrets of black holes, dark matter and dark energy may never be uncovered, the Planetary Society said.', 'Billions of dollars have already been spent on it, and killing it now would be “nuts”, astrophysicist David Spergel told Scientific American last month.', 'Other experts lament the distancing of the Trump administration from science, and believe it will allow other nations to catch or eclipse US leadership in space.', '“What’s happening now, and that’s beyond Nasa, is this general atmosphere of: ‘No, science is not important to us as much as it used to be,’” said Ehud Behar, a high-energy astrophysicist at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, and a former Nasa researcher.', '“Is the US going to be left behind? It might take time, this is not going to happen tomorrow, but China has enough people, they have enough scientists. If they are going to invest much more in science and technology development, they’re going to be more competitive, and they’re going to achieve things within five to 10 years that today maybe only Nasa can achieve.”', 'Behar also fears a “brain drain” of Nasa’s top talent.', '“There are a lot of good people in these agencies, and they’ve made a living of being innovative on a budget that was always limited. If somebody thinks that you walk into Nasa and you have boxes of dollars falling on your head, that’s not the case when you want to do a mission,” he said.', '“Even in the best years, you never had enough money to do everything you wanted. So these people are pretty well-trained to find ways with less funding to get the job done. You can count on these people as long as you hold on to them.', '“Hanging on to your best people is one of the main challenges when you have to cut the budget.”', 'Dreier said there had been “productive” conversations with congressional politicians on both sides of the aisle, and that a number of Republicans and Democrats were pushing for an increase to Nasa’s science budget in place of the cuts.', 'The argument to them, he said, is simple: why throw away so much of what has already been bought and paid for?', '“It’s just like we’re giving up and turning away. Instead of looking up, we’re turning down and inwards,” he said.', '“This is a budget of retrenchment, this is a budget of retreat.

Additionally, these programs draw hundreds of additional workers and tourists to the area, benefiting hotels, restaurants and other regional businesses.', 'The cancellation of the SLS and Orion programs will bring all of these economic benefits to a screeching halt. Jobs will go elsewhere, local businesses will suffer and years of technological progress in the area will be reversed.', 'From a broader perspective, SLS and Orion, which together form the backbone of NASA’s Artemis program, are crucial for maintaining U.S. leadership in space. China has made no secret of its ambition to dominate in space, with plans for regular crewed moon missions by 2030.', 'By phasing out the SLS and Orion well before a replacement system is ready, the United States risks ceding this critical ground to rival nations. It would be a grave mistake to land on the moon on the third Artemis flight but then be unable to return for a decade or more.', 'SLS and Orion performed flawlessly during their first flight in 2022, and the integration and assembly of the vehicles for the next two missions are progressing smoothly. Significant work is already underway on hardware, including brand-new SLS engines that will need to be tested at Stennis and future core stage elements. However, this hardware could be scrapped in favor of unproven systems if the administration’s budget proposal is approved by Congress.', 'Canceling SLS and Orion after just three flights is strategically and economically unsound, as well as detrimental to America’s long-term goals in space exploration.

It comes at a time of upheaval for NASA: Shortly after its release, the Trump administration walked back its nomination of a tech billionaire with Alabama ties to lead the space agency.', 'The White House previewed the cuts in a budget outline released last month. In that document, the administration called for the elimination of the Space Launch System and its Orion crew capsule, dismissing them as, “grossly expensive and delayed.” The SLS is the super-heavy, expendable launch vehicle that is scheduled to carry crews to lunar orbit throughout the life of the agency’s Artemis program.', 'In line with the earlier budget preview, the administration’s $18.8 billion funding request for NASA is down 24.3%, or $6 billion, from the $24.8 billion approved for the space agency last year. The main cuts come to science programs, with 41 “lower-priority missions” being eliminated. Those include the New Horizons Pluto probe and the Juno Jupiter orbiter, along with the office of STEM engagement. It would be the largest single-year cut in NASA’s history.', 'Eliminating SLS and Orion will, “[pave] the way for more cost-effective, next-generation commercial systems that will support subsequent NASA lunar missions,” according to budget documents.', 'Both are key programs for Marshall Space Flight Center, one of the largest of NASA’s 10 field centers, which employs nearly 7,000 federal workers and contractors in Huntsville and manages a multibillion-dollar budget related to human spaceflight.', 'Marshall is the agency’s lead center for SLS, managing the booster, engines, stages, and integration. Major Huntsville aerospace contractors including Dynetics, Aerojet Rocketdyne, United Launch Alliance and Teledyne Brown Engineering contribute to the development, production and operation of the SLS’s various elements.', 'A 2024 study found a greater economic impact for NASA’s Artemis-related work in Alabama than in any other state. It tallied $5.1 billion in effects and attributed much of that to the reach of Marshall Space Flight Center and the contracting it oversees.', 'Artemis, NASA’s $100 billion, decade-long human lunar exploration program, includes plans for a permanent colony on the moon, which is intended to serve as a steppingstone for crewed Mars missions. Artemis currently consists of 10 planned lunar missions through 2035, all of them intended to launch atop the SLS and to house the crew in Orion capsules.', 'Trump’s budget supports Artemis II and III, while after that, it envisions “commercial transportation services … through a competitive contract, incentivizing performance and promoting innovation and efficiency.”', 'Phasing out SLS and Orion raises questions about how astronauts would reach the moon starting with the Artemis IV mission, currently scheduled for summer 2028. Orion is the program’s only crew capsule and SLS its only launch vehicle.', 'Commercial landers made by SpaceX and Blue Origin are planned for the journey from lunar orbit to the moon’s surface, and those would be launched aboard rockets from the two companies. But neither has yet matched the SLS and Orion duo, which sent an uncrewed capsule around the moon and back to Earth in December 2022 under Artemis 1.', 'SpaceX’s Starship has recorded four successful flights since April 2023 but has suffered a recent string of setbacks. On its ninth launch in late May, the partially reusable vehicle broke up as it re-entered Earth’s atmosphere, making its third straight failure.', 'Meanwhile, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket took its first flight in January.

But the technical supplement to the proposed budget released Friday includes new details about how the administration would seek to reduce federal spending levels. NASA’s budget would be slashed by roughly a quarter — from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion — and would lay off nearly a third of its workforce — more than 5,500 people across its 10 staffed centers. The technical supplement said centers will use cross-mission retraining opportunities and offer buyouts to meet the staffing requests.', 'For NASA Langley, that includes a staffing cut from 1,730 people to 1,058.', 'NASA Langley spokesperson Brittny McGraw said Langley doesn’t have any additional context for how the cuts would work.', '“At this point, there are no decisions that have been made going forward about what things could look like,” McGraw said.', 'Another major shift proposed for Langley would be in its Aerosciences Evaluation and Test Capabilities. NASA currently operates 12 wind tunnels and propulsion test facilities, seven of which reside at Langley. The proposed budget would replace an 84-year-old vertical spin tunnel with a new flight dynamics research facility at Langley.', 'However, there’s a catch. The proposed budget slashes Aerosciences funding by more than $40 million and will put up to five unspecified wind tunnels in “stand by” mode with minimal maintenance.', 'Aerosciences isn’t the only program being hit with cuts to meet the budget request.

Now, Warner said that culture is in jeopardy.', '“That trickles through the economy, especially when we’re talking about this many folks laid off at NASA Langley, that has been our premier aerospace research facility in the country,” Kaine’s fellow Virginia Democrat said. “Many of those future scientists, you can make a lot more money working at a tech company, but they come and work for NASA because of the mission.

But the Artemis moon mission it is intended to serve may never happen if President Trump’s plans for NASA come to fruition.', 'The mobile launcher 2 has been rising steadily at a construction site just north of the massive Vehicle Assembly Building, where it stands now at 320 feet tall on its way to a target of 390 feet.', 'It’s designed to support a larger version of the Space Launch System rocket called the SLS Block 1B beginning with the Artemis IV mission. But Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 has spiked future use of the SLS rocket after Artemis III, a move that comes amid $6 billion in cuts to the agency’s overall spending plan.', 'An existing mobile launcher, ML-1, was used on the uncrewed Artemis I test flight of SLS and the Orion spacecraft in 2022, and is in place within the VAB for the Artemis II mission, a crewed flight that will go around but not land on the moon. It is set to fly in early 2026.', 'ML-1 would be used for a final time for the Artemis III mission, which aims to return humans to the surface of the moon as early as summer 2027.', 'But after that, Trump wants to find different solutions to send crew and cargo to the moon and onto Mars.', 'That would leave ML-2 with no purpose, and its fate could be similar to its predecessor, which sat unused at KSC for years after the end of the Constellation program. Eventually, though, the launcher was repurposed for use on the first three Artemis missions.', '“NASA will close out Mobile Launcher-2 development, as ML-2 will not be needed to support SLS due to the orderly shutdown of the SLS Block 1B upgrade,” reads the budget proposal. “NASA proposes to use previously appropriated unobligated balances to support the termination of these activities, including but not limited to, ongoing administration, oversight, and monitoring.”', 'That would include money that would be paid out to lead contractor Bechtel National Inc., which was initially awarded a $383 million contract in 2019 with a delivery date of 2023. NASA’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit in August 2024 that said the costs had already nearly tripled to more than $1 billion with the delivery date pushed to no later than November 2026.', 'The budget also calls for an end to NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems team that supports Artemis launches.', 'NASA, which employs for now around 18,000, has not said how many people fall under EGS, but its budgets in 2024 and 2025 neared $884 million. Trump’s proposed budget would drop that to $658 million for 2026, $700 million in 2027, $500 million in 2028, and then nothing beyond that.', '“NASA will utilize a commercial partnership through a competitive contract to transport crew for future Artemis missions,” the budget proposal states.', 'The move to kill the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft by Trump comes amid criticism of the program’s continued delays and ballooning costs.', 'The OIG in a 2023 audit warned that by the time Artemis III finally flies, NASA will have spent more than $93 billion across its various facets including SLS, Orion and Exploration Ground Systems.', 'Instead, Trump’s goal is to rely on commercial launch providers such as SpaceX’s in-development Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn for future moon and Mars missions.', '“New transportation services contracts will permit more frequent missions to the moon while at the same time freeing up resources to invest in the infrastructure necessary to conduct longer stays on the lunar surface than ever before,” reads a note within the budget proposal from interim NASA Administrator Janet Petro.', 'Overall, Trump’s proposed NASA budget would drop dramatically from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion, proposing to kill off not only future SLS launches, but gutting much of the agency’s science portfolio.', '“This budget is a retreat, a narrowing of ambition,” reads a critical statement from nonprofit group The Planetary Society. “This request represents the smallest NASA budget since FY 1961 — a level enacted before the first American had launched into space.”', 'Calling it an “extinction-level event” for NASA’s science efforts, the group noted the budget would kill 41 science projects, or 1/3 of NASA’s science portfolio.', 'But the agency contends it’s focusing on moon and Mars missions instead.', '“With a leaner budget across all of government, we are all taking a closer look at how we work, where we invest, and how we adjust our methods to accomplish our mission,” the proposal reads. “At NASA, that means placing a renewed emphasis on human spaceflight – increasing investments in a sustainable plan to return to the Moon for long-term human exploration and accelerating efforts to send American astronauts to Mars.”', 'A shift from a nationally sponsored rocket program to reliance on commercial partners for launch doesn’t necessarily mean an economic downturn for the Space Coast, according to the Space Florida, the state’s aerospace economic development entity.', '“Florida’s strategic investments over the years have paid off in building a diverse and robust ecosystem that’s well-positioned to fuel the growth of the aerospace sector — regardless of how national priorities evolve,” said Space Florida’s Director of Public Relations Alayna Curry.', 'Part of that is a massive $1.8 billion infrastructure project by SpaceX to support two launch sites of Starship once it becomes operational.', 'Despite the uncertain future, Bechtel continues to work on the job given.', '“We’re constantly looking at potential (fiscal) challenges based on priorities and other things that are going on within NASA,” said Michael Costas, general manager of Defense and Space Business with Bechtel, in November just after the election. “They’re having to work through whatever challenges they’re facing. But of course — new administration — there’s a lot of folks looking at efficiencies.”', 'Congress is the ultimate decider on what gets funded for NASA, though, and without a viable replacement for SLS in place yet, it may be that ML-2 still has a future.', 'NASA had continued to tout its progress on regular updates through the first several months of the year. The latest addition was added in May with only two more to come. Bechtel’s goal was to hand over to NASA the completed tower no later than November 2026, which would give NASA enough time to prep it for what was supposed to be an Artemis IV flight by September 2028.', 'NASA included the previous added sections in a list of achievement in Trump’s first 100 days in office, stating “the agency’s next-generation mobile launcher continues to take shape, with the sixth of 10 massive modules being installed. This structure will carry future Artemis rockets to the launch pad.”', 'That was before the proposed budget came out, though.', '“We must continue to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,” reads the budget proposal. “That means making strategic decisions — including scaling back or discontinuing ineffective efforts not aligned with our moon and Mars exploration priorities.”', 'The warnings from The Planetary Society, which have been echoed by many naysayers to Trump’s new direction, say the agency is choosing a ruinous path.', '“President Trump has stated he is ‘committed to ensuring that America continues to lead the way in fueling the pursuit of space discovery and exploration’,” the Society’s statement reads. “This budget does the exact opposite: laying waste to the nation’s ability to lead in scientific discovery, destroying the economic powerhouse that is NASA, and abandoning allies around the globe.”', '', '', 'MOST POPULAR', 'Osceola Sheriff Lopez charged with racketeering and suspended from office', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Shakira’s Orlando concert draws complaints about noise levels', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Acclaimed chef goes rogue, demolishes Orlando restaurant without permits', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Gators’ 7-foot-9 Olivier Rioux, the world’s tallest teenager, faces uphill climb', 'Tuesday, June 3', 'Person posed as ‘60 Minutes’ producer to hunt for info on secretive Florida land deal', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Winter Park leaders irate over Today Show snub', 'Tuesday, June 3', 'Osceola Sheriff Marcos Lopez’s arrest follows years of controversies', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Pictures: Shakira performs at Camping World Stadium in Orlando', 'Wednesday, June 4', 'Spanish River Grill is an immaculate resurrection | Review', 'Thursday, June 5', 'UPDATE: FAA cancels alert about late flight departures from Orlando International Airport', 'Saturday, May 24', 'Bianchi: Orlando Magic are responsible for Pacers-Thunder NBA Finals', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Florida schools face alarming rise in student absences since pandemic', 'Thursday, June 5', 'Orlando ends minority- and women-owned business program, citing Trump rules', 'Wednesday, June 4', 'As trial opens, Mike Lindell’s attorneys say he spread claims about Dominion official because he was ‘triggered’', 'Wednesday, June 4', 'Copyright © 2025 Orlando Sentinel', ""Hurry, this deal won't last!"", '']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUVjMDh5U2tGbFNraElhV2xHVFJERUF4aW5CU2dLTWdhcEE0aVBFUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

White House Budget Plan Would Devastate U.S. Space Science,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/proposed-federal-budget-would-devastate-u-s-space-science/,"['JUNE 4, 2025', '8 MIN READ', 'White House Budget Plan Would Devastate U.S. Space Science', 'Scientists are rallying to reverse ruinous proposed cuts to both NASA and the National Science Foundation', 'BY NADIA DRAKE EDITED BY LEE BILLINGS', 'Fog shrouds the iconic Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in this photograph from February 25, 2025.', 'Gregg Newton/AFP via Getty', 'Late last week the Trump Administration released its detailed budget request for fiscal year 2026 —a request that, if enacted, would be the equivalent of carpet-bombing the national scientific enterprise.', '“This is a profound, generational threat to scientific leadership in the United States,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a science advocacy group. “If implemented, it would fundamentally undermine and potentially devastate the most unique capabilities that the U.S. has built up over a half-century.”', 'The Trump administration’s proposal, which still needs to be approved by Congress, is sure to ignite fierce resistance from scientists and senators alike. Among other agencies, the budget deals staggering blows to NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which together fund the majority of U.S. research in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics and Earth science —all space-related sciences that have typically mustered hearty bipartisan support.', 'The NSF supports ground-based astronomy, including such facilities as the Nobel Prize–winning gravitational-wave detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), globe-spanning arrays of radio telescopes, and cutting-edge observatories that stretch from Hawaii to the South Pole. The agency faces a lethal 57 percent reduction to its $9-billion budget, with deep cuts to every program except those in President Trump’s priority areas, which include artificial intelligence and quantum information science. NASA, which funds space-based observatories, faces a 25 percent reduction, dropping the agency’s $24.9-billion budget to $18.8 billion. The proposal beefs up efforts to send humans to the moon and to Mars, but the agency’s Science Mission Directorate —home to Mars rovers, the Voyager interstellar probes, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Hubble Space Telescope, and much more —is looking at a nearly 50 percent reduction, with dozens of missions canceled, turned off or operating on a starvation diet.', '“It’s an end-game scenario for science at NASA,” says Joel Parriott, director of external affairs and public policy at the American Astronomical Society. “It’s not just the facilities. You’re punching a generation-size hole, maybe a multigenerational hole, in the scientific and technical workforce. You don’t just Cryovac these people and pull them out when the money comes back. People are going to move on.”', 'Adding to the chaos, on Saturday President Trump announced that billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman was no longer his pick for NASA administrator—just days before the Senate was set to confirm Isaacman’s nomination. Initial reports—which have now been disputed—explained the president’s decision as stemming from his discovery that Isaacman recently donated money to Democratic candidates. Regardless of the true reason, the decision leaves both NASA and the NSF, whose director abruptly resigned in April, with respective placeholder “acting” leaders at the top. That leadership vacuum significantly weakens the agencies’ ability to fight the proposed budget cuts and advocate for themselves. “What’s more inefficient than a rudderless agency without an empowered leadership?” Dreier asks.', 'MICHAEL L. WONG', 'LEONARD DAVID & LEE BILLINGS', 'LOUIS FRIEDMAN', 'NADIA DRAKE', 'During his second administration, President Trump has repeatedly celebrated U.S. leadership in space. When he nominated Isaacman last December, Trump noted “NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration” and looked to a future of “groundbreaking achievements in space science, technology and exploration.” More recently, while celebrating Hubble’s 35th anniversary in April, Trump called the telescope “a symbol of America’s unmatched exploratory might” and declared that NASA would “continue to lead the way in fueling the pursuit of space discovery and exploration.” The administration’s budgetary actions speak louder than Trump’s words, however. Instead of ushering in a new golden age of space exploration—or even setting up the U.S. to stay atop the podium—the president’s budget “narrows down what the cosmos is to moon and Mars and pretty much nothing else,” Dreier says. “And the cosmos is a lot bigger, and there’s a lot more to learn out there.”', 'Dreier notes that when corrected for inflation, the overall NASA budget would be the lowest it’s been since 1961. But in April of that year, the Soviet Union launched the first human into orbit, igniting a space race that swelled NASA’s budget and led to the Apollo program putting American astronauts on the moon. Today China’s rapid progress and enormous ambitions in space would make the moment ripe for a 21st-century version of this competition, with the U.S. generously funding its own efforts to maintain pole position. Instead the White House’s budget would do the exact opposite.', '“The seesaw is sort of unbalanced,” says Tony Beasley, director of the NSF-funded National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). “On the one side, we’re saying, ‘Well, China’s kicking our ass, and we need to do something about that.’ But then we’re not going to give any money to anything that might actually do that.”', 'How NASA will achieve a crewed return to the moon and send astronauts to Mars—goals that the agency now considers part of “winning the second space race”—while also maintaining its leadership in science is unclear.', '“This is Russ Vought’s budget,” Dreier says, referring to the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an unelected bureaucrat who has been notorious for his efforts to reshape the U.S. government by weaponizing federal funding. “This isn’t even Trump’s budget. Trump’s budget would be good for space. This one undermines the president’s own claims and ambitions when it comes to space.”', 'Rumors began swirling about the demise of NASA science in April, when a leaked OMB document described some of the proposed cuts and cancellations. Those included both the beleaguered, bloated Mars Sample Return (MSR) program and the on-time, on-budget Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the next astrophysics flagship mission.', '', '', 'The top-line numbers in the more fleshed-out proposal are consistent with that document, and MSR would still be canceled. But Roman would be granted a stay of execution: rather than being zeroed out, it would be put on life support.', '“It’s a reprieve from outright termination, but it’s still a cut for functionally no reason,” Dreier says. “In some ways, [the budget] is slightly better than I was expecting. But I had very low expectations.”', 'In the proposal, many of the deepest cuts would be made to NASA science, which would sink from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion. Earth science missions focused on carbon monitoring and climate change, as well as programs aimed at education and workforce diversity, would be effectively erased by the cuts. But a slew of high-profile planetary science projects would suffer, too, with cancellations proposed for two future Venus missions, the Juno mission that is currently surveilling Jupiter, the New Horizons mission that flew by Pluto and two Mars orbiters. (The Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan would survive, as would the flagship Europa Clipper spacecraft, which launched last October.) NASA’s international partnerships in planetary science fare poorly, too, as the budget rescinds the agency’s involvement with multiple European-led projects, including a Venus mission and Mars rover.', 'The proposal is even worse for NASA astrophysics—the study of our cosmic home—which “really takes it to the chin,” Dreier says, with a roughly $1-billion drop to just $523 million. In the president’s proposal, only three big astrophysics missions would survive: the soon-to-launch Roman and the already-operational Hubble and JWST. The rest of NASA’s active astrophysics missions, which include the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), would be severely pared back or zeroed out. Additionally, the budget would nix NASA’s contributions to large European missions, such as a future space-based gravitational-wave observatory.', '“This is the most powerful fleet of missions in the history of the study of astrophysics from space,” says John O’Meara, chief scientist at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and co-chair of a recent senior review panel that evaluated NASA’s astrophysics missions. The report found that each reviewed mission “continues to be capable of producing important, impactful science.” This fleet, O’Meara adds, is more than the sum of its parts, with much of its power emerging from synergies among multiple telescopes that study the cosmos in many different types, or wavelengths, of light.', 'By hollowing out NASA’s science to ruthlessly focus on crewed missions, the White House budget might be charitably viewed as seeking to rekindle a heroic age of spaceflight—with China’s burgeoning space program as the new archrival. But even for these supposedly high-priority initiatives, the proposed funding levels appear too anemic and meager to give the U.S. any competitive edge. For example, the budget directs about $1 billion to new technology investments to support crewed Mars missions while conservative estimates have projected that such voyages would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more.', '“It cedes U.S. leadership in space science at a time when other nations, particularly China, are increasing their ambitions,” Dreier says. “It completely flies in the face of the president’s own stated goals for American leadership in space.”', 'The NSF’s situation, which one senior space scientist predicted would be “diabolical” when the NASA numbers leaked back in April, is also unsurprisingly dire. Unlike NASA, which is focused on space science and exploration, the NSF’s programs span the sweep of scientific disciplines, meaning that even small, isolated cuts—let alone the enormous ones that the budget has proposed—can have shockingly large effects on certain research domains.', '“Across the different parts of the NSF, the programs that are upvoted are the president’s strategic initiatives, but then everything else gets hit,” Beasley says.', 'Several large-scale NSF-funded projects would escape more or less intact. Among these are the panoramic Vera C. Rubin Observatory, scheduled to unveil its first science images later this month, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope. The budget also moves the Giant Magellan Telescope, which would boast starlight-gathering mirrors totaling more than 25 meters across, into a final design phase. All three of those facilities take advantage of Chile’s pristine dark skies. Other large NSF-funded projects that would survive include the proposed Next Generation Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico and several facilities at the South Pole, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.', 'If this budget is enacted, however, NSF officials anticipate only funding a measly 7 percent of research proposals overall rather than 25 percent; the number of graduate research fellowships awarded would be cleaved in half, and postdoctoral fellowships in the physical sciences would drop to zero. NRAO’s Green Bank Observatory — home to the largest steerable single-dish radio telescope on the planet — would likely shut down. So would other, smaller observatories in Arizona and Chile. The Thirty Meter Telescope, a humongous, perennially embattled project with no clear site selection, would be canceled. And the budget proposes closing one of the two gravitational-wave detectors used by the LIGO collaboration—whose observations of colliding black holes earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics—even though both detectors need to be online for LIGO’s experiment to work. Even factoring in other operational detectors, such as Virgo in Europe and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) in Japan, shutting down half of LIGO would leave a gaping blind spot in humanity’s gravitational-wave view of the heavens.', '“The consequences of this budget are that key scientific priorities, on the ground and in space, will take at least a decade longer—or not be realized at all,” O’Meara says. “The universe is telling its story at all wavelengths. It doesn’t care what you build, but if you want to hear that story, you must build many things.”', 'Dreier, Parriott and others are anticipating fierce battles on Capitol Hill. And already both Democratic and Republican legislators have issued statement signaling that they won’t support the budget request as is. “This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, ranking member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, in a recent statement. And in an earlier statement, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the powerful Senate Committee on Appropriations, cautioned that “the President’s Budget Request is simply one step in the annual budget process.”', 'The Trump administration has “thrown a huge punch here, and there will be a certain back-reaction, and we’ll end up in the middle somewhere,” Beasley says. “The mistake you can make right now is to assume that this represents finalized decisions and the future—because it doesn’t.”', 'NADIA DRAKE is a freelance science journalist who specializes in covering space science and space exploration.
