Steichen was noncommittal when asked whether Richardson would be ready for the start of training camp, which begins on July 22."", 'The news comes on the heels of Richardson approaching trainers after a practice last week and reporting soreness in the shoulder, Steichen said. After examination, doctors determined he suffered an aggravation of his AC joint, which Richardson sprained five weeks into his rookie season.', ""That previous injury required season-ending surgery. This one won't, Steichen said, but Richardson needs rest."", '""Not going to put a timetable for training camp on it, but when he does come back, we\'ll ease him into throwing and then we\'ll go from there,"" Steichen said.', 'Asked whether this kind of soreness is normal for players who previously sustained AC joint injuries, Steichen said he was not sure.', 'The news is a major setback for Richardson amid the quarterback battle with Jones. Richardson has already missed 17 total games in two seasons because of injuries, including 12 games missed because of the previous shoulder sprain. The Colts also benched Richardson for two games last season, briefly opting for veteran Joe Flacco.', 'The No. 4 pick in 2023, Richardson arrived with hopes of becoming the franchise quarterback in Indianapolis. But his injury travails have dealt a blow to those hopes.', 'Prior to this injury, Steichen said, Richardson ""was in a really good spot. He was throwing it good. Meetings were good. He was making really good progress.""', 'This injury, considering its timing, is among Richardson\'s biggest blows. The Colts, dissatisfied with Richardson\'s progress in Year 2 last season, set out to add ""competition"" to their quarterback unit and did so to the tune of a $14 million one-year contract for Jones.', ""The former Giants first-round choice who flamed out in New York accepted the Colts' offer with the mindset that he would have a chance to resurrect his career. Richardson's injury gives him an opening to do just that."", '""Daniel will get a lot of reps and then we\'ll see how it plays out,"" Steichen said.', ""Richardson's struggles on the field weren't the only factor that prompted them to address the quarterback position. Ultimately, the track record of injuries with Richardson came into play, too."", '""We can\'t beat our head against the wall,"" general manager Chris Ballard said in January. ""We\'ve got to have competition at the position just for the fact that competition makes everybody better, and then two, he\'s not proven he can play 17 games."" That statement seems prescient now with Richardson sidelined again. After injuring his shoulder in 2023, Richardson last season confronted an oblique/hip injury that sidelined him for two games and back spasms/soreness that kept him out for the final two games.', ""In Richardson's absence, sixth-round pick Riley Leonard will occupy the No. 2 spot.

Colts QB Anthony Richardson To Miss Time With Shoulder Injury,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2025/06/colts-qb-anthony-richardson-to-miss-time-with-shoulder-injury,"['Anthony Richardson has encountered another injury setback. The third-year Colts quarterback is dealing with a shoulder injury which will keep him out of minicamp, head coach Shane Steichen announced on Thursday.', 'The affected shoulder – which recently experienced soreness – is the same one in which Richardson suffered an AC joint sprain in 2023, as noted by ESPN’s Stephen Holder. That injury ended his rookie campaign after just four games and cost the former No. 4 pick development time. The same is now true in this case.', 'No surgery will be required this time around, but Richardson will nevertheless miss valuable spring reps during his bid to earn the starting gig. Steichen added (via James Boyd of The Athletic) no timeline is in place for a return but noted he hopes Richardson will be back at some point during during training camp. The latter entered this offseason in an open competition with Daniel Jones for the QB1 spot based on his missed time and underwhelming play when healthy. This latest setback will give Jones additional first-team reps.', 'After his Giants tenure came to an end, Jones finished the 2024 season in Minnesota. Just like Sam Darnold, though, he departed in free agency. The 28-year-old took a contract with a base value of $14MM this spring and in doing so became an option to see considerable time atop the Colts’ depth chart this season. Steichen has previously made it clear Richardson and Jones would evenly split first-team reps during OTAs, a plan indicating the extent to which the position was unsettled based on how things transpired last year.', 'Richardson avoided a major injury during his second season in Indianapolis, but he still missed some time for that reason. The Florida product also found himself benched in favor of Joe Flacco at one point while posting a completion percentage of just 47.7% and a negative touchdown-to-interception ratio (8:12) on the year. Major improvement will be needed if Richardson is to solidify himself as an NFL starter.', 'Next spring, the Colts will need to decide on Richardson’s 2027 fifth-year option. That call will depend in large part on how he performs this season, something which will of course require winning the competition with Jones.

The Colts have one more season to evaluate Richardson, but his poor play, combined with health concerns, doesn’t paint a positive picture.”', 'While the news isn’t ideal for Richardson, Jones is presented with a massive opportunity.', 'Like Richardson, Jones was selected high in the NFL Draft and expected to be the future face of the franchise for his team.

Yet somehow, online sportsbooks still favor Richardson to be under center come Week 1.', 'The former Florida Gator carries -156 odds to win the starting job, while Daniel Jones—who inked a one-year, $14 million deal this offseason—sits at +118. Those odds imply Richardson has about a 61% chance of starting despite missing just 19 of a possible 34 games through two seasons. I’m not buying it.', 'Richardson’s -156 price makes him a modest favorite, with Jones offering real value at plus money.

The 22-year-old has started just 15 games across two seasons, completing a league-worst 47.7% of his passes in 2024. When your franchise quarterback has more games missed (19) than started (15), that’s not a development curve—it’s a flatline.', 'Even when healthy, Richardson’s performance hasn’t justified the faith. His 67.8 passer rating ranks among the league’s worst, and he’s thrown 13 interceptions against just 11 touchdowns. Yes, his rushing ability is elite—635 yards and 10 touchdowns showcase his dual-threat potential—but you can’t run your way to a playoff berth when you’re watching from the trainer’s table.', 'While Richardson rehabs another injury, Jones is seizing his opportunity. The former Giants quarterback has taken all first-team reps since Richardson went down, and early reports from OTAs paint an intriguing picture.

Jones brings 71 career starts worth of experience, and while his Giants tenure ended poorly, he’s proven he can at least stay upright—something Richardson hasn’t managed.', 'NFL insider Albert Breer predicted before the injury that Jones would win the job, citing Richardson’s inconsistency and durability concerns. With Richardson now sidelined indefinitely and Jones building chemistry with the first-team offense, that prediction looks increasingly prophetic.', 'General Manager Chris Ballard hasn’t minced words about the AR situation, stating bluntly: “He hasn’t demonstrated that he can play a full 17-game season.” That’s not exactly a ringing endorsement for your supposed franchise quarterback.', 'Chris Ballard in January regarding Anthony Richardson: ‘The No. 1 thing we have to figure out, and what Anthony’s got to work through, is staying healthy. And that to me is probably the biggest question right now, because now we’re going on two seasons in a row where he’s dealt…', 'The Colts brought in Jones for exactly this scenario. They needed competition and insurance, and Richardson’s latest injury validates both needs.

You don’t pay a veteran $14 million to hold a clipboard.', 'Richardson’s immense physical tools—6-foot-4, 244 pounds, 4.43 speed—will always tantalize. But potential doesn’t win games in September.

Steichen added (via James Boyd of The Athletic) no timeline is in place for a return but noted he hopes Richardson will be back at some point during during training camp. ', 'Richardson entered this offseason in an open competition with Daniel Jones for the QB1 spot based on his missed time and underwhelming play when healthy. This latest setback will give Jones additional first-team reps.', 'After his Giants tenure came to an end, Jones finished the 2024 season in Minnesota. Just like Sam Darnold, though, he departed in free agency. The 28-year-old took a contract with a base value of $14M this spring and in doing so became an option to see considerable time atop the Colts’ depth chart this season. Steichen has previously made it clear Richardson and Jones would evenly split first-team reps during OTAs, a plan indicating the extent to which the position was unsettled based on how things transpired last year.', 'Richardson avoided a major injury during his second season in Indianapolis, but still missed some time for that reason. The Florida product also found himself benched in favor of Joe Flacco at one point while posting a completion percentage of just 47.7 percent and a negative touchdown-to-interception ratio (8:12) on the year. Major improvement will be needed if Richardson is to solidify himself as an NFL starter.', 'Next spring, the Colts will need to decide on Richardson’s 2027 fifth-year option. That call will depend in large part on how he performs this season, something which will of course require winning the competition with Jones. For the time being, though, only the latter will be available for on-field work.', 'This article first appeared on Pro Football Rumors and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', 'As the Green Bay Packers bolstered the wide receiving corps during the 2025 NFL Draft, one veteran has seen his name frequently linked in potential trade conversations as training camp approaches.

Over at Packers Wire, analyst Mark Oldacres suggests that Green Bay should let Doubs cash in elsewhere. “Doubs should have a strong market in free agency a year from now,” Odacres writes for PackersWire. “And be paid well, but barring a significant improvement in a host of areas this season, taking him from a slightly above average to difference-making wideout, it will not be Green Bay writing the check.” It remains to be seen just how robust Doubs’ market develops to be, but barring a breakout as a truly game-changing No. 1, Green Bay might be better off handing the keys to the passing game off to the other young receivers after this season, if not before.

Ehlers’ speed brings fans to their feet and he’s an easy sell in the community.” Ehlers would need a big bag from the Blackhawks Ehlers has been with the Winnipeg Jets since they drafted him with the No. 9 pick in the 2014 draft.

That might change now with the addition of running back Elijah Mitchell, who has speed to burn, but is coming off an injury that kept him out of the 2024 season. For NFL Network\'s Steve Wyche, he thinks that Mitchell, if he can stay healthy, could be the difference-maker in the backfield the Chiefs have been looking for. ""The Chiefs\' running game has to step up,"" Wyche said. ""I think a player to look out for is Elijah Mitchell, who has not been able to stay healthy, but he was killing it before the first knee issue.

Mitchell, in his rookie season, showed what kind of talent he has, rushing for 963 yards and five touchdowns for the San Francisco 49ers in 2021, but injuries have since derailed his progress and that led to Christian McCaffrey signing with the NFC West team with just 16 games played in the last two seasons for Mitchell. Now a Chief, he will hopefully bring a speed element to the run game, and that is something the offense has missed in the past couple of seasons. Hunt and Pacheco are servicable backs, but they don\'t possess the home-run threat that Mitchell does. Of course, as Wyche mentioned, health will play a major role in how effective Mitchell can be.

Richardson missed a game as a rookie due to a concussion, 12 due to surgery on his sprained AC joint, two due to an injured hip/oblique suffered against Pittsburgh and two at the end of the season due to back spasms stemming from a disc issue discovered on MRI.', 'Faced with that history, the Colts decided to go out and get a veteran with starter capability, a player that ultimately turned out to be Jones.', ""“The No. 1 thing we have to figure out, and what Anthony's got to work through, is staying healthy,” Colts general manager Chris Ballard said in his postseason press conference. “We've got to have competition at the position – just for one for the fact that competition makes everybody better.

Obviously, a smart guy, understands it, he’s picked it up,” Steichen said. “He’s a veteran guy that comes in early, late nights, does all the right things.” ', 'The injury is a blow for Richardson, who has responded in the past to questions about the criticism that he’s injury-prone by saying he understands it, and he’d hoped to prove people wrong.', 'A lingering shoulder injury is a difficult blow for the young quarterback.', 'The early returns on Richardson this offseason had been good.', '“Obviously, it’s frustrating, but he is in good spirits,” Steichen said. “He was in a really good spot. He was throwing good. The meetings were good.”', 'What Richardson’s injury means for the quarterback competition is impossible to tell right now, particularly considering that there is no timetable for Richardson’s return from a shoulder injury that no one saw coming. ', 'Because of the uncertain nature of Richardson’s injury, it’s tough to predict when he’ll be back to compete for the starting job.', '“Daniel will get a lot of reps,” Steichen said. “And then we’ll see how it plays out.”', 'The scapula (shoulder blade) and the humerus come together to form the glenohumeral joint, the main joint in the shoulder.

The AC joint sits atop the shoulder, while the collarbone connects the sternum (breastbone) to the shoulder blade.', '""Relatively speaking it\'s a pretty small joint,"" Dr. Christopher Moriarty, a Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine physician at IU Health told IndyStar when Richardson had surgery on the joint in 2023.

"", ""In Indianapolis, Jones is essentially replacing Joe Flacco, who previously served as Richardson's backup. Given Richardson's injury history, it's necessary the Colts have a proven veteran who can step in and perform at a moment's notice. While he isn't the best of quarterbacks, Jones -- who made 71 starts during his time with the Giants -- certainly fits the bill. "", 'While Jones will get some unexpected first-team reps, Richardson will now have to overcome yet another obstacle. As a rookie, Richardson suffered a season-ending injury after just four games.
