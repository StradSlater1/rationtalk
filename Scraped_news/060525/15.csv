Trump compares Ukraine-Russia war to kids’ brawl: ‘Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight’,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/politics/ukraine-war-trump-kids-fighting,"['', 'For months, President Donald Trump has voiced varying degrees of optimism that he – and only he – will be able to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.', 'But halting progress, ever-more deadly drone attacks and unmoving negotiating positions seem to have taken their toll. On Thursday, Trump used a striking analogy to concede the warfare was nowhere near over, and that he did not, at that moment, feel it was best to intervene.', '“Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump said in the Oval Office, with his German counterpart Friedrich Merz looking on silently. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”', 'In this comparison — which Trump said he delivered directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 75-minute phone call Wednesday — Trump is acting not as the man in the middle but as a referee letting an altercation play out.', '“You see it in hockey. You see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds,” he said. “Let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”', 'It was a frank admission for Trump, the verbal equivalent of throwing up his hands at a problem he cannot solve.', 'Trump’s evolution — from vowing to end the war in a day to comparing the warring sides to children allowed to spar on a hockey rink — has been, for him, a frustrating one.', 'He has wavered on applying new sanctions on Moscow, wary of pushing Putin further away from the negotiating table. He also hasn’t approved new military aid for Ukraine, hopeful a swift end to the war means it won’t be required.', 'A timeline he offered last week for determining Putin’s seriousness in wanting an end to the war — “two weeks” — hasn’t been repeated since, and there seems to be little expectation he’ll take action when the self-imposed deadline arrives on Monday.', 'His laissez-faire position will be tested over the coming weeks, as Trump embarks on a series of global summits where he’ll come under pressure from US allies to adopt a firmer position.', 'He’s likely to encounter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in person at the Group of 7 summit in Canada, scheduled for mid-June. For the past three years, the conference has acted as something of a steering committee for western support to Ukraine, with Zelensky attending as a guest to underscore his requests for aid.', 'This year’s conference promises to be very different. Trump’s aides say there is little expectation he’ll agree to new sanctions on Russia while in Alberta.', 'A NATO summit a few weeks later will similarly put American support for Ukraine under a spotlight. NATO’s leaders have designed the summit to be brief and heavily focused on increasing member state defense spending, hoping to avoid any open hostility from a US president who has questioned the alliance’s importance.', 'Still, for all the preparations hosts of both summits have made to appease Trump, his current position on Ukraine could pose existential questions for leaders eager to encourage Trump’s attempts at negotiating a ceasefire.', 'The stance Trump espoused Thursday may not be his final one. A few moments after his “fight for a while” comparison, he insisted he was “for stopping killing.”', 'Yet his comments nonetheless reflected a new degree of resignation for his prospects of ending the war, and detachment from the conflict he once vowed to resolve.', '“They fight, fight, fight,” he said. “Sometimes you let them fight for a little while.”', 'The dispassionate tone was similar to how he described his call with Putin on Wednesday, when he related — without comment — the Russian leader’s determination that he would have to retaliate to Ukraine’s audacious drone attack over the weekend.', 'Trump did not say whether he cautioned Putin or encouraged him to calibrate his response. Nor did he offer any particular view of Ukraine’s actions.', 'His visitor in the Oval Office on Thursday sought to encourage a more confident outlook. Merz cited the anniversary this week of the D-Day invasion of Normandy — a turning point in World War II — as an example of “when the Americans once ended a war in Europe.”', 'Trump was not, at first, moved by the comparison.', '“That was not a pleasant day for you,” he joked, referring to the defeat of the German Nazis.', 'Merz kept going, however, stressing the American intervention amounted to “the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship” that has parallels to today’s war.', '“We know what we owe you,” he said. “But this is the reason why I’m saying that America is, again, in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war.”', 'Trump did not seem particularly moved. He stopped short of promising new sanctions on Russia — something European leaders have been pressing him on for weeks — saying only he would know when the time is right, but that it hadn’t arrived yet.', '“It’s in my brain, the deadline,” he said.', 'He even suggested he’d be willing to apply new punitive measures on Ukraine if the war doesn’t end.', '“We’ll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both countries to be honest,” Trump said. “You know, it takes two to tango.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”', 'In this comparison — which Trump said he delivered directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 75-minute phone call Wednesday — Trump is acting not as the man in the middle but as a referee letting an altercation play out.', '“You see it in hockey.

Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”', 'In this comparison — which Trump said he delivered directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 75-minute phone call Wednesday — Trump is acting not as the man in the middle but as a referee letting an altercation play out.', '“You see it in hockey. You see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds,” he said. “Let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”', 'It was a frank admission for Trump, the verbal equivalent of throwing up his hands at a problem he cannot solve.', 'Trump’s evolution — from vowing to end the war in a day to comparing the warring sides to children allowed to spar on a hockey rink — has been, for him, a frustrating one.', 'He has wavered on applying new sanctions on Moscow, wary of pushing Putin further away from the negotiating table. He also hasn’t approved new military aid for Ukraine, hopeful a swift end to the war means it won’t be required.', 'A timeline he offered last week for determining Putin’s seriousness in wanting an end to the war — “two weeks” — hasn’t been repeated since, and there seems to be little expectation he’ll take action when the self-imposed deadline arrives on Monday.', 'His laissez-faire position will be tested over the coming weeks, as Trump embarks on a series of global summits where he’ll come under pressure from US allies to adopt a firmer position.', 'He’s likely to encounter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in person at the Group of 7 summit in Canada, scheduled for mid-June. For the past three years, the conference has acted as something of a steering committee for western support to Ukraine, with Zelensky attending as a guest to underscore his requests for aid.', 'This year’s conference promises to be very different. Trump’s aides say there is little expectation he’ll agree to new sanctions on Russia while in Alberta.', 'A NATO summit a few weeks later will similarly put American support for Ukraine under a spotlight. NATO’s leaders have designed the summit to be brief and heavily focused on increasing member state defense spending, hoping to avoid any open hostility from a US president who has questioned the alliance’s importance.', 'Still, for all the preparations hosts of both summits have made to appease Trump, his current position on Ukraine could pose existential questions for leaders eager to encourage Trump’s attempts at negotiating a ceasefire.', 'The stance Trump espoused Thursday may not be his final one. A few moments after his “fight for a while” comparison, he insisted he was “for stopping killing.”', 'Yet his comments nonetheless reflected a new degree of resignation for his prospects of ending the war, and detachment from the conflict he once vowed to resolve.', '“They fight, fight, fight,” he said. “Sometimes you let them fight for a little while.”', 'The dispassionate tone was similar to how he described his call with Putin on Wednesday, when he related — without comment — the Russian leader’s determination that he would have to retaliate to Ukraine’s audacious drone attack over the weekend.', 'Trump did not say whether he cautioned Putin or encouraged him to calibrate his response. Nor did he offer any particular view of Ukraine’s actions.', 'His visitor in the Oval Office on Thursday sought to encourage a more confident outlook. Merz cited the anniversary this week of the D-Day invasion of Normandy — a turning point in World War II — as an example of “when the Americans once ended a war in Europe.”', 'Trump was not, at first, moved by the comparison.', '“That was not a pleasant day for you,” he joked, referring to the defeat of the German Nazis.', 'Merz kept going, however, stressing the American intervention amounted to “the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship” that has parallels to today’s war.', '“We know what we owe you,” he said. “But this is the reason why I’m saying that America is, again, in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war.”', 'Trump did not seem particularly moved. He stopped short of promising new sanctions on Russia — something European leaders have been pressing him on for weeks — saying only he would know when the time is right, but that it hadn’t arrived yet.', '“It’s in my brain, the deadline,” he said.', 'He even suggested he’d be willing to apply new punitive measures on Ukraine if the war doesn’t end.', '“We’ll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both countries to be honest,” Trump said. “You know, it takes two to tango.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com', 'Advertisement']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhZVVZUTkZacFgwcG1RVE5FVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhSkk2SnhFUXM=-w280-h168-p-df

In Trump’s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defence, and Trump is now demanding at least 5 percent from allies.', 'The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5 percent mark.', 'During their meeting on Thursday, Trump described Merz as a good representative of Germany and also “difficult,” which he suggested was a compliment.

At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.', 'Germany exported $160bn worth of goods to the US last year, according to the Census Bureau.

On social media, Trump called it a good conversation, “but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.”', 'In subsequent remarks to journalists Thursday at the White House, Trump said he told Putin not to retaliate but also compared the war to squabbling children who have to just be left to fight.', '“Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled, sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while,” Trump said, adding that he’d related that analogy to Putin in the call.', 'In addition to expressing understanding over Russia’s need to respond to Sunday’s Ukrainian drone attack against the Russian bomber fleet, Trump on Wednesday also thanked Putin for assistance in the thorny negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.', '“What happened was an obvious trade-off, Ukraine for Iran,” said Abbas Galyamov, a political consultant and former Putin speechwriter. “It looks like Putin phoned in with this proposal, essentially saying - don’t prevent me from dealing with Ukraine, and I will help you deal with Iran.”', 'On Thursday, Iranian state media reported that a trip by Putin to Tehran is in the works. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in a briefing Thursday, emphasized Russia’s “close partnership” with Iran and its readiness “to take advantage of that to facilitate and contribute” to U.S. negotiations.', 'The Trump-Putin phone call is the latest round in the struggle between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for Trump’s backing in the war as each strives to portray the other as the obstacle to peace.', 'Trump is “leaning toward” faulting Zelensky for escalating the conflict, argued pro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov.', '“That is why he called Putin - to say that the U.S. is not responsible for Ukraine’s vile, treacherous strike on Russia’s nuclear potential,” Markov wrote in a Telegram post. “And he agreed with Putin that Zelensky is escalating the conflict.” It is not clear who initiated the phone call.', 'The Kremlin on Thursday went a step further, signaling it was expecting a strong condemnation from the White House following the airfield attack as well as a number of bridge bombings.', '“We would have preferred to hear a strong condemnation, at the very least, of this terrorist act,” Peskov said.', 'Zelensky on Thursday said that after Russia has dropped thousands of bombs on Ukraine just this year, a military operation that lowered its rival’s striking capabilities was warranted, and he called for increased Western pressure on Moscow.', '“Unfortunately, Putin feels impunity. Even after all of Russia’s horrific attacks, he is reportedly preparing yet more so-called ‘responses.’ … With every new strike, with every delay of diplomacy, Russia is giving the finger to the entire world - to all those who still hesitate to increase pressure on it,” he said in a post on social media.', 'The form and scale that Russia’s potential retaliation could take are unclear - there is no comparable fleet of bombers in Ukraine to target, and Putin still needs to balance the response against the risk of alienating Trump.', '“If it will require the massive destruction of infrastructure, civilian infrastructure incurring many civilian losses, I wouldn’t say that it would help the talks and make President Trump happy,” said Alexander Baunov, senior associate at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “And this is the dilemma for Putin: It needs to be something effective and efficient but something that will not make him lose Trump forever.”', 'Baunov said Russia was careful to maintain Trump’s goodwill, while attempting to deflect blame onto Ukraine for the failure of the peace process.', '“They need President Trump, and to not lose President Trump, so they have to at least pretend they are engaged in conversation with Ukraine,” he said. “And that’s basically the stage where we are now.

But Trump made no mention of this after Wednesday’s phone call, appearing to accept that Putin would retaliate over this week’s drone attacks.', 'In a sign of Putin’s success at rebuilding diplomatic ties without any compromises on Russia’s war on Ukraine, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday that the two presidents had agreed on their readiness “to remain in constant contact with each other.”', 'While many of Ukraine’s backers around the world have applauded Kyiv’s attack on the Russian bomber fleet, many of Trump’s associates have criticized the operation and Zelensky for raising global tensions and threatening to provoke a nuclear war - something Russian officials have threatened many times in the course of the conflict.', '“I’m telling you, the risk levels are going way up - I mean, what happened this weekend,” retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, told Fox News on Tuesday. “People have to understand in the national security space: When you attack an opponent’s part of their national survival system, which is their triad, the nuclear triad, that means your risk level goes up because you don’t know what the other side is going to do.”', 'MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk warned on X, where he has about 5 million followers, that the most important event in the world right now is the war between Ukraine and Russia. “Most people aren’t paying attention, but we’re closer to nuclear war than we’ve been since this began in 2022.”', 'As someone who grew up during the Cold War, Trump (as well as his predecessor, former president Joe Biden) is particularly sensitive to the threat of a nuclear war, said Fiona Hill, who served as a Russia adviser during Trump’s first term, and this has made him reluctant to push back against Putin and his actions in Ukraine.', '“That’s why we’re in such a mess in Ukraine,” she said. “It’s very clear to Putin that he’s got everybody where he wants them, that he can play at will with the nuclear saber-rattling, because, at the back of Trump’s and Biden’s minds, there are still all these searing images from the Cold War era.”', 'Local journalism is essential.', ""Give directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

This meeting between the two was a huge success from the German perspective.', 'She said that Merz was able to flatter Trump by saying, “You are the most important person to end that terrible war [between Russia and Ukraine],” while also emphasising that Russia was the aggressor, not Ukraine.', 'The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is meeting the US president, Donald Trump, at the White House this evening for talks on Ukraine and Russia, and trade, among other things (17:41).', 'Trump said the pair was “unhappy” about the state of war, but insisted they would be successful in stopping the bloodshed (17:50).', 'The US president also suggested he would be happy to keep US troops in Germany (18:00) amid concerns about the on-going review of the US force posture (12:25).', 'The chancellor gifted Trump a fascimile of the birth certificate of Trump’s German grandfather, Friedrich Trump (18:35).', 'Earlier, Nato defence ministers agreed a “historic” change to capability targets amid a broader push to increase defence spending to 5% at this month’s summit in The Hague (17:19).', 'Earlier in the day, the Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said the new target would apply to all countries, including the US and the UK.', 'On Monday, Rutte will meet the UK prime minister Keir Starmer.', 'And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa in London, but Léonie Chao-Fong in Washington will guide you through the next developments.', 'If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com.', 'I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa.', 'And if you are wondering what is this framed document that Merz gave Trump as a gift, here’s a handy video from the chancellor himself explaining the story behind it.', 'It’s a facsimile of the birth certificate of Trump’s German grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who later changed his name to Frederick.', 'He says:', 'This will be my gift for American President Donald Trump and my visit to Washington, when I meet him for the first time. This is his grandfather’s birth certificate with an English translation. It was created by the Federal Foreign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany. The calligraphy is truly sensational.', 'And that’s it, they wrap up here.', 'Merz emerges unscathed, as he chose not to challenge Trump on some of his comments about the alleged disparity in the value of support from the US and Europe, but focused on their similarities and shared views instead.', 'But he conveys a strong, positive message on Ukraine, and got Trump to say he is “with Ukraine” and suggest he would be prepared to keep US troops in Germany.', 'Good enough, surely?', 'Merz finally gets a say too, as he says “we both agree on this war and how terrible this war is, and we are both looking for ways to stop it very soon.”', 'He says Trump is “the key person in the world who can really [stop it] by putting pressure on Russia,” and adds he will want to discuss this in more detail in bilateral talks.', 'He adds:', '“And I think … we have the duty to do something on that now, to stop it after three and a half years, which is really terrible.', 'Look at the kids, the kids which were kidnapped from Ukraine to Russia.

We just signed a big deal on rare earth with Ukraine, and…', 'You know what I’m for, stopping killing, really, that’s what I’m for again, a war that would have never started, should have never started.”', 'He talks about the support for Ukraine from the US and Europe offering potentially questionable calculations, but then goes back to the main point:', '“It’s a little bit money, but not the money. The big thing, the big thing is the death,” he says.', 'Continuing his comments, Trump mentions the Nord Stream 2 pipeline again and that he stopped it from operating.', '“It was a mistake,” Merz admits.', 'Trump acknowledges his comments and continues:', '“I used to go with Angela, I’d say, Well, wait a minute, we’re spending all this money to defend you against Russia, and then you’re giving Russia billions of dollars a month. What kind of a deal is that?”', 'Trump gets asked about if he would put more sanctions on Russia.', 'He says he will be “very, very tough” if it becomes clear that the war will not end soon.', 'But, in a comment likely to alarm Ukraine’s allies, he adds: “it could be on both countries, to be honest, it takes two to tango.”', 'He then says:', '“We’re going to be very tough, whether it’s Russia or anybody else, we’re going to be very tough, that’s a bloodbath that’s going on over there.”', 'He then uses a hockey analogy, of allowing the two sides to have a go at each other for a bit, before intervening.', 'But he says it’s all difficult.', '“There’s some bad blood between the two. I have to deal with it and the chancellor has to deal with it, it’s incredible [as] … there’s a great hatred between those two, between those two men, but between the warring parties, great hatred.”', 'He suggests Putin told him “we have no choice but to attack” in response to the latest Ukrainian attacks inside Russia.', '“And it’s probably not going to be pretty. I don’t like it. I said, Don’t do it. You shouldn’t do it. You should stop it. But again, there’s a lot of hatred.”', 'Trump also gets asked about Russian president Vladimir Putin.', 'He repeats his usual lines and claims that it would have never happened with him in the White House and so on.', 'But he doesn’t answer the question directly.', '“I’ve been saying that for a long time, the amount of death in that war is far greater than the news has been reporting. Or that, frankly, that either side has been reported. It’s a very sad thing,” he says.', 'Merz is much more focused as he says he is here “to talk with you later on how we could contribute” to ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine.', 'He says it’s the D-Day anniversary tomorrow – which Trump jokes was “not a pleasant day for you” – and he wants to talk with Trump about “what we can do jointly, and we are ready to do what we can.”', '“You know that we gave support to Ukraine and that we are looking for more pressure on Russia, the European Union did, and we should talk about that,” he says.', '“We will talk about it,” Trump replies.', 'Trump gets asked about Elon Musk’s criticism of his financial plans and he goes into a level of detail that probably goes beyond the Europe blog.', 'But what is interesting is that he says “Elon and I had a great relationship,” and adds “I don’t know if we will any more”.', 'He later says:', '“I’ll tell you, he’s not the first, people leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile.', 'I don’t know what it is, it’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it, but we have it with others too.', 'They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour is gone, the whole world is different, and they become hostile.
