The new readings were a record high and represented an increase of more than 3 ppm over last year.', 'The measurements indicate that countries are not doing enough to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reverse the steady buildup of C02, which climate scientists point to as the main culprit for global warming.', '“Another year, another record,” Ralph Keeling, a professor of climate sciences, marine chemistry and geochemistry at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in a statement. “It’s sad.”', 'Carbon dioxide, like other greenhouse gases, traps heat from the sun and can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. As such, high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere contribute to higher global temperatures and other negative consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels, melting polar ice, and more frequent and severe extreme weather events.', 'Atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen sharply since preindustrial times, owing mostly to human activities that pump greenhouse gases into the air.', 'Decades ago, crossing the 400 ppm threshold was unthinkable. That meant that for every 1 million molecules of gas in the atmosphere, more than 400 were carbon dioxide. The planet hit that grim milestone in 2013. And now, scientists have warned that levels of CO2 could reach 500 ppm within 30 years.', 'But human society is already in uncharted territory.', 'The last time the planet had such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was likely more than 30 million years ago, Keeling said, long before humans roamed Earth and during a time when the climate was vastly different.', 'He said it’s alarming not only how high CO2 levels have climbed, but also how quickly.', '“It’s changing so fast,” he told NBC News. “If humans had evolved in such a high-CO2 world, there would probably be places where we wouldn’t be living now.

"Carbon dioxide levels usually peak in May, but 2025's reading was like no other",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/05/mauna-loa-sets-new-record-for-carbon-dioxide/84040707007/,"[""An observatory high on Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano that measures carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reported its highest ever seasonal peak concentration of the greenhouse gas."", ""For the first time, the May average exceeded 430 parts per million, reported scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mauna Loa Observatory and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego."", '""Another year, another record,"" said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Program. ""It\'s sad.""', ""Carbon dioxide and other gases function like a blanket around the Earth, holding in heat and warming the atmosphere above the surface, scientists say. A broad consensus of international scientists say the rise in carbon dioxide concentrations is responsible for the globe's changing climate, helping to make natural weather events such as rainfall, drought and heat waves more extreme."", ""While carbon dioxide is naturally present in Earth's atmosphere, scientists say the problem is the rate at which it's increasing, driven by fossil fuel emissions. Geoscientists at the University of Utah, who participated in a 2023 study with more than 90 scientists in 16 countries, previously stated that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are higher than they've been in human history and highest in at least 14 million years."", ""Last year, the average level of carbon dioxide rose faster over the previous year than at any other point since the recordings began, Scripps reported in January. The average readings for the 12 months was 3.58 parts per million higher than the previous year's average, breaking a record set in 2016."", 'In both years, the climate pattern El Niño played a role, Keeling said in January. ""Although this El Niño event ended early in 2024, it is often the case that El Niño events are associated with higher than normal CO2 growth extending into the northern hemisphere summer following the El Niño event.""', 'The historic 67-year-old laboratory at elevation 11,141 feet is the global benchmark location for monitoring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Its measurements represent the average state of the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere.', ""Scripps scientist Charles David Keeling, Ralph Keeling's father, began monitoring CO2 concentrations there in 1958. He was the first to realize CO2 levels peak in May in the northern hemisphere, fall during the growing season and rise again after plants die in the fall, according to Scripps. The fluctuations were presented in a record that became known as the Keeling Curve, which demonstrated carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were increasing every year."", 'NOAA initiated daily measurements at Mauna Loa in 1974 and has maintained a complementary, independent measurement record ever since. A global network that includes NOAA and Scripps, forms a dataset used by climate scientists internationally. Eruptions at Mauna Loa caused an interruption to power at the observatory in 2022, NOAA said. Scientists established a temporary measurement site at Mauna Kea nearby.', 'Dinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, covers climate change, wildlife and the environment.
