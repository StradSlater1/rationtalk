Inflation data threatened by government hiring freeze as tariffs loom,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2025/06/04/inflation-data-threatened-by-government-hiring-freeze-as-tariffs-loom/84036286007/,"[""Washington — The Labor Department has cut back on the inflation data it collects because of the Trump administration's government hiring freeze, raising concerns among economists about the quality of the inflation figures just as they are being closely watched for the impact of tariffs."", ""The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the monthly consumer price index, the most closely watched inflation measure, said Wednesday that it is “reducing sample in areas across the country” and added that it stopped collecting price data entirely in April in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Provo, Utah. It also said it has stopped collecting data this month in Buffalo, New York."", 'In an email that the BLS sent to economists, viewed by The Associated Press, the agency said that it “temporarily reduced the number of outlets and quotes it attempted to collect due to a staffing shortage” in April. The reduced data collection “will be kept in place until the hiring freeze is lifted.”', ""The cutbacks have intensified worries among economists that government spending cuts could degrade the federal government's ability to compile key economic data on employment, prices, and the broader economy. The BLS also said last month that it will no longer collect wholesale prices in about 350 categories for its Producer Price Index, a measure of price changes before they reach the consumer."", 'The inflation data plays a huge role in the U.S. economy. It is used to calculate the annual cost of living adjustments for tens of millions of Social Security recipients and it helps determine the interest rate paid in about $2 trillion of inflation-adjusted Treasury bonds. Many private-sector wages are also influenced by the CPI.', ""The reduced data collection is also occurring at a time of heightened uncertainty about the economy and the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs on hiring, growth and inflation. Officials at the Federal Reserve, for example, have repeatedly cited the cloudy outlook as a key reason they are no longer cutting their short-term interest rate, after reducing it three times late last year."", '“The PPI is cutting hundreds of indexes from production, and the CPI is now being constructed with less data,” Omair Sharif, chief economist at the consulting firm Inflation Insights, said in an email. “That alone is worrying given that we’re heading into the teeth of the tariff impact on prices.”', 'The BLS said that the cutbacks “have minimal impact” on the overall inflation data, but “they may increase the volatility” of the reported prices of specific items.', 'President Donald Trump froze federal hiring on his first day in office and extended the freeze in April until late July, suggesting future inflation reports will also involve less data collection. The White House could continue to extend the freeze indefinitely.', ""Sharif and other economists said the BLS hasn't released enough information to judge how big an impact the cutbacks are having on the inflation figures. But it could make them less slighly less accurate."", '“When you have a reduced sample size, it introduces more error into the estimate,” Sharif said. ""It creates the potential for the indexes to be more volatile and potentially less accurate.”', 'Earlier this year, the Trump administration disbanded several advisory committees that worked with BLS and other statistical agencies on fine-tuning their data-gathering.', 'Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, an investment bank, said the cutbacks likely had little impact on April\'s inflation figures. But ""if these types of cuts continue, they will degrade the reliability and efficacy of these statistical agencies,” he said.', 'The BLS compiles the monthly inflation reports by sending hundreds of workers into retail stores across the country to gather thousands of prices. About 60% of the prices used in the inflation data are compiled in person, while about 35% are gathered online and 5% over the phone.', ""Erica Groshen, a former commissioner of BLS, said that the agency has lost about 15% of its personnel since the beginning of the year, a sharp decline that likely reflects falling morale stemming from the attacks on government workers by Elon Musk's DOGE."", 'She said the drop in staff and potential for cuts in funding could also threaten lesser-known economic measures, such as an index that tracks import prices, as well as a report that measures job openings.', '“These are things that are not required (by law) but that are still very important to figure out what is going on,” Groshen said.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNXhjSGd4Um14MFJXbGxORTFKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQlFLQ1hvQ201YUFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

DOGE layoffs may have compromised the accuracy of government data,https://www.wral.com/story/doge-layoffs-may-have-compromised-the-accuracy-of-government-data/22039699/,"['(CNN) — The Consumer Price Index is more than just the most widely used inflation gauge and a measurement of Americans’ purchasing power.', 'Its robust data plays a key role in the US economy’s trajectory as well as monthly mortgage payments, Social Security checks, financial aid packages, business contracts, pay negotiations and curiosity salves for those who wonder what Kevin McCallister’s $19.83 grocery bill in “Home Alone” might cost today.', 'However, this gold standard piece of economic data has become a little less precise recently: The Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a notice on Wednesday stating that it stopped collecting data in three not-so-small cities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Buffalo, New York; and Provo, Utah) and increased “imputations” for certain items (a statistical technique that, when boiled down to very rough terms, essentially means more educated guesses).', 'The BLS notice states that the collection reductions “may increase the volatility of subnational or item-specific indexes” and are expected to have “minimal impact” on the overall index.', 'The Trump administration’s drastic cutbacks of government spending and the federal workforce have economists, researchers and statisticians sounding the alarm that the reliability and accuracy of economic data could become a casualty to those efforts.', '“The BLS’s need to infer more data points due to personnel and funding constraints is deeply concerning,” Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon’s chief economist, told CNN. “It raises legitimate questions about the reliability and timeliness of critical economic indicators.”', 'While statistical agencies often have protocols to maintain data quality during short disruptions, any sustained underfunding could “degrade the foundational data used for policymaking, market analysis and business planning,” he said.', 'BLS officials did not respond to questions posed by CNN and instead referred to the notice and related links on response rates and collections.', 'In the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, federal websites went dark and data disappeared as the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency set its sights on streamlining the government. That further heightened concerns as to whether the nation’s statistical infrastructure — which already has been in a precarious state in terms of funding, response rates and public trust — was at risk of crumbling.', 'Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget proposal includes an 8% reduction to BLS funding and staffing.', 'To what extent the CPI reductions are a sign of what’s to come remains to be seen; but the immediate impacts to inflation readings could be minimal for now, Alan Detmeister, a UBS senior economist who previously helmed the Fed’s Wages and Prices section, told CNN.', '“Their statement said that this will have little impact on the aggregate index, which is quite possible; but up to this point, they have not put out enough information that we would need to really evaluate — we don’t have any numbers on how [the reductions] are distributed, except for a few locations they stopped sampling,” he said.', 'The reductions likely won’t affect the long-run increases or decreases in inflation and, because of that, don’t seem to be politically motivated, he added.', '“What it does mean is that since they’re using fewer observations, there’s likely to be a little bit more noise in the monthly CPI data,” he said. “How much more noise? We don’t really know.”', 'Detmeister flagged the imputations anomalies in a note to clients earlier this week, noting that the share of imputed prices jumped 15% in March (the highest level since the pandemic rattled the economy in April 2020), and then surged even more in April, by 29%.', 'It’s not yet clear whether the CPI has become less reliable, but what is certain is that any weirdness or hitches in the data is happening at a bad time, he added.', '“Any time you’re using fewer observations, it creates a bit of an issue; the real concern is if these types of surprises continue to occur, and the number of observations continues to be reduced,” he said. “And if you see it occurring in other statistics as well, it just makes our view of what’s going on in the economy slightly worse.”', 'He added: “We’re really scrutinizing all the price data every month to see if there are impacts of the tariffs coming through; so, the timing isn’t ideal.”', 'The CPI for May will be released Wednesday next week.', 'The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

We don’t really know.”', 'Detmeister flagged the imputations anomalies in a note to clients earlier this week, noting that the share of imputed prices jumped 15% in March (the highest level since the pandemic rattled the economy in April 2020), and then surged even more in April, by 29%.', 'It’s not yet clear whether the CPI has become less reliable, but what is certain is that any weirdness or hitches in the data is happening at a bad time, he added.', '“Any time you’re using fewer observations, it creates a bit of an issue; the real concern is if these types of surprises continue to occur, and the number of observations continues to be reduced,” he said. “And if you see it occurring in other statistics as well, it just makes our view of what’s going on in the economy slightly worse.”', 'He added: “We’re really scrutinizing all the price data every month to see if there are impacts of the tariffs coming through; so, the timing isn’t ideal.”', 'The CPI for May will be released Wednesday next week.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Experts look to the BLS\'s massive surveys as the ""gold standard"" of economic data.\n\nIn addition to cutting back on its consumer price survey, the BLS said it will stop monitoring wholesale prices in 34 different industries including cookware, greeting cards, toys, and power tools.\n5\nThat data is used to create the Producer Price Index.\n\nThe cutbacks raised alarms about the reliability of BLS data, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\n“The reduced number of price quotes will likely reduce the reliability of the CPI as a measure of inflation and increase the volatility in the monthly CPI prints,” UBS economists led by Alan Detmeister said in a report obtained by Bloomberg.\n6', ""The cutback on data collection is just the latest red flag about the accuracy of the Trump administration's economic statistics."", 'Jed Kolko, former Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at the Department of Commerce, wrote a blog post in April detailing several major threats to public trust in government statistics, including budget cuts.\n7\nIn March, Trump disbanded two outside advisory panels that helped the BLS produce its statistics. Kolko noted that expertise will be hard to replace.\n\nA survey of academic economists in March by the Chicago Booth School of Business showed that experts overwhelmingly believed the staff cutbacks at statistical agencies and the elimination of the advisory panels would lead to a ""substantial reduction in the reliability of government economic data.""\n8', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNXhjSGd4Um14MFJXbGxORTFKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQlFLQ1hvQ201YUFJ=-w280-h168-p-df
