I’m sure we’ll have more battles in the future.”', 'The first Frenchwoman to reach the last four at Roland Garros since Marion Bartoli in 2011, Boisson bowed out when she sent yet another forehand long.

Coco Gauff and Madison Keys’ French Open quarterfinal and a clash of tennis superpowers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6399712/2025/06/03/coco-gauff-madison-keys-french-open-tennis-quarterfinal/,"['Tennis', 'French Open', 'LIVE', '', '14', 'ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — There’s a moment in nearly every long tennis point involving Coco Gauff these days, when an opponent believes she’s won it with a ball that lands an inch or two from the line.', 'Then it comes back, and then then so does another, and maybe one or two more. When it finally ends, often in Gauff stealing it, there’s a marked contrast between the two players. One player is doubled over, gasping for air. The other is strolling into position for the next point, mouth closed, air calmly streaming in and out of her nose.', '', 'Guess who is who?', 'Of all of Gauff’s superpowers, put those lungs at the top.', 'There’s a moment in nearly every Madison Keys match these days — especially during a Grand Slam — when her back is against a wall and she really needs the point. One player is shifting around, wincing with stress, while the other one looks like it’s 1-1 in the first set.', 'Keys used to look like the apocalypse had arrived in those moments. In the past year, she has acquired a preternatural calm, a deep breath into her lungs in moments of strife. She displayed it over and over again on her march to the Australian Open title in January. She displayed it again against fellow American Sofia Kenin in the third round at Roland Garros, saving three match points late in the third set.', 'The points that used to crush her have become the ones when she turns to her husband and coach, Bjorn Fratangelo, sitting courtside in her box, with an “I’ve got this” look – because she genuinely does.', 'Wednesday’s French Open quarterfinal duel between Gauff and Keys exists on multiple levels. They got tagged with the “next Serena Williams” label at a young age, roughly eight years apart. Keys, 30, has watched Gauff, 21, evolve and endure an uber-version of what she went through during her late teens, when everyone told her the sport was hers for the taking.', 'The apparent generational battle manifests as one of styles on the tennis court. Keys was reared in an era when the game was about digging in and swinging hard. Gauff grew up as the focus shifted toward movement and court coverage, the ability to find winners or reverse the momentum of points from every spot on the court.', 'And then there’s the clash of the powers that stands out more than any other. Gauff’s engine against Keys’ ability to lower her blood pressure when everyone else’s spikes. This match may turn on those more than anything else.', '', 'Gauff said over the weekend that there’s only one player on the tour who can stay with her in a long match: Zheng Qinwen, who matched her shot for shot for over three hours in their past two matches, both of which Gauff won.', 'In Gauff’s third-round match at Roland Garros, Marie Bouzková of the Czech Republic tried to beat her by becoming a human backboard, stretching points with deep looping shots in a bid to induce errors from an impatient Gauff. For a while, it worked, but Bouzková lacked the weapons to win her service games after playing lungbusters for most of Gauff’s. The American ended up with a 20-12 edge on points that lasted longer than eight shots.', 'There was one especially long point, early in the second set, that had both players scrambling up and back and all across the baseline. Bouzková won it. Gauff didn’t care because she looked over and saw Bouzková bent over, using her racket to keep her from tumbling onto the clay.', '“I was aware that my heartbeat wasn’t really high at all,” Gauff said with a grin. “It felt fine.”', 'Gauff knew that was one way that Bouzková likes to play. With a set in that bank, Gauff was pretty sure there was no way she could manage that against her for the better part of two more sets.', 'The advantage becomes especially stark when she plays against teenagers who, regardless of their talent, don’t have the miles in their legs or their lungs. In the second round, the shoulders of Tereza Valentová, 18 and a rising Czech talent, were heaving between points after 45 minutes. The same happened to Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old Canadian making waves this spring, who took the first set off Gauff at the Italian Open, then quickly realized her gas gauge had tipped to empty.', 'None of this surprises Chris Eubanks very much. Eubanks, the ATP Tour player, Gauff’s surrogate big brother, and an analyst for TNT at this tournament, has known Gauff since their early childhood days in Atlanta, before Gauff moved to Florida. When Gauff was 15, Eubanks, who is eight years older than her, started spending as many as 10 days training with Gauff during the off-season. By then, she was already doing full-on adult-style track and gym workouts.', '', 'Training with Gauff in the heat of South Florida is not for the faint of heart, he said. Every drill becomes a contest, even when they’re just going cross-court or down the line at each other. He’s not sure just what it takes to make her crack.', '“There’s never been a day on which we’ve been practicing together and you felt like, she’s she’s giving out,” he said during an interview this week in Paris. “She’s always been ultra competitive. I’ve never personally seen her seen gas on a court in a match or in practice.”', 'What might set Gauff apart, Eubanks said, is that plenty of players view fitness work as homework, something they have to do but would happily skip if that were an option for those seeking to reach the top. Gauff actually likes it. And it’s led to success in those long matches, which makes her confidence grow when the clock ticks.', '“If you’ve never done it, it can be a bit taxing,” Eubanks said.', '“The more reps you get, I think the more confidence you get.”', 'Keys has been getting those reps. She spent the fall and winter working with Reshard Langford, a former NFL defensive back who is now one of the top strength and conditioning coaches at the U.S. Tennis Association. That’s given her the belief that she can stay with Gauff physically, but she knows the red clay of Roland Garros only gives Gauff an even greater edge on the points when she can use her legs and her lungs.', '“You’re going to have to win the point multiple times before it’s actually over,” Keys said. “Then you also have the threat against her of, if at any point you lose control of the point, she’s going to be the aggressor.”', 'Keys does not want to let that happen. She’s worked on getting comfortable with all the difficult moments that tennis requires, with accepting that she needs to take her chances and go for her shots and not worry so much about the outcome. Safe and tentative is not where she wants to be, regardless of what the scoreboard says. Never did she display that more than in the Australian Open final against Aryna Sabalenka, serving at 5-5, 30-30 in the deciding set.', '', 'Sabalenka sent a return screeching back at Keys’ shins. She bent her knees, let the ball come across her body and redirected it into the postage stamp in the opposite corner of the court. The kind of shot that looks good on television, but whose brilliance comes with the fact it is a shot that only a tennis player with diamond conviction can produce.', 'What a cracker from @Madison_Keys!', 'Maybe the best shot of her career, at maybe the biggest moment of her career!', 'She’s on the cusp!@wwos • @espn • @eurosport • @wowowtennis • #AusOpen • #AO2025 pic.twitter.com/ZuxfiiVz5X', '— #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 25, 2025', '', '“In the past, I would maybe get a little bit more tentative and kind of play a little bit more defensively in big moments, and now trying to make the push to continue to play the way that I was playing in order to get up in scores,” Keys said in Paris.', 'What becomes apparent when listening to Keys is how little of this is the product of changes in technique and equipment, even though she has tweaked her serve and changed her racket. The bigger changes can happen on the off days, when she takes in the sights in world capitals instead of hibernating in her hotel room. Losing is fine, as long as she loses on her terms.', 'That goes a long way when she’s facing match point or when she’s holding one, or when she just wants to show Fratangelo who’s the boss. For instance, he wants her hitting her backhand crosscourt about 99 percent of the time.', '“I typically go for something ridiculous down the line and I make it, and I look at him and give him a funny face,” Keys said.', 'There will likely be a moment Wednesday when Keys will look across the net and think of the version of Coco Gauff she met roughly a decade ago, when Gauff was a hyper-talented tween headed for big things amid big hype.', '“It’s been really fun kind of getting to see her do so well at such a young age,” Keys said of Gauff.', 'She’s older now.

Coco Gauff vs. Lois Boisson: Will France’s Cinderella actually reach the final?,https://www.tennis.com/news/articles/coco-gauff-vs-lois-boisson-semifinal-preview-roland-garros-french-open,"['The 361st-ranked Frenchwoman has lit up Roland Garros with one of—if not the most—improbable runs in Grand Slam history.', 'Published Jun 05, 2025', '“Pristine” is not a word that comes to mind to describe Wednesday’s women’s quarterfinals at Roland Garros.', 'In a nervy, topsy-turvy, largely rhythmless opener, Coco Gauff and Madison Keys combined for 40 winners and 101 errors, and broke each other 14 times. Both players were tense and prone to mistakes early; playing a countrywoman in a Grand Slam quarterfinal will do that to you. But only one of them, Gauff, managed to cut those errors out as the match progressed. By the third set, she’d returned to the lockdown mode that has served her so well at this tournament in recent years.', '“I’m very happy with how I managed to fight today,” a relieved Gauff said after her . “It was a tough match. Madison is a tough opponent, but glad to be in the semis.”', ""“I wasn’t feeling the ball obviously to start the match,” she said, but a change in racquet tension helped. “Usually if you're playing too passive, in the end the more aggressive player is going to win. I was just trying to be aggressive.”"", 'The second quarterfinal, between Biosson and Mirra Andreeva, was of somewhat higher quality, through both made more mistakes than winners. The ugliness came in the second set, when the 18-year-old Andreeva, regularly booed by the capacity French crowd, came unglued, smashed her leg with her racquet, bashed a ball high into the seats and watched a 3-0 lead turn into a .', '“I didn’t really pay attention to the [booing], but obviously with nerves and with pressure, it became a little harder,” Andreeva said. “But, anyway, I think that I can learn from this, so nothing more I can say for now.”', 'Andreeva credited Boisson’s good play for her win, which is only appropriate. The 22-year-old, 361st-ranked Frenchwoman has lit up the tournament with one of—if not the most—improbable runs in Grand Slam history. By now, though, after seeing the way she has gone about beating two Top Tenners, Jessica Pegula and Andreeva, back to back, the element of shock over’s Boisson’s performances should be waning. Her game—physical, spin-based, forehand-centric—is the embodiment of how tennis has been played in this decade. She can hit her serve with flat pace or a high-bouncing kick. She sets up points to feature her forehand, and she loves to take it inside-in for blistering winners. She adds slice and finesse with her backhand.', '“She has a great serve,” Andreeva said. “She has a great forehand. I think she hit a lot of winners with her forehand today. I think that she also played solid and consistent throughout the whole match.”', 'Boisson vs. Gauff is a great unknown. It’s the rare Slam semifinal in which the two players have never met—by contrast, the other semi will give us the 13th encounter between Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.', 'We can start by saying that Gauff is ranked No. 2 and Boisson, as we all know by now, is 361st. But that 361 is somewhat misleading; she has climbed as high as 152, and surely would have moved higher if not for an injury. Still, Gauff has a huge edge in experience, especially on big stages.', 'Game-wise, the match will likely be defined by high, heavy topspin exchanges that may go on at length. Boisson hits with a lot of topspin on both sides, and Gauff does with her forehand. One dynamic to watch: When Boisson runs around and cracks her forehand inside-out, can Gauff counter that with her flat two-handed backhand down the line? Andreeva had some success doing that on Wednesday, but not enough.', 'A post shared by Tennis (@tennischannel)', 'Both women can and will disrupt the points with drop shots, but both are quick enough to track them down. Look for a fair amount of cat and mouse after they’ve drawn each other up to the net. Boisson’s serve looks more reliable. Avoiding a cascade of double faults will be crucial for Gauff, but if her serve is clicking, it will make her more confident all around.', 'As for the Lois-loving fans, Gauff says she’s ready for whatever they bring, citing other matches in other countries where she has handled a hostile audience.', '“I think there are two ways I have done it in the past,” Gauff says. “Either, A, just pretend they’re cheering for you, and B, just using it and not letting that get to you.”', 'Gauff and Boisson seem close to evenly matched at the moment. Coco has been here before, and she would likely beat the Frenchwoman in any other place, at any other time. But this week. Boisson is a home-town Cinderella. The old tennis axiom is that a hot-hitting player will eventually show you why they’re ranked where they’re ranked. I waited for that to happen to Boisson against Pegula, and again versus Andreeva. It hasn’t happened yet. Winner: Boisson']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWFNM0IxVmpFek55MXVMWFp4VFJEMEFoalJBeWdLTWdZbEJvcnREUXM=-w280-h168-p-df

"", 'While Boisson was able to take out a highly ranked American in No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the fourth round, she could not replicate that performance against the top-ranked American woman Thursday, as Coco Gauff steamrolled Boisson (6-1, 6-2) to punch her ticket to the French Open final against Aryna Sabalenka. ', 'Gauff took control from the start, ensuring the French crowd never got a chance to get involved and try to lift their countrywoman to another upset. Gauff rolled through the first set, simply looking a class above Boisson, who never seemed to get settled on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Thursday night. The onslaught continued in the second set, as Gauff did not let her foot off the gas and continued to apply constant pressure to Boisson, controlling points and never letting Boisson get on the front foot -- and on the rare point Gauff was the one scrambling, she found all the right answers. ', 'The final point of the match was a fitting example of what we saw all evening, as Gauff leaned on the Boisson backhand when possible, forced her into the corners and asked her to execute near-perfect shots to win points. ', ""Gauff looked extremely focused from the start and executed her game plan to near perfection, leaning on Boisson's inexperience and allowing Boisson to make mistakes -- 33 unforced errors to just 15 from Gauff. With that performance, Gauff cruises into the final where she will face the world No. 1 in Sabalenka, who had to work much harder in a three-set battle with four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek in her semifinal match. "", 'Gauff and Sabalenka have split their career matches 5-5, with both having one win over the other in major championships.

Coco Gauff puts an end to a French fairytale as she advances to Roland Garros final against Aryna Sabalenka,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/sport/french-open-womens-semifinals-tennis-spt-intl,"['', 'The final in the women’s tournament at Roland Garros is set after Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff put an end to two historic runs in Paris, with the American Gauff breaking French hearts in the process.', 'Gauff’s dominant 6-1, 6-2 win over France’s Lois Boisson halted the story of this major after Boisson’s underdog run inspired the host nation. Boisson entered the tournament as the No. 361 player in the world and upset two top 10 players on her way to the tournament’s semifinals.', 'But the fatigue of the Cinderella story appeared to catch up with Boisson, a day after a dramatic win over No. 6 Mirra Andreeva. The Frenchwoman received a massive ovation from the crowd at Court Philippe-Chartier as she walked off the famous clay.', 'Gauff simply blew past Boisson, breaking her serve in the opening game and claiming the first four games of the match before Boisson could halt her momentum briefly to get on the board. It took 38 minutes for Gauff to put Boisson away in the first set and the match in total lasted a little more than an hour.', 'Boisson and Gauff both held serve to start the second set, but Gauff got a break point in the fourth game and there was no coming back for the French underdog after that.', 'Boisson made 33 unforced errors to Gauff’s 15 and could not muster the same kind of groundswell of emotion that carried her past Andreeva and world No. 3 Jessica Pegula in her previous two matches.', 'Gauff is now heading into her third singles grand slam final and looking for her second grand slam championship. She’s appeared in the final at Roland Garros once before, losing in 2022 to Iga Świątek.', 'Świątek lost earlier in the day to Sabalenka, the first time in four years that the Polish defending champion has tasted defeat at Roland Garros.', 'The three-time defending champion was dethroned by Sabalenka in the semifinals of this year’s French Open, with the world No. 1 triumphing 7-6(1), 4-6, 6-0 in a high-quality display.', 'For Sabalenka, it sets up her first final at the clay court grand slam and second final against Gauff – the American beat the Belarusian in the 2023 US Open final.', 'RELATED VIDEO\nDo nasal strips enhance athletic performance? We asked an expert in sports medicine', 'Świątek was on a 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros prior to Thursday’s semifinal – the second-longest in women’s singles in the Open Era – but faced a tall task against a high-flying Sabalenka.', 'In an absorbing contest, both women played aggressive tennis in a bid to gain the upper hand in a close first set. Sabalenka looked to have done that when she broke Świątek twice for a 4-1 lead, only for the Polish star to fight back. A double fault from Sabalenka made it 4-4 before Świątek took a lead for the first time in the match the following game.', 'There were eight breaks of serve over the course of the one-hour, 10-minute opening set, which was ultimately decided in a tie-break dominated by Sabalenka.', 'The second set continued in a similar vein to the first, with three breaks of serve in the first three games. Świątek got what proved to be the crucial edge for a 3-1 lead and was able to see out the set from there to become the first person to take a set off Sabalenka this tournament.', 'In the deciding set, however, the Belarusian took the brakes off, dismantling Świątek’s challenge in just 22 minutes without making an unforced error. By the end of the match, she had hit 29 winners – the same number as Świątek – while converting an impressive eight of her 10 break points.', 'With the victory, Sabalenka has now won all of her past five grand slam semifinals and will look to win a fourth major title in Saturday’s showpiece.', '“It was tricky conditions, I have to say,” she told TNT Sports after the match. “It was tricky to serve with the roof closed. It was different compared to the previous matches, but I’m glad that both of us adjusted pretty well and we were able to show such a high-level match.”', 'Sabalenka, who was defeated by American Madison Keys in the Australian Open final in January, has been the standout player in women’s tennis in 2025 with three titles to her name.', 'The year so far has been less kind to Świątek. Having spent so long at the top of the rankings throughout her career, she has dropped to No. 5 in the world and is yet to win a title this season.', 'And after winning four of the past five titles at Roland Garros, the tournament will crown a first-time French Open women’s champion on Saturday.', 'This story has been updated.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Coco Gauff ends Lois Boisson’s fairytale run as she advances to final against Aryna Sabalenka,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2025/06/05/womens-french-open-semi-final-sabalenka-swiatek-gauff/,"['The top two seeds in the women’s draw will face each other in Saturday’s French Open final after Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff wrapped up their respective semi-finals in contrasting style.', 'For Sabalenka, there was a tricky three-set tussle with defending champion Iga Swiatek, who came into yesterday’s match on a streak of 26 straight wins here that dated back to 2021.', 'Gauff, meanwhile, was largely untroubled, as she disposed of Lois Boisson, the surprise package of this tournament, by a dominant scoreline: 6-1, 6-2.', 'Coco comes out flying! 🇺🇸\n\nGauff takes the opening set in her Roland-Garros semi-final against Boisson in Paris 🔥#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/a1a9a12uco', 'The final is already shaping up as a contest between the most powerful attacking force in the tournament and the most resilient defender: the classic unstoppable force/immovable object combination.', 'Sabalenka is the woman with dynamite in her racket. It was always going to take something special to end Swiatek’s three-year reign at Roland Garros, and she came near to tennis perfection as she rounded off a 7-6, 4-6, 6-0 victory in style.', 'It’s virtually unheard of for a tennis professional to make zero unforced errors in a set. If it happens, it usually stems from ultra-safe shot selection. But Sabalanka managed to do exactly that while blasting winners in all directions.', '“I think I lost my intensity a bit, and she came on pretty strongly in third set,” said Swiatek, who seemed surprisingly philosophical for a woman whose greatest stronghold had just been breached. “I didn’t react to that well and just couldn’t push back.', '“She played like she didn’t doubt. She just went for it, and that’s what I mean about intensity.”', 'The final two points of this match were both service returns that flew for clean winners, one off each wing. Swiatek simply had to shake hands and walk off in the knowledge that she had been outclassed.', 'After the match, Sabalenka admitted that her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek on the WTA Tour had helped her predict what was coming next.', '“We played a lot of matches, and I kind of knew what she would try to do against me,” said Sabalenka, who has narrowed the head-to-head gap to 5-8 in Swiatek’s favour. “I have to say that in the third set I saw where she was going [with the serve].”', 'Sabalenka has always been capable of spectacular strokeplay, but the big shift over the last season or two has been the way she has cleaned up her game. She no longer gives away cheap points, and even when Swiatek was on top during the second set, there were no freebies on offer.', 'Refocusing before the decider, Sabalenka came out and landed 80 per cent of her first serves, before backing up her delivery with devastating power and poise off the ground. Even when it came to the touch game, she was clearly superior, and the sheer quality of her performance surely bodes well for the final.', 'Yet if anyone can stop Sabalenka in this form, it is Gauff. Both players will have vivid memories of the previous major final that they contested, which came at the 2023 US Open. In that one, Gauff’s fleet-footed movement eventually drove Sabalenka to distraction, to the point where she started missing even the simpler putaways.', 'Gauff never had to go into the trenches on Thursday, however, thanks to a much friendlier draw than the one Sabalenka had faced. World No 361 Lois Boisson is arguably the most unheralded player ever to reach a major semi-final, and while she played respectably enough, she was a little out of her depth.', 'By contrast with her erratic performance against compatriot Madison Keys in the quarter-finals, Gauff kept the ball under close control and worked Boisson all over the court. It probably helped that Boisson favours a high, spin-heavy ball that gives Gauff time to make her long forehand swing. In the final, Sabalenka will look to rush her with a much faster and flatter trajectory.', 'There was no tension in Gauff’s racket arm, so we didn’t see the crabby forehand errors that she tends to cough up under pressure. But will she be able to stay so calm on Saturday?', '“My first final here I was super nervous and wrote myself off before the match even happened,” said Gauff, who lost to Swiatek in 2022. “Now I’ve won a grand slam so I’m much more confident.”', 'It will be the first women’s final between the top two seeds at this event since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova in straight sets. And with the men’s semi-finals due to come on Friday, many suspect that we might see the same pattern play out again.', 'Coco Gauff powers past Boisson to reach her second Roland-Garros final 🏆#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/Na5SigMR19', 'World number two Coco Gauff speaking on court after sealing victory: ', 'It’s always the plan to try to start strong, but I knew it was important today.', 'Lois [Boisson] is obviously an incredible player. In this tournament, she has definitely proven she’s one of the best players in the world, especially on clay. I’m sure we will have many battles in the future, hopefully here.', 'I know you guys wanted her to win, but I wanted to win as well. But congratulations to her for an incredible tournament. Today just happened to be my day.', 'On dealing with the atmosphere on Court Phillipe-Chatrier: ', 'This is my first time playing a French player here in this tournament, that I can remember. How I managed it? I mean I was mentally prepared before the match. I knew during the match it was going to be 99 per cent for her but I just tried to block it out.', 'Actually, when you guys were chanting her name I was saying my name to myself – just to kind of psych myself up. You have to do that.', 'I know you guys would usually root for me if I wasn’t playing someone French, So I love you guys too.', 'It is such a physical and mental battle for Boisson right now – can she produce one last bit of magic for the crowd?', 'Frenchwoman edges 15-0 with a peach of the winner down the line. However, her next shot is wild and well wide.', 'Suddenly, for the first time this week Boisson’s forehand is looking vulnerable and she pings into the net. Then,the errors flow from here and Boisson’s backhand is wild and hands over two match points.', 'Gauff books her place in her second French Open final as Boisson’s forehand goes out. Gauff will now face Sabalenka for the title on Saturday.', 'The end is nigh. Rudimentary service hold to love from Gauff, cranking up the heat and enticing three errors on the forehand side. ', 'Boisson again tries to curtail points with aggressive attempted winners but cannot nail them and when drawn into a long rally she eventually cracks and overstretches a couple of times and Gauff breaks to love. ', 'You can’t question Boisson’s spirit as she keeps trading blows and breaks her opponent’s serve for the first time, exploiting errors and a double fault to take it to 30. ', 'I’m afraid those unforced errors are now mounting. Chris Evert says it’s because she’s trying not to get into rallies with Gauff because of her defensive skill so is going for winners and not nailing them. But at love-30 down she wins a 15-stroke rally with a fine top-spun forehand winner. ', 'Gauff nets her return to make it 30-all but then ends a longish rally with the deftest of running drop-shots to earn a break point. And she takes it at the first opportunity when an understandably knackered-looking Boisson, given the 10 days she’s had, loops a backhand too long.  ', 'Amazingly acrobatic rally for 23 shots ends with Gauff’s forehand winner to take a 15-love lead. Guts and running power from Gauff end an 11-shot rally in her favour and she moves ahead on a Gauff unforced error on her backhands side. ', 'The low balls on her sliced backhand earn Boisson a break point but then she hooks her return into the net to make it deuce. Gauff takes advantage by virtue of her opponent’s 19th unforced error and seals the hold by pushing Boisson deep and eliciting a 20th on her forehand side. ', ' ', 'Boisson races to 40-love by exploring a range of serves, one down the T, one wide, a lovely vollyed winner and a backhand error from Gauff. The American’s forehand error earns Boisson a hold to love!', 'There’s no shame in Lois Boisson. Her rise after her cruciate ligament surgery has been remarkable but Gauff has superior experience and a well-honed game. Boisson has a fine all-round game and has already climbed more than 300 places in the rankings but Gauff has too much nous and power so far and holds to 15.', 'Gauff nails a forehand, driving off the front foot to go to love-15 at the end of a long, attractive rally. Boisson fights back to win a pair of points until Gauff isolates her in her forehand corner then carves a crosscourt-volley winner to make it 30-all.', 'Set point comes after Boisson’s backhand drifts out and Gauff wraps up the first set on the wildcard’s forehand error.', 'Coco comes out flying! 🇺🇸\n\nGauff takes the opening set in her Roland-Garros semi-final against Boisson in Paris 🔥#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/a1a9a12uco', 'Gauff’s first serve accuracy is down to 33 per cent but it makes no difference. Boisson manages to get to both corners in scrambled defence but Gauff still holds to 30 when Boisson pulls a backhand wide and disappointment is written all across her face. ', 'As Chris Evert notes, Boisson has switched to trying to shorten the points and it pays off when she gets to 30-15 and even when engaged in a longer rally her sliced backhand serves her well and she earns two game points to get on the board. Boisson cannot convert the first – her backhand sails too long – but she nails the second when Gauff pings her return of serve into the net. ', 'Now Gauff goes on the offensive and although Boisson digs into good defence, force of stroke wins the day. But at 15-all Boisson gets a glimmer of hope with a backhand and then Gauff double-faults. ', 'Boisson has two break points. She leaves her return short on the first of them and Gauff flays a winner at the net. And then she loses the second of them with an attempted drop shot that she leaves her side of the net. Deuce. ', 'A gorgeous backhand crosscourt winner, upping the pace, earns her a third break point after manipulating Gauff from corner to corner. But an attempted lob seems to come off the frame and flies out to take them back to deuce. ', 'A risky crosscourt dropshot comes off for Boisson to return it to deuce having lost the previous point on an error. But then she misses a winner down the line at the net by half an inch. The crowd boos as Gauff signals it out. Advantage Gauff. And the Amrican makes it 4-0 when Boisson nets a backhand. Closest game, if that’s any succour, though. ', ' ', 'Fast footwork from Boisson after a forceful forehand takes her to the net to slap a volley winner to go 15-love ahead, Gauff’s solid defence earns the next three points, waiting for mistakes. Two break points.', 'And just like the first semi, the higher ranked players starts with a double break.', 'Raw power from Gauff on her backhand side, absolutely drilled up the line takes her to 30-15 and she comes to the net after pushing Boisson very deep to cushion a volley winner and move to 40-15. ', 'Gauff closes out the hold with a loose forehand from a high-kicking ball pushed into the corner. ', 'The crowd, almost all of the 15,000, are in Boisson’s corner who betrays no nerves as she plays the most gorgeous dropshot winner with backspin to make it 30-all in start defined by longer rallies than the earlier match.', 'Gauff’s power earns her a break point which Boisson defends when Gauff drives a forehand six inches too long. Boisson’s backhand yields a second break point and she is broken next point when she chips another backhand into the net.', 'Is about to begin featuring Coco Gauff, the No2 seed, and wildcard Lois Boisson. They’re just knocking up now and playing each other for the first time. ', 'It was always going to take something special to end Iga Swiatek’s 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros, and world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka came near to tennis perfection as she rounded off a 7-6, 4-6, 6-0 victory in style.', 'It’s virtually unheard of for a tennis professional to make zero unforced errors in a set.

Even when it came to the touch game, she was clearly superior, and the sheer quality of this performance made one wonder how anyone can possibly stop her.', 'Whoever wins the second semi-final, Sabalenka will go into Saturday as the strong favourite to win the French Open and extend her personal collection to four grand-slam titles.', 'Sabalenka: “She’s the toughest opponent, especially on the clay. I’m proud that I was able to get this win. It was a tough match a streaky match, but I managed somehow and I’m super proud right now.', '“I’m glad that I found my serve [in the third set] and it was a bit easier with the serve. Six-love.

Sabalenka lost her way after the “let” call but rediscovered her best game at 4-5 down, and has been back on top since. Great serving and returning, and a bit of touch too. Swiatek’s hands let her down at a crucial moment in that tie-break, as she served at 1-3 and a short chip of a return drew her in to the net. She poked the next ball wide with notably poor feel, whereas I would back Sabalenka to do something creative in an awkward position like that, maybe like a re-drop with heavy underspin. That’s a big factor: they can both strike heavy balls (even if Sabalenka has more pace through the air) but Swiatek has less touch and feel these days than her opponent, who has worked tirelessly on improving that facet of her game', 'Sabalenka starts with a mini-break off the first point then holds the next two points, resorting to power and width.

', 'That “let” call from the chair umpire at 4-1 is now looking increasingly important. Sabalenka thought she had hit an ace out wide at 40-30 that would have given her a 5-1 lead. The umpire called it back for a tiny flick on the net-cord, and then had a conversation with Sabalenka, who seemed unconvinced. She could be seen grinning sardonically in order to mask her own irritation. From there, a couple of strong backhands helped Swiatek break serve and now – after a string of four straight games – she has the initiative at 5-4. The quality is definitely rising and Swiatek looks like she will take some stopping. ', 'Sabalenka slips in the corner after sliding at 15-30 and allows Swiatek to level on her service game. Neither’s service game is functioning, Sabalenka’s for lack of precision, Swiatek’s because of the ferocity of Sabalenka’s returns. ', 'An unforced error on her forehand from Sabalenka is followed by an inside-out spiffing forehand winner to take them to deuce. ', 'Swiatek wins the next point by peppering the corners until Sabalenka cracks. Width and pace. And she pumps her fist for the first time I’ve noticed then goes into the lead for the first time when, after a long rally, Sabalenka drags a backhand wide. ', 'Sabalenka starts her fourth service game with her first double fault. And then she overhits off her second serve to make it love-30. No doubt whose side the crowd is on. Win here four times and you deserve to be their favourite. Sabalenka finds her serving range with the new balls and exploits Swiatek’s slip to tie it up at 30-all. Swiatek finds the depth to make it 30-40, forcing Sabalenka into a verticla swing with the ball at her feet which spoons the ball too long. ', 'And a big double fault from Sabalenka, who goes spare with her coaches, levels it at 4-4. ', 'Sabalenka rolls her eyes when routine groundstrokes go long and Swiatek moves to 30-love and then, in a rally, swats her overhead wide to make it 40-love.', 'Sabalenka battles one point back with a sizzling return and a second with a backhand winner up the line: 40-30.', 'But Swiatek finally holds with deep, kicking serve that Sabalenka thumps into the net on return.', 'Two holds and five breaks here so far so even though Sabalenka remains 4-3 up, we might say that Swiatek is “back on return” after that game. (As opposed to “back on serve”, which is the usual formulation.)', 'In the interval between games, Swiatek approached her box and engaged in an animated discussion, almost pleading with them for a solution. ', 'She resolves to push Sabalenka off court when she can with crosscourt strokes that force her out of her comfort zone and off to the sides. ', 'At 40-30, though, a late call of ‘let’ takes what Sabalenka thought was an ace off the table and Swiatek stays in the next rally and waits for a mistake that levels the game at deuce. ', 'Swiatek misjudges a backhand from the baseline mid-rally and gives Sabalenka game point but Swiatek manages to defend it on the second serve with a backhand winner up the line.', 'Swiatek pushes Sabalenka deep to earn a break point when Sabalenka’s desperate backhand lob sails out and seals the break on second serve with a forehand, crosscourt winner. She has won nine of 14 points off Sabalenka’s second serve. ', 'But she is yet to hold. Now or never. ', 'Brutal power from Sabalenka off Swiatek’s second serve takes her into a love-30 lead. Interesting point from Lindsay Davenport who says Sabalenka can play like this, using her power game, because she’s essentially playing indoors with the closed roof taking the wind out of the equation, allowing her to go for it.', 'After trading points to make it 15-40, Swiatek pumps her forehand off Sabalenka’s return into the net.', 'Sabalenka has the double break back.', 'The rhythm here is like a grass-court match from the mid-1990s, when carbon fibre rackets were new and Kevin Curren was a Wimbledon finalist. About 75-80 per cent of the points are four shots or under. We’ve had one rally that lasted nine shots, whereas last night Djokovic and Zverev managed about 60 of those. ', 'The power of Sabalenka is finally harnessed by Swiatek who moves her opponent side to side then fires a pair of winners to rally from 30-love to 30-40 and give her a glimmer of hope.', 'But her backhand crosscourt after the ball pops up off the net cord is smeared wide. So we move to the first deuce of the match.', 'Sabalenka keeps changing her service position to sow more problems for Swiatek but the four-time champions speed across court earns her another break point with an inside-out backhand winner, her seventh of the match.', 'Sabalenka racks up her fourth winner to take it back to deuce with a baseline forehand winner before lunging at and hooking a forehand wide to yield a third break point.', 'And Swiatek gets on the board with a forehand return that paints the line.', 'One break back.', 'I’m fond of saying that clay-court tennis is all about building points, but this is fast and furious so far. Sabalenka is teeing off on her return of serve, as Rybakina did when she almost bagelled Swiatek in the opening set last week. Is there an argument for Swiatek to move a little deeper and try to extend the points rather than going toe to toe?', 'Sabalenka in full bully mode, smiting murderously powerful returns to take a love-30 lead. Swaitek clings on with a forehand winner driven up the line off hers second serve but then chops a backhand crosscourt into the net cord and the ball balloons out. 15-40.', 'Swiatek defends the first break point with a forehand crosscourt at Sabalenka’s toes but then pans a forehand six inches too long.', 'Sabalenka has the double break.', 'Swiatek opts to fight fire with fire and comes out swinging, hitting each shot aggressively setting up a winner at the net to move to love-15. ', 'Sabalenka counters with high-kicking serves on second serve, thrashes a return back and then, after she pulls a face at her coaching/family box as she hasn’t yet nailed a first serve, she clocks up an ace, holding to 15 by coming to the net on her backhand side and follows up a drop shot with an angled volleyed winner accompanied by a big grunt.  ', 'Swiatek, in lilac, easily takes the first point as Sabalenka, resplendent in turquoise, whacks her backhand return into the net. Sabalenka, after that false start, pummels a pair of returns with dizzying pace back at Swiatek who can’t get them back over and  advances to 15-30.', 'Make that 15-40 and two break points when her forehand power proves too much for Swiatek. ', 'Never a good time to double fault… but at 15-40 down is particularly detrimental to the nerves.', 'Sabalenka breaks. ', 'But first… they’ll knock up. Tim Henman has backed Swiatek, only when pushed into a corner and quite equivocally. ', 'And the roof of Philippe-Chatrier has been closed. The match was scheduled to follow the Mixed Doubles final which was a breeze for the No 3 seeds, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, who took 70 minutes to rack up a 6-4, 6-2 victory over the US’s Taylor Townsend and Evan King. ', 'The players are out of their dressing rooms, in the corridor and ready to be announced on court. ', 'By Emily Thomas', 'Good afternoon and welcome to the coverage of the two French Open women’s semi-finals. First up on Phillipe-Chatrier is the highly anticipated clash between defending champion Iga Swiatek and world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka. ', 'Sabalenka has found her feet on the clay and is yet to drop a set in this tournament, avenging defeat by Qinwen Zheng last month in Rome in the quarter-finals here. ', 'Slowly but surely, Swiatek is overcoming stuttering form and is back playing with poise and precision. One minor hiccup in the fourth round, when she lost the first set to Elena Rybakina, has been the only minor disruption in Swiatek’s mission to reclaim the title.', 'Swiatek is known as the ‘Queen of Clay’ after winning  four times at the Roland Garros but will the pressure and Sabalenka’s prevailing power be too much for her? The world No 1 has worked tirelessly to broaden her range, adding more touch and subtle slices to her repertoire. These small changes compounded with her rocket-like ground strokes will make for an interesting match against the measured Swiatek.', 'Sabalenka is certainly talking tough. “I go out there and I fight,” she said. “I’m ready to leave everything I have to get the win.”', 'The pair have met on 12 occasions, with Swiatek winning eight but this is their first meeting at Roland Garros. ', 'In this afternoon’s second semi-final, world No2 Coco Gauff is the overwhelming favourite against darling of the crowd, French wild card Lois Bosson. ', 'Lois Boisson first made headlines when her opponent, British No 4, gracelessly called her smelly. But who is laughing now Boisson is having the run of her life becoming the first home player to reach the final four at Roland Garros since 2011 after defeating No 6 seed Mirra Andreeva in straight sets in the quarter-final.', 'As for Gauff, she managed a tricky three-set victory over compatriot Madison Keys in the last eight and the 2023 US Open Champion is gunning to reach her first French Open final.  If her forehand and serve come together, she has the ability to make this a cakewalk against a player of such little experience.

After securing a spot in the semifinals, the American received a celebratory cheer from compatriot Tommy Paul’s girlfriend, Paige Lorenze, on social media.', 'It is worth noting that Lorenze’s boyfriend, Paul’s French Open campaign ended with a straight-set quarterfinals defeat to Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday.', 'Gauff hit 11 unforced errors to fall 1-4 behind in the opening set but rallied to take a 5-4 lead. However, Keys saved a set point with a forehand winner and capitalized on three double faults from Gauff to narrowly win in the tiebreak.', 'The 21-year-old encountered some resistance from Keys in the second set but broke through at 4-4 to take it 6-4. The deciding set proved far more straightforward for Gauff, who sealed the match, 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-1.', 'Many were in awe of Gauff’s impressive win over Keys, just like social media influencer, model, and entrepreneur Lorenze.

She will next face France’s Loïs Boisson on Thursday.', 'Meanwhile, the clay-court season concluded for Paul, whose performance seemed to have been hampered by a heavily taped right thigh during his late-night loss to Alcaraz. The American’s highlights on clay in 2025 included semifinal runs in Houston and Rome.', 'Many social media enthusiasts are likely familiar with Lorenze, whether through glimpses of her daily life or her brand promotions. However, she believes her boyfriend, Tommy Paul, could improve when it comes to his own social media presence.', '“I think of all the American guys, Tommy is the most quiet in terms of self-promotion. I’m pushing him in general to create content because I see the value in it, and I want him to make the most of his career. There’s an entire side of Twitter that goes nuts for him! And sometimes I also wish he would involve the crowd a little bit more,” Lorenze told GQ Sports.', 'World No. 13 Paul and Lorenze started dating in 2022, and the latter frequently showcases their bond online. Moreover, Lorenze often travels with Paul on tour and cheers him on from the stands. In 2021, Lorenze founded Dairy Boy, a lifestyle brand popularizing a countryside-inspired aesthetic.

Coco Gauff beats Madison Keys to reach French Open semifinals,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6402080/2025/06/04/coco-gauff-madison-keys-french-open-result-analysis/,"['Tennis', 'French Open', 'LIVE', '', '20', 'ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — With a display that epitomized her relentlessness on the biggest stages, Coco Gauff knocked Madison Keys out of the French Open.', 'In a contest of who could keep the ball on the court the most, Gauff was better when she needed to be, toppling the Australian Open champion 6-7(6) 6-4, 6-1 to reach her third Roland Garros semifinal.', '', 'The two American title hopefuls, nearly a decade apart in age but seemingly destined to battle not just each other, but the promise they’ve long carried through their careers, did not play a beautiful match.', 'Instead, this was a two-part test. Gauff and Keys both had to overcome a tough-as-nails opponent. They also had to overcome two hours and 11 minutes in which both players struggled to summon their best tennis.', 'What unfolded was a pendulum swing between the two qualities that have made them factors at this stage of majors: Keys’ preternatural calm under pressure and Gauff’s preternatural ability to stay in any match, no matter the momentum.', 'Where does that power come from? Not even Gauff knows. She does remember a match at the Orange Bowl, the tournament for elite junior players. She was down 6-1, 5-1 and came back to win.', 'She’s got plenty of skills, she knows that, but maybe it’s her love of winning, or the will to do whatever it takes to try to get the win. Whatever it is, she’s pretty sure of this: “It’s not something that’s taught,” she said.', '“It’s just I have always had that in me, and not just in tennis but in everything. I’m a very competitive person.”', 'Keys surged to an early lead as Gauff kept shooting for the lines and missing. Twenty minutes after the first ball, Keys was serving at 4-1 and it looked like she was going to cruise through the first set.', 'Then Gauff stopped firing at the lines, widening her margins and trying to make Keys move just a little. It worked, passing the error bug onto Keys’ racket. Five games later, Keys had to save a set point on her serve.', 'And that’s when Keys managed to do the thing every player dreams of doing – playing a perfect point exactly when she needed to. She followed a big first serve with a bigger forehand winner and escaped danger. There was more of that in the tiebreak, with Gauff looking like she was in control, but Keys freeing up to win six of the final eight points, cracking a big first serve to seal it on her second chance.', 'The second set was the opposite of the first, with Gauff surging out to a lead on the strength of Keys’ errors, than losing her form and her 4-1, double-service break lead. She found her control of the ball just in time, breaking Keys with some deft slicing to move ahead 5-4, and then watching Keys make errors on three consecutive returns to send the match to a deciding set.', '', '“I just knew I had to be able to run today and when the ball came short punish her for it,” Gauff said on court.', 'With the stage set for a similar tussle to decide the match, Keys returned to the court apparently struggling to shake the idea that her best chance might have slipped away. Just when Gauff had looked like she was going to slip off a cliff, Keys had thrown her a rope, and now Gauff sensed she could use it to reel Keys in.', '“She covers the court so well, I think it just put a little bit of pressure on me to go a little bit more for my shots and maybe press a little bit too much too soon,” Keys said in her news conference.', '“There were a lot of points where I felt like playing someone else I would have won the point, but having to reset two and three times, it makes it harder, where even if you win six of those but if you’re losing three or four, they could be important points.”', 'Keys gave Gauff an early break with an error-strewn game. Gauff, her serve jitters easing and her first-ball percentage climbing toward 60 percent, seized another 4-1 lead with a big looping backhand onto a deep stretch of sideline that Keys couldn’t handle. Unlike the first two sets, that double-break looked secure, rather than vulnerable.', 'Now the only question was whether she could deal with the adversity once more. She did, playing high-margin tennis and not allowing Keys to think a wobble was just a few bad swings away, as it had been throughout the match.', '“I was just trying to be aggressive,” she said. “Usually if you’re playing too passive, in the end the more aggressive player is going to win.”', 'Gauff got to match point with a nifty short slice forehand and an easy down the line pass, then sealed it with one more steady rally that ended with her watching Keys send a last forehand long.', '', 'She will play French wild card Loïs Boisson in the semifinals, which will bring a whole different kind of challenge. Boisson, the world No. 361 who had just one WTA Tour win coming into the tournament, has captured the imagination of the French crowd. The screams for her under the roof at Chatrier during her upset of Andreeva were deafening, and they will be whether the roof is open or closed Thursday.', 'Gauff said she’s ready for it.', '“I have done it in the past,” she said. “Either, A, just pretend they’re cheering for you, or B, just using it and not letting that get to you. I have been in crowds where they are 99% for me, so I don’t have an issue with it. You know, I hope everyone will be respectful and things. If not, it’s cool.”', 'She’s a sports fan, she said.
