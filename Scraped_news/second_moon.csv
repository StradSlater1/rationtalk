It's not going to hit us, but it is going to hang out for a couple of months. A recently discovered asteroid known as 2024 PT5 will fly into Earth's orbit, get caught there from Sept. 29 to Nov. 25 and then eventually exit and continue its way through the solar system. Scientists call such phenomena mini-moons."", 'The asteroid was found by a group called ATLAS, which stands for Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, in August. The researchers who found it published a nonpeer-reviewed study about the asteroid.', 'Some past mini-moons, such as this one from 2020, have been discovered to be random pieces of space junk. The 2020 mini-moon was eventually identified as a rocket booster from the 1966 Surveyor 2 Centaur launch. But ATLAS reports this upcoming mini-moon is likely to be a real asteroid, which is simply defined as a small, rocky object that orbits the sun.', ""Amateur astronomer Tony Dunn posted a simulation to X of what the asteroid's path will look like. 2024 PT5 has already been near Earth since July."", ""During the event, the asteroid's geocentric energy will become negative and remain that way for 56.6 days.

Mini-moons that do complete a total orbit of Earth are referred to as temporarily captured orbiters."", ""It's unlikely you'll see the mini-moon. NASA says the absolute magnitude of 2024 PT5 is 27.593. That means it's quite dim and won't be visible even if you have a telescope. For reference, the dimmest magnitude that is visible to the naked eye at night is around 6.5 and a 12-inch telescope can see objects with a magnitude of around 16 or 17. That means amateur astronomers are going to have to sit this one out since you'd need a much larger telescope to see 2024 PT5."", ""Mini-moons aren't particularly rare. We see them almost every year. Earth had a mini-moon in 2022 thanks to the peculiar flight path of the 2022 YG asteroid. Another one appeared in 2020 courtesy of the 2020 CD3 asteroid.

The 2022 NX1 asteroid became a mini-moon in 1981 and 2022. It's scheduled to make its return in 2051. One of the best examples is 2006 RH120, which orbited Earth for a whole year between July 2006 and July 2007. The phenomenon is so consistent that some researchers claim that Earth always has a mini-moon lurking around somewhere."", 'The asteroid impact in Mexico left deposits similar to those made by other asteroids from the outer solar system.', 'An asteroid impact led to the end of times for the dinosaurs.', ""Asteroids, volcanic eruptions and poisonous plant species: the extinction of the dinosaurs has been a hotly debated topic for decades. But researchers have found hard evidence of an asteroid impact that had a massive effect on the Earth's climate along with asteroid-specific minerals like iridium at the crater in Chicxulub, Mexico, all but proving the asteroid theory."", ""And now scientists have figured out where the asteroid likely came from, and it wasn't from anywhere nearby. Research headed by Mario Fischer-Gödde at the University of Cologne in Germany says the asteroid came from beyond Jupiter, well into the outer portion of our solar system. "", 'The research paper, published Thursday in the journal Science, identified it as a C-type asteroid. Known as a carbonaceous meteor, these most commonly come from the outer solar system. C-type meteors are exceptionally old, and their makeups can help researchers learn more about the early history of our solar system.', 'To figure this out, scientists had to go through a number of steps. When the meteorite smashed into Earth, it pulverized rock and launched it into the skies. This giant dust cloud -- which included material from both Earth and the meteorite -- lowered the temperature of Earth and wiped out most of the species in existence. That dust eventually settled, where it would become a layer of rock that scientists could dig up tens of millions of years later. ', 'Geologists designate this very thin layer as the K-Pg layer, which describes the time when the Cretaceous period ends and the Paleogene period begins. It was around this time, 66 million years ago, when the asteroid was thought to hit.', 'Researchers dug up samples from the K-Pg layer and found ruthenium, an element that is rarely found on Earth but is plentiful on carbonaceous meteorites. The isotopes, or atoms, found in the ruthenium matched those found in ruthenium in other carbonaceous meteorites, proving that it came from a meteorite and not Earth. ', 'To make sure, researchers also compared it to material found in other major meteorite impacts and found no matches. That means the ruthenium found in the K-Pg layer came from the same meteorite that hit Chicxulub.', 'As the theory goes, a 6-mile-wide meteor plunged into Earth near modern-day Chicxulub on the Yucatan peninsula. The impact launched vaporized rock and debris into the air, covering the planet in a dust cloud that caused the temperature to fall by about 50 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius). This caused a long winter that killed off nonavian dinosaurs, along with 70% of all life on Earth.', 'Eventually, the dust fell back to Earth where it became the K-Pg rock layer, and then other things got piled on top that also became rock. Whatever happened when the K-Pg layer was created definitely killed the dinosaurs, because no nonavian dinosaur fossils have ever been found above the K-Pg layer.', 'Researchers have found plenty of stuff in the K-Pg layer, including iridium and chromium. Iridium is rare on Earth but common on asteroids, so when they found iridium in the 1980s, it helped piece together the puzzle of what killed the dinosaurs. Chromium, by contrast, is very common on Earth so it could not be correlated to a meteorite impact.', 'Later, scientists found more evidence in the form of sulfur in the K-Pg layer but not in the impact crater, suggesting that the impact launched sulfur into the atmosphere, which certainly contributed to global cooling. Sulfur was found in the rock as far away as Antarctica, which showed how violent the meteorite impact was.', 'We now come to today. As Fischer-Gödde explained to Mashable, ruthenium is quite difficult to detect and it required some technological advancements to do it. So, the team measured five samples from the K-Pg layer and found that the ruthenium from all five samples likely came from the same single source. They also found that the isotopes matched those of carbonaceous meteorites that had been previously analyzed.', ""To sum it up: The meteorite that hit Earth and killed the dinosaurs was likely formed billions of years ago as part of the solar system's earliest history, and not something that was close by like most meteorite impacts.""]"

This revealed that it's on a horseshoe-shaped path and traveling relatively slowly, resulting in a brief honey(mini-)moon phase with Earth."", 'Its orbital characteristics also helped the team narrow down where it might have come from. 2024 PT₅ seems to belong to a group of near-Earth objects called the Arjunas, which orbit the Sun at about the same distance, shape and angle as Earth.

But in all three cases, it was still stalking us at a distance of at least 8.2 million kilometers (5.1 million miles). The last time it was under a million kilometers away seems to have been in October 1937, but as the team says, that far back its history is less certain."", 'Going the opposite direction in time, the next sure visit will be in November 2055. After that, the foggy crystal ball suggests it could make another close pass in January 2084, at about 1.66 million kilometers (1 million miles) away.', 'Earth has had similar brief flings with mini-moons before. In 2020 astronomers realized a small rock, just 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) wide at most, had been orbiting our planet for about three years. Just a few months after its discovery, it broke free of its bounds and drifted off.', ""A different kind of mini-moon was discovered in 2016. This one was a 'quasi-satellite,' in that it was technically still orbiting the Sun but was trailing behind Earth, tangled up in its gravitational pull. It was estimated to have been following us for almost a century, and probably will for a few more yet."", 'The study of 2024 PT₅ was published in Research Notes of the AAS.']"
