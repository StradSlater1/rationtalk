On Sunday, Stellantis NV’s board rightly decided that his unrelenting approach had become more hindrance than help to the automaker’s long term prospects; softly spoken Chairman John Elkann will take charge on a temporary basis during the hunt for a successor.', 'But while Tavares made unforced errors and became his own worst enemy, the role of running an automaker has become fiendishly hard; finding a replacement to steer the owner of Jeep and Peugeot, plus a dozen more brands, through technological upheaval, regulatory confusion and the rise of Chinese competition won’t be easy.', 'Tavares, 66, has had a glittering career, culminating in successfully turning around Peugeot and Opel and then overseeing their merger with Fiat Chrysler in 2021. Until his fall from grace this year, he deftly filled the role of industry savant vacated by the death of Sergio Marchionne in 2018.', 'The speed of Stellantis’s unravelling has been breathtaking — Tavares was awarded €36.5 million euros ($38.4 million) in total compensation earlier this year following record financial results which we now know weren’t sustainable. It’s appropriate that Tavares accepts responsibility for a collapse in the company’s North America profitability and severe deterioration in relations with key stakeholders.', 'As head of the Agnelli family holding company Exor NV, the largest shareholder in Stellantis, Elkann arguably should have acted sooner to restore harmony, before several top executives sought employment elsewhere. Instead, Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight was offered as the sacrificial lamb in October — a decision I found regrettable because she wasn’t at the company long and the problems mostly weren’t part of her purview.', 'Tavares would probably still have a job if Stellantis hadn’t dropped the ball in North America by increasing prices too much and offering too many high-trim Ram and Jeep trucks and SUVs, and then failing to respond quickly enough when demand nosedived and inventories ballooned. While the pressures on the car industry demand tough decisions — as Volkswagen AG has belatedly recognized by considering plant closures — a war of attrition with unions, dealers, suppliers and governments is no way to run a business.', 'Tavares won’t be the last CEO who fails to rise to the challenge. Manufacturers are required to meet daunting emissions targets, but many western drivers aren’t ready for vehicles with plugs. Meanwhile, the key determinant of success in coming years will be software competency, not metal bashing. The risk of missteps and capital misallocation are high. Add trade wars and the rise of ultra competitive Chinese rivals like BYD Co. to the mix, and you wonder why anybody would want to manager a western automaker, notwithstanding the potential for lucrative remuneration like that secured by Tavares.', 'It’s probably no coincidence that some of the longest-serving auto-industry bosses are visionary electric vehicle founders such as BYD’s Wang Chuanfu and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, so kudos to Mary Barra for lasting more than a decade at General Motors Co.', 'Elkann tapped an outsider when one of Exor’s other prized assets, Ferrari NV, needed a new boss in 2021 — Benedetto Vigna’s background is in semiconductors, not luxury or autos. But with all due respect to Vigna, running Ferrari, which sells around 14,000 cars a year and builds them all in Italy, is a picnic compared to Stellantis, which produces more than 400 times that number.', 'Having overseen the creation of this globe spanning, multi-brand leviathan, Elkann must now find someone to tame it.

Stellantis’s Carlos Tavares: the hard-driving boss ejected from global carmaker,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/02/hard-driving-style-put-carlos-tavares-on-collision-course-with-stellantiss-board,"['Firm rejects ruthless approach of former chief executive known for pushing for bigger profits', 'Carlos Tavares is known as one of the most outspoken leaders in the car industry. Among the executive class, the former Stellantis chief executive is also considered to be one of the best drivers of its products on the track.', 'He used a similarly hard-driving style in the board room, constantly pushing his managers and factories to deliver bigger profits. Yet after his enforced departure from the global carmaker, it appears Tavares may have been better off applying the brakes than charging ahead.', 'Stellantis announced Tavares’s resignation with immediate effect on Sunday. In a statement, Henri de Castries, Stellantis’s senior independent director, made it clear that “different views” were behind his departure. In a sign of the discord, there was no statement from Tavares. Shares fell more than 6% on Monday.', 'The global car industry has been struggling this year with falling demand in its key markets, at the same time as it spends heavily to switch to electric vehicles – all the while fending off increasing competition from China.', 'For Stellantis, owner of brands ranging from Fiat and Chrysler to Peugeot, Opel and Jeep, the pressures became clear in September when it shocked investors with a profit warning. A buildup of unsold cars in North America – priced too high, according to analysts – plus delays to European car launches were major factors in the company saying it would burn through between €5bn (£4.2bn) and €10bn this year.', 'Tavares was against issuing such a stark warning, according to a person with knowledge of internal discussions, arguing instead that Stellantis could make steep cost cuts and actually generate cash during the year. Yet the board is said to have felt that making cuts now would have stored up problems for next year and beyond.', 'Tavares’s ruthless approach, which the Stellantis board was said to have rejected, was honed under another Carlos: Carlos Ghosn, the former head of the Nissan-Renault alliance, who was known as “le cost killer”. Tavares shared many of the same instincts and was promoted rapidly through Renault.', 'However, the protege turned rival when Tavares said in a 2013 interview that he wanted to lead a global carmaker. Tavares achieved that goal less than a year later when he left Renault for French-dominated competitor Peugeot, which also owned Citroën, Opel and Vauxhall. His successful turnaround of the group made him one of the most prominent voices in the global car industry.', 'Yet his ambitions did not stop there. When the Agnelli industrial dynasty and its Fiat Chrysler group came calling, Tavares led the 2019 merger talks and was appointed to lead one of the world’s largest carmakers. It allied one of Detroit’s big three carmakers with one of Europe’s biggest.', 'One of the most striking things about Tavares’s fall was its speed: less than a year ago Stellantis reported record net profits of €11.8bn. Yet it quickly became clear the profits were unsustainable and, in September, Tavares said he would retire in 2026. Analysts led by Daniel Roeska at Bernstein, an equity research house, said the decline in North America undermined Tavares’s credibility, while 30% of investors had already in April balked at a pay package worth nearly €37m that was considered by some as a warning sign.', 'Sign up to Business Today', ""Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning"", '', 'Tavares’s legacy will be divisive – not least in the UK where one of his last acts was announcing the closure of a Vauxhall van factory at Luton, putting 1,100 workers at risk of redundancy or relocation. However, several people said there was little chance of Stellantis making a U-turn on that decision, even with Tavares’s departure, because the company still has too much spare van-making capacity in Europe.', 'In the US, some executives, hard-pressed suppliers and workers will also be breathing a sigh of relief. The United Auto Workers claimed a victory on his departure, and will look forward to a more conciliatory approach. The union’s president, Shawn Fain, said in a statement: “Tavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots.”', 'One person who has worked with him said that he is a “visionary” who deserves credit for turning around Peugeot and building Stellantis into a global player. However, another said that, despite his undoubted intelligence, the seeds of his downfall were sown in the merger that created Stellantis, an unwieldy beast with 14 separate brands and cultures that have not been fully integrated.', 'Instead, John Elkann, the scion of the Agnelli interests who chairs the Stellantis board, will chair an interim executive committee. The board room bust-up leaves 66-year-old Tavares unable to add another corporate turnaround to his record.']"

Ahead of the resignation, the stock was down about 43% in 2024.', '“The market will inevitably ask why the Stellantis board considered that not having a permanent CEO for some months was preferable to keeping the current CEO in situ,” Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said in an investor note Sunday night. “We struggle to identify any scenario under which these events can be positively spun as far as the stock price is concerned.”', 'Stellantis on Sunday reconfirmed its previously lowered guidance for the year that included an adjusted operating income margin of 5.5% and 7% and industrial free cash flow between minus 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) to minus 10 billion euros.', 'Tavares’ resignation comes less than two months after the company announced he would retire at the end of his contract in early 2026. At the time, Stellantis said it planned to name a successor by the fourth quarter of next year.', 'Tavares, 66, had led Stellantis since its creation through a 2021 merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Groupe, where he had been board chair since 2014.', 'The longtime automotive veteran — a prodigy of former Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn — was widely heralded in recent years for spearheading the merger and making Stellantis one of the world’s most profitable automakers.', 'But this year, the company’s financial results have severely underperformed expectations amid mismanagement of the U.S. market — its prime cash generator — with a lack of investment in new or updated products, historically high prices and extreme cost-cutting measures.', 'The company, which also owns brands such as Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, lowered its annual guidance targets in September, a month ahead of the automaker reporting a 27% decline in third-quarter net revenue.', '“The credibility of Carlos Tavares had been massively undermined by the collapse in profitability in Stellantis’ North American operations which had caused the group to slash its 2024 guidance on 30 September,” Bernstein’s Roeska said.', 'Stellantis’ sales also have struggled this year. Most recently, the company reported a roughly 20% decline in year-over-year global vehicles sold during the third quarter. That included extending a yearslong free fall during in the U.S. despite Tavares’ attempts to correct what he has called “arrogant” mistakes.', 'Tavares made cost-cutting a critical mission for Stellantis, including a self-reported 8.4 billion euros in reductions from the merger.', 'The cost-saving measures have included reshaping the company’s supply chain and operations, as well as reducing headcounts in the U.S. and increasing work in lower-cost countries such as Brazil and Mexico.', 'Several current and former Stellantis executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to potential repercussions, previously described the cuts to CNBC as grueling to the point of excessiveness and leading to problems in the U.S.', 'Tavares pushed back on the claim that the company’s massive cost-cutting efforts had created problems.', '“When you don’t deliver for any reason ... you may want to use a scapegoat.

With the surprise announcement from Stellantis that CEO Carlos Tavares is resigning, it’s time to consider what can be done to save the American brands of Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Eagle, and Ram. Well, maybe not Eagle.', 'And what of Europe? What should the rest of the brands (Fiat, Lancia, Alfa, Maserati, et cetera) do? I’ve got some thoughts about how new interim boss John Elkann can start to piece the company back together if that’s what he wants.', 'Why did Tavares leave? Yesterday, I didn’t have an answer, today it’s becoming a little clearer how the final moments played out in the Stellantis bunker somewhere in Amsterdam. It’ll give me a chance to review his term as CEO and make an offer to any other brand that might be interested in picking up his term.', '', 'When Fiat picked up the various Chrysler brands for a song, the newly merged Fiat Chrysler (FCA) made sure people knew and understood that it was still an American company. Reeling from two failed wars and an economy that was made out of soggy gingerbread, America in the late aughts could be a depressing place. The young company embraced the new administration’s message of hope and Detroit’s underdog spirit to create the “Imported from Detroit” campaign.', '', 'It worked. We believed Eminem when he said the vehicles would reflect American attitudes and tastes, even if the guy who ran the company was suddenly a chainsmoking, sweater-wearing Italian. In fact, then-CEO Sergio Marchionne was a constant fixture in North America who was largely liked and accepted by American journalists, execs, and employees.', 'Carlos Tavares never found that acceptance. A successful CEO in Europe, Tavares stayed mostly European. As head of Opel and Peugeot, Tavares was seen as a smart guy who saw the coming changes to the global car market and began to make the hard decisions necessary to keep those brands afloat long enough to eventually merge with FCA to create Stellantis.', 'In fairness to Tavares, this was Marchionne’s dream as well. Fiat always wanted to be a bigger global player, and Tavares realized Marchonne’s vision. Unfortunately, Tavares was never equipped to make the deal work. In his selection of managers, his reduction of engineering/product development in Michigan, and his constant bickering with suppliers/workers/governments, Tavares understood the potential of a combined global automaker but never quite understood what to do with it.', 'In the interim, market share in North America has taken a nosedive, and with it the profits needed to sustain the failing European operation (Stellantis lost a third of its share in Europe since Tavares took over, and Fiat is down by half to just 1.8% of Europe’s total market). Earlier this year I wrote that I didn’t think Stellantis, though coming off a profitable year, would be able to stick the landing. It clearly didn’t.', 'What can be done? I think Stellantis has two choices:', 'America needs a fourth major automaker, and Jeep is one of the strongest brands in the world, other than maybe Tesla or Ferrari. IF Stellantis wants to keep the American arm it needs to invest in making good products with American engineers, marketers, and designers. Tavares arrogantly assumed he could outsource much of the work to Europe, Brazil, and India.', 'In the impending Trump era, it’s clear that there’s going to be an industrial policy here that favors American production. Honestly, even if Harris had been elected, I think this was going to be the case. Rather than fight it, Stellantis needs to embrace it with vehicles and concepts that make the various brands fit within an American portfolio and not a ‘House of Brands’ that also includes Alfa, Fiat, and Maserati.', 'In fact, Fiat, Alfa, and Maserati have to leave North America. It was a fun experiment and it didn’t work. Oh well.', 'Dodge needs new products, badly, and it needs them to cover the entry-level of the market that the Korean and Japanese automakers are dominating. Ram needs to become a part of Dodge. While the Wagoneer and Wagoneer S can stay, Jeep needs to offer a fuller and better (newer!) range of crossovers on the lower/middle end of the market. Chrysler needs some flagships and, in fact, Chrysler should have been the EV brand all along while Pacifica should become the Dodge Grand Caravan again. That’s three brands, all distinct, that make sense. Make Ralph Gilles CEO. Easy. Done.', 'If Stellantis can’t do that, it should just let the American brands become a new company as it did with Ferrari. It worked out for Ferrari and it can work out for the newly re-minted Chrysler Corporation (with Ralph Gilles as CEO, just saying). It’s probably a bad time to become a public company, so I’m not sure how that’ll work, but perhaps there’s enough private capital out there to try.', '', 'John Elkann, pictured above with his brother Lapo and his sister Ginvera, is the Chair of Stellantis, CEO of Ferrari/Stellantis shareholder Exor. He’s also the grandson of famous Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and has long operated as the family leader following the death of his uncle.', 'He’s going to be running the company in the interim, and he’s going to have to help pick a leader with a vision for Stellantis. I’ve explained what I, a humble blogger, think needs to be done in North America. What about Europe?', 'Sell Peugeot and Citroën to Renault. Just get rid of it. It’ll make everyone happier and Renault has a hot hand right now. Sell Maserati to a Chinese automaker. Keep Alfa Romeo and let it be a sister brand to Ferrari so Ferrari dealers can get a car to its clients while its clients wait two years for a Ferrari. Fiat can be an Italian brand again, and one with eyes on cheaper cars in Europe and South America. OR, just sell that as well.', 'Honestly, the car business is an old business and you’ve already got Ferrari. What do you even want Fiat for? Let that be someone else’s problem.', 'Friends, readers, CJDR dealers, lend me your ears. I come to bury Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, not praise him. The capital expenditures men do live after them; the higher margin quarters often interred with their bones. So let it be with Carlos.', 'Tavares, not pictured above, is an interesting character. His reputation coming into the Stellantis deal was stellar. As longtime auto exec Dr. Andy Palmer put it, “Carlos is perhaps the most professional car guy I’ve worked with. He’s created some of the most iconic cars, including the Renault Megane series. That Stellantis exists at all is all down to Carlos.” He also added that Carlos is also a “bloody good driver.”', 'Other than Elon Musk, Carlos Tavares is probably the highest-paid automotive CEO in the world, having made about $40 million in 2023. He did it by driving margins up on cars in America by squeezing out the same old products at a much higher price to consumers who didn’t have much of a choice. It worked until it didn’t and, unlike his former boss Carlos Ghosn, it seems like Tavares is going to get out with the money. His reputation? That’s another story and seems related to why Tavares left.', 'Here’s what Reuters is reporting, though I haven’t heard the Tavares side of it yet:', 'A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that tensions grew after the board felt Tavares was moving too quickly and focusing on near-term solutions to save his reputation, not working in the best interests of the company.', 'The sudden announcement on Sunday indicated that the fissures between the board and Tavares had to be severe, given that the parties decided it was better to operate with no CEO on a short-term basis, Bernstein analysts said.', 'Yikes. Once the company announced it wasn’t going to pick up the Tavares contract it didn’t really make sense to keep him on as his motivations would be either to make as much money as possible or, as indicated above, try to make himself look better.', 'Here’s the kicker on that article, by the way:', '“Tavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement.', 'Double yikes.', 'I’ve been doing this bit with Carlos Tavares, pictured above, since at least February. The basic premise of the joke is that the actor Jon Lovitz tends to play characters who are always willing to say or do anything to get an advantage over other people.', 'I truly enjoy this bit and would like to see it continue. I also think Tavares blundered this, but he does have a great history and loves old cars.', 'So here’s my deal: If you’re a struggling automaker, an upstart firm, or any other carmaker in need of a CEO, please hire Carlos. If only to keep this joke going I will write more about KTM or Polestar or whatever way more than I would if you hired some normal MBA exec person.', '', 'With a shoutout to SWG, here’s a little Paul Simon from the excellent “Graceland” doing “Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes.”', 'Do you also agree that Ralph Gilles should take over Stellantis? If not Ralph, then who would you pick?', 'Peugeot and Citroën are Stellantis heart and soul. Sell them? Impossible. Fiat, also not happening. Maybe Stellantis should concentrate more on markets outside of North America and just let Chrysler and Dodge die off. Jeep, maybe they can sell that; it may have some life left in it. Maybe RAM too. Chrysler and Dodge, I don’t think it’s worth it. They have run their course. Let’s just Plymouth them.', 'Let’s be real here for a moment. Did anyone think Stellantis would have a positive outcome in the US market?  ', 'I think there could have been a chance if they had stuck to a model of euro/global, and US. We have seen is that none of the smaller global market cars that are produced come to the US in a segment that is underserved. Look at the Maverick- Why in the heck did they not bring in a global platform that could compete with it? They put out the Rampage for the South American market. The US market space just got devoured by Ford, and has now got a friend in Hyundai with the Santa Cruz. These are rookie mistakes, that a company that wants to make profits should have been aware of and tossed some models at. Ignoring the US market and the not right place- right time pushing of cars here doomed them.', 'The Ram truck was pushed as brand by FCA, and it only ever had the truck. It wasn’t GMC with several rebranded upmarket SUVs and a truck line. It was left undeveloped.', 'The Dodge brand was the performance brand, but still with a mediocre lineup and only two real players in the market (Charger/Challenger). To be fair, they did milk the Journey platform for all it was worth, and people did buy it for the cheap three row crossover it was. The Durango hanging around even after the WK2 jeep died for the same reasons- tooling was paid for and it was just profit for three rows.', 'Jeep has gotten too overpriced and low quality. I cant say i was impressed with the JL when i was looking for a used Wrangler. I got more value out a 2017 jk with 96k on the odometer thana a 2018 JL similarly equipped. ', 'Chrysler was left to languish with two models that basically turned profit because of the tooling was paid for with the 300, and they developed the Pacifica as a Caravan replacement, and then throw the Voyager name on it in the last few years to add another model to the brand.', 'Really, what needs to happen is have the brands each with their own specific niche- Chrysler is the upscale brand- target it at the Caddy buyers. If your going to keep RAM, then its trucks and SUVS, but then make it diverse in it ‘s offerings. Dodge- keep it the performance brand, but again make it diverse. ', 'To close out, stop the absurdity that you should shouldn’t build cars and only make SUVs. You need to get people into your brand somehow, and lets be honest, cars are the gateway drug to bigger things. But you have to make something that isn’t garbage quality. It’s possible to make an OK car at an OK price that get people into your brand. It should get them in the Dodge, and then as they age up, they go to Ram or Chrysler. Plymouth was the budget brand, and they killed that off because it was easier to ignore it than to develop it…maybe bring that back as the entry level again?', 'Absolutely keep Alfa. Fewer dealerships. Every dealership must evoke the art and passion of the brand.\nReverse the elevation of Ram as a brand. It’s rightful place is part of Dodge.\nExpand lineup at Chrysler to five models. Minivan, SUV compact, SUV midsize, near luxury wagon and sedan. Badge engineer Peugot models. All of them must offer hybrid or EV.\nLet Jeep fix Jeep. The solution must be from North America.\nThere is no future for FIAT. Bye Tony.\nAllow Maserati to fail or succeed on it’s own merit. It funds itself or it’s gone.', 'First, put Ram back as part of Dodge. Then do platform sharing with distinct branding. Dodge is the fun, affordable brand. Chrysler is the slightly upmarket brand for older people (think Buick who has had a resurgence lately). Jeep is the adventure / outdoors brand.', 'For vehicles, make a Dakota version of the Gladiator. The van becomes the Chrysler Town and Coutry, All three get a version of the Grand Cherokee in line with the branding and pricing – Durango with the base model (the Durango was essentially the same price as the GC but more dated looking so no one wanted it), the Chrysler Pacifica with a more restrained design (think Cadillac mixed with VW) which only comes with leather seats, etc. It also has a top of the line trim, like GMCs Denali or Buick’s Avenir. Take the new Cherokee and do the same. Create a compact SUV for all three. Create a successor for the 300 that is still RWD and gives a more exciting option to the Accord / Camry / Altima.', 'For engineering, focus on the known issues – show the public you want to be a benchmark company. Redesign and fire everyone involved in the TIPM. Work on electrical reliability. Hire people who interact with owners forums, repair shops, and social media to see what people are complaining about. Update the Pentastar to fix the small issues like the oil cooler. Create a smaller (say 2.8-3.0L) twin turbo version of the Pentastar as an upgrade option across the line. Partner with someone like Nissan to build a good 2.0L 4-cylinder and create a turbo version of it. Redesign and bring back the Hemi V-8 (fixing the cam/lifter wear issues).', 'For marketing, focus on engineering – make commercials about nerds with pocket protectors pushing be-suited MBAs out of meetings looking at spreadsheets to talk about design over dollars. Make a commercial starting with a WWII Jeep “we designed what American soldiers needed to win”, then a rocket blasting off “we designed what Americans needed to put a man on the moon”, then an early Chrysler minivan “we designed what American families needed.” Soldiers, NASA engineers, and a typical family stand together in front of an American flag – “Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep – Designed for America”.', 'Great song selection, Matt! You have excellent taste in music and thanks for the shout-out.', 'How To Save Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, And Ram', 'After a quick look at the Dodge and Chrysler websites, my first suggestion would be to offer cars for sale.

I’m not sure why that’s always the answer; like their presence is keeping the Chrysler brand on life support and them going away will allow Chrysler to make a full recovery. They can co-exist. Fiat, Alfa, and Maserati need more competitive products that appeal to Americans at reasonable prices. I mean Hyundai-Kia built an empire from nearly nothing, gobbling up significant market share while introducing yet another luxury brand into a crowded market with decent success. Mazda successfully changed their branding and image from fun zoom-zoom to upscale. There’s no reason why Fiat, Alfa, and Maserati can’t do something similar, but they need a team that is more competent in that arena than what they have had.', 'That said, I don’t hate the ideas under the ‘What About the Rest of the Brands?’ heading.', 'P.S.: Keep the Wagoneer?

A Maserati Grecale should be priced like a BMW X3, and the Levante like an X5; Jeep SUVs have way too high MSRPs, but seem to go out the door at much lower prices – but who wants to fight with the dealer’s salesperson to get it to a decent price? If the regular Grecale GT was priced even like a Macan it would probably sell multiples of its current volume. If the Grecale Trofeo was priced where it should be, the same as a X3M, then I might be driving one today – although probably not because of the crappy doorhandles and limited seating options.', '© 2024 The Autopian.

He had been chairman of PSA Group ahead of that deal, which closed in January 2021.

US sales are down 17% in the first nine months of the year. Experts told CNN that the average price of the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler vehicles had gotten too high for the core customers of those brands.', 'By the fourth quarter of 2023, the average Stellantis vehicle sold for $58,000 in the United States, according to data from automotive site Edmunds. While Stellantis’ US average price has declined since then, it was still the second-highest average price in the industry, at just under $55,000 in the third quarter.', 'The company laid off about 1,200 workers at its truck plant in Warren, Michigan, coinciding with the discontinuation of the entry-level Ram 1500 Classic pickup. The elimination of a shift at that plant took effect in October. In November, Stellantis announced plans to cut one of two shifts in January at its Toledo Assembly Complex South plant, which builds the Jeep Gladiator pickup, indefinitely laying off about 1,100 workers.', 'Those layoffs — and the company’s slow pace in bringing back workers to a closed plant in Belvidere, Illinois — has the union threatening to wage a new strike against Stellantis. The UAW said Stellantis was not living up to the terms of the contract reached after strikes a year ago against the automaker. Stellantis has denied it is in violation of the contract and has vowed to challenge the legality of any new strike.', 'Strong profits in 2023 led Stellantis to pay Tavares €36.5 million in total compensation, which comes to $38.4 million at current exchange rates. The pay package sparked strong criticism.', '“The UAW welcomes the resignation of Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, a major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long,” the UAW said in a statement. “We are pleased to see the company responding to pressure and correcting course.”', 'In a letter in August, Kevin Farrish, chairman of the company’s US dealers’ council, which represents the independent businesses that sell its vehicles to car buyers, blamed decisions made by Tavares for many of Stellantis’ problems. Farrish said Tavares put too much emphasis on increasing profit margins and executive pay and not enough on producing vehicles at competitive prices.', '“In 2023, you engineered a record year of profitability for Stellantis, earning you the title of highest-compensated automotive CEO,” Farrish wrote in the letter. “The reckless short-term decision-making to secure record profits in 2023 has had a devastating, yet entirely predictable consequences in the US market.”', 'Farrish pointed to plant closing announcements and the loss of US market share, among other problems.', 'While Farrish told CNN last month that steps by Stellantis to shake up its executive ranks and to offer incentives to buyers of its vehicles had stemmed some of the worst of the problems, he still had concerns about the direction of the company.', 'Farrish did not have an mmediate comment on Tavares’ departure.', 'In October, Stellantis cut its 2024 profit forecast because of declining earnings and sales.

Or been pushed. There is no official line on why, other than that he and most of the rest of the board had a disagreement over strategy.', ""But we have a pretty strong clue what that was about. And TopGear.com doesn't want to see him off without marking his immense achievements."", ""Stellantis is the huge company that resulted when PSA merged with FCA in January 2021. To explain further, PSA was Peugeot, Citroen and DS, later including Vauxhall and Opel. That was the group Tavares was in charge of. FCA itself was the result of a merger, between a European combine – Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Abarth and Lancia – with the US group of Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler. It's a sprawling enterprise, still not fully integrated."", 'In an official statement this week, Stellantis senior independent director Henri de Castries said very little. ""In recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the chief executive coming to today’s decision."" That decision being Tavares\' departure.', ""The 'different views' stem from the fact the company's Detroit-based brands have been losing sales in the huge and profitable US market this year. Unsold cars were piling up at dealers there."", 'When I saw Tavares a month ago, he said he\'d given the Detroit management too much power, and they\'d lost control of the situation. Their ""daring marketing plan"", he said, had failed. This autumn the head of the US division got sacked; Tavares survived.', ""But he couldn't fix the problem or repair relationships with dealers, which partly stemmed from the fact the vehicles were too expensive. Lots of cheaper petrol-engined models had gone out of production with no direct replacements."", ""Stellantis issued a profit warning and the stock price fell. Great way to annoy the shareholders. This, it's very likely, is the cause of his exit."", ""OK, let's look at what the guy did. He is a great petrolhead, often racing and rallying at weekends. He was a late convert to electric drive, and embraced it pragmatically. His EV platforms, including the one under the Peugeot e-3008, can also run on petrol."", 'He is a strong advocate of action on climate change, but also hates regulations that, as he sees it, pushes up car prices for ordinary people. The fact the same rules can erode car company profits also drives his arguments, of course.', '', 'Get all the latest news, reviews and exclusives, direct to your inbox.', 'He has an astonishing ability to spot cost savings, whether in factories or in the supply chain or distribution network. Boring to the likes of us, but critical to making enough money to launch good new cars.', ""He was always nakedly ambitious too. Having started at Renault he transferred to Nissan, and by 2011 was number two at Nissan. He made the mistake of saying, when asked, that one day he'd like to run the company. The man actually running the company at the time, Carlos Ghosn, took the hump and Tavares was very rapidly shown the door. An example of how the fate of car companies do turn on the vastness of the egos at the top."", '', ""Tavares soon found a new berth, in 2014, at the top of PSA. At the time it was in immense trouble. He rapidly turned it around, with financial discipline but also vastly improved cars. He wanted to shift upmarket and founded DS, always saying it'd take a long time to get fully established."", ""Then in 2017 he bought Vauxhall and Opel from GM. To some (including me, and I told him so) it looked like lunacy, as GM had lost money on those for decades. Yet again he made the turnaround, by moving fast to integrate them onto PSA's engineering."", ""More drama followed when PSA and FCA joined three years ago. It was called a merger but PSA was the healthier outfit at the time. It was going to need speed to bring the operations together, but the ex-Chrysler Group is very different from the European operations and there's not a whole lot of potential shared efforts. Even in Europe the Fiat, Alfa and Maserati parts remain distinct from the ex-PSA bits."", ""We don't yet know who'll replace Tavares.

Stellantis had almost 1.5 million vehicles in its U.S. inventory at the end of 2023, about 50% more than it had a year earlier."", 'Why so many? Stellantis, like most automakers, books revenue when vehicles are shipped to dealers. From the company\'s point of view, those vehicles were ""sold,"" and those sales were counted in its year-end results -- even as they sat on dealer lots.', ""But why weren't they selling to customers? Simply put, Tavares had demanded higher retail prices to support his margin goals, but those prices were turning away too many customers. Dealers were struggling to move the metal they had in stock even as more vehicles continued to arrive on their lots."", 'Unwinding that inventory backlog-- with margin-crushing discounts -- has been the story of 2024 for Stellantis.', ""The company warned in September that its adjusted operating margin for 2024 would be 7% at best, down from earlier guidance for over 10%, as it works to get its U.S. inventory down to just 330,000 vehicles by year's end. Baked into that was a plan to reduce vehicle shipments by more than 200,000 in the second half of 2024, and to offer even higher incentives on the 2024 -- and 2023 -- vehicles still on dealer lots."", ""How should Stellantis proceed once its huge inventory sell-down is accomplished? Apparently, the board and Tavares had different answers to that question, and that's why Tavares is no longer CEO."", ""Here is my carefully thought-out opinion: I wouldn't touch Stellantis's stock. Not yet."", ""Right now, it's a company with too many brands, too much inventory, too many discounts, and probably too many factories -- and no superstar CEO to help offset those concerns."", ""Before I would even consider investing, I would have to hear the company's plan for getting itself back on a sustainable path. It seems likely that any plan will require painful cuts, and such cuts may hurt Stellantis stock further in the near term.

While official reasons point to strategic differences, the difficulties encountered by the Group, particularly in North America, and the sometimes judged unrealistic ambitions of its Dare Forward 2030 plan, raise the question of the viability of the targets set. Does this departure offer an opportunity to review the automotive giant's priorities?"", 'Carlos Tavares had made Dare Forward 2030 a bold plan to transform Stellantis into a world leader in electrification and sustainable mobility. Among its key targets for 2024 were sales of 200 billion euros, a double-digit operating margin, 8 % of R&D spending, and a strong ramp-up in electric vehicles.', 'However, recent financial results have shown that the road to these ambitions is fraught with difficulties. Third-quarter 2024 sales plunged by 27 %, and consolidated sales fell by 20 % year-on-year. Reasons cited include production interruptions, overstocking in North America, and a difficult economic environment in Europe.', ""These financial setbacks exacerbated internal tensions, particularly in the face of a board of directors increasingly skeptical of Tavares' strategy."", ""Chairman of the Board of Directors, John Elkann, seemed dissatisfied with Stellantis' sales performance in North Americaa historically profitable region. Dealer and union discontent, combined with errors in inventory management and an electrification strategy deemed too rapid, created a climate of tension."", 'The Union of Automobile Workers (UAW) has openly criticized Tavares\' management, particularly concerning the delay in reopening the Belvidere plant. These criticisms came to a head at the beginning of the year, when UAW head Shawn Fain called his work ""lousy"".', 'Added to this are minor communication problems, such as with Nathalie Knight, former CFO of Stellantis, who confirmed that it was open to a Maserati salebefore the group issued a denial a few days later. Nathalie Knight left Stellantis a few months later.', 'The Dare Forward 2030 plan aimed to transform Stellantis through a series of ambitious objectives, notably in terms of reducing CO2 emissions, vertically integrating electrical components, increasing the sales mix of electrified vehicles, but also cutting more than 30,000 jobs, mainly in Europe and North America between 2021 and 2023... Si important milestones reachedsuch as the production of e-motors and electrified transmissions, these advances have been overshadowed by major operational challenges.', ""In North America, sales of Jeep and RAM models suffered, as did Stellantis' ability to compete with Chinese automakers in the electric market. In Europe, massive investment in the transition to electric vehicles weighed on margins. The quest for double-digit profitability, the cornerstone of the Dare Forward plan, now seems out of reach. in such a tense context."", 'The departure of Carlos Tavares opens the door to an in-depth revision of the Dare Forward plan. The Board could opt for a more realistic approach, focused on adapting to the realities of local markets. Tensions with dealers, employees and American unions will have to be eased, while a more measured strategy could be envisaged to maintain competitiveness in Europe in the face of the Chinese offensive.', 'A new Dare Forward plan, tailored to economic and industrial realitiescould be launched in 2025 under the leadership of the future CEO. Challenges include boosting sales in North America, consolidating gains in the European EV market, and better managing stakeholder relations.', ""The Group needs to strike a balance between ambition and pragmatism. Tavares' successor will have the tough task of reconciling the board, employees and investors around a common project."", ""If Dare Forward 2030 is adjusted, it will not be a denial of Tavares' vision, but a necessary realignment to face an uncertain future. Stellantis is playing for high stakes: not only is it a question of turning around the figures, but also of regaining the confidence of the markets (-45 % since the start of the year) and consumers."", 'Thank you for the comprehensive information. What tavares achieved will remain remarkable in terms of the strict ability to succeed in a merger between automotive groups. But the figures were crazy.
