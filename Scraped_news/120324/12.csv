"Countries fail to agree deal to ""end the world's plastic pollution crisis""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-treaty-negotiations-pollution-crisis/,"['Watch CBS News', 'By Duarte Dias, Tracy J. Wholf', 'Updated on: December 2, 2024 / 3:36 AM EST / CBS News', ""Delegates from 175 countries spent last week in Busan, South Korea, attempting to negotiate a legally binding treaty to address global plastic pollution, but they failed to bridge significant gaps in opinion over how much to limit new production, and the summit wrapped up on Sunday with nothing more than an agreement to keep talking. The gathering was the fifth and intended final phase of multiyear talks of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC-5)."", 'By the final hours of the negotiations over the weekend, 95 countries had come together and agreed to reject any treaty that failed to include a legally binding phase-out and eventual ban on some harmful products and chemicals. The last draft treaty under consideration on Sunday did include some bans, but some critics — and crucially, some delegations — felt the measures were insufficient, and there was no deal to be had.', 'The delegations agreed only that another session would be scheduled in 2025, tentatively being calling ""INC-5.2,"" to finalize a deal.', ""The talks were stymied by a wide gap in opinions between delegations from small, often developing nations and the world's more advanced economies — along with some major global corporations and business lobbies whose presence was, in itself, controversial."", 'The nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law said Wednesday that fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists at INC-5 had collectively formed the single largest delegation. The 220 registered corporate lobbyists at the summit outnumber all the delegates representing European Union nations combined.', '""Their strategy is designed to preserve the financial interests of countries and companies who are putting their fossil-fueled profits above human health, human rights and the future of the planet,"" said Delphine Levi Alvares, CIEL\'s global petrochemicals campaign manager.', ""The goal of the summit was to finalize a legally binding treaty to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that enters the environment and address the scourge of waste already clogging the world's waterways and landfills and contaminating everything from the food and water we consume to our arteries."", 'The INC-5 delegations were tasked with defining reduction targets, determining how to regulate hazardous waste and chemicals and outlining criteria to manage the entire life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal. ', ""There's little dispute that something must be done to tackle plastic pollution, but how to do it remains contentious."", '""We are confronted with the alarming reality that plastic pollution is set to triple by 2060, with levels expected to rise 2.5 times from 2015 levels by 2040,"" the delegation from Canada, which was among those pushing hard for a binding treaty to cap plastic production and phase out some toxic substances entirely, said in a statement before the summit concluded. ""Global restrictions, prohibitions and phase-outs on certain harmful plastic products and chemicals of concern in plastics are essential for protecting both human health and the environment.""', 'The idea of a cap on plastic production was deeply unpopular at the summit among nations whose economies still lean heavily on the production of both plastics and fossil fuels, which are essential to making plastic, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States.', 'A ban on certain chemicals used in some plastics that are known to be toxic to the environment and dangerous to human health also proved contentious. ', 'In a statement on Sunday, the American Chemistry Council, one of the biggest industry groups supporting plastic production in the U.S., said it was ""crucial"" that any treaty be ""focused on addressing the primary cause of plastic pollution — mismanaged waste,"" rather than on limiting the production of new materials.', 'There is historical precedent for focused product bans, including the decades-old Montreal Protocol, which saw the production of ozone-depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) barred universally.', 'Island nations and developing countries are — just as with climate change — among those most directly impacted by plastic pollution, but least responsible for producing the waste. Some of these countries say a plastic pollution treaty is vital to preserve their fragile ecosystems and public health.', 'Speaking on behalf of the Small Islands Developing States group at the talks, Penivao Moealofa, of the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said it was ""already a challenge to manage our own plastic waste, and it is an injustice to us to continue to manage others\' plastic waste, especially when we contribute to less than 1.3% of the total global plastic waste.""', 'If policies are not implemented to change things, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says ""annual plastics production, use and waste generation are projected to increase by 70% in 2040 compared to 2020,"" when the world churned out roughly 480 million tons of new plastic products.', '""After another week of hard-fought and frustrating negotiations in Busan, the meeting has closed with governments no closer to agreeing on a solution to the worsening plastic crisis,"" the World Wildlife Fund\'s head of global plastics policy, Eirik Lindebjerg, lamented in a statement on Sunday. He said that over the 1,000 days since INC-5\'s mission to hammer out a treaty was established, ""more than 800 million tonnes (882 million tons) of plastic has been produced, over 30 million tonnes of which have leaked into our ocean, harming wildlife, poisoning ecosystems and destroying lives, to say nothing of the plastic that has been sent to landfill or burnt.""', ""A group of 68 countries or blocs, including Canada, the EU, Mexico and Australia, have come to be known as the High Ambition Coalition (HAC). They've backed the goal of stopping all new plastic pollution from entering the environment by 2040, and they believe countries that create the most plastic, including the U.S., should pay to transition the global economy away from the reliance on new plastics."", 'In a joint statement for INC-5, the HAC had highlighted the importance of creating binding global rules to ensure products are designed with circularity in mind. Circularity is the concept in sustainability of reusing and repurposing products, rather than using and then discarding them, to reduce the amount of waste.', 'The petrochemical industry has been broadly supportive of a treaty, but it firmly opposes production caps and favors other solutions, such as recycling. But as CBS News has previously reported, recycling many plastics is incredibly challenging, expensive, and has not been scaled up to anywhere near the level that would make it a viable solution to the problem.', ""Scientists have suggested that, given the pace at which new plastic products are being manufactured, recycling won't be sufficient to combat its impact, and reduced production should be the first priority. "", 'In August, Reuters reported a shift in U.S. government policy to support a global treaty calling for a reduction in plastic production, but three months later, nonprofit news website Grist reported the Biden administration was backtracking on that support ahead of INC-5.', 'The U.S. State Department has called for an agreement that works ""towards ending plastic pollution entering the environment by 2040,"" but the American policy leans largely on recycling and circularity as primary mechanisms to achieve the goal — solutions supported by the petroleum and chemical industries.', ""Another factor weighing on the minds of many delegates in Busan was the fact that the U.S. delegation was sent by the soon-to-depart Biden administration. There's concern that any commitments Washington does make could be abandoned by the incoming Trump team."", '© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.', 'Copyright ©2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

It said: The objective of this Convention is to protect human health and the environment from plastic pollution, including in the marine environment [based on a comprehensive approach that address the full life cycle of plastics]. The life cycle of plastics begins from raw material to produce plastics to final disposal of the plastic product.', 'The preamble is not bracketed and hence indicates countries are agreeable to the overall approach of an instrument to deal with plastic pollution.', 'The Preamble which runs into a full page states: ""Noting with concern that the high and rapidly increasing levels of plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, represent a serious environmental and human health problem, negatively impacting the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development,..Acknowledging the important role played by plastics in human society, and stressing the importance of establishing effective mechanisms throughout the plastic lifecycle to promote plastic circularity and prevent leakage of plastics in the environment.""', 'The definition of ""plastic pollution"" also remained bracketed. It said: [pollution caused by or released throughout the life cycle of plastics] [all emissions and releases resulting from plastic production, use, waste management and leakage from different sources and pathways] and in the article on ""Sustainable Production"" no article also was an option.', 'Almost the entire text on ""Financial Resources and Mechanism"" remained bracketed and hence contested. This was mainly to do with with how developed country parties would provide funds for transition from plastics or for implementation of the legally binding instrument in developing countries.', 'On single use plastic products; toys and children’s products and food contact material containing certain chemicals including BPA have been given tentative phaseout dates all of which are bracketed.', 'On Friday and Saturday, in states-only consultations with the INC Chair, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, three issues were on the table: products and chemicals of concern as used in plastic products (draft article 3); supply (draft article 6); and finance, including the establishment of a financial mechanism (draft article 11), the International Institute of Sustainable Development said.', 'Observers said petro states were using various delaying tactics to resist any curbs on plastics production through a lifecycle based approach to phasing out plastics. On Saturday evening delegates were still unsure if INC 5 would deliver a treaty at all, it was still unclear whether “we’ll be shedding happy tears on Sunday, or weeping,” said a delegate.', 'Some countries flagged the lack of progress at INC 5 talks on Sunday morning. PlasticsTreaty needs to address production, and hazardous products and chemical of concern, delegates from Mexico said while Panama and Fiji asked those obstructing an ambitious treaty to get out of the talks.', '""Too many brackets, too many options. We\'ve made significant progress from the previous draft to this, which could potentially be the final treaty text. However, we need to pole vault, not leapfrog, to finalize and reach agreement and consensus on critical areas. The treaty must go beyond waste management to address the entire lifecycle of plastics,"" said Swati Singh Sambyal, Waste and Circular Economy Expert, GRID-Arendal.', '', '', '']"

The opportunity to secure an impactful plastics treaty that protects our health, biodiversity and climate remains within reach.”', 'The week-long talks, known as INC-5, which were supposed to be the last before the first treaty to cut plastic pollution was signed, ended without agreement in the early hours of Monday in a deadlock over the inclusion of cuts to plastic production between so-called ambition countries and fossil fuel states, which object to any reductions in production.', 'More than 100 countries supported a draft text that included legally binding global reductions in plastic production and phasing out certain chemicals and single-use plastic products.', 'But the resistance of countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia to production reductions, according to statements in their submissions to the treaty talks, led negotiators to concede defeat. They acknowledged they had failed to bridge serious divisions over the aims of the treaty.', 'Abdulrahman al-Gwaiz, the Saudi Arabian delegate, indicated that production cuts remained a red line for many countries. “If you address plastic pollution, there should be no problem with producing plastics, because the problem is the pollution, not the plastics themselves,” he said.', 'In response to the failure of the talks, countries pushing for production cuts continued to call for legally binding reductions.

Countries have different interests, they present them and the conversations then have to take place … seeking to find that common ground.”', 'No date or location has been set for resumed talks. Saudi Arabia and other countries are trying to ensure that they start no sooner than mid-2025.', 'Record numbers of plastic industry lobbyists attended the talks in Busan, with 220 fossil fuel and chemical industry representatives present.

As the talks in South Korea approached the fifth and final day on Sunday, Rwanda\'s delegation presented a statement on behalf of 85 countries demanding a target to reduce plastic production and the elimination of harmful products and chemicals. Mexico\'s negotiators followed that with a pledge signed by 95 countries that they will not accept a treaty without binding global bans and phaseouts on harmful products.', 'Despite those demands by the majority of countries in the negotiations, observers said that a small number of petroleum-producing countries stymied progress and prevented key items from making it into the final text.', 'In a statement on behalf of the Arab Group of nations, Saudi Arabia said it would ""reject any proposals that impose undue burden on industries"" such as limits on plastic production.', '""It\'s disheartening,"" Erin Simon, vice president and head of plastic waste and business at the environmental nonprofit World Wildlife Fund, told Newsweek via email.

It's their last chance before an end-of-year deadline to agree on a plan to stem a crisis that threatens the environment and human health."", ""The world produces about 400 million metric tons of plastic waste every year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. That's about the sum total of how much every human on the planet weighs. Most plastic ends up in places like oceans, shorelines and landfills, where it breaks down into tiny pieces called microplastics that have been found in every corner of the environment and inside human bodies. The problem is getting worse, with plastic pollution expected to soar in the coming decades. So in 2022, U.N. member states said they'd write a legally binding agreement to keep plastic waste out of the environment."", 'But for months, the talks have been deadlocked. Plastic is made from fossil fuels. Environmental groups, scientists and human rights activists say the oil and gas industry, along with major producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia, have delayed progress and blocked measures that could hurt demand for their products.', ""However, some observers of the negotiations now see a path for countries to broker a deal. That's due in part to signals from the Biden administration in recent months that the U.S. might support more aggressive actions to reduce plastic pollution."", '""We have all the right conditions at play,"" says Erin Simon, head of plastic waste and business at the World Wildlife Fund.

Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution in Ottawa, Canada, in April.', 'A major sticking point in these negotiations has been a measure to limit the production of new plastic. Scientists and environmental advocates, along with attorneys general from New York, California and eight other states, say that the world manufactures too much plastic to manage effectively and that countries need to cap production to have any hope of making a dent in pollution.', ""Plastic-makers see that sort of regulation as a threat to their business. The industry wants negotiators to focus on creating what's called a circular economy, where plastic is recycled and reused to prevent waste."", ""But investigations, including by NPR, have found that the plastics industry promoted recycling for decades even though officials long knew that it probably wouldn't work on a large scale. Former industry officials have said the goal was to avoid regulation and ensure demand for plastics kept growing."", ""Current officials have said those investigations don't accurately portray today's industry."", 'Matt Seaholm, chief executive of the Plastics Industry Association, a trade group, said in a statement that his organization supports an ""ambitious"" treaty but warned against policies like production caps that he said would hurt plastic manufacturers ""without reaching our shared sustainability goals.""', ""Countries are also debating whether to regulate the chemicals that go into plastics. A study this year found that plastics contain more than 4,200 hazardous chemicals, the vast majority of which aren't regulated globally, according to the researchers. The plastics industry argues that chemicals should be regulated by national governments, not by a global treaty on plastic pollution. But scientists and environmentalists calling for global chemical regulations note that plastic waste — as well as the chemicals the plastic is made from — doesn't stay in the country where it's produced. It travels around the world in rivers and oceans."", 'Other issues under consideration include setting design standards to ensure plastic is safe to reuse and recycle, requiring companies to use some recycled material in their plastic products and raising money to help pay for waste management infrastructure, especially in developing countries.', '""From the vantage point of science, it\'s very clear what actions we need. So, there\'s no ambiguity there. It\'s just a matter of political will,"" says Douglas McCauley, a professor of environmental science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has studied ways to cut plastic pollution.', 'And McCauley says world leaders have plenty of reasons to act. ""If you care about fighting cancer, well, there\'s a win here. If you care about environmental justice, there\'s a win here. If you care about the environment — oceans, rivers, all the rest — there\'s a win. If you care about climate change, there\'s a win,"" McCauley says.', 'A spokesperson for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said in a statement that the U.S. supports measures that address plastic supplies and the chemicals the industry uses. ""Global plastic production is projected to triple by 2060, overwhelming solid waste management systems and contributing to pollution,"" the statement said. ""An outsized proportion of that increase will be in the growth of single-use plastic products that will ultimately lead to more plastic pollution.""', 'People look for reusable material at a garbage dump filled with plastic and other waste on the outskirts of Jammu, India.', 'Observers of the negotiations say countries could produce a strong treaty in South Korea even if they leave some details to be worked out later.', '""You can\'t get everything concluded in Busan,"" says Magnus Løvold, a project manager at the Norwegian Academy of International Law. ""But you can set a starting point that is credible for [the] governance of plastics internationally"" in the coming years.', 'But time appears to be running short to lay that groundwork. When countries agreed to write a treaty to end plastic pollution, they set a goal to finish this year. Negotiators often extend talks when they run into gridlock. However, McCauley says participants in these deliberations seem committed to sticking to the original timeline.', 'For developing nations especially, letting the talks drag out could sink their efforts to get a strong treaty, Simon says.

Extracting the fossil fuels needed from underground is directly associated with greenhouse gas emissions, for example due to leaky mines, wells and pipes that contribute to rising methane emissions.', 'Overall, extracting oil, gas and coal from the ground accounts for around one-fifth of plastics production emissions.', 'The rest of the emissions associated with plastics production come from the processes required to first convert the fossil fuels into plastics. The fossil fuels are refined to produce petrochemical feedstocks, such as ethane and naphtha.', 'In one of the most emissions-intensive steps of the process, these feedstocks are broken apart in a high-pressure steam cracker to produce chemicals called monomers. Finally, the monomers are joined into chains called polymers, which are used to construct plastics.', 'The remaining plastic emissions – which account for around 10% of the total – are emitted when materials are disposed of. One study finds that in this “end-of-life” stage, only around 9% of all plastics ever have been recycled, while 79% ended up in landfill and 12% were incinerated.', 'The world’s consumption of oil is currently around 100m barrels per day. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) special report, around half of the oil produced globally is currently used to fuel road transport – and this is being squeezed by the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). ', 'Along with renewables substituting for oil-fired electricity generation and increasingly efficient engines, EVs are the major driver of expectations that global oil demand could soon peak. ', 'Petrochemicals feedstocks – chemical substances derived from fossil fuels that can then be used to make products such as plastics, rubbers and fertilisers – are widely seen as the last growth market for global oil demand. As such, the future of the $700bn plastics production industry is a key concern of the fossil-fuel industry.', 'Currently, only 14m barrels per day are used as a petrochemical feedstock – the majority of which is used to produce plastics. But the IEA expects this to grow further in the coming years, even as demand in other sectors falls.', 'The figure above shows projected annual growth in oil demand from petrochemical feedstocks (red) and other sectors, such as road transport and aviation (blue), up to 2030, according to the IEA’s Oil 2024 report. ', 'Numbers above zero indicate an increase in oil demand compared to the previous year, while numbers below zero mean a decrease.', 'To have a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, humanity can only emit a further 200bn tonnes of CO2, according to the latest estimate from the emissions gap report from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).', 'Unless there is a change in current trends, plastics production is expected to use up a significant proportion of this carbon budget. ', 'A landmark 2024 report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) outlines two scenarios for plastics growth between now and 2050. Under its “conservative growth scenario”, the report says that plastics production will grow by 2.5% per year, based on projections of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).', 'Meanwhile, an alternative scenario is defined by a much more rapid 4% per year growth scenario, based on projections from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)', 'Carbon Brief finds that, under the conservative growth scenario, annual “lifecycle” emissions from plastics could double by 2050, reaching 5.2GtCO2e. Under this scenario, plastics production, use and disposal would cumulatively emit 104GtCO2e between 2024 and 2050, consuming more than half of the remaining carbon budget.', 'Under the rapid growth scenario, cumulative emissions would be 130GtCO2e – or around 65% of the remaining carbon budget.', 'The rise in annual emissions from plastics, including all stages from fossil-fuel extraction to plastics disposal, are shown above. The black line indicates historical emissions, while the dark blue line shows the conservative growth scenario from the LBNL report, originally taken from the OECD.', 'At the negotiations in South Korea, countries will attempt to ratify a legally binding agreement on curbing plastics pollution.', 'Daniela Duran Gonzalez is a senior legal campaigner focused on the plastics treaty at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL). She tells Carbon Brief that when discussing emissions from plastics at INC-5, experts usually focus on limiting production because plastics production is “challenging to decarbonise”.', 'At the negotiations, countries will consider a global target to limit plastics production, Duran explains. She likens this to the Paris Agreement 1.5C warming limit, arguing that “it gives us a north star, but it doesn’t provide any enforceable obligation to any country to actually achieve it”.', 'If it is agreed, the treaty could stipulate different ways to achieve this overall target. The first option, which Duran says is “very vague”, is for countries to all work towards the target at their own discretion, without any targets set. ', 'Another method with more accountability would be for countries to set their own voluntary, non-legally binding and non-enforceable measures – similar to the climate pledges (“nationally determined contributions”) that countries submit under the Paris Agreement. ', 'The most enforceable method on the table would be to set legally binding targets for each country, Duran explains. She says this could work in a similar way to the Montreal Protocol, which successfully cut global emissions of substances that deplete the ozone later. ', 'To set targets, countries would need to agree on a baseline year to measure against, a goal and a deadline for the goal to be met.', 'For example, at the last set of negotiations (INC-4) earlier this year in Ottawa, Rwanda and Peru put forward a global target for a 40% reduction on 2025 levels by 2040. Under this scenario, plastics would emit 52GtCO2e cumulatively between 2024 and 2050. ', 'Others have suggested a cap on plastic production at 2025 levels – a scenario that would see the production, use and disposal of plastics cumulatively emit 76bn tonnes of CO2e between 2024 and 2050. These scenarios are shown in light blue and blue on the graph above.', 'In early November, Ecuadorian ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso – chair of the INC – developed and submitted his non-paper three to the committee for the talks. This document set out his proposed basis for the negotiations.', 'Under the proposal, a single party would be able to veto any decision, similar to the process under the UN climate regime. WWF warns that this “can result in a stagnant and dead treaty, incapable of adapting to changing developments and circumstances in the future”. ', 'Developed countries have already been accused of bowing to pressure from lobbyists seeking to avoid any caps on plastics production at the international negotiations. According to CIEL analysis, at the last set of talks, 196 fossil fuel and industry lobbyists registered, up from the 143 who registered at the previous discussions in Nairobi. ', 'Duran tells Carbon Brief that plastics production is an “existential” issue for Gulf countries, whose economies currently rely on continued oil and gas extraction.', 'As a result, she says that these countries likely will not be “negotiating in good faith” at the INC-5 and “will never accept a treaty that has any mention of plastic production, because it’s their lifeline”. She argues for other countries to “overcome this idea of universal ratification” to ensure a “good” treaty. ', 'According to expert interviews conducted by the University of Portsmouth, crucial outcomes from the negotiations include deciding on a voting mechanism as a backup if consensus cannot be reached.', '(The UN climate regime must take all decisions by consensus because rules on how it makes decisions – including voting – were never agreed.)', 'INC-5 negotiations could lead to a reduction in plastics production, which could be key to limiting emissions from the industry. However, decarbonising the production, use and disposal of plastics could also help to bring down the carbon footprint of the sector.', 'One way to reduce emissions is to recycle plastics. Only 9% of plastics that have ever been produced have been recycled. However, the present-day number is likely higher, as recycling rates around the world are rising.', 'A report by the IEA says that most plastics recycling today is physical or “mechanical”. This involves grinding down plastics without changing their chemical structure, but can lead to the quality of plastics degrading over time.', 'Meanwhile, chemical recycling is becoming more popular, it says. This involves breaking down the plastics back into small chemical sections called monomers, which can be used to make new plastics. This method generally produces a higher-quality plastic, but it can be more energy intensive, resulting in higher emissions.', 'Another option is to switch from using petrochemical feedstocks, which are derived from fossil fuels, to using alternative feedstocks. ', 'Bio-based feedstocks, such as starch, can also be used to produce plastics. These biological materials draw down carbon as they grow and also do not have the emissions associated with fossil fuel extraction.', 'Meanwhile, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) can be used to draw down CO2 from chemical plants before it enters the atmosphere. The captured CO2 can be combined with hydrogen to generate synthetic feedstocks. Using renewable energy to produce the hydrogen for this process can help to keep the materials’ carbon footprint low. ', 'The IEA report says that the “use of alternative feedstocks, including bio-based feedstock, remains a niche industry due to a considerable cost gap and competing demand with other sectors”.', 'A 2021 study explores four pathways through which the global plastics industry could reach net-zero by 2050. These are: a recycling pathway; a CCUS pathway; a biomass pathway; and a circular carbon pathway that combines the three approaches in an “optimal” way.', 'The combined pathway, shown above, is the only scenario that reaches net-zero emissions. ', 'The chart shows the flow of carbon (in million tonnes) through the full lifecycle of plastics under a net-zero scenario in the year 2050. The width of each arrow corresponds to the amount of carbon flowing. In this scenario, around 38% of plastic feedstocks would be made from biomass, 17% from synthetic feedstocks, 44% from recycling and less than 1% from fossil fuels. This scenario would require an effective recycling rate of around 61%, with only 5% of plastics going to landfill and 34% ending up in the atmosphere through incineration.', 'However, the authors highlight how challenging it would be to fully decarbonise plastics, if production levels continue to rise. ', 'Cutting emissions while production increases would require a significant uptick in the rate of plastics recycling, they note – and the feasibility of fully decarbonising plastics production will be limited by the amount of renewable energy and biomass available to the sector. ', 'In the scenario above, the plastics sector would require 9,900 terawatt hours of renewable electricity (more than global renewable generation in 2023 or 14% of renewables generation under IEA net-zero scenario in 2050), and 19.3 exajoules of biomass (11% of “untapped” biomass potential in 2050).', 'Duran tells Carbon Brief that, while the INC-5 can talk about limiting production levels, it has not “entered into the discussion of decarbonising the petrochemical industry”. ', 'She says that there are many reasons for this, including political factors and the uncertainty around measures such as CCUS. However, she also says that “decarbonisation is an issue of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)”.', 'She explains that the UNFCCC cannot make rulings on plastics production, but can set out frameworks for the transparency and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions caused by plastic production. ', 'The Carbon Brief analysis on the lifecycle greenhouse emissions in this article is based on using the production-related emissions figures from the LBNL study (Karali et al., 2024), and combining this with an estimate of the end of life emissions from OECD data.', 'In order to make these datasets compatible, it is assumed that the percentage share of emissions from end of life, calculated from OECD data, remains constant at 10.8% and then this is applied to the production-related emissions from LBNL.', 'Due to differences in methodology, scope and poor availability of detailed data, generally, there are varying estimates of the climate impact from plastics. This analysis uses the values from LBNL study because it is the most recent and comprehensive evaluation of the climate impact from plastics, as confirmed by an expert that Carbon Brief spoke to.', 'However, the emissions measured in that study are higher than commonly cited estimates from the OECD, which suggests that production emissions in 2019 are around 28% lower than the LBNL estimate. This highlights the large uncertainty in measuring the climate impact of plastic, but the LBNL study authors also note that their higher estimate is “due to the increased level of granularity in modelling production processes, technologies and routes”. Their study also has no “by-product’ assumption”, which they say leads to an underestimation of the climate impact of plastics in other studies if they do not attribute emissions by mass across all the products of a given chemical process.', 'Historical data for plastics emissions is taken from a combination of LBNL, OECD and Cabernard et al (2021). Due to differences in methodology and uncertainty in the data, these different datasets do not match exactly and, therefore, have been scaled based on overlapping years to ensure that they are aligned with the values from the LBNL.', 'In order to model future emissions in a consistent manner, a constant emissions intensity per tonne of plastic produced from the LBNL study is used (4.9tCO2e per tonne of plastic, excluding end-of-life emissions) and applied to the production projections for each of the three scenarios presented (2.5% growth, cap at 2025 levels, 40% reduction from 2025 levels by 2040). ', 'The baseline plastics-production projections are taken from the LBNL study, which uses OECD projections of plastics demand under a 2.5% growth scenario and assumes that annual plastics production matches annual demand. The projected end-of-life emissions from plastics are then calculated by using the assumed constant percentage share of emissions (10.8%) from end of life, as per above. For the 40% reduction scenario, it is assumed that production levels continue to reduce at the same rate between 2040 and 2050.', 'Ireland election 2024: What the manifestos say on climate change and energy ', 'INTERNATIONAL POLICY', '27.11.24', 'Analysis: China’s emissions have now caused more global warming than EU', 'EMISSIONS', '19.11.24', 'Guest post: How COP29 host Azerbaijan could boost growth through climate action', 'COP29 BAKU', '01.11.24', 'Analysis: Solar surge will send coal power tumbling by 2030, IEA data reveals', 'INTERNATIONAL POLICY', '18.10.24', 'Data analysis by Verner Viisainen.

That’s more than the weight of all humanity. Birds choke on plastic bags. Whales get ensnared by fishing lines. Litter breaks down into tiny particles that end up in food, water, and air.', 'It’s a global problem that needs a global solution. So, in 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly called for an international treaty to end plastic pollution. The agreement would curb plastic pollution at every stage of product life cycle including design, manufacturing, and disposal. After four meetings, this week in Busan, South Korea, representatives from 175 countries are hoping to finalize a treaty.', 'The parties agree that recycling should be improved and that less developed countries need help with handling plastic waste. Some nations are still hoping for a global cap on the amount of new plastic made, which continues to soar. But a coalition of countries that produce the petroleum used to make plastic, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia, is firmly opposed to that idea.', 'Among the scientists in Busan is ecotoxicologist Bethanie Carney Almroth of the University of Gothenburg. She co-founded the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, a group of about 400 experts who are advising member nations about plastic pollution.', 'Carney Almroth, who has studied the toxic effects of chemicals and plastics on fish, spoke with ScienceInsider before she left for South Korea. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.', 'A: We’re going to need a lot of solutions. All the models point to reducing production as one of the most important. So options could include a moratorium on building production facilities, eventual caps on production, and then reduction of production.', 'Next on the list is chemicals. There are 16,000 chemicals used in plastics. We know that 4200 are hazardous. We lack data on more than 10,000. There are very few requirements for reporting. There were calls for bans and restrictions on chemicals of concern in the original iterations of the treaty draft. That has since morphed into proposed restrictions and bans on problematic and nonessential products, such as single-use packaging.', 'Another problem is that a lot of places in the world lack solid waste management. That needs to be improved and requires financing.', 'A: The chair drafted a bare bones skeleton of a treaty. Production is no longer explicitly in it. There’s a reference to “supply” that needs to be defined. The provision on chemicals is weaker than what I would like, but a lot of countries may get behind what is currently proposed. There are provisions on improving waste management and on compliance, implementation, and financing.', 'I’m viewing this document as a starting point. To really be effective, the treaty must be globally mandated with obligations that need to be nationally implemented with compliance mechanisms.', 'A: If the member states pull this off in Korea, it will be the fastest negotiated multilateral environmental agreement in the history of the world. Others have taken decades.', 'I am choosing to feel optimistic. There were a number of countries coming out publicly supporting production reduction, though this has been a difficult discussion.', 'This is the last scheduled negotiating meeting. A sixth meeting could be added, but I think that would be contentious. Most countries really want to finish these negotiations, so we need to support them in finalizing an effective treaty that can respond to emerging data and evidence.', 'A: What do you see as the role of scientists going forward? The treaty should create some sort of science policy interface, or dedicated expert group. There should also be, importantly, an inclusion of not only academic scientists or experts, but also other knowledge holders. Indigenous peoples of the small island states are just inundated with plastics that they’re not producing and not importing.', 'There will also be a place for doing research on the effectiveness of the obligations that are put into place.

Researchers are hopeful a strong treaty will emerge from the fifth — and final — session of the negotiations, but there is a high chance that any agreement will be weak or delayed. Until a global consensus is reached, however, many cities and nations are introducing their own policies.', '“Some countries are pre-emptively protecting themselves, regardless of what happens with the treaty,” says Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at New Zealand’s Cawthron Institute in Nelson and a co-lead of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, an independent group attending the meeting as an observer.', 'These policies showcase what can work, researchers say, but also highlight why a global effort is important. Some groups, including the scientists’ coalition, support a treaty that will reduce production of non-essential plastics, which have skyrocketed to unsustainable levels. But some nations, particularly those that make petrochemicals, want the treaty to focus on waste management instead, including steps such as recycling.', '“If we miss this opportunity to do unified policy-making with standardized guidelines, we’re going to set ourselves back decades or more,” says Douglas McCauley at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who published modelling work on plastics policies earlier this month1.', 'More than 90 nations and territories have passed full or partial bans on single-use plastic products such as carrier bags. These bans can be very effective. One analysis showed that bans in five US states and cities together cut consumption of single-use plastic bags by about six billion bags per year2. Several studies have also shown huge reductions in plastic litter in waterways, says McCauley. Even fees can work. A litter survey in the United Kingdom found that the number of plastic bags found on beaches dropped by 80% after the nation introduced a mandatory fee for single-use carrier bags, although other forms of litter had increased.', 'But bans that are poorly designed or enforced are likely to be ineffective. California, for example, allowed shops to switch to thicker, reusable carrier bags — but people still threw them away, leading to a higher rate of plastic disposal than before. Policies need to be monitored and reviewed, says McCauley. “You have to put a policy in place, take data and then whack-a-mole the loopholes.”', 'Many nations and US states require companies that produce plastic packaging to pay for it to be recycled, which can boost recycling rates. In Spain,for example, the government introduced an ‘extended producer responsibilities’ policy, and the recycling of paper and plastics rose from 5% up to 81%.', 'Such policies are also meant to incentivize companies to redesign their packaging, but because most of the fees are based on weight, they mainly influence the amount of packaging used rather than its composition. A good idea, says Richard Thompson, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth, UK, and a co-lead of the scientists’ coalition, is to have a policy that rewards or mandates inclusion of recycled content in products: in the United Kingdom, for example, plastic producers pay a tax of £217.85 (US$274) per tonne of plastic, but only for packaging that’s less than 30% recycled. Such incentives “will pull demand in the right way”, says Thompson.', 'As with all policies, there are some good, some bad, says Farrelly.

Observers and negotiators were quickly openly discussing the road beyond Busan, as many said the talks were destined for failure.', 'The draft treaty text, released late on Sunday ahead of the final plenary, was riddled with brackets – a UN shorthand for unresolved provisions. These included a range of options on some of the most critical issues, including binding targets to cut plastic production.', 'In practical terms, the brackets symbolised a failure to achieve consensus. The ambiguity left those countries worst affected by plastic pollution and campaigners visibly frustrated, as it meant no clear commitments had been made.', 'Describing the state of the negotiations in the final days, Aleksandar Rankovic, director of The Common Initiative, said the talks resembled “a ballroom of clashing partners stepping on each other’s toes – and even breaking each other’s knees”.', 'A group of countries known as the High Ambition Coalition (HAC) called for another session before the final plenary on Sunday, saying a consensus on critical issues was impossible to reach in a day.', '“If you ask me … we stop, we adapt the paper as it is and we try to do another session,” Senegal’s Cheikh Sylla said.

Rankovic said some of the HAC countries were also “almost totally passive in the contact groups”.', '“A negotiation like this requires the involvement of ministers, not outside, but inside the rooms,” Rankovic said, adding that it was “up to ministers to find compromise”.', 'The exclusivity of the talks became another contentious issue. Meetings labelled as “informal” were closed to civil society, NGOs, and Indigenous groups.

Blocking their access effectively silences them.”', 'Financial support for developing nations remained a sticking point, as in the Cop29 and Cop16 talks. The plastics treaty was supposed to create a funding mechanism for a transition away from plastics. While the text acknowledged that it is the responsibility of the polluter to pay, it failed to provide such a framework.', 'At least 126 countries supported the creation of an independent, dedicated fund for treaty implementation, funded by a polymer production fee. However, the chair’s draft included only optional language, failing to establish concrete mechanisms for funding.', '“This is a matter of life and death for Global South communities,” said Arpita Bhagat, plastics lead at GAIA Asia Pacific. “The chair’s text undermines this demand, leaving countries without the resources needed to address the crisis.”', 'Another critical omission was binding measures to regulate harmful chemicals. Plastics are laced with over 3,000 chemicals, many of which pose serious risks to human health and the environment. While campaigners pushed for strong controls, the draft weakened provisions on this front.', '“The draft text strips away systematic controls on toxic chemicals,” said Beeler. “We’re seeing weak language where there should be binding measures to eliminate these hazards.”', 'The consensus-driven nature of the negotiations further complicated progress.

Fossil Fuel Lobbyists Flood Final Scheduled Round of Global Plastics Treaty Negotiations,https://www.ciel.org/news/inc-5-lobbyist-analysis/,"['', 'BUSAN, Republic of Korea, November 27, 2024 — 220 fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists have registered to participate in the fifth and final scheduled session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) to advance a global plastics treaty. The negotiation is expected to develop and deliver the final text of the future treaty.', 'A new analysis from the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) — supported by International Indigenous Peoples’ Forum on Plastics (IIPFP), the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), the Break Free From Plastic movement, the Global Alliance for Incinerators Alternatives (GAIA), Greenpeace,  the Stop Tobacco Pollution Alliance (STPA), the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, and the Uproot Plastics Coalition (Korea) — and based on the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) provisional list of INC-5 participants, finds that:', 'With each INC, we have seen an increase in the number of fossil fuel and petrochemical industry lobbyists, but the efforts to effect the future treaty extend well beyond the negotiations themselves. Reports of intimidation and interference have surfaced, including allegations of industry representatives intimidating independent scientists participating in the negotiations and pressure on country delegations by industry to replace technical experts with industry-friendly representatives.  ', 'While civil society organizations, independent scientists, and rights holders face significant financial and logistical barriers to participation, the fossil fuel and chemicals industry mobilizes significant financial and human resources not only to influence negotiations, but also to privately lobby leaders and discreetly back positions held by petrostate allies who openly defend their shared financial interests.', '“From the moment the gavel came down at UNEA-5.2 to now, we have watched industry lobbyists surrounding the negotiations with sadly well-known tactics of obstruction, distraction, intimidation, and misinformation,” says Delphine Levi Alvares, Global Petrochemical Campaign Manager at the Center for International Environmental Law. “Their strategy — lifted straight from the climate negotiations playbook — is designed to preserve the financial interests of countries and companies who are putting their fossil-fueled profits above human health, human rights, and the future of the planet. The mandate for this treaty is very clear: ending plastic pollution. Ever-growing evidence from independent scientists, frontline communities, and Indigenous Peoples clearly shows that this won’t be achieved without reducing plastic production. The choice is clear — our lives or their bottom line.” ', 'Pro-plastic rhetoric was on full display in the lead up to and during the early days of INC-5, with key industry associations trumpeting the ‘massive societal benefits plastics’ and Member States claiming ‘the sovereign right to exploit resources of states’. However, the numbers tell a different story: plastic production accounts for a mere 0.6% (USD 627 billion) of the global economy, and reducing our dependence on plastics is unlikely to impact economic growth. Ahead of INC-5, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights acknowledged that plastic pollution is incompatible with the enjoyment of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment. ', '“Plastic markets are already oversupplied. The world simply cannot afford to continue producing more plastics as a means of sustaining fossil fuel dependency ” says Daniela Duran Gonzalez, Senior Legal Campaigner at the Center for International Environmental Law. “Shrinking demand, closing facilities, diminishing profit margins — expanding plastic production is bad business. If Member States are truly committed to fair and equitable development they would support mandatory rules to reduce production, starting with a halt to the construction of new production facilities. This is a moment for courage — for our economy, our planet, our climate, and the rights of present and future generations ”', 'What’s transpired at plastic treaty talks is not dissimilar to what we’ve observed at recent biological diversity and climate talks. Once again, industry-friendly actors are working to infiltrate the process and delay substantive progress. ', '“We cannot let industry-friendly tactics derail and delay these negotiations like they’ve been able to do in other multilateral spaces,” concludes Rachel Radvany, Environmental Health Campaigner at the Center for International Environmental Law.  “Countries must seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and use every tool at their disposal to prevent obstructionism and end corporate capture of this negotiation. We must secure a treaty that includes strong conflict of interest protections, lobbying disclosures, and prevent vested interests from influencing the implementation of the agreement.” ', 'Juressa Lee, Co-Chair, International Indigenous Peoples’ Forum on Plastics (IIPFP)', '“Indigenous Peoples already experience barriers to full and meaningful participation in these talks, from registration to attendance to speaking rights to recognising us as Rights Holders. As a caucus, we’ve had to backfill needs where we believe UNEP has shirked their responsibilities to facilitate procedural justice. For us to be competing with Industry representatives in and outside of Member State delegations for space is a cruelty. For polluters’ attendance to be marginalising Indigenous Rights is a contradiction of the entire purpose of this meeting.', 'Yuyun Ismawati, Co-chair, International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) ', '“IPEN continues to be concerned about the overly influential role that the plastics, petrochemicals, and fossil fuels industries play at the Plastics Treaty talks. As the recent California lawsuit shows, these industries have lied for decades about plastic recycling. As another recent report notes, the companies allied to ‘solve’ plastic pollution have produced 1,000 times more plastic than they cleaned up. We must eliminate industry conflicts of interest from these proceedings. It’s time for delegates to understand that we cannot trust these industries – their only agenda is to maintain their profits at any cost.”', 'Deborah Sy, Head of Global Public Policy and Strategy at GGTC, Stop Tobacco Pollution Alliance (STPA) ', '“It’s no surprise the plastics treaty struggles with corporate influence, given the tobacco industry’s continued role as an observer—despite clear FCTC guidelines against such interference. This disregard for established rules signals a deeper lack of integrity, allowing corporate interests to corrupt decision-making processes. The Conference of the Parties to the FCTC, in noting the INC’s work on the plastics treaty, emphasized the need to protect tobacco-related environmental policies from the commercial and vested interests of the tobacco industry. Cigarette butts, one of the most littered and harmful forms of avoidable plastic waste, must be banned immediately as part of any serious effort to combat plastic pollution.

Civil society observers face significant limitations, as they must line up at least an hour before the meetings just to secure entry into the venue.\nThe issue of the petrochemical industry sending large delegations to lobbying within the negotiation halls has been raised repeatedly.

In 2022, 175 countries agreed to develop a legally binding treaty and have spent the past two years debating its requirements, with particular disagreements over setting limits on the production of new plastic.', 'Advertisement', '', 'Read more', ""A fifth of the world's plastic garbage is either burned or littered"", '', 'To bring more clarity to the debate, Douglas McCauley at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his colleagues used an artificial intelligence model trained on economic data to test how the policies under consideration would affect this pollution globally. “I wasn’t convinced that [eliminating plastic pollution] was actually possible,” says McCauley. “But it turns out you can get pretty darn close.”', 'According to their projections, under current conditions, such pollution is set to roughly double to between 100 and 139 million tonnes by 2050. But a combination of four policies, all of which are still on the table in the current treaty draft, were enough to reduce this by more than 90 per cent.', 'Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month.', 'The most impactful was a mandate that plastic products contain at least 40 per cent recycled material. That rule alone cuts plastic pollution in half by mid-century. This effect is so significant because it reduces demand for newly made or “virgin” plastic, while also spurring demand for recycled materials, says McCauley. “Suddenly there’s a giant global market for recycling.”', 'But recycling on its own wasn’t sufficient. “If your target is to end plastic pollution, you need to do things across the entire life cycle,” he says. Deeper cuts required limiting production of virgin plastics to 2020 levels. This cap cuts plastic pollution by around 60 million tonnes per year by the middle of the century, according to the model. This change also had the greatest impact on greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production, as extracting fossil fuels and turning them into virgin plastics involves emissions-intensive processes.', 'A third policy, spending $50 billion on waste management, reduced pollution by nearly the same amount as the production cap – especially if these funds were spent in low-income countries with poor infrastructure, which are also the most inundated by plastic pollution. “When you start talking about global finance, [the amount of money needed] is not that big,” says McCauley. “Building a sanitary landfill is not like building a port.”', '', 'Plastic waste is increasing, and though some is recycled or destroyed, a large portion is “mismanaged” and piles up as pollution', 'A. Samuel Pottinger et al.', '', 'Finally, a small tax on plastic packaging cut pollution by tens of millions of tonnes. The researchers based this estimate on case studies of how people reduced their plastic use in response to similar taxes, such as a 5 cent fee on single-use plastic bags in Washington DC. Money raised by such a tax could also be used to pay for other changes, like building more waste management infrastructure or improving recycling systems.', 'Royer, who wasn’t involved with the study, says she thinks those policies would all help. Targeting the use of single-use plastic, such as grocery bags or plastic forks, via a tax or a ban could also make a difference, she says. “If we look at plastic pollution in general, 40 per cent of the plastic being produced is single-use items.”', 'However, she points out that local rules alone will never solve the problem. For instance, California banned some single-use plastic bags a decade ago and this year banned all such bags. But most of the plastic pollution that washes up on its beaches originates outside the state: plastic waste found in California generally drifts across the Pacific from Asia or is flotsam left by the fishing industry. “There’s no border,” says Royer.', 'That is where a global treaty comes in. The researchers showed how implementing different policies across the world would cut down on three things: the volume of mismanaged plastic waste, the production of new plastics and plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions. The four key policies in combination, seen in the graph below, reduced all three measures, and in particular slashed mismanaged waste by 91 per cent.', '', 'Researchers estimated the impact of different policies for reducing plastic waste', 'A. Samuel Pottinger et al.', '', 'In Busan, countries have now reached the deadline to decide on a final treaty draft, but they remain far apart on key issues. A main fault line is whether the treaty should include a production cap on newly made plastics, which the researchers found was the second-most impactful policy. Plastic-producing countries and the petrochemical industry oppose these caps, instead throwing their support behind recycling measures.', 'A “high-ambition coalition” of 68 countries, including the UK, is pushing for a treaty that would include both, with the goal of eliminating plastic pollution by 2040. Other researchers have also argued a cap on production is necessary to end pollution. But just last week, advocates for this were dismayed by reports the US wouldn’t support a specific limit. McCauley recently penned an open letter – signed by more than 100 researchers – to the administration of US president Joe Biden urging it to support a strong plastic treaty.', '“We’re at a pivotal moment,” said Erin Simon at the World Wildlife Foundation, an environmental advocacy group, in an email to the press. “Our last best chance to forge an agreement that could end the flow of plastic into nature is within reach, but only if countries come to the negotiating table with a clear vision and determination to get the job done.”', '', 'Journal reference', 'Science DOI: 10.1126/science.adr3837', '', 'Topics:', 'Advertisement', '', 'Explore the latest news, articles and features', 'Comment', 'Subscriber-only', 'News', 'Subscriber-only', 'News', 'Free', 'News', 'Free', 'Trending New Scientist articles', 'Advertisement', 'Download the app', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'gdg']"
"World will be ‘unable to cope’ with volume of plastic waste in 10 years, warns expert",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/world-unable-cope-10-years-talks-un-global-treaty-to-end-plastic-waste,"['Countries must curb production now and tackle plastic’s full life cycle, says Norwegian minister Anne Beathe Tvinnereim ahead of key UN talks this week', 'The world will be “unable to cope” with the sheer volume of plastic waste a decade from now unless countries agree to curbs on production, the co-chair of a coalition of key countries has warned ahead of crunch talks on curbing global plastic pollution.', 'Speaking before the final, critical round of UN talks on the first global treaty to end plastic waste, in Busan, South Korea, this week, Norway’s minister for international development, Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, acknowledged the split that had developed between plastic-producing countries and others. She represents more than 60 “high ambition” nations, led by Rwanda and Norway, who want plastic pollution tackled over its full life cycle. Crucially, this means clamping down heavily on production.', 'While a “perfect treaty” may not be possible due to the strength of opposition, mainly from oil-producing countries, she hoped a deal could be reached that could be strengthened over time.', '“We are not going to land a perfect treaty. But we need to get further. And I think we will. I choose to be hopeful,” Tvinnereim said. “With high-ambition coalition countries, we will continue to demonstrate that there is a big group of countries that sticks to its ambitions. The world desperately needs some leadership now, and some good news.”', 'This year, various researchers found microplastics in every sample of placenta they tested; in human arteries, where plastics are linked to heart attacks and strokes; in human testes and semen, adding to evidence of the ubiquity of plastics and concern over health risks. The plastics crisis is widely recognised as a threat to human health, biodiversity and the climate.', 'Two years after a historic agreement by 175 countries to adopt a mandate on negotiations for a global, legally binding treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics, delegates remain widely divided on what to do – and a deadline is looming. Progress has stalled over a row about the need for cuts to the $712bn plastics industry. The last talks, in April, failed to get an agreement to put production targets – seen as key to curbing plastic waste – at the treaty’s centre.', 'The final round of talks, which starts on Monday and is due to end on 1 December, is critical.', '“We need increased recycling and waste management, of course, but if we don’t reduce production and consumption we will be unable to cope with the volume of plastic in the system 10 years from now,” said Tvinnereim.', 'Use of plastic could triple globally by 2060, with the largest increases expected in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Plastic waste is also projected to triple by 2060, with half ending up in landfill and less than a fifth recycled.', 'An agreement on a “phase out” of a list of single use plastic products globally, as well as bans on poisonous chemicals in plastic – including for food contact plastic and children’s toys – was a “no-brainer”, said Tvinnereim. Many countries already have unilateral single-use plastics bans.', 'Fractious negotiations have seen divergent views, and countries with large fossil fuel industries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, dubbed the “like-minded” group, have eschewed production cuts and emphasised waste management as the main solution to the crisis. Developing nations, which bear the consequences of plastic overproduction overwhelming their inadequate waste systems, are calling for global cuts.', 'The uncertainty dogging the talks has been exacerbated by the US position. One of the largest plastic producers, the US recently signalled it would support a treaty calling for curbs on production. But the impending return of Donald Trump, a fossil fuel advocate, as US president in January, has led to doubts.', 'The US would be “very welcome” to join the coalition, Tvinnereim said. There was also opportunity for China and others to show leadership.', 'A negotiator for one of the “high ambition” countries said: “If we can see China stepping up, as we have seen them do elsewhere and domestically, we have a good chance of creating an effective instrument. If we don’t, it is going to be very difficult.”']"
