The equity is issued by a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock (“SubCo Units”), and exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock.', 'The future of fixed income is building public and private portfolios to optimize liquidity, yield, and diversification. This transaction will bring together BlackRock’s strong corporate and asset owner relationships with HPS’s diversified origination and capital flexibility. The combined private credit franchise will work side-by-side with BlackRock’s $3 trillion public fixed income business to provide both public and private income solutions for clients across their whole portfolios.', '“I am excited by what HPS and BlackRock can do together for our clients and look forward to welcoming Scott Kapnick, Scot French, and Michael Patterson, along with the entire HPS team, to BlackRock. We have always sought to position ourselves ahead of our clients’ needs. Together with the scale, capabilities, and expertise of the HPS team, BlackRock will deliver clients solutions that seamlessly blend public and private,” said Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock Chairman and CEO.', 'Durable global growth will require higher volumes of debt financing and markets are increasingly looking to private capital as an answer. The addition of HPS will position BlackRock to connect companies of all sizes, from small and medium-sized businesses to large corporations, with financing for investments that support economic growth and job creation.', 'Market forces, technology, and regulation are consistently moving financial activity to where it can be done most efficiently, making private credit a structural growth segment. BlackRock expects the private debt market will more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030.

BlackRock is a leading provider of solutions for insurers, which represent 100 Aladdin technology clients and $700 billion in assets under management at BlackRock. HPS is a leading independent provider of private credit for insurance clients. The addition of HPS will position BlackRock to be a full-service, fiduciary provider of public-private asset management and technology solutions for insurance clients.', 'Mr. Fink continued, “For over 35 years, BlackRock has grown and evolved alongside the capital markets. With GIP, and now HPS, we are expanding our private markets capabilities across our comprehensive global platform.

The transaction is not expected to meaningfully change BlackRock’s leverage profile.', 'BlackRock is committed to being a good steward of shareholders’ capital.

BlackRock to acquire HPS Investment Partners for about $12B,https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/blackrock-to-acquire-hps-investment-partners-for-about-12b,"['BlackRock (BLK) and HPS Investment Partners, a global credit investment manager with approximately $148B in client assets, have entered into a definitive agreement for BlackRock to acquire HPS for approximately $12B, with 100% of consideration paid in BlackRock equity. The equity is issued by a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, and exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock. Under the terms of the transaction, BlackRock will acquire 100% of the business and assets of HPS for total consideration of 12.1 million SubCo Units. SubCo Units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock at the election of the holder, and will have equivalent dividend rights to BlackRock common stock. A portion of the transaction consideration will be paid at closing, and a portion will be deferred approximately five years. Approximately 9.2 million SubCo Units will be paid at closing. Approximately 25% of the consideration, or 2.9 million SubCo Units, will be paid in approximately five years, subject to achievement of certain post-closing conditions. There is also potential for additional consideration to be earned of up to 1.6 million SubCo Units that is based on financial performance milestones measured and paid in approximately five years. Of the total deal consideration, up to $675 million in value will be used to fund an equity retention pool for HPS employees. In aggregate, inclusive of all SubCo Units paid at closing, eligible to be paid in approximately five years, and potentially earned through achievement of financial performance milestones, the maximum amount of BlackRock common stock issuable upon exchange for SubCo Units would be approximately 13.7 million shares. As part of closing the transaction, BlackRock expects to retire for cash, or refinance, approximately $400 million of existing HPS debt. The transaction is not expected to meaningfully change BlackRock’s leverage profile. BlackRock is committed to being a good steward of shareholders’ capital. Its capital management strategy is to first invest for growth, and then return excess capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and a consistent share repurchase program. Over the last ten years BlackRock has repurchased 29 million shares, at an average repurchase price of $498 per share, which represents a 15% annualized return for shareholders. The deal is expected to increase private markets fee-paying AUM and management fees by 40% and approximately 35%, respectively, and be modestly accretive to BlackRock’s as-adjusted earnings per share in the first full year post-close. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. .', '', '', '']"

The deal, its biggest one since it bought Barclays's asset management business in 2009, closed in October. In June it agreed to buy data giant Preqin, which it hopes will help bring some of these more complex private strategies to a broader audience."", ""In addition to the HPS talks, the FT has reported that BlackRock is eyeing a stake in Izzy Englander's $70 billion hedge fund Millennium Management."", 'BlackRock is not new to reshaping itself through acquisition. The Barclays deal gave the firm iShares and helped it become the passive investing giant it now is.', '""I do not want us to be comfortable in our business model,"" Fink said during the firm\'s investor day last summer.

Principals from the firm bought it out in 2016 after the bank's appetite for high-risk loans waned."", ""The three will now join BlackRock's global executive committee and lead a new unit combining HPS and BlackRock's existing private credit business."", ""The secretive firm has been at the forefront of the private credit boom, which resulted from the 2008 financial crisis and banks' withdrawal from risky lending. Private players moved in to make loans to companies when Wall Street giants were reluctant to."", '""Our competitors refer to us as the nerds of private credit and we take no offense,"" French told Bloomberg in an interview last November.', 'The firm, which was previously working toward an initial public offering, caters to mostly institutional investors and has more than 760 employees in offices around the world, according to its website.', ""BlackRock brought in more assets in the third quarter than ever before, mostly down to its index funds, but in its October earnings call the firm's leaders were already focused on its future growth engine — GIP."", 'GIP is expected to add $250 million in management fees in the fourth quarter alone.', '""This is a revenue growth story,"" Martin Small, BlackRock\'s chief financial officer said during that call.""
