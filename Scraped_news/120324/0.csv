', 'The presidential pardoning process is one that has long courted controversy, especially since many presidents issue pardons when they are leaving the White House. ', 'One of the most famous —and controversial— pardons in history happened less than one month into President Gerald Ford\'s term. On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford announced from the Oval Office that he would ""grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed."" Ford\'s own press secretary resigned over the pardon, and Ford\'s approval rating dropped 20 points over the following days. His approval rating never recovered and he went on to lose the 1976 presidential election. ', ""Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. The Constitution's framers were heavily influenced by the English legal tradition of pardon, which dates back to the 7th century, and Alexander Hamilton introduced the concept of the presidential pardon at the Constitutional Convention. "", 'Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution declares: ""The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.""', ""There are four different types of clemency that fall under the president's pardoning power: pardon, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.  As outlined by the White House, a pardon releases a person from punishment and restores all civil liberties; amnesty is the same as the pardon but is extended to an entire class of individuals; commutation reduces the sentence imposed by a federal court, and a reprieve delays the imposition of a sentence or punishment."", 'Pardons, however, may not be issued in cases of impeachment or if it is an ""offense against the United States,"" such as treason. ', 'The Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice issues guidelines for the application of clemency, but presidents do not need to follow them.', 'To be pardoned, a person must have been convicted in a United States District Court, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or a military court-martial — so a president cannot issue a pardon for a state conviction. ', ""A pardon can help eliminate some of the consequences of conviction and restore a person's civil rights. "", ""According to the Justice Department, the offense is not removed from a person's criminal record when they are pardoned but instead the conviction and the pardon both appear on the record. But the pardon can be helpful in obtaining licenses, bonding or employment. "", 'Hunter Biden is the 26th person Mr. Biden has pardoned so far. Most pardons relate to drug offenses, a practice started by former President Barack Obama. In September 2023, Mr. Biden granted clemency for three Iranians who were accused of moving $6 billion in a restricted Iranian account as part of a prisoner swap. ', ""At this point in President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he had pardoned 29 people. "", 'Trump issued a slew of pardons on Jan. 19, 2021, shortly before he left office.

Pirro and rapper Lil Wayne.', ""Prior to those pardons, Trump pardoned more than 30 people in December 2020, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions in 2005. Ahead of his second term, Trump has nominated Charles Kushner to be the ambassador to France."", 'Earlier in his term, Trump pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D\'Souza, his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, former George W. Bush aide I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby and Oregon ranchers Dwight L. Hammond and Steve D. Hammond.', ""In 2020, Trump issued a full pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence he had commuted in 2018 after lobbying from Kim Kardashian. Johnson is a great-grandmother who had served 22 years in federal prison for what was a first-time criminal offense, which had come to Kardashian's attention. "", 'In total over four years in office, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. The only presidents since 1900 who issued fewer acts of clemency were George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, according to the Pew Research Center. ', 'Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations while in office, including for 568 people who were serving life sentences. In 2014, Obama launched the Clemency Initiative, which allowed federal prisoners to apply for leniency, especially those serving for nonviolent drug offenses. In the Obama White House archives, his administration touts that those whose sentences were commuted were ""incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws.""', 'Although Obama encouraged prisoners to apply for leniency under the Clemency Initiative, a report by the Justice Department Inspector General in 2018 found that initiative was poorly planned and not implemented properly, while also suffering from poor communication and bureaucratic feuds. ', '""We found that the Department did not effectively plan, implement, or manage the Initiative at the outset,"" Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in the report.', 'President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served 13 years in office, issued the most pardons: 3,687.', ""Although Mr. Biden is the first president to pardon his son, he is not the first to pardon a family member.

Former President Jimmy Carter also issued preemptive pardons for Vietnam draft evaders, as did Lincoln in the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which allowed for former Confederates to be pardoned if they took an oath to the U.S."", 'President George H.W. Bush also pardoned his secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, along with five others, for his alleged role in the Iran-Contra scandal after he was indicted but before his trial.

A fourth was allowed to stand since it had been delivered."", 'According to Washington Monthly, an 1868 textbook by Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph Story on the Constitution says a presidential pardon can be revoked if the president was impeached. In recent history, both Clinton and Trump have been impeached — although their pardons did stand after their terms.', 'Former President George W. Bush, meanwhile, revoked one of his own pardons.

Joe Biden wrote, in part: “I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.”', 'On the date of Biden’s plea hearing, the federal judge in Delaware questioned the scope of the immunity provision in the agreement.', 'I, too, believe that Hunter Biden’s criminal cases were the direct result of a political campaign by Donald Trump and his fanatical supporters in an attempt to attack Joe Biden.', 'As a prosecutor, you get to exercise what we call “prosecutorial discretion,” meaning you can exercise your professional judgment to decide what cases to prosecute, and, within reason and the bounds of applicable laws and procedure, you get to decide how to resolve those cases. If you are a lower-level prosecutor, your prosecutorial discretion can be limited: It can depend on the directives and priorities set by the lead prosecutor for your office, etc. But, in Hunter Biden’s investigations, special counsel David Weiss cannot say that he was prevented from exercising his prosecutorial discretion because he was the head prosecutor on those cases.', 'The tortured history of the cases speaks volumes about why these cases were politically motivated and unprecedented in their prosecution:', 'Hunter Biden was investigated for five years by the Justice Department. After those five years of investigations, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, agreed with Biden’s lawyers to a nonprosecution agreement. Weiss then backpedaled and ended up insisting that Biden instead plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors (for failure to file) and that he enter into pretrial diversion for one gun charge. Biden agreed in June 2023 to these new terms and the two sides submitted his written diversion agreement to the court.', 'One very important part of Hunter Biden’s deal was a mutually agreed upon immunity provision. On the date of Biden’s plea hearing, the federal judge in Delaware questioned the scope of the immunity provision in the agreement. But she never killed the deal; she asked the parties for clarification of the immunity.', 'At this time, Trump and his team went after Weiss full bore. Weiss was publicly attacked and criticized. At one point, Trump posted on social media: “Weiss is a COWARD, a smaller version of Bill Barr, who never had the courage to do what everyone knows should have been done.” Instead of clarifying the deal that he himself had negotiated and already approved and despite there not being any new evidence to merit any changes, Weiss reneged on the agreement and insisted that Hunter accept new terms. He also got Attorney General Merrick Garland to grant him special counsel status.', 'Hunter Biden’s lawyers have argued that Weiss’ appointment as special counsel was problematic, as he was unlawfully appointed. Special counsel is supposed to be appointed from outside of the U.S. government and, obviously, Weiss was, and remains, the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware. He should not have been allowed to serve as special counsel in Hunter Biden’s cases. When Hunter Biden moved to dismiss his cases on this basis, his motion was denied.', 'Nevertheless, Weiss,  in a surprising about-face, then indicted Hunter Biden on three felony gun counts in Delaware and nine tax counts in California. It’s worth exposing the legal hypocrisy in these charges to underscore just how unprecedented these prosecutions were:', 'Once Weiss caved to the political pressure by Trump and his Republican supporters including members of Congress, Weiss failed to honor the original plea agreement and instead filed nine counts.', ""Hunter Biden possessed a firearm for a total of 11 days. At no point during those 11 days was the firearm loaded or used, and, without his knowledge, a third party took the gun from him and disposed of it in a garbage can. Prior to Weiss' indicting Biden, prosecutors did not believe the evidence even supported a prosecution. And his substance abuse problem at the time merited, at the most, a diversion program. In fact, Biden’s lawyers have argued that in the history of this district in Delaware, no individual has ever been charged under the same facts as Hunter Biden has."", ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'There were zero aggravating circumstances that would have justified the DOJ pursuing any gun charge against Hunter Biden. As Hunter’s lawyers noted: “Since 2023, the only defendant charged with these [gun] offenses in the District of Delaware has been Hunter Biden. In that time, no other case has been charged in Delaware under these statutes.”', 'Biden was also charged with nine tax counts in California, despite having fully paid his past-due taxes, including interest and penalties in 2021, more than two years before any criminal charges were filed. To move on from the multiple years of investigations and harassment, Biden initially agreed, with Weiss’ full acceptance, to plead to just two misdemeanors for failure to file his tax returns/to pay his taxes for 2017 and 2018. But, once Weiss caved to the political pressure by Trump and his Republican supporters including members of Congress, Weiss failed to honor the original plea agreement and instead filed nine counts (including three felonies).', 'But perhaps the most obvious evidence that Hunter Biden was a selective criminal prosecution is that other individuals were able to resolve their cases with administrative or civil penalties or judgments. They weren’t prosecuted. But, then again, their last name wasn’t “Biden.”', 'Katie S. Phang is the host of ""The Katie Phang Show,"" which airs Saturdays at 12 p.m. ET on MSNBC.

But they believed it was worth resisting pressure to fall in line from our longtime party, our lifelong friends, even our family members on the principle that some things matter more than tax rates.', 'I was one of those voters. I am someone who does not identify as a Democrat and yet has voted for Democrats in the last two presidential elections thanks to my disgust with Donald Trump, my fears at how he would use the levers of power, and my frustration with the party that would select him as its standard bearer once again after he assembled a mob that besieged the Capitol while chanting “hang Mike Pence.”', 'I’m now one of those people who finds it incredibly vexing not only to see Biden pardon his criminal son Hunter after swearing he wouldn’t but also to see partisan Democrats say, essentially, “Yeah, so what?” On the Secret Pod this week, something Sarah said crystalized why this particular move is also so frustrating—and, frankly, demoralizing—for a lot of us.', '“It goes to a couple of very base-level things about both who we are as The Bulwark [and] what it means to somebody who is fighting against Donald Trump for reasons that are bereft of partisanship,” Sarah told JVL. “Some of us, I think, identify as Democrats now. But I think that the sort of loyalty to a party or a partisan interest is not our motivating factor, right? Our motivating, our animating reason for being here is that we do care about, let’s say, norms, values, institutions, those things. And this was something that further sort of tears at the fabric of those things.”', 'The notion that institutions and values are worth defending is something Biden told us to believe. And he dispensed with those stated values the second they proved inconvenient.', 'Gawker founder Nick Denton’s key insight into the human psyche is that in our relativistic age, the only modern sin is hypocrisy. I don’t entirely agree with this—there are worse things than hypocrisy! But Biden has, inarguably, acted hypocritically. And in doing so, he has made it harder for those opposing Trump, whose supporters can now point to this sort of thing and say: “Well what do you expect from voters; both sides are equally bad.”', 'The Bulwark is a place for honest debate and discussion. We pledge that to you. Consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.', 'Such an argument may lack comparative moral judgment. JVL’s totally right: Trump has done and will do worse. But in the end, the pardon validates much of the cynicism with our politics when the guy who held himself up as the restorer of honor and decency functionally says “I’ll do what I want, Jack: My debauched heir doesn’t have to play by the rules.”', 'It also adds to our collective exhaustion. It’s been exhausting to argue with friends and family and former allies about putting principle over policy—because I fundamentally disagree with Biden about a great many policies, though Trump’s own policies aren’t really my cup of tea either—when the people I’m supposedly aligned with make it abundantly clear they don’t actually agree with the principle at stake, that their ethics seem to be just as situational as Trump and his allies always said.', '“For those who have to be in the arena making the case against Trump—have four years facing us of fighting everything Trump does—every way in which you remove the moral high ground to do that is difficult,” Sarah said. “You can say, like, ‘It’s not the same’—and it isn’t the same: The ability to weigh these things in importance is an important part of analysis. So in no way are they equal. But still, but still: They make it harder.”', 'In the end, I’m angered most by the pardon because I fear it is born from my own naïveté. As I put it in The Bulwark slack, what’s frustrating is that Biden saying he wasn’t going to pardon Hunter during the election was kayfabe, and though I suspected it was kayfabe on some level, I hoped it wasn’t. Which means I’m a dumb mark rather than a smart mark, and no one likes to feel dumb.', 'Regardless: What’s right is right and wrong is wrong. Pardoning Hunter Biden may have been constitutional, it may have been “what any father would do,” it may have been thrilling for people looking to stick it to Trump in some minor way. But it was wrong to do, it’s wrong to defend, and everyone involved in the decision should feel great shame for trying to pass it off as some sort of enlightened attempt to undo an injustice rather than a tired old man’s desire to do what he wants for someone he loves.', '', 'Ready for more?']"

Biden isn't the first president to pardon a relative.

Days later Biden announced he had pardoned his son, who was awaiting sentencing in criminal cases related to tax evasion and gun charges.', 'The topic of presidential pardons is back in the spotlight this week after President Biden announced he signed a ""full and unconditional"" one for his son.', 'Hunter Biden was convicted earlier this year of federal gun charges for lying about his addiction to crack cocaine when he purchased a gun, and separately pleaded guilty to tax offenses for failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. Sentences in both cases were scheduled to be handed down later this month.', 'The president has said publicly that he would not pardon his son — but reversed that promise in an announcement on Sunday in which he called the prosecution unfair and selective.', 'Biden blamed his opponents in Congress for instigating the charges against Hunter and unraveling his would-be plea deal through political pressure, though the special counsel leading the firearm probe has denied facing political interference.', 'In his statement, Biden said, ""No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter\'s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.""', '""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,"" Biden added. ""I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.""', ""Biden's decision was met with criticism from both sides of the aisle."", ""For one, his rationale closely echoes Donald Trump's claims of a politicized Justice Department — even though the charges against Hunter Biden and Trump, the first president to be convicted of a felony, are very different. Trump was charged with trying to overturn the 2020 election and endangering national security through his handling of classified documents, though both cases were dismissed after his 2024 election victory."", 'Trump was quick to slam Biden\'s pardon as an ""abuse and miscarriage of Justice."" Even some Democrats — including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Arizona Rep. Greg Stanton and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet— publicly denounced Biden\'s decision. They warned it could set a dangerous precedent, especially before the return of Trump, who has vowed to pardon Jan. 6 rioters and baselessly suggested he could even pardon himself.', '""Joe Biden put self before country, and just pardoned his son,"" tweeted Joe Walsh, an anti-Trump former Republican congressman who had endorsed Biden. ""And that selfishness took the \'no one is above the law\' argument against Trump off the table.""', 'Presidential pardons have been commonplace since the days of George Washington, who forgave the two men convicted of treason for their role in the Whiskey Rebellion. Over the years, many have been cause for celebration as well as controversy.', 'Presidential pardon authority is inspired by early English law, which granted kings ""the prerogative of mercy.""', 'Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the president the power to ""grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.""', '""The U.S. Constitution grants the president of the United States what\'s called unilateral clemency power,"" explains Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU law school. ""And you can think of clemency as the umbrella term.""', 'Acts of clemency include granting amnesty, reprieves, commutations, and pardons — the most expansive form of relief.', 'A full pardon releases the person from punishment and restores their civil liberties, including their right to vote, hold office and sit on a jury.', '""Clemency really is an expression of mercy, and often tempers the very overly punitive, harsh, inequitable results that our criminal justice system produces,"" says Eisen.', 'The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the president\'s pardoning powers as relatively broad, ""extending to \'every offence known to the law\' and available \'at any time after [a crime\'s] commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment,\' "" according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).', 'In some rare cases, presidents have even pardoned individuals who had not been charged with a crime: Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal, and Jimmy Carter pardoned most Vietnam War draft dodgers, both charged and uncharged.', 'The only limits — at least according to the Constitution — are that a president can only grant pardons for federal criminal offenses, not state or civil offenses, and cannot issue pardons in cases of impeachment.', 'President Gerald Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon shortly after taking office in 1974, to which many historians attribute his election defeat two years later.', 'Presidents have pardoned all sorts of federal offenses, from marijuana possession to mail fraud to murder. Somewhere along the way, they even started pardoning Thanksgiving turkeys to spare them from the dinner table.', ""Some pardons have involved high-profile figures: Andrew Johnson pardoned a doctor who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg after he assassinated Abraham Lincoln, as well as thousands of Confederate soldiers and officials after the Civil War."", 'Warren Harding pardoned Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs after he was sentenced to a decade in prison for speaking out against World War I.

George W. Bush issued the fewest — 200, including 189 pardons.', 'Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his first term, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. His use of the power was relatively rare compared to many of his predecessors, but highly controversial because most of the people he helped had some sort of personal or political connection to him.', 'Biden is now the third president to pardon a relative.', 'On his last day in office in 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger, who had pleaded guilty and spent a year in jail on drug charges.', 'That was one of a whopping 140 pardons that Clinton issued that day, and not the most controversial.', ""He got much more flack for pardoning Marc Rich, a disgraced financier who had fled to Switzerland after being indicted for evading more than $48 million in taxes, among other charges. Rich's ex-wife Denise had donated over $1 million to Democrats and Clinton's presidential library, raising questions and a Justice Department investigation into the pardon, which ultimately found no wrongdoing by Clinton."", 'Trump also issued a flurry of pardons — 74, to be exact — in the final hours of his first term, with recipients including his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, rapper Lil Wayne and Al Pirro, the former husband of Fox News commentator Jeanine Pirro.', 'He had previously pardoned many other members of his inner circle who had been charged with various crimes, including Republican operative Roger Stone, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Charles Kushner — the father of his senior advisor, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.', 'Charles Kushner, himself a real estate billionaire, pleaded guilty in 2004 to filing false tax returns, lying to the Federal Election Commission and retaliating against a witness: his own brother-in-law.', ""The case, prosecuted by then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie, led to Kushner attempting an elaborate blackmail plot against his brother-in-law and former employee, William Schulder, who had become a witness for federal prosecutors. He hired a prostitute to sleep with Schulder, secretly videotaped the encounter and mailed the recording to Schulder's wife — his own sister — who turned it over to authorities."", 'Kushner served about two years in prison before his release in 2006, and Trump cited his philanthropic record ""of reform and charity"" when pardoning him in 2020. Over the weekend, Trump announced he intends to nominate Charles Kushner to serve as ambassador to France.', 'Biden has pardoned 25 individuals and commuted 132 sentences during his tenure, according to Justice Department data. He has granted clemency to many more, including entire groups.', 'In 2022, he took executive action to pardon the more than 6,500 people convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law and D.C. statute, which he expanded last year. Earlier this year, he issued a blanket pardon to LGBTQ+ service members removed from the military over their sexual orientation or gender identity.', 'Even so, Eisen says there is much more Biden could do before his term ends — including addressing the more than 8,000 petitions for clemency pending before his administration.', 'The Brennan Center, which describes itself as a nonpartisan law and policy organization, is among the groups urging the president to commute all death sentences to life without parole.', 'Last month, more than 60 members of Congress wrote Biden a letter asking him to use his authority to ""help broad classes of people and cases, including the elderly and chronically ill, those on death row, people with unjustified sentencing disparities, and women who were punished for defending themselves against their abusers.""', ""While Biden's most recent — and most personal — pardon is in the spotlight, Eisen hopes he will take this opportunity to afford the same grace to many others who are already serving what she calls excessive sentences."", '""President Biden has until January 20 to provide clemency for thousands of individuals who are appropriate clemency candidates who are sitting in federal prison right now,"" Eisen says.

Now’s their chance.', 'by Eric Levitz', 'President Joe Biden has pardoned Hunter Biden for all crimes — known and unknown — that his son committed over the past 11 years.', 'This is not a great look for a man who’s decried President-elect Donald Trump’s attacks on impartial law enforcement, declared that “No one is above the law,” and repeatedly vowed he would not pardon his son.', 'The president justified immunizing Hunter from criminal accountability by arguing that his son had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.” Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on a federal gun application and failing to pay his taxes, offenses that virtually never inspire felony charges, in the president’s telling. That he was not only prosecuted for such indiscretions — but charged so aggressively he was likely to face three years in prison — reflected a politically biased process, Biden argues: Were he not the child of the GOP’s top political adversary, Hunter would never have faced hard time for such minor crimes.', 'This is a plausible argument. But then, one can just as reasonably argue that New York would never have investigated anyone but Trump for falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to a porn actor paramour. And in that case, Biden was emphatic that the law was the law.', 'All this said, it is not hard to understand Biden’s hypocrisy. His sole surviving son was staring down years in prison, plausibly because of Biden’s own decision to seek the presidency (thereby throwing a spotlight on his son with a history of drug addiction). The incoming president, meanwhile, has vowed to investigate the Biden family for further crimes. Joe Biden had the power to protect his child from imprisonment and further selective prosecutions. I suspect most fathers in his shoes would do as he has done.', 'But Biden is not just a father. He is, for a few more weeks anyway, the de facto leader of the Democratic Party. And this pardon does his co-partisans no favors.', 'To the contrary, it reinforces the narrative that Democrats’ ostensible horror at Trump’s use of public power for private benefit is sanctimonious posturing. If all sides are corrupt, why not back the unabashed crook who promises to ruthlessly put America first? These sorts of (deluded) sentiments have badly undermined Democrats in recent years. And the pardoning of Hunter Biden lends credence to such reasoning.', 'More concretely, Biden has made it more difficult for Democrats to claim the moral high ground in impending fights over Trump’s abuses of the pardon power. Already, the president-elect has hinted that he intends to pardon the January 6 rioters en masse, an act that could embolden other MAGA die-hards eager to commit lawless acts in service of their leader.', 'Fortunately, Democrats now have the opportunity to demonstrate the sincerity of their ideals, while also mitigating one of their party’s greatest political liabilities — all by simply loudly and uniformly condemning Biden’s pardon as an abuse of power.', 'Indeed, from a certain angle, Biden may have just done his party a favor. The president’s extraordinary unpopularity has weighed on Democrats for years now. During the 2024 campaign, the party had limited capacity to distance themselves from the Biden administration, since their standard-bearer was its second-most prominent member.', 'But now that Harris 2024 is no more, Democrats face little imperative to protect Biden’s brand. And the impetus to get out from under his shadow has only grown since Election Day. According to both Gallup and 538’s polling, Biden’s approval rating has fallen since the election, with Americans now disapproving of him by a 19-point margin in the latter’s assessment. Exit polls, meanwhile, showed a record-high 45 percent of voters saying that they have grown worse off under the existing administration.', 'Thus, even before Hunter’s pardon, it was in the interests of Democrats to loudly break with their president. Now, the party has a means of doing so without implicating anyone else in their firmament. Denouncing Biden over inflation would involve disparaging every Democratic member of Congress who voted for the president’s fiscal policies (which also still have much to recommend them on the merits). Decrying the president for pardoning his son, by contrast, damages no one but the president, whose career in Democratic politics is over.', 'To be sure, many voters are not going to notice Democrats’ disavowing Biden en masse, while others will see it as a cynical ploy. Taking Biden to task for pardoning his son is not going to solve all of the party’s problems. And this whole episode will have fallen far out of the public’s consciousness by the 2026 midterms, let alone the 2028 presidential election.', 'But the project of extricating the Democratic brand from a presidency that voters disdain — however misguidedly — must start somewhere. In pardoning Hunter, Biden has given both his son and his party a chance for a new beginning.

Trump Teases Jan. 6 Rioter Pardons After Biden Pardons His Son—Here’s Who Else Trump Might Pardon,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/12/02/heres-who-trump-might-pardon-from-hunter-biden-to-jan-6-rioters-and-eric-adams/,"['President-elect Donald Trump responded to President Joe Biden’s pardoning of his son Hunter Biden by again raising the possibility he could pardon Jan. 6 rioters—among a string of controversial figures Trump has suggested he could pardon after taking office.', 'Hunter Biden attends an event celebrating the 2024 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams on the South ... [+]', 'Jan. 6 rioters: Trump asked in a Truth Social post “does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?” after Biden announced Sunday, in a surprise move, that he had pardoned his son Hunter Biden for his felony conviction for lying on a federal gun form and his guilty plea for felony tax violations.', 'Trump has said repeatedly he would pardon people convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, though it’s unclear who among the more than 1,500 charged would be subject to pardons; he told reporters in July “if they’re innocent, I would pardon them,” while his campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Post in June Trump would decide “on a case-by-case basis” who to pardon.', 'Ross Ulbricht: Supporters of Ulbricht—sentenced in 2015 to life in prison for creating and operating the dark web marketplace Silk Road—tweeted days after Trump won the election “ROSS IS COMING HOME IN JANUARY,” after Trump pledged while speaking at the Libertarian National Convention in May that “on Day One, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht” (commutation is different from a pardon as it does not absolve an individual of guilt, but instead reduces their sentence).', 'Peter Navarro: Trump left open the possibility he would pardon his former trade adviser—who served a four-month prison sentence earlier this year on charges of contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena in connection with the House Jan. 6 Committee probe—telling reporters after voting in Florida on Election Day “he’s a good man, he was treated very unfairly,” calling Navarro a “great patriot” when asked if he would pardon him.', 'Navarro told the Wall Street Journal in May he would reject any pardon offer from Trump, because he wants to continue appealing his conviction, writing in a letter sent from prison, “I will not give the Supreme Court any excuse to duck what is otherwise a landmark constitutional case.”', 'Julian Assange: Trump said in May in an interview with podcaster Tim Pool he would “give very serious consideration” to pardoning the WikiLeaks founder—who struck a deal with the U.S. government in June to plead guilty to publishing military secrets, securing his freedom after 12 years in the U.K.—some of it spent in prison—while fighting extradition to the U.S.', 'Biden announced the surprise move Sunday, marking a reversal from his previous statements ruling out a pardon for his son. The sweeping “full and unconditional pardon” prevents Hunter Biden from being prosecuted for any alleged offenses since the start of 2014, in addition to wiping his record of the two felonies. Biden argued his son was “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted” by the Justice Department for political purposes and “singled out only because he is my son,” the president said in a statement.', 'Trump suggested previously he was open to pardoning the president’s son. He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt recently, “I wouldn’t take it off the books . . . despite what they’ve done to me,” when Hewitt asked if he was open to pardoning the younger Biden, suggesting he was taking a moral high ground compared to the Justice Department, which he claims has unfairly prosecuted him.', 'PROMOTED', 'Already, some Jan. 6 defendants and their lawyers have referenced Trump’s pardon promises in court, though most judges have rejected the argument. A D.C. judge denied a request from Christopher Carnell, who was found guilty earlier this year of felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from his participation in the attacks, to delay a hearing in his case, citing Trump’s “multiple clemency promises.” D.C. federal judge Judge Rudolph Contreras agreed to delay the trial of another Jan. 6 defendant, William Pope, until after the inauguration after Pope argued Trump could pardon him and other accused rioters.', 'Journalists, social media users and Polymarket bettors have speculated about a long list of characters, while others facing criminal charges have made new requests to Trump after his election. Journalists and prosecutors have suggested Trump could order the Justice Department to dismiss the federal corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams or pardon him if he’s convicted. Trump has said he predicted Adams would be indicted because of Adams’ sharp rhetoric regarding the migrant crisis in New York City, building on his baseless claims that the Justice Department is working at the Biden administration’s behest. “I know what it’s like to be persecuted by the D.O.J. for speaking out against open borders,” Trump said at a charity dinner in New York City earlier this year, sympathizing with Adams. In another case that has links to Trump’s own criminal election interference charges in Georgia, Trump has said rapper Young Thug was being treated “very unfairly” during an interview with podcaster Adin Ross in August. The rapper recently agreed to plead guilty to drug- and gun-related charges in the racketeering case brought by Fulton County Prosecutor Fani Willis’ office, who also charged Trump under the state’s RICO statute. Washington Post columnist Phillip Bump also predicted Trump “would almost certainly quickly pardon” Todd and Julie Chrisley, the Atlanta reality TV stars serving prison time for federal tax evasion and bank fraud charges. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, spoke at the Republican National Convention and derided “rogue prosecutors . . . the Democrats’ corruption” and “the Biden family’s corruption” in what was widely viewed as a direct appeal to Trump to pardon her parents if he were elected.', 'Federal judges dismissed the Justice Department’s classified documents and election interference cases against Trump last month at the request of the DOJ, which has a long standing precedent of declining to prosecute sitting presidents. The Justice Department could still bring charges against Trump after he leaves office, leaving open the possibility Trump could pardon himself for potential future indictments before he leaves office. The Constitution prohibits Trump from pardoning cases at the state level, which rules out his ability to pardon himself in his New York criminal fraud case and his Fulton County, Georgia, election interference case.', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', 'The legality of the scenario is unclear as Trump is the first person elected president to have been convicted of a crime, but Trump previously dismissed the idea, telling NBC News last year, prior to his Manhattan hush money conviction, it was “very unlikely” he’d pardon himself, because he “didn’t do anything wrong.” Legal scholars are split on whether the Constitution would permit him to do so. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley noted in a 2018 USA Today column that “there is no language” in the Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, which lays out the terms for presidential pardons, that specifies “who may or may not be the subject of a pardon,” leaving open the possibility the president could pardon himself, though Turley writes that “it would be a disastrous idea.” Others, including law professors Laurence Tribe, Richard Painter and Norman Eisen, wrote for the Washington Post that because the Constitution prevents the president from using his pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal, and those who are removed through impeachment are subject to criminal prosecution, it “would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.”', '143. That’s how many people Trump pardoned during his first White House term. He also issued 94 commutations. Only two other presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, granted fewer acts of clemency, according to Pew Research. Trump’s pardons were particularly controversial because many of the individuals had personal connections to the president, including former members of his 2016 campaign team, Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.', 'Presidents have broad authority to issue pardons in ongoing and completed criminal, but not civil, federal cases under Article II Section 2 of the Constitution, which states the president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Pardons do not wipe convictions from a person’s record, but instead eliminate some, but not all, penalties associated with a conviction. Individuals convicted of federal felonies and pardoned by the president would still be prohibited from voting in federal elections in some states, for example, according to the Brookings Institution. Pardoned individuals also do not have a right to a refund for a monetary fine or the seizure of assets or cash in connection with their criminal cases, unless the pardon was issued before the money or property was “fully vested in a person or entity” or if “the conditions of the pardon preclude this.”', 'Trump Pardons And Commutes 143 People On His Last Day — But Doesn’t Pardon His Family (Forbes)', 'Cybercriminal Ross Ulbricht’s Family Says He’ll Be Freed In January—Here’s What We Know (Forbes)', 'Trump Sprung: Here’s Why—And When—His Criminal Cases Will Get Dropped Or Delayed (Forbes)', ""Sara Dorn is a Forbes news reporter who covers politics, with a focus on elections and Capitol Hill.

Hunter had the .38 calibre Colt Cobra Special for approximately 11 days and never fired it, according to his lawyers.', '', '', '', 'Months later, in September, he pleaded guilty to charges of a scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4m in taxes.', 'For the tax case, he faced up to 17 years in prison, and the gun charges were punishable by up to 25 years. Still, Hunter was expected to receive a shorter sentence, and it was possible he could have avoided prison time entirely.', 'Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced on December 12 on the gun-related charges in Delaware and on December 16 on the tax charges in California.', 'Indeed.', 'In June, Biden ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son. “I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him,” Biden said as his son was facing trial in the Delaware gun case.', 'Separately, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at least seven times – over more than a year – that Biden would not pardon his son.', 'As Biden faced off against former President Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election, he tried to draw a distinction with the realtor-turned-politician – who has been charged in multiple cases.', '“No one is above the law,” he wrote on X in early July, in seeming protest against the US Supreme Court verdict granting broad immunity to Trump for any legal violations he committed while president.', 'No one is above the law.', '— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2024', '', 'In a statement by the White House on Sunday, Biden announced his decision to grant executive clemency to his son, Hunter Biden.', 'Biden explained that this decision was made in response to what he described as a politically motivated attack orchestrated by his opponents, to damage his reputation.', '“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said in the statement.', '“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong.”', 'Biden also emphasised, “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. … I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.”', 'Statement from President Biden', '“Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter…”', 'Full statement: https://t.co/InKuzm3vMF pic.twitter.com/vhxIjr1xIe', '— CSPAN (@cspan) December 2, 2024', '', 'Hunter said in a statement he would never take the reprieve “for granted”.', '“I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,” he said in a statement.', '“I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.”', 'The US Constitution says a president has the power to grant clemency, which includes pardons, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.', 'A pardon absolves individuals of federal criminal offences and restores all civil liberties and rights, while a commutation lessens penalties without completely removing them. An amnesty is the same as a pardon but it’s extended to a group of individuals.', 'This power originates from English law, where the king could show mercy to anyone, and it later travelled across the Atlantic Ocean to the American colonies. US presidents often use this authority.', 'It’s not uncommon for US presidents to use this power to pardon or commute the sentence of a family member.', 'In his final weeks in office in 2021, Donald Trump issued about 100 pardons and commutations. Among the people he pardoned were Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.', 'In 2005, Kushner was sentenced to two years for tax evasion, illegal campaign donations, and witness tampering.

But also, I think it raises a much larger question of where the US stands now as a nation of laws,” he added.', 'Experts also suggest that this also places the US in a challenging position in its global role.', '“It’s going to be very difficult for the US … as it tries to hammer other nations, including China, Russia, and North Korea,” Ham said.', '“I think it blurs the lines, and I think it makes it difficult for the US to make those arguments. When you look at successive moves being made by Biden and Donald Trump, who ran on pardoning January 6th insurrectionists, I think the argument for the US becomes harder as the nation moves forward,” he explained.', '“The law seems to only work for or doesn’t work for certain people,” Ham added.', 'Both Biden and Trump have alleged that the Department of Justice has been influenced by politics.', 'Biden argued that the case was used to attack him and oppose his election.

Biden’s Pardon of Hunter Further Undermines His Legacy,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/bidens-pardon-of-hunter-further-undermines-his-legacy,"['For the first seven months of 2024, in that long period before Joe Biden was finally forced to reckon with both the realities of his diminished capacities and popularity, an essential question to ask the aging President was how he understood the singular priority of his job: insuring that Donald Trump did not regain control of the executive branch. He began the year by campaigning for reëlection, but during the debate with Trump in late June, he wheezed through confusing answers and sent the Democratic Party into a full-blown panic. Over the next month, Biden stubbornly and selfishly insisted on running a doomed campaign. Even after he eventually relinquished the nomination, he often appeared bitter and grumpy about having been forced to step aside.', 'This drama was often cast as a tragedy—a good man forced, at last, to face mortality and relinquish power. A more worrying analysis, however, arose from the strong impression that throughout this drama, the national interest was not at the forefront of Biden’s mind. On Sunday night, Biden pardoned his son Hunter with the stroke of the Presidential pen. Earlier this year, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges, and was scheduled to be sentenced later this month. He had also been convicted in June of three federal gun charges. He will now face no punishment in either case, and the pardon extends to any “offenses” he “has committed or may have committed” starting in 2014. Some rushed to cast the drama in terms of decency—a father, understandably, rescuing his child from a prison term. But Biden has once again forced Americans to ask whether he is acting in the national interest, or in response to private whims and grievances.', 'Many will make the argument, as the Bidens do, that Hunter was definitely a mess, deeply flawed, but the only reason he was facing a long prison term was because he was the President’s son in an age of political war. But, in fact, Biden is not an ordinary man and, by pardoning his son he is once more losing sight of his overriding objective: to diminish Donald Trump’s capacity to do violence to the liberal-democratic institutions which Biden claims his Presidency centered on upholding. Indeed, regardless of whether Biden’s age (now eighty-two) or his character is to blame, the statement he released about the pardon makes clear that he does not grasp the differences between his responsibilities to his job and his responsibilities to his family. “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,” Biden wrote.', 'This is a strange utterance for the President of the United States to make about official business. Americans should not be expected to understand why “a father” is making this decision; it is simply the wrong standard by which the most powerful man on Earth should ask to be judged. Worse, it is a more maudlin parallel of the manner in which Biden’s predecessor and successor operates—not as the head of a democratic government but, far too often, as the leader of a gangster family. (Trump has already announced that he is appointing two of his children’s in-laws for government roles; this type of insider dealing will seem quaint within weeks of his Inauguration.)', 'Biden, in his statement, claimed that his son had been charged “selectively” and “unfairly.” Legal experts disagree about exactly how unfair the prosecution was: the tax case is widely seen to have merit whereas the gun charges seem to be rare and targeted. At any rate, the charges were brought by Biden’s own Department of Justice. Then, Biden continued, “a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room—with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process.” But the likelihood of political pressure influencing a plea deal is not sufficient cause to short-circuit the judicial process. The rest of Biden’s statement is a combination of his more blustery side (“enough is enough”) and soggy paeans to the wisdom of the American people (“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded.”). By any measure, it falls short of explaining why Biden made this decision—especially after promising repeatedly that he would not, and having his staff do the same.', 'The Trump team must surely be pleased today, because every conceivable argument it could make for allowing a man like Kash Patel to lead the F.B.I. may now sound just a bit more convincing to any wavering Republican. (This should not, of course, be an excuse for any senator who votes for Patel, or any other unqualified and dangerous Trump nominee.) More broadly, Biden’s decision allows Republicans to engage in the same cynicism about the system being rigged and corrupt, and Trump being no different than any other politician, that they have engaged in for nearly a decade. This couldn’t be further from the truth—especially the part about Trump’s corruption and self-dealing being no different from the norm—but Biden is doing the work of people who want to wreck the best aspects of America’s democratic ethos.', 'The pardon now gives Trump and his allies the opportunity to call Biden a hypocrite and proceed having their own way with the law. “Most Americans can sympathize with a father’s decision to pardon his son, even if they disagree,” Senator Tom Cotton said on Monday. “What they can’t forgive is Biden lying about it repeatedly before the election. . . . Democrats can spare us the lectures about the rule of law when, say, President Trump nominates Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to clean up this corruption.” Cotton is being predictably disingenuous, but Democrats now can only hope that slightly more reasonable Republican senators than Cotton will not fall for this logic.', 'Biden’s defenders will surely use Patel and his ilk to justify the President’s move, because Trump and his team have promised to go after his political enemies—including, in Biden’s case, his children. Based on this understanding, the pardon preëmpted what is coming from the next Administration. But, if that were the reason for the pardon, why did Biden pardon only his son? And if he was willing to offer Hunter a pardon for any crimes, even ones that he has not been charged with, why not extend the same to Anthony Fauci, Andrew McCabe, Barack Obama, or anyone else on the (long) list of people Trump wants to prosecute and persecute? And, if Biden plans to pardon some of these people, why would he begin this perhaps understandable campaign with his son? Needless to say, this particular motive is not mentioned in Biden’s solipsistic and self-pitying statement.', 'It would be comforting to think that this nearly final act from Biden is a break from his legacy, and his Presidency—the regrettable lapse in judgment of an aging lion who has given his country a life of service and made it a better and fairer place. Biden, as a senator and President, has many accomplishments to his name, and one hopes that the most substantive of them, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, survive the next four years. But the unfortunate possibility is that his behavior this past year will overshadow his achievements in the history books, and even in the memories of the minority of Americans who approve of his Presidency. By putting his selfish aspirations above his responsibilities, Biden paved Trump’s path back to Washington. On Sunday night, he let personal desires take over again. The consequences of the latter action won’t be nearly as dire, but that decision was made for the same reasons. It’s a fitting coda to a tragic Presidency. ♦', 'Little treats galore: a holiday gift guide.', 'What happened when the Hallmark Channel “leaned into Christmas.”', 'An objectively objectionable grammatical pet peeve.', 'Two teens went to prison for murder.
