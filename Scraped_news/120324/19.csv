All have pushed to curb the global dominance of the US dollar. He wrote that he would impose a 100% tariff on those countries' goods unless they committed to not creating another currency that competes with the dollar."", '""There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America,"" Trump wrote.', ""Business Insider looked at the top goods the US imports from BRICS nations, including medicine, apparel, and electronics. While Trump appears to be using the tariff threats as a negotiating tool and could choose not to implement them at the scale he's proposing, the top imports from the targeted countries could see prices increase even with smaller tariffs."", ""Census Bureau trade data showed that in 2023, the BRICS nations together accounted for about $578 billion in US imports. China was responsible for the lion's share of that trade, with about $427 billion."", 'In 2023, the US imported $66.7 billion in cellphones and other household goods from China, $37.4 billion in computers, and $32 billion in toys, games, and sporting goods.', 'The US imported $151 billion in goods from the remaining eight BRICS nations, including over $11 billion in pharmaceutical preparations, followed by nearly $9 billion in gem diamonds, $6.3 billion in crude oil, and $6.1 billion in cotton apparel and household goods. India accounted for much of the imports from BRICS nations other than China.', ""Trump is targeting this group because some BRICS leaders have previously suggested acting to reduce their countries' reliance on the US dollar. Last year, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva proposed creating a common currency among the BRICS nations."", 'The tariff threat on BRICS came just days after Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada that would remain in effect ""until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"" He also warned of a 10% tariff on imports from China on top of any additional tariffs put in place on the country.', 'Russia has already responded to Trump\'s tariff threat. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that if the US used ""economic force to compel countries to use the dollar,"" it would empower countries to shift to other currencies for international trade.', 'Some companies, including Walmart and Columbia Sportswear, have already said they are preparing to increase prices should Trump implement tariffs on key trading partners.', 'The Trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how the proposed tariffs might affect prices. Trump has previously said tariffs will not hurt Americans, misleadingly calling them ""a tax on another country"" (tariffs imposed by the US are paid by US importers).', 'During Trump\'s first term, he threatened tariffs against Mexico as a response to illegal immigration over the southern US border but later withdrew the plan. Sen. Bill Hagerty told NBC News on Sunday that trade had long been used as a ""strategic tool,"" and he said he supported Trump using tariffs as leverage to achieve his priorities.', '""We need to take a very hard look at countries that don\'t have our best interests at heart, countries that are allowing our borders to be violated,"" Hagerty said, ""and use those tariffs as a tool to achieve our ends.""', '']"

But we're reminded that Trump can make or break sentiment on a whim with his eye now on BRICS countries, which saw AUD/USD fall alongside the FX barometer of risk on Monday."", 'Share this:', 'President-elect Trump upped the ante with his own tariff threats, this time quoting a hefty 100% tariff on BRIC countries if they fail to commit to not creating a new currency to dethrone the US dollar. BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. While the topic of BRICS creating a new currency is not new, this is the first real action the US has taken to stifle it. It certainly paves the way for a turbulent 2025, something I warned about last week via price action clues on AUD/JPY.', ' ', 'The US dollar index snapped a four-day losing streak, which saw EUR/USD come close to retesting its 2023 low before recovering to 1.05. While Europe is not part of BRICS, it has many economic ties with countries within it, and yesterday’s threats served as a reminder to Europe that high tariffs could be a real prospect and not just a bad dream. This helped EUR/USD earn its place as Monday’s weakest FX major.', ' ', '', ' ', 'Commodity currencies were also bruised, which saw AUD/USD retest its February low and print a bearish engulfing day. Only the yen held up to USD strength as it sucked in safe-haven flows and renewed bets of a 25bp BOJ hike this month.', ' ', 'Australia’s data was mostly disappointed on Tuesday, and even the strong retail sales figure could be short lived. Retail sales delivered a punchy 0.6% rise in October, although this is likely due to retailers bringing forward Black Friday sales and parting consumers from their Christmas-spending money, which leaves December’s figures vulnerable for disappointment. Job ads were -1.3% lower according to ANZ, down from 0.7% previously. Company profits fell a further -4.6% in Q3, down from -6.8% in Q2 and missing the low consensus of 0.8% q/q. Private housing approvals also contracted by -5.2% in October, compared with a 2.2% rise in September.', ' ', 'This sets the stage for a set of soft Australian GDP figures tomorrow.', ' ', ' ', '', ' ', 'In yesterday’s outlook report, I noted that range-trading strategies might be preferred for AUD/USD, given the plethora of resistance levels around the October low alongside demand around the February low. Risks of a downside break appear to have increased. This would be in line with its daily trend, which met resistance at the 20-day EMA twice last week and yesterday. A break of last week’s low brings the 64c handle and the August low into focus.', ' ', 'The 1-hour chart shows a strong rebound from the weekly S1 pivot (0.6446) and February low. Yet with the 200-day MA (0.6498) and weekly pivot point (0.6497) overhead and the 1-hour RSI (2) overbought, today’s preference is to fade into rallies towards resistance and target Monday’s low initially. A break beneath would bring the lower targets into focus.', '', ' ', '', ' ', 'The FX barometer of risk suffered a near 18% decline from the July high to the August low. A three-wave countertrend rally (which was more of a grind than a rally) ensued before stalling beneath the 2014 high. Momentum has now realigned with the trend from the July high, and I suspect further losses are more likely than not over the coming weeks or months.', ' ', 'However, the daily chart shows that Monday’s low held above a weekly VPOC (volume point of control) and a small bullish divergence has formed on the daily RSI (2) in the oversold zone. This is more of a warning for bears not to jump late into a move as opposed to seeking a long setup.

Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-brics-nations-china-russia-brazil/,"['Watch CBS News', 'By Megan Cerullo', 'Edited By Alain Sherter', 'Updated on: December 2, 2024 / 3:41 PM EST / CBS News', 'President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations — the so-called BRICS — if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency. ', ""The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange. "", '""We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,"" Trump said on Truth Social.', ""Trump's move comes after he recently threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S."", 'The BRICS — named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) — was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce. ', 'The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world. ', 'In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new  international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying ""the dollar is being used as a weapon,"" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade. ', ""Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars. "", '""Economically, it\'s not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,"" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.', ""In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex."", '""Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don\'t have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,"" Weinstock said. ', ""Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency."", '""Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,"" South Africa\'s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. ""This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.""', 'While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.', '""Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,"" Weinstock said. ""That\'s always the impact of the tariff."" ', 'Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.', ""Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak. "", '""It isn\'t a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,"" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist, wrote on X. ', 'Trump\'s threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar ""is actually a long-run threat to the dollar\'s global role.""', '""It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,"" he added.

The idea that they can create a common currency to take on the US dollar is pure fantasy. While Russian President Vladimir Putin has flirted with the idea by showing off a colourful Brics banknote at a recent summit in Kazan this year, he was quick to clarify that the group is not considering a new currency.', 'The member states are unified by a shared discontent with the US-led world order and belief that their voices do not get the attention they deserve. Still, the group lacks influential institutions or capabilities.', 'The Shanghai-based New Development Bank, formerly the Brics Development Bank, is unlikely to assume the role of central bank. The group’s annual summit offers a new chance for state leaders to mingle and provides a stage to make symbolic political gestures, but little else.', 'Despite the undertone of resentment towards US hegemony, the term Bric was first published by American investment bank Goldman Sachs. The acronym was coined by British economist Jim O’Neill to inform clients about trading and investment patterns, like the Pigs tag for Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain during the European debt crisis.', 'The term Bric started to gain political weight after the G8 summit in Japan in 2008. One unconfirmed story is that Japan listed G8 members as honoured guests while the five invitees – China, Brazil, Mexico, India and South Africa – were peripheral. The G8+5 global governance was quickly discarded for a more equal and inclusive G20, and Bric states started to develop some camaraderie.

BRICS currency: Is Trump's tariff threat justified?,https://www.dw.com/en/brics-currency-is-trumps-tariff-threat-justified/a-70934600,"['President-elect Donald Trump has warned BRICS nations of 100% tariffs over plans for a new currency to challenge the US dollar. DW examines why these economies are taking on the world’s reserve currency.', ""The BRICS nations — named after original members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — are among the fast-growing economies in the 21st century. They are keen to reduce their dependence on the US dollar, the world's reserve currency, used for nearly 80% of global trade."", 'Most economists agree that the dollar-dominated financial system gives the United States major economic advantages, including lower borrowing costs, the ability to sustain larger fiscal deficits and exchange-rate stability, among others. ', 'The dollar is the main currency used to price commodities like oil and gold, and its stability means investors often flock to the dollar during uncertain times.', 'Washington also benefits from enormous geopolitical influence from so-called dollarization, including the ability to impose sanctions on other nations and restrict their access to trade and capital.', 'BRICS nations, which expanded recently to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, have accused Washington of ""weaponizing"" the dollar, leveraging the currency so that rivals must operate within a framework defined by US interests.', 'Discussions about a new joint currency gained traction after the US and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia over its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, amid concerns other BRICS nations could be targeted if they fell out with the West.', 'The creation of a BRICS currency was first mooted shortly after the 2008/9 financial crisis, when a US real estate boom and poor regulations nearly collapsed the entire global banking system.', ""At last year's BRICS summit in South Africa, the bloc agreed to study the possibility of creating a common currency to minimize exposure to dollar-related risks, although BRICS leaders noted it would likely take many years to come to fruition."", 'Russian President Vladimir Putin went further during the most recent BRICS summit in Kasan in October, proposing a blockchain-based international payments system, designed to circumvent Western sanctions.', ""There was little enthusiasm for Putin's plan, but BRICS leaders did agree to facilitate more trade in local currencies, cutting their reliance on the dollar."", 'Putin and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are the strongest proponents of the new currency. While China has not explicitly expressed a view, Beijing has supported initiatives to reduce reliance on the dollar. India, meanwhile, is a lot more cautious about the idea.', 'A new joint currency would be a huge undertaking for BRICS nations, fraught with many complexities due to the differing political and economic systems within the nine current members. The BRICS states are at varied stages of economic development and have vastly different growth rates.', ""China, for example, is an authoritarian state but is responsible for about 70% of the bloc's total gross domestic product (GDP) at $17.8 trillion (€17 trillion). China runs a trade surplus and maintains a large holding of dollars to support its competitiveness as a major exporter. India, on the other hand, runs a trade deficit, is the world's largest democracy and its economy is worth $3.7 trillion."", ""China's dominance in BRICS would create a huge imbalance that would make it tricky for New Dehli to agree on a framework for the new currency that wouldn't overshadow its national interests. Disparities between other BRICS members are also likely to spur resistance to a shared currency."", '', 'It is also unlikely that the BRICS members want to eventually move towards a fully-traded currency like the dollar or euro.
