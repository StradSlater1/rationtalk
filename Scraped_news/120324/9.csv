In addition to the battery-powered “non-persistent” anti-personnel mines, which can be set to deactivate after a certain period of time, the newest package includes air defense missiles and Javelin, TOW and AT-4 anti-armor weapons, counter-drone munitions, 155mm artillery shells and “equipment to protect critical national infrastructure,” according to the Defense Department.', 'Pentagon officials said last month that the Defense Department had the authority to issue about $6.8 billion from Pentagon inventories, but they have increasingly acknowledged doubt about withdrawing that much from inventories before Biden leaves office in January because of the risk of undermining U.S. readiness.', 'Asked how the U.S. could issue $6.8 billion in equipment by Jan. 20, Major General Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters earlier Monday that “we understand the urgent situation in Ukraine and the president’s direction and will continue to do everything we can to ensure that Ukraine is getting the aid that it needs.”', 'In a statement, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that “between now and mid-January, we will deliver hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds, thousands of additional rockets, and other critical capabilities to help Ukraine defend its freedom and independence.”', 'The Biden administration is pressing ahead amid uncertainty about how President-elect Donald Trump will handle U.S. support for Kyiv in its fight against Russia’s invasion. Trump campaigned on a promise to end the war quickly once he takes office. Retired General Keith Kellogg, Trump’s pick for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has raised the possibility of cutting off military aid to Kyiv. But he also told Fox News that Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to fire US-made ATACMS missiles inside Russia has “actually given President Trump more leverage.”', 'Separately, the White House last week asked Congress to provide an additional $24 billion in security assistance for Ukraine as U.S. weapons stocks are dwindling.', 'The White House is seeking to designate that money as “emergency spending.” The administration requested $8 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which finances long-term weapons contracts with U.S. defense contractors. The remaining $16 billion would be used to replenish U.S. weapons stocks. But the package depends on approval by Congress, which is considered a long shot.', '(With assistance from Larry Liebert and John Harney.)', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

You need soldiers.”', 'The US has been able to authorize military aid packages totaling approximately $750 million per month recently, according to one US official. This fall, DoD increased the size of the military aid packages at the request of Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the official said.', '“We’re basically trying to do everything we can to leave everything on the table and put Ukraine in the strongest position,” the official said.', 'Now, the administration is working to increase that amount to about $1 billion per month in the time remaining, a second US official said, but that will still leave billions unused.', 'Both officials said there are still large quantities of weapons and equipment that will arrive in Ukraine before the start of the Trump administration on January 20, including hundreds of air defense missiles. Then it will be up to the new administration to decide whether to continue to flow weapons to Kyiv or use the remaining authority to send new military aid packages.', 'In September, Biden committed billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House. But the US was not able to send all of the aid at once, instead breaking it down into smaller packages announced approximately every two weeks.', '“As part of the surge in security assistance that President Biden announced on September 26, the Department remains committed to providing Ukraine with the capabilities it needs to fight Russian aggression through the end of the Administration,” a defense official told CNN.', 'The Biden administration has continued to announce military aid packages twice a month, but the US is still far short of the pace required to use the remaining money. In the previous two months, the US announced a total of $1.9 billion in Ukraine assistance across five different aid packages, a number that would have to triple to use what’s left to give from the Biden administration. The last package, announced on November 20, was worth $275 million and included much-needed artillery rounds and drones.', 'Biden led a concerted effort to convince some skeptical Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to pass a supplemental funding bill in April that included $61 billion in aid for Ukraine.', '“It’s going to make America safer. It’s going to make the world safer. And it continues America’s leadership in the world,” Biden said upon signing the bill on April 24.
