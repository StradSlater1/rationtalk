Here’s how it works.', ""According to Bloomberg, the outgoing Biden administration is preparing new rules to slow down or limit advancements in China's semiconductor industry. Still, the new restrictions will not be as severe as initially expected. While the new measures will reportedly hit select chipmakers, their main purpose is to curb the development of China-based producers of chipmaking equipment and limit the supply of fab tools that could be used to advance China's AI sector."", 'The new rules focus on limiting exports to specific Chinese entities rather than broad categories of chipmakers. In particular, the new measures will sanction two fabs owned by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC). Additionally, of about 12 known suppliers to Huawei, a company on the U.S. Entity List, only a few will be added to the Entity List and, therefore, banned from U.S. technology. Others, including Huawei, will be able to continue serving their customers.', ""Also, while the new restrictions will include some provisions regarding high-bandwidth memory (HBM), ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), one of China's DRAM makers capable of making HBM2, will not be directly affected."", ""However, the list will include over 100 companies in emerging semiconductor manufacturing equipment. These firms, often government-funded, are meant to develop chipmaking gear that will eventually replace tools from the world's biggest suppliers, such as ASML, Applied Materials, KLA, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron. This will enable Chinese companies like Huawei and SMIC to make chips on leading-edge process technologies without any restrictions, which the U.S. would prefer to avoid."", ""The proposed restrictions are not final, so things may change when the President signs the bill. The evolving plan reflects a compromise between curbing China's technological progress and mitigating economic harm to American and allied companies. The restrictions, which could be announced the following Monday, are believed to be less severe than initially considered."", 'The proposal follows extensive lobbying by American chipmakers, including Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research, who opposed broader restrictions. These companies argued that harsher measures would put them at a competitive disadvantage against foreign rivals like Japan-based Tokyo Electron and the Netherlands-based ASML. Japan and the Netherlands have imposed limited export curbs similar to earlier U.S. restrictions from 2022.

[Photo: Chinatopix Via AP, File]', 'BY ASSOCIATED PRESS\n2 MINUTE READ', 'China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.\n\nThe ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.\n\nChina said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.\n\nThe limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include super-hard materials, which would include diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.\n\nChina is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.\n\nAfter the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called “entity list” subject to strict export controls. China’s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China’s “rights and interests” Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington’s latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.\n\nBoth governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.\n\nChina’s government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China’s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.\n\nVarious Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.\n\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, “abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.”\n\n“Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.\n\n“U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China’s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year.', 'AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.', '—Elaine Kurtenbach, AP Business Writer', 'Fast Company & Inc © 2024 Mansueto Ventures, LLC', 'Fastcompany.com adheres to NewsGuard’s nine standards of credibility and transparency.

In general, exporting certain technologies to companies on the list requires a license from the federal government.', 'Blocking military development', 'The latest round of sanctions is specifically aimed at preventing China from fabricating advanced semiconductors on its own, out of concern that it would then incorporate AI into new military hardware and advanced tools of social control.', '“Advanced AI models could be used for rapid response scenarios on the battlefield; lowering the barrier to develop cyberweapons or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons; and utilizing facial and voice recognition to repress and surveil minorities and political dissidents,” the department said in a release announcing the sanctions.', '“This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration’s targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair [China’s] ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies that pose a risk to our national security,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement.', '“The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the same statement. “As technology evolves, and our adversaries seek new ways to evade restrictions, we will continue to work with our allies and partners to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how so they aren’t used to undermine our national security.”', 'China responds', 'In a statement sent to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington condemned the sanctions.', ""“China strongly opposes the U.S.' latest control measures on semiconductor export. The move is a typical economic coercion and non-market practice,” the embassy said."", 'The embassy accused the United States of “overstretching” the idea of national security, abusing export control rules and “bullying.”', ""“The semiconductor industry is highly globalized,” the statement said. “The US' abuse of regulatory measures severely hinders normal economic and trade exchanges among countries, undermines market rules and the international economic and trade order, and poses a serious threat to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. The global semiconductor industry, including US companies, has been severely affected.”"", 'The statement concluded with the promise that, “China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”', 'Significant impact', 'Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told VOA that the new sanctions are likely to do real damage to China’s effort to create a world-class domestic chip manufacturing industry.', 'In an email exchange with VOA, Ezell said that manufacturing semiconductors is “perhaps the most complex engineering task humanity undertakes,” and that simply building the machinery to manufacture them requires a vast array of inputs, access to many of which the U.S. can meaningfully restrict.', '“Those tools … depend on literally dozens of thousands of inputs and components, many provided by specialized suppliers from across the world,” Ezell wrote. “If Chinese toolmakers don’t have ready access to these, it makes their task of recreating a wholly indigenous supply chain that much more difficult and expensive.”', 'Ezell said the loss of market share in China will hurt U.S. manufacturers unable to sell into the country, but he pointed out that China’s goal has been to eliminate its dependence on foreign chips anyway, which would produce the same result.', '“The way to deal with the challenge is for the United States (and like-minded allies) to stimulate the growth of semiconductor industries in places like India or Malaysia, so sales that are lost in China can be recaptured elsewhere, because we’re expanding semiconductor production in like-minded nations,” Ezell said.', 'He added that it is important that the U.S. team up with other major semiconductor manufacturing and equipment-making nations to institute similar policies toward China.', 'Advanced chips', 'The primary target of the new U.S. export controls are so-called “advanced node” chips and the equipment used to manufacture them. Advanced node chips’ distinguishing factor is the size of the transistors used in their manufacture.', 'Some transistors can be as small as three nanometers — three one-billionths of a meter — in length. The smaller the individual transistors are, means more of them can be placed on a single chip, making them better at processing information, and more energy efficient.', 'For advanced node chips to operate at their full potential, they need to be paired with high-bandwidth computer memory, which can provide high-speed access to vast amounts of data.', '']"

US to Introduce New Restrictions on China’s Access to Cutting-Edge Chips,https://www.wired.com/story/memory-restrictions-china-advanced-chips/,"['Watch It Live | 10AM - 4PM PST', 'THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION is expected to announce a sweeping set of measures on Monday designed to further restrain China’s ability to develop advanced artificial intelligence, people familiar with the matter told WIRED. The controls could include sanctioning dozens of Chinese companies that produce equipment for making semiconductors, as well as placing restrictions on a handful of chip manufacturing plants, some of which have ties to the Chinese tech giant Huawei.', 'The US Department of Commerce has also discussed including controls on the sale of high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, an advanced kind of 3D-stacked computer memory component that is often used in high-performance GPUs and customized AI chips. Bloomberg previously reported that the Biden administration was considering clamping down on China’s access to HBM chips.', 'In total, the Biden administration could end up adding around 200 Chinese firms to an entity list maintained by the Bureau of Industry and Security—an agency within the Commerce department—which would require other companies to acquire special licenses to supply them with software or products from the United States. The US government has been discussing the new measures with its allies and representatives from the semiconductor industry for months, and the exact details of what will be announced on Monday were still in flux as of earlier this week.', 'FEATURED VIDEO', ' ', 'A spokesperson for the Commerce department declined to comment. Huawei did not immediately return a request for comment.', 'Reuters reported on Friday that the US Chamber of Commerce, a powerful advocacy group for American businesses, warned its members in an email last week that a new round of export controls targeting China would be arriving “prior to the Thanksgiving break,"" though that timing now appears to have been pushed back by a few days.', '“China is firmly opposed to the US overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control measures and making malicious attempts to block and suppress China,” Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said at a regularly scheduled press conference earlier this week in response to the anticipated controls.', 'The limits on China’s access to the high-bandwidth memory seem aimed at slowing the country’s efforts to develop domestic chips capable of training very large and powerful AI models. The new restrictions are expected to block access to HMB3, one of the people told WIRED, the latest and most advanced version of the technology, and impose some limits on access to the previous generation, known as HMB2.', 'The US government has been imposing similar export controls on China aimed at limiting its ability to mint advanced silicon for years, but the controls apparently didn’t stop Huawei from developing competitive chips for training large AI models.', 'The Chinese tech giant, which was temporarily crippled by US sanctions half a decade ago, sent samples of its latest AI training chip, called Ascend, to customers this September, according to the South China Morning Post. Companies testing Ascend reportedly include ByteDance, the Chinese parent of TikTok, which is said to be training a large model primarily using Ascend.

In 2019, several up-and-coming Chinese AI firms were added to the entity list, meaning that US firms, including chipmakers like Nvidia, would be required to get a special license to do business with them. This was followed by restrictions on sales of chips made with US technology to Huawei, China’s dominant telco and a leading smartphone manufacturer.', 'The Biden administration ratcheted up the controls in October 2022, limiting exports to China of cutting-edge GPU chips, including those made by Nvidia, a move aimed at curbing any Chinese company’s ability to train the most powerful AI models.

US CURBS HBM EXPORTS TO CHINA – MORE FOR THE REST OF US,https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/12/02/us-curbs-hbm-exports-to-china-more-for-the-rest-of-us/,"['Current US president Joe Biden and once and future president Donald Trump do not agree on much. But they absolutely agree that advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques as well as chips made with those processes to host HPC and AI applications should not be easily accessible to the military in the People Republic of China.', 'And so, the Bureau of Industry and Security at the US Department of Commerce has put out a whole new set of rules that, among other things, restrict the export of HBM stacked DRAM to the Middle Kingdom.', 'The wonder is not that this has happened, but rather why it took so long to happen given how critical HBM is to the functioning of certain high performance CPUs as well as just about every kind of datacenter accelerator (such as GPUs and various custom ASICs such as TPUs and RDUs) that is used for AI training and inference as well as for HPC simulation and modeling.', 'It is not an exaggeration to say that the market for GPU accelerators is gated to a large extent to the availability of HBM memory, which is linked to accelerator chips through various means, usually with the family of 2.5D CoWoS interposers from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Manufacturing accelerator chips is fairly easy, even if you compose them out of chiplets with die-to-die (D2D) interconnects, sometimes called chip-to-chip (or C2C) interconnects, to create compute engines that are larger than the 800 mm2 area limit of the reticle of an modern immersion lithography machine.', 'The Commerce Department has finally figured out that curbing exports of GPUs and other accelerators with certain raw floating point performance and certain HBM memory capacities and bandwidths is not enough, hence the new rules to curb the distribution of the HBM memory itself. The original curbs on AI and HPC accelerators kept certain devices that have military uses from getting into China, and curbs on the export of advanced chip making technologies kept Chinese organizations from etching advanced compute engines themselves.', 'But as several Chinese exascale-class supercomputers show, you can do a lot with 14 nanometer processes on chips with DDR4 main memory, as the “Tianhe-3” system appears to do as does the ”OceanLight” system. Both of these were installed in 2021. As far as Hyperion Research knows, China installed a new exascale machine each year in 2022, 2023, and 2024, which makes five machines, and there is an outside chance that what all the kerfuffle is all about is that one or more of these machines used an accelerator with HBM memory instead of DDR5 memory. China is expected to install another one or two exascale machines in 2025, and two more in 2026. We think these machines almost certainly intended to use HBM memory.', 'That plan may now have to change. If China can’t get HBM memory, then that memory will be available for other uses, which will benefit Nvidia, AMD, and those making their own AI accelerators. More supply will be available for them to play with. Which is the real upside as far as we are concerned.', 'Under the new BIS export rules, which you can see here, HBM memory exported to China has to have a memory bandwidth density of less than 3.3 GB/sec per mm2 – which doesn’t sound very high at all but then again, we don’t know the specific area figures for HBM memory stacks used in the calculations. What we do know is that a DDR5 memory chip used in HBM memory is somewhere between 100 mm2 and 125 mm2 in size. HBM2E topped out at 461 GB/sec per stack, and divided by 100 mm2 would be a memory density of 4.6 GB/sec per mm2 and by 125 mm2 would be a memory density of 3.7 GB/sec per mm2. To our estimation, HBM2, which is now eight years old, would make the cut at 3.1 GB/sec per mm2. And China can forget about HBM3, HBM3E, and HBM4, if our estimations of what the Commerce Department is talking about are correct.', 'The new rules apply to HBM memory made in the United States – that is you, Micron – as well as that made overseas – that would be you, SK Hynix and Samsung. They are effective today with a compliance deadline of December 31 for certain components, which were not named.', 'In addition to the HBM memory restrictions, another 140 organizations in China were added to the entity list that prevents them from getting HBM memory, advanced accelerators, or advanced chip making gear because the United States wants to not just cut off supplies of chippery, but also China’s ability to make such chips itself. (You can see that updated list here.)', 'The US government is not only worried about the production of high-end compute devices because it helps the Chinese military design advanced weapons, but also because it helps in the development of AI technology that is also, in and of itself, an important weapon and also a part of advanced weapon systems these days, including cyberwarfare.', 'Having said all that, as we have said many times, all of this does in the long run is buy the United States and its allies a little time. In the long run, with the world’s second largest economy and one that is increasingly self sufficient, China can afford to build its own high performance systems, top to bottom and including things that look like HBM and CoWoS.', 'Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW', '', '', '', 'Your email address will not be published.', 'Comment', 'Name *', 'Email *', 'Website', '', '', '', 'This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

On Monday the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said Joe Biden’s presidency had been especially tough in “strategically addressing China’s military modernisation through export controls”.', 'Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said: “The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security.” Washington would keep working with allies and partners “to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and knowhow so they aren’t used to undermine our national security”.', 'Beijing vowed on Monday to defend its interests, with a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson saying the US “abuses export control measures” and has “hindered normal economic and trade exchanges”.', 'The latest US rules include a restriction of sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission. They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the commerce department. Others include entities in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.', 'The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors. “We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as reassessing and updating our controls,” said Alan Estevez, the undersecretary of commerce for industry and security.', 'The Netherlands-based computer chip equipment maker ASML – which is the only manufacturer of the most cutting edge chip-making machines – said it did not expect the new US restrictions to affect its most recent financial guidance.', 'ASML said the latest US restrictions would affect its export of deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) systems to some chip-making plants in China, if enforced by the Dutch government. ASML is the only maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines (EUV) that produce the most advanced chips. Because of existing government restrictions around the use of US technology, it already cannot sell EUV machines to China.', 'The Dutch government said separately on Monday that it shared US security concerns on the export of advanced semiconductor making tools, and was studying the latest US rules.', 'The US commerce department said the fresh restrictions are meant to slow China’s development of advanced AI that could “change the future of warfare”, and impair China’s development of its own semiconductor ecosystem.', 'The agency maintained that this is in line with Washington’s “small yard, high fence” policy, which targets restrictions strategically – an approach that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, criticised last month.', 'Calls to further close the semiconductor supply chain have grown since the world became increasingly aware of the powers of AI, with the launch of ChatGPT.', 'Thibault Denamiel, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told AFP that the latest actions confirm “the trajectory of US policy rather than significantly stepping up control efforts”.', '“The significance of the additions is lessened given proposals from the incoming Trump administration,” he added, noting the president-elect has vowed drastic actions that dwarf these latest restrictions on chip technologies.', 'With Agence France-Presse']"
The US Just Made It Way Harder for China to Build Its Own AI Chips,https://www.wired.com/story/2024-chips-export-controls-china/,"['The US Department of Commerce introduced a sweeping package of export controls on Monday designed to weaken China’s domestic semiconductor ecosystem and undermine the country’s ability to manufacture advanced chips locally. The new regulations prevent China from accessing 24 types of chip-manufacturing equipment and three software programs, and place restrictions on the sale to China of high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, an advanced kind of 3D-stacked computer memory component that is often used in customized AI chips.', ""“They're the strongest controls ever enacted by the US to degrade the PRC’s ability to make the most advanced chips that they’re using in their military modernization,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. The measures are likely to enrage Beijing, which has given tens of billions of dollars worth of subsidies and tax breaks to semiconductor firms in the hopes of building out its own chips sector."", 'Over the past decade, the United States has grown increasingly concerned that China could use cutting-edge computer chips to build AI-powered military weapons or other technology that threatens the US and its allies. To address the issue, the Biden administration has concentrated its efforts on preventing China from acquiring high-end semiconductors made by companies like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC).', 'FEATURED VIDEO', ' ', 'But China proved it was capable of manufacturing high-end chips on its own, so the US shifted its attention to going after the components and equipment that Chinese companies like Huawei still rely on to produce their homegrown silicon. The measures announced today are the most far-reaching part of that strategy so far. WIRED previously reported the Biden administration was working on the provisions, which are the result of months of negotiations with US allies and industry partners.', 'In response to the anticipated measures, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, accused the United States last week of “overstretching the concept of national security,” and using export controls to suppress China. “Such moves seriously violate the laws of market economy and the principles of fair competition, disrupt international economic and trade order and the stability of global industrial and supply chains,” Mao said at a regularly scheduled press conference.', 'One of the most significant changes introduced is an update to the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDP), a relatively obscure trade regulation that covers goods made in other countries with US technology, software, or components. Previously, only foreign-made chip manufacturing equipment and tools with more than 25 percent of US components were subject to FDP. That threshold is now being abolished, meaning that if any American technology was used to create, say, a lithography tool in the Netherlands or a memory component in South Korea, it will be subject to US export controls.', 'The shift is a big deal, since US technology is everywhere—just look at the ubiquity of Microsoft Windows or Google’s Android software. The semiconductor industry publication Semianalysis hypothesized in October that removing the 25 percent threshold could be devastating for Chinese chip manufacturing plants, commonly referred to as fabs. “At its own discretion the US could stop Chinese capacity expansion immediately, and existing fabs would be severely handicapped if not inoperable within six months,” Semianalysis reported.', 'The Commerce Department said it was also adding 140 Chinese companies to its so-called entity list, which requires other companies to acquire special licenses to supply them with software or products from the United States. The new additions include Chinese tool manufacturers, fabs, and investment companies “that are acting at the behest of Beijing to further the PRC’s advanced chip goals,” according to a press release.', 'The problem with the entity list, however, is that it’s easy to circumvent. Many large corporations have extensive networks of existing subsidiaries, not all of which may be subject to US export controls, and the lines between them can sometimes get blurry. A particularly illustrative example is the current controversy over Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), a Chinese chip manufacturer whose most advanced production line has already been sanctioned by the US government.', 'In a letter to the Commerce Department last month, House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Michael McCaul noted that only a “wafer bridge” that is “designed to support frictionless transfers across facilities” separated SMIC’s high-end production line from another non-sanctioned legacy facility that is free to purchase whatever chip manufacturing equipment it wants.', 'With these latest measures, the US government is trying to close these kinds of loopholes. In addition to the entity list updates and restrictions on equipment and tools, the Commerce Department also released new “red flag” guidelines, essentially hypothetical circumstances that companies should look out for when considering doing business with another company in the chips industry.', 'According to a senior Biden administration official, one example of a red flag is whether the company in question is connected to another sanctioned organization by, well, perhaps some sort of bridge.', 'In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day', 'Election reaction: The manosphere won', 'The Big Story: California will keep moving the world forward', ""Trump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's president"", 'Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco', 'MORE FROM WIRED', 'REVIEWS AND GUIDES', '© 2024 Condé Nast.

This latest crackdown is expected to take effect on Monday.', 'Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo reportedly called the new rules ""groundbreaking and sweeping"" in a statement.

Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier are also being restricted under the new rules. Wise Road Capital and Wingtech Technology, two firms that invest in the chip industry, are also being restricted, as well as nearly two dozen semiconductor firms and over 100 chip production tool manufacturers.', ""In recent months, US-sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei has been accused of using shell companies to skirt the rules to obtain advanced chips from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC). Some of the now-restricted firms—like Swaysure Technology, Qingdao SiEn, and Shenzhen Pensun Technology—reportedly do business with Huawei and are therefore now on the US ban list. This means US firms or those that use US chip-making equipment can't ship to them."", ""But Chinese and US firms aren't the only ones impacted by the rules.

HBM can no longer be shipped to China without the Commerce Department's permission."", 'The Biden administration first established Chinese tech export restrictions in 2022, and has added to them a few times in part to try to close existing loopholes.

The True Impact of Allied Export Controls on the U.S. and Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Industries,https://www.csis.org/analysis/true-impact-allied-export-controls-us-and-chinese-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment,"['Photo: PonyWang via Getty Images', 'Report by Gregory C. Allen', 'Published November 26, 2024', 'There is a fierce debate in the United States and among its allies about the impacts of export controls, and nowhere is that debate more heated than in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry. Too often, however, this debate occurs without any grounding in real-world data or relevant historical Chinese policy context. This paper seeks to provide some of that grounding through a combination of Chinese policy document analysis and new financial and market share data for leading semiconductor equipment firms in China, the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. What follows are a set of 10 key judgments based on the author’s analysis.', '1. China’s ambitions for eliminating dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment started long before America’s expanded usage of technology export controls.', 'The first and most important argument among critics of U.S. export controls is that they weaken U.S. technology leadership by incentivizing China to eliminate U.S. technology from its semiconductor supply chain. However, reducing dependence on foreign semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers was official Chinese policy before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls restricting sales of U.S.-designed chips to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications firm, launched the new era of semiconductor export controls. “The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025,” which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors, included goals such as “replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries” by 2025. It set specific targets and deadlines for the degree of market share that Chinese companies were supposed to reach and by what date. Targets for the semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector include the following:', 'As the Made in China 2025 technical document roadmap stated, “meeting domestic market demand, improving the self-sufficiency rate of integrated circuit products, meeting national security needs, and occupying the strategic product market have always been the greatest demand and driving force for the development of the integrated circuit industry.”', 'Even earlier policies, though less well resourced, sought to dramatically reduce use of foreign semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For example, the 2006 “Medium Long Range Plan for the Development of Science and Technology” explicitly called for self-sufficiency in semiconductor technologies and initiated so-called “mega projects” to drive toward that goal.', 'For more than a decade, China’s government has provided lavish subsidies in the form of tax breaks, free land, government grants, and equity infusions to a number of Chinese semiconductor equipment companies. Naura, one of China’s leading domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies received $1.3 billion in state support in 2021, even before the imposition of the Biden administration’s export controls. AMEC, another leading Chinese semiconductor equipment company, received a similar equity investment from the “Big Fund” in 2015. Simply put, China’s goal of semiconductor equipment industry localization and robust policy support predated any modern effort to impose meaningful export controls on China’s chip fabrication capabilities.', '2. There is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s rate of technological progress. China’s greatest progress came in sectors with no export controls.', 'A September 2024 analysis by Bernstein Research, an equity research firm, included a review of China’s semiconductor self-sufficiency goals from the 2015 roadmap and found that “China has made impressive progress and likely will beat the ‘Made in China 2025’ targets for integrated circuit (IC) Design and Manufacturing, but may miss the goals for IC equipment and Materials.” As the Bernstein analysis shows, the rate of China’s progress toward self-sufficiency is best predicted by the market and technological complexities of each semiconductor market segment, not by the extent to which export controls were applied. It is certainly not the case that the segments in which China has made the most progress—or even devoted the most resources—are the areas in which the United States has applied export controls most forcefully.', 'That there is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s technological progress should be obvious given that China has made rapid progress in other technological domains—such as solar cells and electric vehicles (EVs)—where the United States applied no export controls and in some cases actively supported the rise of a Chinese supply chain. The United States applied no export controls in the case of the equipment used to manufacture silicon solar cells, yet today China dominates both production of solar cells and production of the equipment used to make them. This equipment is in many ways similar to (though less sophisticated than) the equipment used to make and process silicon wafers for semiconductors. In fact, one Chinese company, Naura, is a domestic leader in both manufacturing equipment for both solar cells and semiconductors. The biggest difference in Chinese outcomes between those two industries is not the presence or absence of export controls but the far greater technological complexity of producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.', 'The EV maker Tesla made a major push into Chinese manufacturing in late 2018, launching deep partnerships with many local Chinese suppliers, such as battery-maker CATL. As a November 2024 commentary in a major Chinese state-run newspaper stated:', '""Tesla’s rapid growth in sales, fueled by its technological and branding advantages and backed by China’s massive consumer market, has driven the rapid development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Today, the localization rate of parts for Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, with more than 60 suppliers integrated into Tesla’s global supply chain.""', 'The Chinese EV supply chain, which Tesla helped dramatically increase in both scale and technological sophistication, is now also supplying Tesla’s competitors. Defections of Tesla-trained skilled employees are also a challenge. An April 2024 New York Times report claimed that most of Tesla’s early Chinese employees now work at competing Chinese firms. In a January Tesla earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said “The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. . . . Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world.”', 'The point here is not to suggest with unwarranted certainty that export controls would have definitively prevented China’s rise in the solar and EV industries. Rather, it is to caution the reader against relying too heavily on cursory anecdotal evidence to reach conclusions about when export controls do or do not work and what the counterfactual outcome would have been if export controls were or were not applied. Much depends upon the state of the global market landscape, the complexity of the controlled technology, the current technological sophistication of the targeted country, the design of the export control regulations, and the robustness of the controls’ implementation and enforcement. Only a detailed analysis can hope to reach anything approaching insight.', '3. Semiconductor export controls—as implemented thus far—have in different ways and at different times both helped and hindered Chinese firms.', 'Just as foreign firms have supported Chinese competitor growth in solar cells and EVs in the absence of export controls, so have they done in semiconductor manufacturing. The major semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers all have major service businesses, where, among other things, they train customer companies on how to get the most out of their equipment. Prior to the October 2022 changes in U.S. export controls, this could include assisting with the facility planning, installation, repairs, and operational troubleshooting of equipment as part of advanced chip manufacturing operations. Industry sources told CSIS that this sometimes included contract research and development (R&D) of advanced node semiconductor process technology on behalf of or in partnership with Chinese clients. At least as of November 2024, this is still legal in the case of providing support to Chinese legacy chip manufacturing operations.', 'By contrast, earlier U.S. export controls meaningfully reversed progress in some segments of the Chinese semiconductor sector, such as NAND memory manufacturing and smartphone chip design, though the durability of those setbacks, even if temporary, will depend on many factors. More recent export controls have also made life harder in many ways for Chinese semiconductor equipment firms, who can no longer legally obtain U.S. subcomponents or technical expertise.', 'Thus, it is simply wrong to say that export controls always, in isolation, accelerate Chinese technological indigenization and that making it easier for U.S. firms to export will always slow Chinese indigenization.', 'At the same time, it is unambiguously the case that the United States’ use of semiconductor export controls, beginning with ZTE in April 2018, made a massive impression on both political and corporate leaders in China. Speeches at the time by Chinese leadership, including General Secretary Xi Jinping, indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point and justified China’s aggressive pursuit of “self-reliance” in science and technology. Pony Ma, the chairman of Tencent, one of China’s largest technology firms, said in May 2018, “The recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is, without mobile devices, without microchips and operating systems, we can’t compete competently.”', 'The evidence goes beyond talk to specific actions. China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE, and China’s central government directed local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector. Some Chinese companies also took drastic measures to respond after ZTE. For example, Nikkei Asia reported that Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC)—one of China’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturers—began a full-blown de-Americanization campaign in 2019 involving the full-time work of more than 800 staff (both YMTC and its suppliers). This included the establishment of multiple new major partnerships with domestic Chinese equipment producers. Of note, at the time when YMTC began this de-Americanization initiative, no significant U.S. export controls applied to the company. YMTC began their work based on fear of future controls, not the reality of current ones.', 'Combined, this provides strong evidence that the export controls did increase the desire of both the Chinese government and Chinese companies to increase the capabilities of local semiconductor equipment providers, but that is not the same thing as saying that export controls caused accelerated indigenization, which depends upon more than just desire.', '4. The Biden administration’s 2022 export controls strengthened a policy approach to semiconductor equipment controls that began in 2019 during the first Trump administration.', 'As with chip export controls, the first Trump administration launched the U.S. government’s modern approach to semiconductor manufacturing equipment export controls. According to reporting by Reuters, the U.S. government successfully persuaded the Dutch government in July 2019 to cancel the export license of EUV lithography equipment to SMIC, China’s most advanced logic chip foundry. In December 2020, SMIC was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, prohibiting the company from buying certain kinds of U.S. equipment, specifically, “items uniquely required for production of semiconductors at advanced technology nodes (10 nanometers and below, including extreme ultraviolet technology).”', 'In October 2022, the Biden administration significantly expanded U.S. export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including not only Entity List and end-use restrictions but also some country-wide export controls that applied to China as a whole (including a use of the U.S. persons rule). Just as importantly, the Biden administration made some of these controls more multilateral in nature, engagingJapan and the Netherlands to overhaul their export control policies for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Even though these controls did not entirely align with U.S. controls, this was important to ensure that Dutch and Japanese companies did not provide China with alternative sources for the items that the United States was no longer willing to sell.', '5. Chinese semiconductor equipment firms started very small but have grown rapidly. However, this rapid growth occurred both before and after export controls and took place during a period of massive Chinese equipment demand growth.', 'China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has long been both small and technologically inferior to the global state of the art. To understand the growth trajectory of the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector, CSIS gathered market data on how China’s global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market share has changed over time across both supply and demand (see Table 1).', '', 'China has grown as both a supplier and as a buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment over the past 15 years. And while Chinese firms have in aggregate increased China’s share of global supply, they remain quite small in comparison to foreign firms, providing only 3.2 percent of the equipment (by dollar value) globally and 9.6 percent of the equipment purchased by customers operating in China in 2023 (see Figure 1). Some industry sources, such as the research firm Sanford Bernstein, estimate that the Chinese domestic market share captured by Chinese equipment providers (aka Chinese self-sufficiency) is 15 percent. Whether the true figure is closer to 9.6 percent or 15 percent, the equipment that Chinese firms sell remains almost exclusively confined to legacy nodes and remains far behind the global state of the art. However, industry sources have told CSIS that Chinese equipment has grown in competitiveness compared with the legacy node equipment sold by leading global suppliers.', 'Until the Biden administration’s October 2022 export controls, it was generally legal to sell critical subcomponents or expert consulting services to Chinese equipment firms, assisting with their growth in both sales and technological knowhow. In addition to voluntary foreign support, Chinese firms have benefitted from industrial espionage that has included state-backed cyberattacks on equipment companies. Chinese equipment firms have also benefitted from hundreds of billions of dollars in government investments, tax credits, and subsidies.', '', '6. R&D expenditures by Chinese semiconductor firms have grown explosively, though the rate of growth has decreased somewhat since 2021.', 'Using public financial filings, CSIS has collected R&D expenditure data from the eight largest publicly traded Chinese semiconductor equipment firms (see Figure 3).', '', 'As the above data shows, the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry started out with comparatively low R&D expenditure but has shown extraordinary growth since the beginning of the Made in China 2025 policy era in 2015. Relative growth rates of R&D have slowed in the industry over the past two years, but growth in absolute terms remains very high. This data is not consistent with a simple story of “export controls caused a boom in the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry” and instead shows that annual growth rates were very high both before and after the United States began imposing export controls.', 'One plausible interpretation of the data is that U.S. and Dutch export controls in the 2018–2020 period increased desire among both the Chinese government and Chinese equipment customers in strengthening the local equipment industry, but they did so without making it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain help—even from U.S. experts and equipment subcomponent providers. The export controls of 2022 and 2023 may have further increased interest among the Chinese government and customers, but such interest and ability to productively absorb additional investment was already nearly maxed out.', 'However, the export controls of 2022 and 2023 also took extensive steps (e.g., extensive application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule and the U.S. persons rule, multilateralization of the controls) to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain foreign help in advancing the reliability and competitiveness of their technology. Thus, the pace of revenue and R&D expenditure growth among Chinese equipment providers slowed somewhat (while remaining high in absolute terms). Again, this is a plausible interpretation that is consistent with the available data, but the available data is not sufficient in and of itself to definitively state that this is the correct interpretation.', 'Another plausible interpretation for slowing pace of growth—discussed in the next section—is that Chinese customers for semiconductor manufacturing equipment dramatically accelerated equipment purchases in an effort to stockpile equipment in anticipation of future export controls and that this surge of foreign imports stockpiling temporarily reduced demand growth for domestic equipment (while not changing China’s long-term commitment to end reliance on imports).', 'There are some limitations in the R&D data, as not all of the companies are exclusively focused on the semiconductor equipment industry. Naura, for example, has lithium battery and photovoltaic business units which industry sources told CSIS are responsible for about 18 percent of the firm’s revenue (and presumably comprised a comparable share of its R&D for at least some period), but these are not broken out in the firm’s public financial reporting. Additionally, there are important Chinese semiconductor equipment firms that are not included in this analysis, such as Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment (SMEE) and Huawei’s recently established semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, because they do report such data publicly.', 'The absence of Huawei’s semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, in particular, could be an important missing source of data. Huawei’s private investment in R&D and the semiconductor equipment that it produces for its own secret network of chip manufacturers would not be captured in any of the data sources used in this report. In October 2023, the Dutch newspaper NRC, citing anonymous ASML employees, reported that an employee who stole significant semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology secrets moved to China and now works for Huawei. This suggests that Huawei is making a significant investment in lithography equipment, as does a 2022 Huawei patent filed under the name “Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography.” ', 'While these complications mean that the specific R&D values as presented have an error bar, the overall trajectory characterized is likely close to the reality of the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry as a whole.', '7. In the 2016–2024 period, leading U.S. and international semiconductor equipment firms continued to demonstrate strong Chinese revenue growth after imposition of increasingly strict export controls.', 'The top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers are Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation. Together with ASML of the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron and Advantest of Japan, they comprise the six largest semiconductor equipment providers in the world by revenue. In their financial reports, these firms report the share of their revenue derived from China (not including Taiwan).', 'CSIS extracted and aggregated this data to show that these firms have grown revenue in China both before and after the United States began imposing export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For the top three U.S. providers, Chinese revenue growth outperformed growth in the rest of the world every year in the 2016–2024E period.', '', 'Similarly, ASML, the Dutch lithography equipment firm, also saw dramatic growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world.', '', 'Finally, the same is true of Tokyo Electron and Advantest, the two leading Japanese equipment providers. Both saw superior performance in China compared with the rest of the world.', '', 'The most likely explanation for this is that Chinese firms have shifted their purchases of international equipment earlier so that they occurred prior to expected future export controls (which the U.S. government has maintained since 2022 will be updated annually). Just as Huawei built up a U.S. chip stockpile equivalent to multiple years of demand during a period prior to U.S. export control loopholes being closed, Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have acquired a stockpile of U.S. and other foreign equipment in anticipation of strengthened export controls coming in the near future.', 'This “pulling demand forward” interpretation is the one that many executives in the semiconductor equipment industry have evidently reached. In July 2024, both the CEO of ASML and the CEO of ASM said during investor earnings calls that Chinese semiconductor manufacturers would likely decrease purchases of equipment soon, as they have struggled to “digest” all of the accelerated purchases of equipment and spare parts that they have made, effectively confirming that many tools that have been sold to China are still likely awaiting installation and remain unused. Similarly, in August 2024, a Lam Research executive likewise described “inventory stocking” behavior among Chinese customers over the past several years.', '8. Export controls changed the composition of equipment demand both technologically (decreasing the technological sophistication of demand in China) and geographically (shifting more demand outside of China) but likely did not change the overall demand trajectory.', 'Decades before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls on ZTE ushered in the modern era of semiconductor export controls, the U.S. policy goal for exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China was already to restrict sales of advanced equipment to trusted U.S. allies and partners while allowing the sale of older, less advanced equipment to China. A 2002 U.S. government policy review of semiconductor technology exports to China stated this explicitly. Neither the Trump administration nor the Biden administration fundamentally changed this approach at a high level. Both administrations continued to allow the sale of legacy equipment, though they increased restrictions on sales of advanced equipment exports. In the case of the Biden administration, it also communicated an intent to end the “sliding scale” approach that allowed the sophistication of equipment exports to China to advance, but on a multiyear delay from the global state of the art.', 'As such, China has continued to be a large and growing market for equipment exports even after the more recent export controls, but Chinese firms have changed their focus from a rush to compete at the most advanced semiconductor technological nodes to maximizing both domestic self-sufficiency and global leadership in legacy chip production. China was likely to pursue a massive expansion of chip production capacity regardless of U.S. actions, but the export controls helped ensure that this capacity did not drive the U.S. and allies toward a strategic dependence on China for the most technologically advanced chips, such as those that power AI systems or high-end smartphones.', 'Moreover, the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment fundamentally depends on the overall demand for manufactured chips. As the demand for advanced chips grows, that demand will translate into demand for advanced equipment. And if China is not in a position to purchase advanced equipment, then the purchase and production will instead take place outside of China. The chief financial officer of ASML, Roger Dassen, said this explicitly during ASML’s July 2024 earnings call with investment analysts:', '"". . . the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography. In this case, China. We look at—and that\'s the way we model our sales medium term and long term. We look at what is the global demand for wafers and whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y, at the end of the day, it doesn\'t matter. And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model. We don\'t have a specific China element in our models. It is the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling.""', 'Accordingly, U.S. and allied controls did not so much destroy demand as change its composition. China is buying fewer advanced tools than it would have otherwise and is instead purchasing more legacy tools. The advanced tools that would have been sold to China have instead been sold to places like the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. Likewise, given that many foreign players are wary of investing in legacy nodes due to fears of Chinese overcapacity, the tools are being largely sold to China for those production lines, not elsewhere. Chinese firms are also likely attempting to use many “node-agnostic” or “backwards compatible” equipment tools not subject to a control to bolster their advanced node efforts.', '9. Increased application of semiconductor equipment export controls coincided with and likely caused U.S. equipment firms to ensure that sales to China did not ship from the United States and/or were manufactured outside the United States.', 'CSIS has produced an estimate of the Chinese semiconductor equipment revenue of each of the top three U.S. semiconductor equipment companies by taking their topline revenue from China and subtracting the share reported as services and non-semiconductor equipment businesses (e.g., display, printed circuit board inspection). This figure would include any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales to China from these three firms shipped from any of their facilities worldwide, whether those facilities are in the United States or elsewhere.', 'U.S. trade data provided by the International Trade Commission (ITC) reports the dollar value of all U.S. exports based on six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The NAICS Code for “Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing” is 333242, which covers all front-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment. CSIS collected ITC trade data for all U.S. exports of 333242 goods to China. This figure includes any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales made from U.S. soil, whether those sales are made by U.S.-owned or internationally owned firms. In practice, the top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies—Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation—tend to dominate 333242 exports to nearly all countries.', 'Based on these two datasets, one could see that U.S. equipment sales to China by U.S. firms have increasingly become exported from non-U.S. countries since 2016 and especially after 2019 (see Figure 7).', '', 'From 2016 to 2020, the ratio of sales to exports grew 34 percent, from 1.1 to 1.5. However, from 2021 to 2024, the ratio nearly doubled, from 1.6 to 3.1. In other words, exports to China and sales to China used to be nearly identical, but sales overwhelmingly outgrew exports in the post-2020 period, the same period when the United States adopted significantly stricter export controls. Industry sources told CSIS that much of the change was originally due to U.S. firms seeking to legally avoid export controls that—in the absence of strict usage of the Foreign Direct Product Rule—only applied to exports from U.S. soil. This interpretation is consistent with the remarks of KLA CEO Rick Wallace, who discussed how some versions of U.S. semiconductor equipment export controls did not apply to U.S. companies manufacturing their equipment abroad and shipping from abroad during the company’s 2020 Q3 earnings call. The exchange is important and worth quoting at length:', '""Question: Regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it\'s still very early, and I\'m sure you\'re awaiting clarity on how broader now the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what\'s been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. and considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you read today?', 'Rick Wallace:Our understanding at this point is, this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have three major manufacturing sites; Israel, Singapore and here. So there is a potential impact depending on the customer. And our final understanding of the ruling that [is that it] will impact tools that come out of California.""', 'In short, export controls that do not include strict implementation and enforcement of the Foreign Direct Product Rule or U.S. persons rule can incentivize U.S. firms to move production offshore, costing the United States manufacturing jobs. In recent years, U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms have doubled-down and expanded their non-U.S. manufacturing operations. Both KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have committed to major expansions of their Singapore manufacturing facilities, while LAM Research has built out its largest manufacturing site in Malaysia.', 'In quantitative terms, this is one of the most striking effects of the export controls as implemented thus far, and it clearly illustrates the risk that countries take by applying export controls that do not apply extraterritorially in industries where off-shoring some or all production is relatively easy. As one Japanese business executive stated, his company will “develop duplicate supply chains—one for the U.S.-led economic bloc and one for [the] China-led bloc.”', 'Industry sources told CSIS that, more recently, both U.S. and international semiconductor equipment companies are being required by their Chinese customers to remove all U.S. citizens from their supply chain and ship from outside the United States when selling to China.', 'This fact shows that there is really no turning back from the export control path that the United States and its allies have gone down. Half measures incur nearly all of the costs of an aggressive export control policy—in terms of incentivizing U.S. firm outsourcing, foreign substitution, and Chinese indigenous investment—while delivering comparatively few of the strategic benefits.', '10. There is no change in U.S. or allied policy that will persuade the Chinese government and Chinese firms to abandon their semiconductor equipment de-Americanization and decoupling efforts. However, the United States can take steps to make those efforts more difficult and to extract more strategic benefits in semiconductor and AI competition.', 'Critics of export controls oftentimes make two related arguments. First, revenues from China can be reinvested in R&D and thus contribute to increased U.S. technological competitiveness, including against Chinese firms. Second, prohibiting exports increases willingness on the part of Chinese firms and the Chinese government to invest in competitors to U.S. firms, decreasing U.S. technological competitiveness.', 'However, these arguments assume that the strategic approach of the Chinese government and Chinese firms depends solely or primarily upon U.S. actions, which is contradicted by the review of Chinese policy at the beginning of this paper and from the experience of the EV and solar industries.', 'Consider a thought experiment: What would be the likely policy response of the Chinese government if the United States decided to begin unrestricted exports of nuclear submarines to China? U.S. nuclear submarines are widely regarded as the best in the world, and China’s spies have long devoted major efforts to stealing U.S. submarine technology secrets.', 'Presumably, therefore, China would leap at the chance to buy U.S. nuclear submarines on the open market. And, under the logic of the above two arguments—increased U.S. revenue and decreased Chinese investment—these sales would increase, not decrease, the U.S. technological advantage in nuclear submarine technology. Are American policymakers fools for using export controls to block nuclear submarine sales to China?', 'Of course not.', 'Even if a hypothetical reckless U.S. president and Congress were to allow China to buy as many submarines as U.S. firms could make, China would never accept that this state of affairs is likely to continue on a permanent basis. China would obviously take the submarines they could get and reverse engineer the technology as fast as possible and transfer that technology to their domestic submarine industry, which they would continue to financially support. The increased revenue from R&D for U.S. firms is not going to make nearly as much of a difference as China’s hands-on opportunity to reverse engineer U.S. technology. Neither would the lost sales among Chinese submarine manufacturers decrease China’s commitment to supporting a domestic industry. This is not to even mention the grave risks to national security of a hypothetical Chinese navy equipped with U.S.-built nuclear submarines.', 'This admittedly extreme thought experiment bears consideration because, while some in the West question whether semiconductor manufacturing equipment deserves to be viewed as a strategic technology of major importance to national security, China’s leaders do not. This belief is evident not only in words but also the deeds, whether that be Chinese state-backed espionage against equipment firms, aggressive reverse engineering of purchased Western equipment, or the astonishing amount of financial resources dedicated to indigenization.', 'There is simply no policy that the United States could articulate that would persuade China to abandon its goals of de-Americanization and decoupling in the semiconductor equipment sector. As the United States and allied governments consider reforms to semiconductor equipment controls, they should focus less on how to change China’s goals and more on how to make achieving those goals as expensive and complicated as possible.', 'Gregory C.
