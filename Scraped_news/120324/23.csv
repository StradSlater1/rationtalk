His mission: restore the company to its former glory as a leader in chipmaking and manufacturing."", ""But less than four years later, that redemption story has ended. According to sources cited by Bloomberg, Gelsinger was forced out -- a stunning turn for one of the industry's most respected technical minds. His sudden departure raises tough questions: Why couldn't Gelsinger complete the mission he was seemingly born to lead?

It's a symptom of a company that has lost its way. His departure is a wake-up call for Intel to confront its cultural stagnation, address its legacy dependencies, and embrace the transformative changes required to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. Without decisive action, Intel risks becoming a relic of its own storied past."", ""Gelsinger brought credibility and a bold vision to Intel but he couldn't overcome the cultural inertia that has plagued the company for years. Intel's internal dynamics have become a major roadblock. Bureaucratic bottlenecks, risk-averse decision-making, and an overreliance on legacy systems have significantly slowed innovation."", ""Also: I switched from Intel to AMD - here's why I'm never going back"", ""I've spoken with engineers who describe Intel as a place where risk-taking is discouraged and new ideas are often met with skepticism. In contrast, companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple thrive on experimentation and rapid iteration. Gelsinger's technical expertise alone wasn't enough to resolve these systemic issues."", 'The next CEO must prioritize cultural transformation. This involves empowering engineers, reducing red tape, and fostering a sense of urgency. Consider what Satya Nadella accomplished at Microsoft: he transformed a slow-moving giant into one of the most agile and innovative companies in the world. Intel requires a similar cultural revolution to unlock its full potential.', ""x86 has been Intel's core product for decades, powering PCs, servers, and enterprise systems. However, as the industry shifts toward AI, cloud-native computing, and energy-efficient designs, x86 is beginning to seem outdated. Arm-based processors are now dominant across a range of devices, from smartphones to cloud servers, and Apple's M-series chips have demonstrated that Arm can surpass x86 in both efficiency and performance."", ""Also: If Intel can't come up with a Qualcomm-killer soon, it's game over for x86 PCs"", 'That said, x86 is not yet obsolete. Legacy applications in enterprise environments still rely heavily on x86, and it remains popular among gamers for its capability to deliver high frame rates.

At the same time, competitors like Ampere are proving that Arm servers can manage data center workloads with lower power consumption, while companies like Nvidia are pioneering new approaches to high-performance computing.', ""Intel's challenge is clear: it must protect its x86 foundation while aggressively transitioning to new architectures. If it fails to adapt, x86 risks becoming a niche product, potentially leaving Intel behind in an industry increasingly prioritizing scalability, efficiency, and flexibility."", ""Intel's venture into contract chip manufacturing through Intel Foundry Services (IFS) represents one of its most ambitious moves in recent years. The semiconductor industry urgently needs alternatives to TSMC and Samsung, especially given the geopolitical tensions that underscore the dangers of relying heavily on Asia. On paper, Intel is well-positioned to fill this gap."", ""However, the journey to becoming a leading foundry is challenging. Intel's advanced manufacturing processes, such as the 18A node, have experienced delays, and gaining customer trust remains a significant hurdle. TSMC is not only ahead in technology but is also a reliable partner for companies like Apple, AMD, and Nvidia."", 'For IFS to be successful, Intel must demonstrate its ability to deliver results on par with or better than TSMC. This requires meeting deadlines, offering competitive pricing, and establishing strong relationships with prominent clients. The funding provided by the CHIPS Act gives Intel an advantage, but this is a high-stakes risk. If IFS does not succeed, it could result in another setback for Intel.', ""The future of computing is centered around artificial intelligence (AI), with Nvidia at the forefront. The company's GPUs are the dominant force in AI training and inference workloads, and its Grace Hopper platform is specifically designed to manage the complex, parallel tasks that AI requires. Apple is also heavily investing in AI through its custom silicon."", ""Also: Today's AI ecosystem is unsustainable for everyone but Nvidia, warns top scholar"", 'In contrast, Intel has struggled to establish itself in this area. While the 2019 $2B acquisition of Habana Labs was a positive move, the outcomes have been disappointing. Qualcomm is advancing AI-powered PCs with its Snapdragon X series, and AMD is working with Microsoft on custom AI chips.', 'For Intel to remain relevant, it needs a clear and aggressive AI strategy. This could involve developing memory-safe architectures like CHERI or concentrating on edge computing. The company must act swiftly to adapt to this rapidly changing landscape.', ""Selling its xScale Arm business in 2006 -- just a year before the introduction of the iPhone and two years before Android-based devices hit the market -- was one of Intel's biggest strategic mistakes. Arm-based architectures now dominate everything from smartphones to cloud servers, and companies like Apple and Qualcomm have shown that Arm can scale effectively for high-performance computing. Meanwhile, RISC-V is gaining traction as an open-source alternative, particularly in the IoT and edge computing sectors."", 'Also: Why Intel can no longer live in denial', 'Although Intel has explored RISC-V through partnerships with SiFive, it has not fully committed to either Arm or RISC-V. This hesitation could prove to be a significant mistake. To effectively compete with Qualcomm and Apple, Intel must embrace a multi-architecture future.', 'This strategy could involve acquiring Arm startups, developing its own Arm-based products, or investing more heavily in RISC-V. Intel can no longer afford to rely solely on x86 architecture. The industry is evolving, and Intel needs to take the lead -- or risk being left behind.', 'Geopolitical tensions have transformed semiconductors into a national security concern, and Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this shift. The CHIPS Act provides billions in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, offering Intel an opportunity to take the lead in this sector.', ""However, merely constructing fabrication plants (fabs) is not enough. Intel must also develop advanced manufacturing processes that can compete with TSMC and Samsung in terms of price and performance. Expanding into regions like Europe and India could help diversify Intel's supply chain, thereby reducing geopolitical risks and creating new opportunities."", 'If Intel can successfully navigate these challenges, it could become an indispensable player in the global semiconductor ecosystem. Nonetheless, the margin for error is very slim.', 'With Gelsinger no longer at the helm, Intel is facing a leadership void at a crucial time. The company requires a CEO who can inspire confidence, tackle complex challenges, and implement ambitious plans effectively.', ""This situation goes beyond mere technical expertise; it hinges on vision. The right leader must confront Intel's cultural stagnation, accelerate its transition to AI and Arm technologies, and restore trust with customers and investors. Without strong leadership, even the best strategies are likely to fail."", ""It may seem radical, but what if Intel's best option is to sell? For instance, Qualcomm could benefit from Intel's manufacturing capabilities to scale its Arm-based products and compete with Nvidia in AI and data centers. Intel's fabs would give Qualcomm the infrastructure it needs to operate more quickly and efficiently."", ""However, selling Intel wouldn't be straightforward. Regulators would scrutinize the deal, and the company's role as a national security asset adds complexity. Still, in a landscape where speed and focus are crucial, selling to a more agile player might be the only way to preserve Intel's legacy."", ""Pat Gelsinger's exit marks a turning point for Intel. The challenges ahead are daunting, but they're not insurmountable. Whether through cultural transformation, bold pivots to new architectures, or even a strategic sale, Intel must act decisively -- and soon."", ""The semiconductor industry isn't waiting for anyone. Intel has a choice: adapt and lead, or fade into irrelevance.""]"

I‚Äôve known her for a long time, so I think she‚Äôs a good steward of the Intel business, [and] she‚Äôs a good choice to co-lead the company. But obviously [Gelsinger‚Äôs sudden exit] is someone saying there‚Äôs doubt in the previous strategy,‚Äù Stromquist said.', 'In Intel‚Äôs announcement about Gelsinger‚Äôs retirement, Frank Yeary, a longtime Intel board director who now serves as its interim executive chair, said the chipmaker must ‚Äúput our product group at the center of all we do.‚Äù', '‚ÄúOur customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them,‚Äù he said in a statement while adding that Intel will continue to advance its manufacturing and foundry capacities.', 'To Stromquist, Intel should now focus on going ‚Äúback to the basics of working with their [partners] and coming up with great solutions.‚Äù', ""‚ÄúMaybe that historical business of Intel‚Äôs go-to-market needs to be questioned. I don't know. But I always encourage them to do what they‚Äôve done best, which is build a great channel, build great products, and business will follow,‚Äù he said."", 'An executive at a U.S. Intel distribution partner said that even in the absence of news reports explaining why Gelsinger retired on Sunday, the timing and nature of how the exit was announced made it likely that the CEO‚Äôs departure wasn‚Äôt voluntary.', '‚ÄúUsually, when somebody retires from Intel, there‚Äôs a much longer process,‚Äù said the distribution executive, who asked to not be named to speak frankly. ‚ÄúThey announce that they‚Äôre retiring.

She knows all of the channel business really well. She knows all of Intel‚Äôs lines of business, so I think she‚Äôs got a really good, broad understanding of Intel's different customer bases, which for us as a distributor, that's important,‚Äù he said."", 'Randy Copeland, president and CEO of Richmond, Va.-based Velocity Micro, said while he didn‚Äôt find the news of Gelsinger‚Äôs sudden exit surprising, he didn‚Äôt think it was the ‚Äúwisest decision‚Äù because of how much Intel has transformed over the past three years to execute on Gelsinger‚Äôs expensive and ambitious IDM 2.0 strategy.', '‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to get a new CEO in who‚Äôs going to have a whole new vision and a whole new road map, and I think it‚Äôs going to mire them some more. Pat‚Äôs plan was extremely aggressive, but they‚Äôre so far into it, now I am concerned about what‚Äôs going to happen next. Are they going to pivot again and go in another direction? I feel like they just can‚Äôt seem to get anything finished,‚Äù he said.', 'To Copeland, the board should have been better prepared to weather any challenges that came with Gelsinger‚Äôs comeback plan, which also involves the revitalization of the company‚Äôs contract manufacturing business under the Intel Foundry name.', ""‚ÄúIt was a very long-term plan, and I think before the board approved it, they should have thought about what the next [few] years were going to look like, because they're obviously deep in the middle of it,‚Äù he said."", 'While Copeland said Intel is ‚Äústill years away from catching up‚Äù with Taiwanese foundry giant TSMC, he believes the bet on contract manufacturing could still work out.', '‚ÄúIf they can come up with a bona fide competitor that is U.S.-based in a few years, I have very high confidence that Intel is going to be a formidable company,‚Äù he said.', 'Despite feeling uncertain about Intel‚Äôs future, Copeland doesn‚Äôt think the company faces any existential threat, even if he doesn‚Äôt think its problems end with Gelsinger.', '‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to completely implode or anything, but I think they are using Pat as a scapegoat for a company-wide strategy that‚Äôs not going as fast as Wall Street would like it to,‚Äù Copeland said.', 'Dominic Daninger, vice president of engineering at Burnsville, Minn.-based Nor-Tech, said he was surprised to hear the news about Gelsinger.', '‚ÄúI thought he was only part-way done, but apparently there was dissension on the board. When there‚Äôs not unification there, that‚Äôs not good,‚Äù he said.', 'While Intel has made progress in expanding its manufacturing footprint, introducing advanced chip-making nodes at an accelerated pace and named a couple marquee customers for Intel Foundry, those projects have yet to boost its financials.', '‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs taken longer than anybody thought,‚Äù Daninger said.', 'The Nor-Tech executive added that Intel has also struggled to introduce a formative accelerator chip that could rival Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs in AI computing. While Intel‚Äôs new Gaudi 3 chip has gained support from multiple large server vendors, including Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Gelsinger said in October that the Gaudi product line is expected to fall short of its modest $500 million revenue goal for 2024.', '‚ÄúIf you go back [and look at] multiple attempts to go after that [market], just none of them have been successful,‚Äù Daninger said.', 'One bright spot for Daninger is Intel‚Äôs recently launched Xeon 6 server processors. But even then, he said, those products have received a muted response among his customers, many of whom are in the high-performance computing space.', ""‚ÄúThe last generations of Xeons have been very reliable [with] pretty decent performance. And all the reports I'm seeing on Xeon 6 are good. We‚Äôre just not getting a lot of people beating the doors down here to test them out,‚Äù he said."", 'To Daninger, Gelsinger‚Äôs sudden exit suggests that big changes are on the way.', ""‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got to do some major strategy changes and get serious about some things here, and there's probably a lot of lot of entrenchment there within corporate Intel,‚Äù he said."", 'Two solution provider executives said they hope that Gelsinger‚Äôs sudden exit could allow the chipmaker to put a bigger emphasis on driving AI sales with enterprises.', '‚ÄúI think this could lead to a stronger position for Intel in the enterprise AI solutions market,‚Äù said Patrick Shelley, CTO at Montvale, N.J.-based PKA Technologies, which is No. 438 on CRN‚Äôs 2024 Solution Provider 500 list.', 'In September, Intel outlined its strategy around Gaudi 3, which rests on the idea that enterprises will seek out Gaudi chips for AI systems that are more cost-effective than Nvidia GPU-based systems for running smaller AI models.', '‚ÄúIntel is already doing some real innovative things in the AI market especially with Gaudi 3, which is a much more cost-competitive AI solution for the enterprise. We think that is going to make AI more affordable for customers especially in SLED (State Local and Education). I see this driving more innovation for Intel in the enterprise AI market,‚Äù Shelley said.', 'Bob Venero, CEO of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Future Tech Enterprise, No. 76 on the CRN‚Äôs 2024 SP500, said he remains confident that Intel will continue to be a key player in the AI era, particularly when it comes to the PC market.', '‚ÄúI see Intel continuing to grow its AI business especially with the PC continuing to be more and more of an important part of the ecosystem that is going to be tied to AI,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe way you access AI systems is through your PC and the best way PCs run is on Intel chips. Pat‚Äôs retirement doesn‚Äôt change that. It just means there is going to be a new CEO who leads Intel into the AI future.‚Äù', 'Venero said he would like to see Intel double down on product innovation with its key OEMs like HP Inc., Dell and Lenovo.', '‚ÄúThose are the companies that are driving the major investments in R&D around the PC product set,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is where Intel needs to invest in differentiated products that can help drive the journey to AI and beyond.‚Äù', 'Even with the changing of the guard, Intel remains one of the strongest technology product companies in the business, according to Venero.', '‚ÄúLook at the long line of x86 products that has driven decades of productivity and growth for the channel. Without Intel there wouldn‚Äôt be much of a channel. Think about who is running all the PCs, servers and the chipsets on the storage platforms: It‚Äôs Intel, Intel, Intel. There are other players there but nobody with the depth and breadth of the product line that Intel offers,‚Äù he said.', 'Venero said he expects the new leadership and Gelsinger‚Äôs eventual replacement to continue to be strong supporters of the channel.', '‚ÄúIntel has always been a channel-first company,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe new executives obviously know the value of the channel.

We are not going to reprise all of those thoughts here.', 'But what we are going to do is draw parallels to IBM‚Äôs self-described ‚Äúnear death experience‚Äù in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the mainframe market imploded at the same time that RISC/Unix systems ascended in the datacenter and client/server computing shifted a lot of application work from datacenter systems out to the desktop. This was when John Akers, the consummate mainframer and Big Blue insider, was at the helm and did not read the market forces even close to correctly.', 'It is not a pretty comparison between IBM and Intel or Akers and Gelsinger.', 'Back in the late 1980s, when Big Blue was at its absolute peak, the company had over 400,000 employees, with half of them being in the United States. This is when we entered the datacenter market ourselves, and it was an exciting time with maybe 25 different chip architectures in systems and maybe 40 operating systems that had some market penetration. But the inevitable consolidation was coming, and IBM was the biggest and richest target for the competition.', 'In 1991, IBM laid off around 30,000 employees and booked a $3.4 billion charge, reporting a $2.8 billion loss for the year. In 1992, IBM‚Äôs revenues shrank a bit and it lost nearly $5 billion and the employee count dropped by close to another 43,000. This left IBM with just above 300,000 people worldwide and an employee base that had shrank by nearly a quarter in two years. In 1993, revenues went down a few more percent and IBM cut another 45,000 employees and posted a whopping $8.9 billion in restructuring charges and an $8.1 billion loss against $62.7 billion in sales. That was it for Akers, who ‚Äúretired‚Äù in April that year and American Express executive Louis Gerstner was brought in by the board of directors to replace him. In his first year (1994), IBM boosted revenue by two points to $64 billion and actually posted a $3 billion profit, but Gerstner continued the layoffs; the employee count shrank by 36,000 to 220,000 worldwide.', 'All during this time, there was talk of breaking IBM into ‚ÄúBaby Blues,‚Äù separating its PC, mainframe, X86 server, other proprietary servers (AS/400), Unix servers, middleware and database software, printers, and services businesses into separate companies to give them freedom to maneuver in the market. Gerstner decided ‚Äì and we think correctly ‚Äì that keeping IBM together and pivoting strongly to services and getting its software running on other systems was smarter than breaking the company up. IBM bought Lotus for its middleware, sold off low-end printers, and righted its financial ship through huge stock buybacks that rewarded IBMers and Wall Street for growth in earnings per share. (We call this burning the furniture in the house to stay warm.)', 'We could argue as to whether or not this strategy has worked. But a lot of the IBM that was then is still around now, despite it subsequently selling off DRAM memory, disk drives, PCs, high-end printers, X86 servers, and various services businesses. The mainframe and Power server businesses are relatively healthy and profitable, and IBM owns Red Hat and soon HashiCorp. It is a one possible equilibrium state Big Blue could have engineered.', 'The question we have ‚Äì and that the Intel board of directors has been facing ‚Äì is will we be able to say the same about Intel ten or twenty years from now?', 'Which brings us all the way back to Gelsinger, who is absolutely as Intel Inside as Akers was True Blue. And who had only cut 15 percent of the Intel workforce thus far into a turnaround process that lasted about as long as the one Akers tried to do and resulted in a nearly 50 percent reduction in the IBM workforce.', 'If Gelsinger had a health issue that means he cannot fulfill his fiduciary duties as chief executive officer, then Intel would have to say that in its announcement of Gelsinger‚Äôs ‚Äúretirement‚Äù because it is such a material fact about the state of the company and the strategy that was put into place by Gelsinger several years ago. It doesn‚Äôt look to us like Gelsinger is tired, much less retired, and that means all we can surmise is that Gelsinger is being shown the door as a repudiation of the IDM 2.0 strategy where Intel revives its floundering foundry business and revitalizes its dependent chip design business at the same time.', 'Maybe Gelsinger could not make the very deep job cuts and strategy changes that were necessary to get Intel financially healthier sooner ‚Äì just like Akers could not. Both are too close to the companies they run, and they would have to bear that shame personally. Running companies like IBM and Intel is extremely difficult, and economies and markets change fast. Look at how quickly Nvidia went from interesting HPC accelerator to the largest and most profitable systems business we have seen since IBM‚Äôs System/360 mainframe in the 1960s and 1970s.', 'Intel is still an innovator in chip packaging and transistor design, despite its lapses in the past decade, and given a decent manufacturing process, we still think that Intel can create a compelling X86 processor for PCs and servers.', 'It is important to remember that Intel still has two-thirds of the share of the X86 server market, and the X86 server recession that has plagued Intel and bothered AMD ‚Äì and that we think was caused in part by a shift in focus on spending for AI systems ‚Äì is largely over.', 'But the problem is that the X86 server matters less and less in the datacenter except as a legacy platform for Windows Server applications, which is itself the last proprietary operating system on Earth with volume economics driving it. And it has been shrinking ever so slowly over the past decade as Linux is on the rise and the variety and volume of server CPU platforms based on the Arm architecture that can run it are also increasing. The hyperscalers and cloud builders as well as a number of HPC centers in the world have their own Arm processors. Nvidia has one, and we think at some point AMD might need to blow the dust off its own Arm server chip efforts. Combined, these organizations represent a growing base of server CPU acquisitions, and as we have said before, we can envision a day when AMD, Intel, and the Arm collective all have large and relatively equal shares of the server CPU pie.', 'This is not a world where Intel can extract huge profits from X86 CPUs, as it was able to do in the 2010s when it essentially had a monopoly on datacenter compute. (Much as Nvidia does on datacenter GPU accelerator compute today, and is benefitting mightily from.)', 'As we said four years ago, Intel has to decide if it wants to be a foundry or a chip designer. It may not be able to do both and still be Intel. And maybe instead of keeping these two companies together, it does indeed need to separate them so they can go their own ways and either live or die separately.', 'We think the Intel Products group will have an easier time switching to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co as a foundry than the Intel Foundry will have making a dent in TSMC as a secondary source for chips. The forecasts for Intel and TSMC show this ‚Äì and we did the math back in April showing that TSMC will have an AI chip manufacturing business that is larger than all of Intel Foundry before too long.', 'Maybe the answer is that TSMC buys the Intel foundry business to get a footprint ‚Äì a real one ‚Äì in the United States and a place to carry on once China invades Taiwan. (This gets more and more likely as time passes, and with a Trump administration starting in a few weeks and an expected ramping of the trade war with China, it may happen sooner rather than later.) TSMC would, in this doomsday scenario, keep current Intel processes alive, give Intel employees jobs, and give Intel Products ‚Äì what we will call Intel if this comes to pass ‚Äì a foundry for the future as TSMC builds out capacity in the United States.', 'This is what IBM tried to do in 2014 when it paid GlobalFoundries to take its IBM Microelectronics division that, among other things, etched its Power and z mainframe chips. (This didn‚Äôt work out so well, with IBM suing GlobalFoundries three years ago and switching to Samsung as its foundry partner, but don‚Äôt let that scare you.)', 'The client PC business at Intel is relatively healthy at around $30 billion per year with on the order of $10 billion in operating profits, which is one reason why Michelle Johnston Holthaus, a sales executive from the PC business who was elevated to general manager of its marketing and communications operations in 2017 and who was made general manager of its Client Computing Group in January 2022 by Gelsinger himself, is now CEO Intel Products and co-CEO of all of Intel Corp alongside of chief financial officer Dave Zinsner. Frank Yeary, who was the independent chair of Intel‚Äôs board, is now the executive chair, and Naga Chandrasekaran, who was named general manager of Intel Foundry in July this year, remains in that role.', 'The statement put out by Intel does not indicate a change in Intel‚Äôs strategy, but its leadership, but it also says that Gelsinger retired when we all believe he was asked to leave because the turnaround was not happening fast enough.', '‚ÄúWhile we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,‚Äù Yeary said in that statement. ‚ÄúAs a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do. Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them. With MJ‚Äôs permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability.‚Äù', 'Yeary went on to say that Intel would simplify its product portfolio and advance its foundry capabilities. There is no hint of selling off the foundry business. And for all we know, Gelsinger wanted to break Intel up and the current board does not ‚Äì just like Akers thought about it and Gerstner put the kibosh on the idea.', 'We don‚Äôt know.', 'What we also don‚Äôt know is how a Trump administration might use executive orders and national security to compel US-based tech giants to use an indigenous US foundry ‚Äì whether it is owned by Intel, TSMC, any cluster of private equity companies, or maybe even Uncle Sam itself. The US government could federalize Intel Foundry for its own purposes without denting the US Treasury balance sheet. Without question, the semiconductor business and national security are in jeopardy because Intel dropped the ball on advanced manufacturing processes a decade ago.', 'It will be very interesting to see who Intel tries to bring in as CEO, and when, and what happens then.', 'Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW', '', '', '', 'Loan Guarantees like the Automakers received and no more talk about what if and what may happen. AMD existed for years running on fumes and had revenues to remain in business and to keep the lenders happy and leaders who renegotiated that debt to make things easier for AMD back then! And that Chips Act funding is predicated on Intel keeping 51% ownership of Intel Foundries and so any non US interest can NOT acquire any majority/controlling share of Intel Foundries!', 'I think the Chips Act can be amended any time the situation warrants it. And I agree, AMD had to earn it. But of all of the chip designers, Intel was the only one to keep foundries here in the States. And that is different, especially considering the geopolitics of the situation.', 'Sometimes, equality is treating different things differently.
