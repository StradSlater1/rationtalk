First, turn France into a dynamic, low-tax, high-tech nation with a lean state and sound finances. Second, keep “populism” – by which his supporters meant Jean Luc Mélenchon on one side and Marine Le Pen on the other – at bay. A year and a half into his second term, the president has failed at both objectives, and his government stands on the brink of collapse.  ', 'Having already lost his parliamentary majority in 2022, and after a poor performance in the European elections in June of this year, Macron dissolved parliament, calling snap legislative elections. But the only effect was to pit both left and far-right against him, and both made gains, whittling his coalition down further. He then refused to appoint Lucie Castets, the candidate of the New Popular Front which came first in the election. Instead, he opted for a government of the right (propped up by the far-right), with Michel Barnier as PM.', 'Related']"

Parties that support Barnier don’t have the numbers to counter a collective move from the two groups, meaning the administration could fall as early as Wednesday.', 'The National Rally became the largest single party in the lower house of parliament in a June snap election, transforming Le Pen into Paris’s most influential power broker. Even though Barnier submitted to nearly all of Le Pen’s demands to tweak France’s 2025 budget, she said her party still wouldn’t back the bill, paving the way for a government collapse.', '“It is now up to you, as a parliamentarian of the nation, to decide whether to equip our country with responsible financial laws that are indispensable and useful,” Barnier told lawmakers Monday. “Or if we are entering uncharted territory.”', 'Barnier on Monday used a constitutional mechanism, called Article 49.3, that allows for legislation to be adopted without a vote, but opens the door to no-confidence motions. Support from the National Rally would have allowed him to adopt the bill while still being able to survive a no-confidence vote.', 'The French premier sought to appease Le Pen in the 11th hour, abandoning a proposal to reduce drug reimbursements after already caving to her demand last week not to raise taxes on electricity.', 'What Bloomberg Economics Says...', '“Le Pen might prefer political chaos to stability to put pressure on Macron to resign.”', '—Antonio Barroso, Eleonora Mavroeidi and Jamie Rush. For full insight, click here', 'The timing is particularly hazardous for France’s finances as the government must adopt a budget by year-end or use untested emergency legislation to avoid a shutdown.', 'But Barnier didn’t give in on the government plan to make significant savings by delaying the indexations of pensions to inflation. The National Rally submitted an amendment to crush the measure, but it was not integrated in time, according to a budget ministry official.', '“Barnier did not wish to respond to the request of the 11 million National Rally voters,” Le Pen told reporters after the announcement. “He said that everyone should shoulder their responsibilities, so we will shoulder ours.”', 'The uncertainty around the budget has pushed bond investors to punish France’s sovereign debt relative to its peers, driving up borrowing costs at one point last week as high as Greece’s and leading Barnier to warn of a “storm” in financial markets if he is dismissed from power.', 'The spread between 10-year French and German notes widened by seven basis points on Monday to 88 basis points, near the highest level since 2012. The CAC 40 Index ended largely flat, while the euro fell 0.8%.', 'Investors have fretted for months over France’s political difficulties, just as the government has been trying to push measures that will reduce its unwieldy deficit. The budget bill initially presented by Barnier’s government contained €60 billion ($63 billion) of tax increases and spending cuts that aimed for a sharp adjustment in the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025 from an estimated 6.1% this year.', 'French Finance Minister Antoine Armand said there would be painful consequences across the French economy if the government falls in the next few days. Relying on emergency legislation would tip 380,000 more households into paying income tax and another 18 million would see their bills rise, according to the minister. Emergency aid for farmers would also be impossible and the government could not go ahead with plans to hire more police.', '“In an economy where interest rates rise, in an economy without a budget, in an economy plunged into uncertainty, no sector wins, no French person wins, no business wins,” Armand said on France 2 Tuesday.', 'Budget Minister Laurent Saint-Martin told Le Parisien newspaper over the weekend that requests to amend the budget would cost nearly €10 billion.', 'The National Rally has slammed broad swathes of the plans that it sees as potentially harming household incomes.', '“There is no way out for a government that reconnects with the thread of Macronism, which refuses to take into account the social emergency at the end of the month and which ignores the need to relaunch growth,” National Rally President Jordan Bardella wrote on X after the announcement.', 'After opposition groups submit no-confidence motions, 48 hours must elapse before parliament begins to debate the proposal and a no-confidence ballot must take place within three days of that.', 'If the government is voted down, ministers remain in place with a caretaker status to manage current affairs, potentially including the emergency legislation to avoid a shutdown. It would then be up to President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a new prime minister, although there is no constitutional deadline for his decision.', 'While the left has called on Macron to resign, he can’t be forced out of his job. The next presidential election is set for 2027 and Le Pen remains the frontrunner, according to polls.', 'The president could also dissolve parliament again, but not until July, a year after the previous elections.', '“I sincerely believe that the French would never forgive us for preferring private interests to the future of the nation,” Barnier said.', '(Updates with finance minister comment in the 12th paragraph.)', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'How a Billionaire’s ‘Baby Project’ Ensnared Dozens of Women', 'The Billion-Dollar Railways Driving Biden’s Last Overseas Trip', 'A New Method to Map the Brain: Infect It With a Virus', 'Musk’s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape', 'Top Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

But while the far-right National Rally president, Jordan Bardella, claimed a “victory” over the step, he warned “other red lines remain”.', 'On Wednesday the gap between French sovereign borrowing costs and those of Germany widened to as much as 90 basis points, the biggest split since 2012.

That would be more than double a 3% limit in the EU’s stability and growth pact, which is designed to ensure member states pursue “sound public finances” and coordinate their tax and spending plans.', 'Brussels has placed France under an “excessive deficit” monitoring process.

He also praised Greece and other peripheral European economies for having “pulled up their sleeves” and making savings.', 'Jason Da Silva, director of Global Investment Strategy at Arbuthnot, said political upheaval in France was bound to “cause ripples across European investing” but said it could spur French lawmakers into action.', '“Hopefully this spurs on a little bit more impetus from the political leaders in Europe to think about what’s going to lead to growth going forward ... sometimes you need to take a bit of pain from the market to really get the political leaders to know what’s needed to grow the economy, particularly with [potential trade] tariffs coming through,” he told CNBC’s Street Signs on Thursday.', 'Commenting on the parity in French and Greek government bond yields, Rabobank said in analysis Thursday that “if far right leader Marine le Pen backs a no confidence vote in the coming days or weeks, Barnier could even be out of power.”', 'The bank also noted that the spread between the 10-year yields of Greece and France climbed above 30 basis points at the height of the Greek debt crisis in 2012, but has been gradually declining since 2016.', 'While nowhere near the level of crisis experienced by Greece in the wake of the global financial crash of 2007-2008, France’s economy is seen to be in need of urgent attention; it’s budget deficit is expected to stand at 6.1% in 2024 and public debt topped 110% of GDP in 2023. Countries within the EU are obliged to keep their budget deficits within 3% of gross domestic product and their public debt within 60% of GDP.', 'Greece experienced the euro zone’s largest sovereign debt crisis in the wake of the global crash in the late noughties, pushing the country into international bailouts that forced it to implement painful austerity measures and reforms. The country has since been praised for making progress on getting its economy back on track and reducing its debt.', 'Greece is expected to grow 2.1% in 2024, according to the European Commission, which noted in November that Greece’s “public debt-to-GDP ratio has been declining over recent years and is projected to reach 153.1% in 2024, before falling further to 146.8% of GDP in 2025 and 142.7% in 2026.”', 'The decline is driven by primary surpluses, nominal growth and the lowering of cash buffers in 2024, it said.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

In any case, there can be no new snap parliamentary elections before July.', 'As far as the budget is concerned, if parliament has not adopted it by Dec. 20, the caretaker government could invoke constitutional powers to pass it by ordinance.', 'However, that would be risky as there is a legal grey area about whether a caretaker government can use such powers.

Having signed a strategic partnership deal in Riyadh, the pair pledged to work for peace in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon.', 'An Élysée spokesman said Macron wants ‘presidential elections to be held in Lebanon, with the aim of bringing the Lebanese together and carrying out the reforms necessary for the country’s stability and security.’', 'No one wants to be seen trying to save Emmanuel Macron', 'The irony won’t have been lost on the French. A recent poll revealed that nearly two-thirds of the country think their president should resign in the event that his government, under the leadership of Michel Barnier, receives a vote of no confidence in response to their proposed budget.', 'That vote will take place on Wednesday, almost certainly bringing to an end Barnier’s short-lived premiership and making his 90-day tenure the shortest in the history of the Fifth Republic. The previous record was held by the Socialist, Bernard Cazeneuve who managed 155 days during the presidency of Francois Hollande.', 'It may be an idea if President Macron stopped worrying about the ‘stability and security’ of the Middle East and hurried home to try and sort out the chaos he unleashed on France when he called a snap election in June.', 'Monday was a day of high drama in Paris with the political class waiting to see if Marine Le Pen was just bluffing when at the end of last week she threatened to join the left in a no confidence vote.', 'It turned out she wasn’t. Barnier tried to talk her out of it, according to the French media, calling the leader of the National Rally on Monday morning to tell her that he was ready to make concessions on the budget as she had demanded. He committed to not cutting reimbursements for medicines, and on the question of abolishing State Medical Aid – a magnet for immigrants, according to Le Pen – he said he had ‘made a start on that’.', 'Le Pen reportedly told Barnier she would discuss her next move with her party president, Jordan Bardella, and get back to him after lunch.', 'When she called Barnier it was to tell him that she will support the left on Wednesday when they table the vote of no confidence in his government. ‘She made him dance’, is the headline in one tabloid this morning, and it does appear that Le Pen enjoyed humiliating Barnier.', 'He deserved to have been treated with more respect. He has his faults as a statesman – notably his devotion to the EU project – but he is an honourable man who had the courage to accept the challenge of trying to save France from becoming a Banana Republic. ‘It’s hard to think of a worse job,’ I wrote in September. Barnier probably agrees this morning.', 'So what next for France? This is the question dominating the print and broadcast media in France this morning with numerous scenarios being discussed.', 'There is a slim chance that the vote of no confidence tomorrow could fail if, in the next 24 hours, Barnier manages to persuade one party to support him. That would most likely be the centre-left Socialists, who are part of the left-wing New Popular Front coalition.', 'In an interview on Tuesday morning the leader of the Socialists, Olivier Faure, rebuked Barnier for not reaching out to his party in formulating his budget, perhaps a hint that it’s not too late.', 'Such a scenario is unlikely, however, because no one wants to be seen trying to save Emmanuel Macron. Ultimately, the aim of the Socialists and their left-wing allies – the Greens and Jean-Luc Melenchon’s la France Insoumise – is the same as Le Pen’s: to force Macron to resign.', 'On Monday evening, Melenchon called on Macron to do just that, but such a scenario is ‘unthinkable’, according to one of the president’s MPs this morning.', 'Instead, Macron might do what he did after July’s inconclusive parliamentary elections and play for time by delaying the nomination of a successor to Barnier until the new year. In the summer he used the Paris Olympics as a ‘truce’, and with Christmas coming up there is another convenient excuse for procrastination.', 'On the other hand, Le Monde claims that Macron is already drawing up a list of successors and will narrow it down on his flight home from Saudi Arabia tomorrow. ', 'How long will the next PM last? Probably not long given the divisions within the National Assembly. And with new elections not possible before July 8 next year (the Constitution precludes two elections within 12 months) the democratic process is well and truly stuck.', 'There have been suggestions that consequently Macron could invoke Article 16 of the Constitution, which permits a president in times of crisis to govern without the backing of the National Assembly. In other words, as one newspaper put it, turn France into a ‘dictatorship’. ', 'Such a power grab, however, would run the risk of provoking a backlash from the people. With the country going through a cost-of-living crisis, and with a wave of redundancies expected in 2025, there is a dangerous febrility to France as this most turbulent of years draws to an end.', 'Macron should think carefully before his next step, or else he and France might have a nasty fall.', 'Subscribe to unlock 10 weeks of unlimited access for just $1', 'Already a subscriber?
