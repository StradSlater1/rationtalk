Scott Owens with the Dothan Police Department said.', 'Online purchases generate billions of packages every year, but not every package will be received.', 'In the last year alone, about $12 billion in packages were stolen by porch pirates.', '“I don’t know that they are looking for anything specific, they are looking for boxes. They see boxes on the porch especially when people are working, that’s when they are most likely to take that opportunity to steal items and if it turns out later on that they don’t need the item, they just throw the item away,” Owens said.', 'Here’s what you can do to prevent this: Track your package, sign up for delivery alerts, or use a secure drop-off location.', 'Cameras among other things are good deterrents for porch pirates.', '“The cameras are obviously going to help hold people accountable. People are going to come on your porch regardless, so turning the (porch) light on, people can see them and that’s where you’re a good neighbor. If you see somebody on someone’s porch that you don’t recognize, maybe you don’t say anything to them or confront them, but you can go out there and let them know you are watching them. A lot of times that will deter people from criminal activity,” Owens explained.', 'DPD urges anyone who falls victim to porch pirates to report it to law enforcement.', 'Subscribe to our News 4 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every morning.

""The best advice we can give just the regular consumer is be very difficult to be a victim.”', 'He recommends scheduling deliveries for when someone is home and can quickly bring the delivery inside. He also said it’s helpful to have a discreet area in front of your home where a delivery driver can leave the package so you can’t see it from the street. Surveillance cameras help, too.', 'He said it is also important to report package thefts.', ""“If we don't have a report, we can't start any type of investigation. It might be something small, you might think it was only like five or ten bucks or whatever it is. But these smaller things sometimes lead into a bigger investigation,” Gandhi said. “Sometimes we do get somebody that's got several packages because the chances are they didn't likely start and stop at your home.”"", 'Smith hopes people will keep an eye out so they don’t end up feeling the way that she did.', ""“It stung. It's an awful feeling when someone steals from you,” she said. “I kind of want this person to know, like, this is what you did to a family.

Before, someone had to steal $750 for it to be a felony, but now, whoever steals a package worth $40 or more is considered a third-degree felony.

We reported it to the police online, along with our doorbell footage, but never got a response.’', 'A thief, who spotted the parcel by the back door of a home while walking his dog, is caught on film stealing goods worth around £200', 'A man reaches through a garden gate in bid to snatch package', 'Sian Thomas’s story takes porch piracy to a new level – a woman apparently attempted to steal a Christmas gift Sian had bought for her daughter when it was delivered to her by mistake. She was wrapping presents when she realised one was missing: a luxury £35 make-up brush holder her daughter, Beth, had asked for.', 'Panicked – by December 22 it was too late to order a replacement – she logged on to eBay and saw it had been sent, but she had forgotten to include the name of her workplace in her delivery address. The street name and postcode of the tiny village where she worked only contained a few houses – so, surely, she reasoned, someone living there would have taken delivery of her parcel.', 'Knowing the parcel must be near, Sian, a mother of two and project manager who lives with husband Stephen, 68, a retired maintenance worker in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, went out during her break next day to knock on the dozen or so doors that shared a postcode with her workplace.', '‘I politely asked people if they’d received a parcel in my name. Everyone said no.’', 'At the last property, a man in his 30s answered the door. Unlike his neighbours, Sian recalls, he seemed ‘disgruntled. I wasn’t sure why. He said his wife ordered online all the time but wasn’t home. He didn’t to want to look for the parcel, so I left’. By chance, on her return to work, she bumped into the postman. ‘When I told him my name, he remembered delivering the missing parcel – to the very house I’d just visited. He said a woman had signed for it and that the Royal Mail system could pinpoint the house that had taken it if necessary.’', 'Furious, Sian trudged back in her lunch break, this time arriving at the property to find the man she’d spoken to in police uniform, apparently a policeman ready to start a shift.', '‘“It’s me again,” I said. “Yes…” he said,’ recalls Sian. ‘It was all very awkward. I told him the postman had delivered my parcel here and that a woman at his address had signed for it.', '‘He mumbled something about having to speak to his wife. He said she was a midwife and out in the community. I asked if he could call her and gave him my number. Then he curtly shut the door.’', 'At work, Sian received a call from the wife, who admitted that not only had she signed for Sian’s parcel she’d wrapped it and placed it under her tree for her daughter.', '‘She said she ordered so much stuff online she couldn’t remember it wasn’t hers. I asked her to drop it off at work. She said she’d see what she could do.’', 'Sian, 60, adds: ‘I couldn’t believe it. I take parcels for people all the time. I’d never dream of keeping them.’ That afternoon the woman arrived at reception carrying the brush holder. ‘My colleagues asked if she wanted to bring it to me, but she didn’t,’ says Sian. ‘I thought “fine by me.” I didn’t want to see her anyway.’', 'Online forums are awash with consumers complaining their neighbours have stolen their deliveries. TikTok user Emily Lin went viral after posting a video of herself leaving a decoy parcel filled with rubbish and a note saying ‘I’m onto you,’ for whoever in her block of flats was stealing her parcels. ‘I just want them to know that I hate them,’ she said.', 'Research shows those reporting stolen deliveries are split evenly between telling their courier and telling the retailer, while only 17 per cent report the crime to police. In fact, says consumer disputes expert Scott Dixon, aka The Complaints Resolver, under Section 29 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, goods remain at the retailers’ risk until they come into possession of the consumer, so the shop should always be your first port of call.', '‘If goods go missing from your doorstep a retailer is responsible for issuing a replacement or refunding you. Yes, it’s a crime but we all know police don’t have the resources or desire to investigate parcel theft.’', 'Of course, delivery drivers are under intense pressure as well, often finding people aren’t home and faced with the dilemma of what to do with packages.', 'One anonymous self-employed agency employee, working for Amazon, recalled delivering up to 300 parcels a day in Christmas 2019: ‘The traffic is really bad at this time of year and you can be in queues for hours on end.’', 'Emma McGovern, 34, didn’t bother reporting the theft of her daughter Tabitha’s birthday gifts from her block of flats last year.', '‘We had no CCTV and I didn’t think the police would spend their resources looking for an 11-year-old’s birthday presents,’ says Emma, a mother of four and teacher from South London, married to musician Neil, 40. His parents had posted a present for Tabitha’s birthday and when it didn’t arrive, Emma says, ‘I assumed the post was slow.’', 'It wasn’t until the next morning that Emma saw torn wrapping paper under the stairway of the four-storey building where the family has lived on the third floor for ten years. On it she recognised their address, written in her mother-in-law’s handwriting.', 'Somebody had stolen Tabitha’s presents, along with a neighbour’s Amazon parcel, and scarpered. ‘It wasn’t anyone in the block – we have a WhatsApp group and babysit each other’s kids.’', 'An Amazon driver arrives at a home in Buckinghamshire to deliver a parcel... ', '... before the brazen driver then steals another parcel and drives off', 'She went back upstairs to relay the upsetting news to her children. ‘I told Tabitha that Grandma had sent her some gifts but sadly Mummy had found packaging and nothing was left. I was sad something her grandmother had put a lot of thought into but was of little value to anyone else was gone.’', 'Although Scott Dixon says ‘courier firms will not readily admit responsibility for stolen items, as missing goods in transit is such a big problem,’ Royal Mail will consider claims from either the sender or recipient, provided they’re made within 80 days of the date of posting. Emma’s mother-in-law had bought Tabitha leggings and T-shirts and a children’s history book, and enclosed a £20 note from her great-grandmother.', 'When Emma posted about the theft on her residents’ WhatsApp group it transpired that three of the other ten households in the building hadn’t received deliveries due at the same time.', 'Emma has now asked family not to send Christmas gifts to their house at all. ‘I’ve said we can exchange them when we see each other – it’s safer,’ she adds.', 'Lisa, whose cashmere sweater and trousers were stolen, was sceptical about calling the police, so she was ‘pleasantly surprised’ that within a week of the incident, two years ago, a female officer called her and arranged for her to send the CCTV footage.', 'A few days later the officer contacted her to say the man in the video was wanted in connection with a shoplifting incident.', 'Police later told Lisa he had been charged and convicted. ‘I was glad I’d helped him get caught,’ she says. ‘I know it’s only a Christmas present, but I find theft appalling.’ And especially galling when it happens outside your front door.', 'Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd', 'Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group']"
