Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire quiets northern front — but not Gaza,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/28/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-quiets-one-front-but-gaza-sees-no-end-to-war-00192017,"['FOREIGN AFFAIRS', '”They agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? Have mercy on the children, the elderly and the women.”', 'Tents occupied by displaced Palestinians are seen at the beach in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, on Nov. 26, 2024. | Abdel Kareem Hana/AP', 'By ASSOCIATED PRESS', '11/28/2024 12:15 AM EST', '', 'JERUSALEM — For many across the Middle East, the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire came as a relief: the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago.', 'But for Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the news appeared only to inaugurate a newer, grimmer period of the conflict there. For them, it marked yet another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months.', 'Palestinians had hoped that any ceasefire deal with Hezbollah would include a truce in Gaza as well. The families of people kidnapped when Hamas-led militants stormed southern Israel in October 2023, meanwhile, wanted part of the agreement to include returning their loved ones. Instead, the ceasefire was confined only to the fighting in Lebanon.', '“We feel this is a missed opportunity to tie in the hostages in this agreement that was signed today,” said Ruby Chen, whose son, Itay Chen, was taken hostage from an Israeli military base and has been declared dead.', 'As much as they were intertwined, the two wars have been very different. In Lebanon, Israel said its aim was to drive Hezbollah back from the countries’ shared border and end the militant group’s barrages into northern Israel. The ceasefire that took effect Wednesday is intended to do that.', 'Protesters block an intersection in Jerusalem on Nov. 27, 2024, during a demonstration by relatives of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and their supporters to call for a hostage release deal. | Maya Alleruzzo/AP', 'In Gaza, Israel’s goals are more sweeping. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been resolute in insisting that Hamas must be completely destroyed and Israel must retain lasting control over parts of the territory. Months of talks have failed to get Netanyahu to back down from those demands — or to convince Hamas to release hostages under those terms.', 'For Palestinians in Gaza, that means continuing misery under an Israeli campaign that has demolished much of the territory and driven almost the entire population from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are going hungry while living in squalid tent cities as the second winter of the war brings cold rains and flooding.', '”They agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? Have mercy on the children, the elderly and the women,” said Ahlam Abu Shalabi, living in tent in central Gaza. “Now it is winter, and all the people are drowning.”', 'Palestinians feel resigned to continued war: The war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants attacked Israel from Gaza, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has rained devastation on the Palestinian territory, killing over 44,000 people, according to local health officials. The officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and fighters in their count, say over half of the dead are women and children.', 'Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after Hamas’ attack in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group. The two sides have exchanged near-daily barrages since. Moving thousands of troops to its northern border, Israel ramped up bombardment of southern Lebanon and launched a ground invasion there two months ago, killing many of Hezbollah’s leaders.', 'Palestinians now fear Israel’s military can return its full focus to Gaza — a point that Netanyahu made as he announced the ceasefire in Lebanon on Tuesday.', '“The pressure will be more on Gaza,” said Mamdouh Younis, a displaced man in a central Gaza tent camp. Netanyahu, he said, can now exploit the fact that “Gaza has become alone, far from all the arenas that were supporting it, especially the Lebanon front.”', 'Israeli troops are already engaged in fierce fighting in Gaza’s north, where a two-month offensive has cut off most aid and caused experts to warn a famine may be underway. Strikes all over the territory regularly kill dozens.', 'In signing onto the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah reversed its long-held position that it wouldn’t stop its barrages across the border unless Israel ends the war in Gaza.', '“This could have a psychological impact, as it will further entrench the understanding that Palestinians in Gaza are alone in resisting against their occupiers,” said Tariq Kenney Shawa, a U.S. policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank.', 'Hamas may dig its heels in: It also leaves Hamas — its capabilities already severely damaged by Israel’s offensive — to fight alone. Hamas official Osama Hamdan appeared to accept Hezbollah’s new position in an interview Monday.', '“Any announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,” Hamdan told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah.', 'Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian analyst, said the ceasefire could make Hamas even less popular in Gaza, by proving the failure of its gambit that its attack on Israel would rally other militant groups to the fight.', '“It’s a moment where we can see the Hamas messaging become weaker and weaker, as they struggle to justify their strategy to the public,” said Sayegh.', 'U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire could help force Hamas to the negotiating table because it would show the group that the “cavalry is not on the way.”', 'But Hamas experts predicted that it would only dig in both on the battlefield and in talks. Hamas has insisted it will only release all the hostages in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.', '“I expect Hamas will continue using guerrilla warfare to confront Israeli forces in Gaza as long as they remain,” said Shawa.', 'Hostage families lose hope: Dozens of Israelis thronged a major highway in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, protesting for the return of the hostages as the country waited to hear if a ceasefire in Lebanon had been agreed.', 'Around 100 people taken hostage are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the other hostages seized by Hamas were released during a ceasefire last year.', 'Ricardo Grichener, the uncle of 23-year-old hostage Omer Wenkert, said the ceasefire with Hezbollah showed how the Israeli government was openly disregarding the hostages.', 'Even though Israel has inflicted greater damage on Hamas in Gaza than on Hezbollah in Lebanon, he said “the decision to postpone a deal in Gaza and release the hostages is not based on the same military success criteria.”', 'The most recent effort to wind down the war stalled in October. U.S. President Joe Biden said Tuesday he would begin a renewed push, but his administration is now in its waning days after the reelection of former President Donald Trump.', '“This ceasefire doesn’t concern our hostages. I believe that Netanyahu forgot about them, and he just wants to keep fighting in Gaza,” said Ifat Kalderon, clutching a photo of her cousin, Ofer Kalderon, who is a hostage and a father to four.', '“Ofer yesterday had his 54th birthday.

October 8th, Hezbollah shelling starts. So the people eventually have to evacuate from the north of their country.', 'If those can go back and they can get the IDF a break, what do you think this does for the hostages, the pursuit, and what do you think it means for Iran, who’s had their nuclear program damaged and their missile defense destroyed?', 'Hanson: I think the biggest win for Israel is if their people can return to their homes in Northern Israel. If Hezbollah withdraws north of the Litani River, which there was a UN resolution 1701 requiring that, and the Lebanese government and army actually enforce that, which the US can make them do, we pay them a lot of money. So if we use that money as leverage and force them to stay up there, then Israel gets those those about plus people returning home, that’s great.', 'Then they can go ahead and as I mentioned, finish the war against Hamas\nand then start figuring out what the end game is with Iran. Ideally, the people of Iran decide they need a better government and go ahead and remove the mullahs themselves.\nThen everyone can go ahead and breathe a little easier.', 'FOX: Jim, it’s not a good time to be the Grand Ayatollah. Trump’s coming to town.\nMaximum pressure is about to come back. Their air defense has been destroyed, their radar has been destroyed, their nuclear program’s been damaged, and they’re out of their two big bodyguards, Hamas and Hezbollah, all flat on their backs. Not a good time for Iran, that Iranian government.', 'Hanson: You’re giving me all that joyous vibe there, Brian.\nI like the way that sounds.', 'And the grand Ayatollah and the rest of the leadership of the Islamic Republic should be worried.\nThey failed. They put all of their, you know, chess pieces into play against Israel in a seven plus front war, and they have failed miserably. They’ve been, you know, Hezbollah got wiped out, essentially, their entire leadership taken off the board. Hamas is on its last legs.\nThe Houthis will will catch their trouble later.\nSo I think they’re the ones now who have to be wondering how much time they’ve got left. And, you know, Israel was was light on the places they hit. They hit one nuke site that wasn’t declared.\nBut I think they need to be worried about the rest of their toys in in the homeland there.', 'FOX: Yeah, sometimes you have to have war to get peace.

Blackmail from the United States. Netanyahu told the Israeli cabinet that if they did not agree to the Biden terms, the administration would move against the Jewish state in the U.N. Security Council. This threat was a first of its kind for any president; even Barack Obama only allowed a hostile Security Council action to go through without a veto in his final act of aggression against Jerusalem in 2017. This time Biden was threatening to lead the U.N. against its only true ally in the Middle East.', 'If what Netanyahu told his cabinet is true, and Biden’s own statement yesterday would seem to provide some confirmation, what we’re seeing here is the final capitulation by this government to the idea that Israel deserves to be held responsible for the crime of defending itself. Not only against the terrorist state that invaded it last October 7, but also against the  terrorist state-within-a-state on its Northern border that has fired rockets at it for 13 months without letup, the catamite army of Iran that takes orders from the theocracy determined to destroy the Jewish state and all Jews worldwide.', 'So the Biden administration is concluding its time in office as a power player in the Middle East praising itself for its toughness in restraining Israel’s just cause. But in the name of what exactly? Well, a “ceasefire,” of course. Hallelujah.  Yes, Biden and his people have secured a ceasefire, as though a ceasefire means anything but its literal definition—a pause in the use of projectile force. It means nothing else. It does not mean peace. It does not mean negotiations. It does not mean a change in the relative positions of the forces at war. It’s a freeze. And when such a freeze freezes the military that’s on the march, it implicitly favors the side that is on its back foot. Thus America has, in effect, sided with Hezbollah.', 'End scene. For a minute there, after October 7, Joe Biden knew Israel was in the right. But that knowledge quickly fell through one of the holes in the swiss cheese that is either his currently decaying octogenarian brain or just the same fourth-rate cognitive machine he has used to such pointless effect for more than half a century in Washington.', '“Oh no!” someone said to him. “There are Arabs in Michigan!” And suddenly Israel, the most accurate military force in the history of the planet, was being accused of killing people indiscriminately;  this country that allowed more than 1 billion tons of food into a war zone to feed its enemy was said to be starving them out somehow; and Israel’s efforts to end the war quickly and cleanly with a victory against Hamas were opposed by Swiss Cheese Man and his map-reading sot of a doyenne, who informed the world there was no way for Israel to prevail in Rafah due to her astounding experience in war, her deep knowledge of tactics and strategy, and her view from the bottom of a bottle of Dewar’s. At long last, Israel finally did go in, and took Rafah in a matter of weeks, and took out Yahya Sinwar. But even this exposure to reality did not change the administration’s determination to stay Israel’s hand somehow. If it couldn’t do so in Gaza, the Biden administration would do so in Lebanon on its way out the door into the annals of history, where it will be remembered for its staggering and almost total failure on all fronts.', 'Knowing as he does that in two months he will not be facing a senile president and that president’s intellectually deficient secretary of state, his oft-AWOL secretary of defense, his neurasthenic national security adviser, his Hawaii-based vice-drunkident, and his increasingly anti-Israel party, Netanyahu decided to play the long game. He also may find it useful to have the time to regroup and figure out what that long game should be. But there is great risk here. Israel has momentum and is giving that up. But in the end, the battle here isn’t against Hezbollah anyway. It’s against Iran. And the incoming administration gives every indication that, unlike the present feckless crew, it sees Iran clearly as an enemy. The nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, declared that it was time to make America great again…and to make Iran broke again. And he isn’t even one of the leading foreign policy voices. The others—Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz, Pete Hegseth—are even tougher.', 'And who knows what the nation that came up with the pager attack has up its sleeve?

More than 3,800 people have been killed, including more than 200 children, and more than 15,400 wounded since October 2023.', 'As yet another Israeli war on Lebanon has taken a painful toll, UNIFIL has clearly failed in its mission to “keep peace”. It is incapable of stopping Israeli aggression and has done little to help the Lebanese authorities maintain control over their southern territory and protect the civilian population. This failure raises important questions about its continuous presence in Lebanon under the new ceasefire announced on November 26.', 'UNIFIL is one of the largest and longest-running peacekeeping missions in the world. It was created in March 1978 by the UN Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 in order to: confirm Israel’s withdrawal from Southern Lebanon; restore peace and security; and assist the Lebanese government in regaining control over the area.', 'Although UNIFIL was supposed to protect the civilian population and was given the right to use weapons to defend itself, it was not empowered to use force to fulfil its mandate. Throughout its existence, its troops have not returned any fire directly at Israel in any of its aggressions against Lebanon.', 'After the 2006 war, UNIFIL force was increased from 2,000 to 15,000 soldiers and its mandate was expanded to include disarming all non-state entities in Lebanon. Given that Hezbollah continues to have access to weapons, it is clear that UNIFIL has failed to implement that aspect of its mandate, as well.', 'The inability of UNIFIL to protect itself, let alone Lebanese civilians from Israeli aggression has had deadly consequences throughout the years. In 1987, an Israeli tank fired at a UNIFIL observation post and killed an Irish peacekeeper, which the Irish army perceived to be a deliberate attack.', 'During Israel’s assault on southern Lebanon in 1996, the Israeli army targeted a UNIFIL Fijian battalion base in Qana, killing more than 100 civilians, including at least 37 children, and four UNIFIL soldiers. Some 800 civilians had sought refuge at the base, hoping they would be safe from Israeli attacks under UN protection.', 'International outrage over the massacre forced Israel to end its assault on Lebanon. However, many contributing countries continued to send their troops to South Lebanon and maintain normal relations with Israel.', 'Ten years later, in the July 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, UNIFIL once again came under direct fire from Israel. As concluded by the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon, UN positions were targeted 30 times in the course of the 34-day war and all attacks were unjustified. Among the incidents was an Israeli air strike on a UNIFIL base in Al-Khiyam which killed four unarmed UN observers.', 'In the years leading up to 2023, Israel continuously demonised UNIFIL, accusing it of working for Hezbollah, covering up its tunnels and tracks, and overlooking the movement of weapons. Through such attacks, Israel aimed to delegitimise UNIFIL, providing a pretext for more violent attacks to come.', 'UNIFIL troop-contributing countries had plenty of time to re-evaluate the risk they were putting their peacekeepers in. Instead of holding Israel accountable for its violence, they continued to put their soldiers in the line of fire.', 'As UNIFIL failed to protect civilians from Israeli aggression, local communities in the south developed sometimes tenuous relations with the force. These dynamics depend somewhat on the nationality of a certain battalion and the denomination of the community, where it is deployed. European troops have been overwhelmingly perceived as spies for Israel, especially by the Shia population, which has endured the worst of Israel’s occupation and violence and has witnessed UNIFIL’s passivity and inability to provide protection.', 'It is of note that UNIFIL, compared with other peacekeeping missions, has the highest number of European soldiers. Almost 40 percent of UNIFIL’s troops come from European countries, such as Italy, France and Spain.', 'In my years travelling to the south, I have been told numerous times that there was “no reason” to study UNIFIL because clearly, they are “a weapon for Israel” or “spies”.', '“As long as Israel exists there, they’ll continue to exist here,” a Lebanese worker employed by the UNIFIL told me. Many share this sentiment and ask: if UNIFIL has been unable to fulfil its objectives, why has it stayed in the south?', 'Part of the reason for this mistrust is that some UNIFIL contingents have used aid to try to penetrate local communities. Given the devastation Israel has repeatedly wrought on the south and the general neglect by the central government in Beirut, villages and towns have struggled to rebuild and develop.', 'After the 2006 war, UNIFIL started implementing so-called “quick impact projects “(QIPs), which have delivered much-needed help to these communities. But some of these initiatives have also caused more resentment because they have been made conditional.', 'Villages and towns, for example, where the mayor is publicly supportive of the resistance, would not receive such aid; the same would go for public institutions, such as schools. When communities are granted QIPs, they are expected to be “grateful” and allow UNFIL greater access to carry out surveillance in their areas.', 'In 2023, I attended one event organised by UNIFIL to celebrate the donation of solar panels by an Italian contingent to a village outside Naqoura and was able to observe some of UNIFIL’s interactions with locals firsthand.', 'We, the attendees, were given juice and some cookies and then asked to take a seat in neatly arranged rows of chairs. We had to move up several times so that we could fill up the front seats. There were armed soldiers standing all around us and cameras in our faces, capturing the celebration.', 'An Italian general spoke to the audience in Italian and had an Arabic interpreter translate. During his speech, he invoked Allah, then Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and then Imam Ali, reminding the audience that each taught them the importance of gratitude. Each invocation sent the crowd into prayers.', 'After the event was over, the men from the village were rounded up to pose for a photo. None of the villagers seemed especially thankful or excited for the solar panels donated to the municipality. While these solar panels were no doubt useful, they also enabled UNIFIL to better patrol and surveil the roads.', 'Another conditional QIP I came across was carried out by a French battalion at a school in a village near Tyre. The principal told me that there were two conditions for French help with repairs for the school: the school leadership could not have any affiliation with an armed group and it had to allow UNIFIL to enter its premises, observe and teach their own courses.', 'While some of UNIFIL’s classroom lessons were supposed to focus on foreign languages, others were not as benign. In one course, French soldiers talked to Muslim elementary school students about brotherhood between all monotheistic religions, emphasising a religious kinship between Jews and Muslims. UNIFIL’s intervention in the curriculum sought to neutralise the struggle between Lebanon and Israel by painting it as an issue of religious misunderstanding rather than one of resistance and occupation.', 'The school principal, who was clearly uncomfortable with UNIFIL’s interference, told me, “I find ways to deter them from wanting to enter the school regularly because I can’t tell them no. I make up excuses, I say that our schedule just doesn’t allow, that we are too busy … whatever I can find.”', 'These dynamics I observed during my fieldwork reflect probably the only achievement UNIFIL has made since its creation in 1978: it has managed to become a governing-like entity that uses much-needed aid as a means to pacify the civilian population.', 'UNFIL clearly does not have the trust of the local Lebanese population or the respect of the Israeli authorities. It is a peacekeeping force that has failed to protect civilians and stop violence.', 'A ceasefire has now been announced that will focus on implementing UNSC Resolution 1701 and keeping the territory between the border with Israel and the Litani River free from Hezbollah presence.', 'This means that UNIFIL’s mandate will likely be expanded, and so will its funding and the number of personnel deployed. However, such changes are unlikely to make it a more effective peacekeeping force.', 'This is because UNIFIL will continue to be incapable of protecting the Lebanese population from Israeli aggression. It is not possible to “keep peace” in Lebanon because there is no peace in the shadow of occupation.', 'The country cannot achieve peace while Israel continues to violate its sovereignty and target its civilian population. Only a just resolution to the Palestinian question, the upholding of the rights of the Palestinians, and respect for the sovereignty of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan can lead to peace.', 'The Israeli political elite has made it clear that it will do everything and anything to avoid peacemaking in Lebanon and elsewhere. So what can be done?', 'This new ceasefire can be an opportunity to rethink “peacekeeping” efforts in Lebanon. If UNIFIL’s mandate cannot be expanded to protect Lebanese civilians, then the troop-contributing countries, especially the European states, which have more political sway with Israel, have to start holding it accountable for its violations and crimes. They must reconsider their diplomatic and trade ties with the Israeli state, which has and will continue to target their peacekeepers.', 'Only by enforcing accountability can the international community put enough pressure on Israel to stop its aggressive behaviour and commit to peace.', 'The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

A key challenge remains the weakened and at times precarious nature of the Lebanese state, though the country's powerful parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, announced Thursday that there would be a parliamentary vote to elect a new president, as part of efforts to end a two-year power vacuum."", 'Leaders on both sides of the months-long conflict have attempted to portray this ceasefire as a success - though many observers interviewed by NPR have questioned such assessments - and they have sought to publicize their recent military achievements to their respective domestic audiences.', ""The deal has been greeted by relief among many Lebanese civilians after a punishing program of airstrikes and military incursions across villages, towns and cities since September, but in Israel residents of communities in the country's northern border region have remained hesitant about returning to homes that have faced a months-long barrage of rocket fire."", ""The Israeli Prime Minister's office has not released an official version of the deal, but an Arabic version was published on the Facebook page of Lebanon's Council of Ministers. Below is a summary of its main terms - as detailed in a version that NPR obtained separately - and which both sides have confirmed is authentic."", "" \nLebanon's government is required to prevent Hezbollah and any other armed groups that operate in Lebanon from conducting combat operations against Israel, while the Israeli military is expected to end its offensive actions against targets inside Lebanon, whether civil or military. This is essentially the crux of the ceasefire, but it is important to note that this does not preclude either the Lebanese or Israelis from exercising the right to self defense that is guaranteed under international law."", ""The Israeli and the Lebanese governments are also required to rebuild lines of communication with each other, in a forum that the United Nations will host and the United States will chair, alongside France. A team of representatives will be guaranteed safety by both sides, and will aim to observe and verify that the deal's details are being implemented on the ground and support the Lebanese military's efforts to remove any vestiges of Hezbollah's military strength in southern Lebanon."", ""The Israeli military said Thursday one of its aircraft struck a storage site for Hezbollah rockets, one of the first large-scale skirmishes that could reoccur in the coming months as Hezbollah and Israel withdraw to the respective positions agreed upon. The Israeli authorities insist Thursday's actions did not mean the ceasefire had been broken, since they were not offensive in nature."", 'But if there are any violations of the ceasefire, both Lebanon and Israel will be required to report them to this group through processes that have not yet been established, which may leave it open to interpretation.', '""The key thing is there is no enforcement mechanism,"" says Karim Makdisi, a professor of international politics at the American University of Beirut. ""There\'s a higher visibility now with the Americans being directly involved - but it\'s not an enforcement mechanism.""', 'A similar oversight system was established after a previous Israeli incursion into Lebanon, back in 1996, according to Nicholas Noe, director of the Beirut Exchange Foundation. Though different in its scope, it was widely judged as successful at reducing civilian conflicts during what proved to be an ongoing low-intensity conflict between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces — something that will be crucial given the expected return of hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Lebanese civilians to this region.', 'But having reviewed this week\'s agreement, Noe anticipates it is unlikely to function as well as the original one did in the late 1990s, because the Israelis will be able to define an ""offensive"" action on their own terms.

""This is especially the case when we consider the sorts of amendments and proposals that have been put forward over the past two months by Amos Hochstein.""', 'The sale of weapons and military equipment into Lebanon will be regulated by the government of Lebanon, a measure that is intended to prevent non-state militant groups like Hezbollah from rearming and reestablishing their military capacities.

"Rejoicing at Lebanon ceasefire, Gazans ask: ‘When will our turn come?’",https://www.972mag.com/lebanon-ceasefire-gaza-isolation/,"['On Nov. 27, a ceasefire agreement came into effect in Lebanon, bringing a glimmer of hope to the war-torn region. For the people of Gaza, battered for over a year by relentless Israeli bombardment and a deepening humanitarian crisis, the news evoked a bittersweet response. The fleeting sense of joy and relief for their neighbors to the north, who might soon be able to rebuild their lives, was overshadowed by their own agony as Israel’s genocidal military campaign in Gaza continues.', '“We are happy for [the Lebanese people],” Asem, a 34-year-old father of three from northern Gaza, told +972. “No one should endure what we are going through. But it hurts that the world can act swiftly elsewhere while we are left to face this genocide alone.”', 'His sentiments resonate deeply among Gazans. For many of them, the ceasefire in Lebanon underscores the harsh reality that their suffering matters less than others. “The world saw what happened in Lebanon, [and was] able to stop the war there,” said Ruba Makwai, a 25-year-old teacher. “But who will stop the war in Gaza? Who will speak for us?”', 'Like over 90 percent of Gazans, Makwai had to flee her home because of the war. In November 2023, she and her family were forced to leave northern Gaza, after heavy Israeli bombardments destroyed their neighborhood. Now, living in a cramped shelter for displaced people in Az-Zawayda in central Gaza with her mother, siblings, and dozens of others, she finds herself yearning for a sense of normalcy.', '“This morning, I watched videos of displaced Lebanese returning to their homes. I’ve replayed those videos over and over, imagining what it would be like to return to our home,” Makwai told +972. “I imagine myself running to hug my father and brother — I haven’t seen them in a year. I wish more than anything to experience that moment. But for us, reality is heartbreaking. Our life is confined to the borders of these tents.”', 'A key factor complicating efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza is the lack of a unified Palestinian leadership, which the Israeli government, under Benjamin Netanyahu, has worked to divide and suppress over many years, exploiting the resulting vacuum to advance its own agenda. Gaza’s isolation, coupled with the political chaos, the U.S. elections, and Israel’s conflict with Lebanon, has left Palestinians without a clear voice on the international stage.', 'This leadership vacuum deepened with Israel’s assassinations of prominent Palestinian political figures. The killing of Ismail Haniyeh in July and Yahya Sinwar in October — key players in negotiations and decision-making — further undermined diplomatic momentum to reach a ceasefire. While U.S. President Joe Biden suggested the assassination of Sinwar could bring Gaza and Israel closer to an agreement, Netanyahu leveraged it to intensify his military campaign against Gaza.', '“The assassinations leave us leaderless,” Adel, a Palestinian journalist, told +972. “We are without a father or representative. We have no one to advocate for us as Netanyahu’s plans move forward.” ', 'Given Netanyahu’s past political maneuvers, some believe that the ceasefire in Lebanon may actually be a dangerous sign for Gaza. Youssef Salem, a Palestinian activist and lawyer, wrote in a Facebook post that the ceasefire in Lebanon “will lead to increased political and military focus on Gaza in the coming period,” but that this focus is unlikely to bring relief. Instead, it signals a potential intensification of Israeli aggression, as the war-torn enclave becomes the sole target of Netanyahu’s military strategies.', 'Regional actors, particularly Iran, further complicate the situation. While Tehran positions itself as a champion of Palestinian resistance, many Gazans feel that its involvement in the war only serves its own strategic interests.', '“They talk a lot about liberating Palestine,” Adel noted. “But where is their help when our children are dying?”', 'Iran’s support for Palestinian factions like Hamas and Islamic Jihad has provided Israel with a pretext for its devastating military operations in Gaza. Yet Tehran’s rhetoric is not matched by tangible aid or intervention. For ordinary Gazans, Adel argues, this disconnect breeds resentment and a sense of betrayal.', '“We are caught between forces that do not care about us: Iran stirs things up, Israel attacks us, and the world watches.”', 'The longstanding divisions between Palestinian factions have posed significant challenges to the broader Palestinian cause. Yet, for the people of Gaza, their suffering transcends political rivalries. “We are human beings first. Isn’t that enough reason for the world to act?” asked Aya Shawa, a 31-year-old activist.', 'Her words reflect the growing frustration within the besieged Strip — not only toward their oppressors, but also toward allies like Qatar, who are perceived as turning away from Gaza.', 'For years, Qatar played a crucial role in helping Gaza survive Israel’s nearly two-decade long blockade, providing humanitarian aid, mediating temporary ceasefires, and funding rebuilding efforts. However, recent comments by Qatari officials, who cited lack of seriousness from “both sides” as reason for suspending the country’s role as mediator in the ceasefire talks, have left Gazans feeling betrayed and further isolated on the international stage.', '“How did Qatar equate Gaza with Israel?” asked Aya Shawa. “Is it logical to put us, the oppressed, on the same level as the occupier?”', 'Qatar’s diplomatic shift reflects a broader regional trend: as Israel’s war in Gaza grinds on, Palestinians’ plight is increasingly overshadowed by other events and political priorities. Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in September temporarily redirected media attention away from Gaza; now, the renewed fighting in Syria’s civil war threatens to do the same. And rather than working to resolve the immediate humanitarian crisis, many diplomats and politicians are instead prioritizing the questions of Gaza’s governance and control in the “day-after” scenario.', 'For the people of Gaza, having already endured 14 months of war, over 44,282 deaths, looming famine, and the destruction of countless homes, schools, and hospitals, this is an ominous sign of things to come. “We are not just numbers,” Aya reiterated. “We are people with dreams, families, and hopes for a better future. But the world doesn’t see us that way.”', 'The ceasefire in Lebanon serves for many in Gaza as a reminder of what they long for, and what is seemingly beyond their reach. As displaced Lebanese begin returning to their homes, Gazans are left with little more than the hope that their suffering will one day end. The question that haunts them is a simple one: “Who will stand with us to stop this madness?”', 'Mahmoud Mushtaha is a journalist and human rights activist from Gaza.

I thought I would be the first one there, but I was surprised that the traffic was stifling on the southern road, just like it was when we left for Beirut,” he said.', 'Hussein said he had been working as a painter in and around Tyre, but that the work had dried up about seven months ago, and he had fled with his mother, three children and wife as the fighting in the city intensified. “Our house is badly damaged, but I will return even if I have to set up a tent in front of the house,” he said. “The important thing is that the war is over. We are not afraid, we are the owners of the land, but our material losses are great, and we have many victims and wounded among our extended family, neighbours and villagers.”', 'The United Nations secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said a ceasefire was “the first ray of hope” in the regional conflict after months of escalation. “It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,” he said. The truce afforded a reprieve to the 1.2 million Lebanese citizens displaced by the fighting, and the tens of thousands of Israelis who fled their homes along the border.', 'Under the Lebanon ceasefire terms, Israel will withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon during the 60-day truce, while Hezbollah will move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the border with Israel. The Israeli military cautioned residents of southern Lebanon against moving south of the Litani River from 5pm local time to 7am on Thursday, noting that Israeli forces were still present in the area and that they would deal “firmly” with those who continued to travel.', 'The military also said that Israeli forces had fired at several vehicles carrying what it claimed were “suspects”, to force the vehicles to turn round and prevent them from entering a no-go zone in Lebanese territory. Such isolated incidents were not expected to put the ceasefire at risk, but the chief of the general staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Herzi Halevi, said Israel’s enforcement of the ceasefire would be very determined.', '“Hezbollah operatives who approach our troops, the border area, and the villages within the area we have marked will be struck,” he said. “We are preparing, getting ready for the possibility that this [ceasefire] approach won’t succeed.”', 'The Lebanese health ministry says that nearly 3,800 people have been killed in Lebanon since fighting erupted in the wake of Israel’s retaliatory war in Gaza against Hamas – an ally of Hezbollah, which is also backed by Iran. The vast majority of deaths have occurred as a result of the intensified bombing and ground campaign by Israel that began in September. At least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Israel, in the Golan Heights, and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.', 'Majida Mubarak, 60, cried in front of the rubble of her home in the Sfeir area of Beirut’s southern suburbs.

People are happy because they will be returning to the homes they miss, but we don’t have a home now,” she said.

The conflict forced her to leave her home for the first time, and she was clear about the toll it had taken, even if many were celebrating being able to go home. “The country is almost destroyed, and dozens of our relatives were killed or wounded in the war. We are sad about the loss of so many lives, all of them innocent children, women and young people.”', 'In Israel, the mood was generally subdued, with displaced Israelis concerned that the deal did not go far enough to rein in Hezbollah and that it did not address the conflict in Gaza or what will happen to the hostages still being held there.', '“I think it is still not safe to return to our homes, because Hezbollah is still close to us,” said Eliyahu Maman, an Israeli displaced from the northern city of Kiryat Shmona, which is not far from the border with Lebanon and was hit hard by the months of fighting.', 'The war in Gaza – along with the cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah – was triggered on 7 October last year, when Hamas launched an attack inside Israel. The militant group killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza.', 'In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all of the hostages are freed. Some 100 hostages remain, although about a third of those are believed to be dead. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in the largely devastated Gaza Strip, according to local health officials, while around 90 per cent of the population of around 2.3 million have been forced from their homes.', 'The deal does not address the war in Gaza, where Israeli strikes overnight on two schools being used as shelters in Gaza City killed 11 people, including four children, according to hospital officials.', 'Joe Biden has said the US will make another attempt, along with Middle Eastern countries, to orchestrate a ceasefire in Gaza, involving the release of hostages and the removal of Hamas from government. “Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power,” Mr Biden said on X (formerly Twitter).', 'Many residents of Gaza have said they feel abandoned, with the focus so heavily on Lebanon. “We hope that all Arab and Western countries, and all people with merciful hearts and consciences ... implement a truce here, because we are tired,” displaced Palestinian Malak Abu Laila told reporters.', 'Back in Lebanon, many are unsure what the future holds. Fatima, 33, said she and her family had been “displaced about four times, once from the south to Tyre, then to the [Beirut] suburbs, then to a school in Sanayeh in Beirut”.

ISRAEL'S VICTORY IN LEBANON,https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/israels-victory-lebanon,"['', '', '', '', 'Israel’s Victory in Lebanon', 'By Brian Carter', 'December 2, 2024', ""Israeli operations in Lebanon have defeated Hezbollah and compelled the group to end its involvement in the October 7 War. On November 26, Israel and Hezbollah reached a ceasefire deal that ended Hezbollah's attacks into Israel and required the group to disarm in southern Lebanon.[1] These conditions achieve the stated Israeli war aim of safely returning displaced citizens to their homes in northern Israel. The ceasefire ensures the Israeli right to self-defense against any future threat that Hezbollah may pose as well.[2] Hezbollah, on the other hand, is severely degraded and has failed to achieve its stated war aim of compelling Israel to accept a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.[3] Israel’s victory and Hezbollah’s defeat have drastically changed the security landscape in the Middle East by limiting Hezbollah’s ability to deter Israel. Though Israel has won this round of conflict in Lebanon, Hezbollah will almost certainly begin reconstituting its forces and likely try re-entrenching itself in southern Lebanon at some point. The United States and Israel must ensure that Hezbollah adheres to the ceasefire. If Hezbollah violates the ceasefire, the United States must permit Israel to use force to disrupt Hezbollah's efforts to rebuild its forces and the threat that it poses to Israel."", '', 'Source: Israeli Army Radio[4]', 'Hezbollah entered the war on October 8, 2023—one day after Hamas’ ground attack into Israel. Hezbollah began firing almost daily drone, missile, and rocket attacks targeting towns and military sites in northern Israel.[5] These attacks led thousands of Israeli citizens to evacuate, leaving many of them displaced for over a year.[6] The stated Hezbollah objectives were to fix some Israeli forces along the border and compel Israel to accept a ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.[7] Israel tried to attrit Hezbollah forces along the border in response by conducting intermittent shelling and airstrikes into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah leaders and logistics.', 'Israel eventually decided to conduct major operations into Lebanon in summer 2024 to make Hezbollah unwilling to continue attacks. Israel began this campaign by conducting airstrikes targeting key leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah, and detonating thousands of pagers and hand-held radios belonging to Hezbollah members across Lebanon.[8] These efforts disrupted Hezbollah forces and paralyzed the group temporarily. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) exploited this disruption by launching ground operations against disorganized Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon.[9] The IDF cleared the surrounding border towns in Lebanon and seized key terrain, such as ridgelines from which Hezbollah would fire into northern Israel.', 'These Israeli operations made serious progress toward securing citizens in northern Israel by addressing the most immediate threats that Hezbollah posed. The IDF ground operations disrupted the ability of Hezbollah to fire coordinated, large-scale rocket barrages into northern Israel.[10] The IDF also destroyed key offensive capabilities that Hezbollah had in southern Lebanon, such as tunnels meant to support ground attacks into northern Israel.[11] Hezbollah had long planned for its powerful offensive military unit, the Radwan Force, to use these tunnels to conduct attacks into Israel that would be similar to what Hamas did on October 7, 2023.[12] These ground attacks are part of a concept developed by Iran and its Axis of Resistance to use ground warfare and information operations to destabilize Israel and ultimately erode the viability of an Israeli state.[13]', 'The IDF designed its campaign to facilitate a political settlement rather than to destroy Hezbollah entirely.  Israeli political leadership ordered the IDF to create conditions that would return citizens to northern Israel, which did not imply destroying Hezbollah as a military organization. The Israeli campaign—in line with the orders from Israeli political leadership—severely degraded Hezbollah, destroyed key capabilities in southern Lebanon, and destroyed the willingness of its leaders to continue fighting. That led Hezbollah to accept the ceasefire deal on November 26, despite having failed to achieve its stated objective of forcing an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip. But destroying all of Hezbollah’s ability to attack Israel would have been tantamount to destroying Hezbollah as a military organization, which would require a much greater military effort than what Israeli political leadership ordered the IDF to do. Destroying Hezbollah would have presumably required the IDF to capture Beirut to destroy Hezbollah military and political leadership and destroy the long-range strike capabilities that Hezbollah has deeper in Lebanon. Such an operation would risk destabilizing Lebanon and entail a years-long military commitment.', 'Although Hezbollah can still break the ceasefire and fire into Israel at any time, the strategic threat that it poses to Israel is far diminished. The large Hezbollah rocket and drone barrages in the days before the ceasefire will inevitably draw comparisons between this ground campaign and the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, in which Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets just before Israel agreed to the ceasefire.[14] Hezbollah sought to prove in 2006 that it had won the war and likely aimed to do so again in 2024 by firing rockets at much higher rates leading up to the ceasefire deal.[15] The IDF inflicted far greater damage to Hezbollah in this campaign than it did in 2006, however. The IDF has killed nearly all of the top Hezbollah commanders, degraded the Radwan Force, destroyed kilometers of offensive tunnels, and demonstrated the Israeli ability to rapidly inflict massive casualties upon Hezbollah at relatively little cost.[16]', 'Israel’s victory in Lebanon and its defeat of Hamas drastically improved Israel’s security situation by removing the immediate threats posed by Iranian-backed groups around the Israeli periphery. Israel is thus redefining the security landscape of the Middle East in fundamental ways—at least temporarily.', 'Hezbollah will almost certainly try to reconstitute its forces and very likely with Iranian support, however. Hezbollah therefore still poses a strategic threat to Israel, despite being defeated in this round of conflict. The United States and Israel must ensure that Hezbollah continues to adhere to the ceasefire and does not rearm in southern Lebanon. The United States and Israel will also need to hold the guarantors of the ceasefire accountable. The ceasefire relies on UNIFIL and the Lebanese state to implement many of its provisions, including preventing Hezbollah from rearming. But UNIFIL and the Lebanese state proved unable and unwilling to fulfill this same responsibility after UN Security Council Resolution 1701 ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, raising questions about whether they could enforce the latest ceasefire. Washington must therefore continue to support the Israeli right to use force against Hezbollah efforts to rearm and re-entrench in southern Lebanon. Failing to prevent Hezbollah from rearming will increase the risk of a new war in the years ahead dramatically. And there is no guarantee that a future Israel-Hezbollah war will be as contained and short as this one was.', '[1] https://t.me/moriahdoron/16929; https://t.me/moriahdoron/16912', '[2] https://t.me/moriahdoron/16929; https://t.me/moriahdoron/16912', '[3] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-signals-it-will-cease-fire-when-israel-stops-attacking-gaza-2024-02-29/', '[4] https://t.me/moriahdoron/16929; https://t.me/moriahdoron/16912', '[5] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-lebanon-after-hezbollah-hits-shebaa-farms-2023-10-08/', '[6] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/23/northern-israel-evacuees-hezbollah-war/', '[7] https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-signals-it-will-cease-fire-when-israel-stops-attacking-gaza-2024-02-29/; https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-25-2023', '[8] https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2024/09/pager-attack-increases-pressure-on-hizbullah/; https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-28-september-2024-c4751957433ff944c4eb06027885a973; https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/understanding-israel%E2%80%99s-campaign-defeat-hezbollah-lebanon', '[9] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/understanding-israel%E2%80%99s-campaign-defeat-hezbollah-lebanon', '[10] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/understanding-israel%E2%80%99s-campaign-defeat-hezbollah-lebanon', '[11] https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-unearths-hezbollah-web-tunnels-souther-lebanon-middle-east/', '[12] https://www.aei.org/research-products/one-pager/hamass-view-of-the-october-7-war/', '[13] https://www.aei.org/articles/how-iran-plans-to-destroy-israel/', '[14] https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/we-were-caught-unprepared.pdf ', '[15] https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-november-24-2024', '[16] https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/10/26/israel-demolishes-massive-hezbollah-underground-bunker-in-southern-lebanon/; https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/troops-destroy-tunnels-equipped-for-long-term-stays-in-south-lebanon/; https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-4-2024;  https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-faces-long-recovery-officials-fear-thousands-fighters-lost-israel-2024-11-27/']"
