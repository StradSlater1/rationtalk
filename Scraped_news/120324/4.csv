His trial was scheduled to start on Monday, but these new indictments mean that trial date will likely be rescheduled.', ""According to police, blood found in the bedroom and bathroom matched Mamta's DNA. Police say they believe she was killed in the bedroom and that her body was then dragged into the bathroom. Chief Lugo told WUSA9 they believe she was killed sometime between the night of July 29 and the morning of July 30. He also said he believes her body was dismembered."", '""The forensic unit of Prince William County said it was one of the worst crime scenes they\'ve seen. That was one statement they made to the day that Naresh was arrested,"" said Chief Lugo.', ""The blood that was found was sent off for testing, and last month the DNA results came back showing that it was Mamta's blood."", '""You get the blood, you\'ve got to determine his blood. So, you\'ve got to send it off to the lab first for that and my understanding once they get that returned that it\'s blood, then they send that off for the DNA testing to to occur. They can\'t do it both at the same time,"" said Chief Lugo.', 'He said those results came back last month, but this was the first meeting of the grand jury since those results came in, which is why the new evidence was only presented now.', ""Chief Lugo said those DNA results, are what prompted police to seek an indictment during Monday's grand jury, for first-degree murder. Despite Mamta's body still not being recovered, a grand jury indicted Naresh on two new charges, including first-degree murder. "", 'Mamta Kafle Bhatt, 28, has not been seen since July 29, but her husband did not report her missing until Aug. 5. Chief Lugo has said he does not believe she is alive.', ""During an Aug. 2 welfare check conducted at the Bhatt residence at the request of Mamta's colleagues, Naresh allegedly told police that he was in the process of separating with his wife. Prosecutors say he told officers that Mamta was either in New York or Texas visiting family, but they allege that the 28-year-old nurse has no biological family in the U.S. He also allegedly told police that Mamta had destroyed her phone before leaving."", 'Naresh Bhatt was arrested on Aug. 22 on a single charge of concealing a dead body. Prosecutors said during his arraignment that Naresh Bhatt had sold his Tesla on Aug. 19 and had attempted to sell his home to two people prior to his arrest.', ""RELATED: 'There's more evidence to this case' | Manassas Park Police Chief says they have a lot of evidence in the case against Mamta Kafle Bhatt's husband"", 'Investigators have previously alleged that Naresh Bhatt killed his wife and dragged her body from their Manassas Park home. ', 'On July 30, prosecutors say Naresh Bhatt traveled to a Walmart in Chantilly to purchase three knives, two of which are unaccounted for. The following day he was captured on surveillance video at a different Walmart purchasing cleaning supplies, according to prosecutors.', 'During the bond hearing, prosecutors said that the U.S. Secret Service had offered up evidence that the agency believed was pertinent in the case against Naresh Bhatt. According to prosecutors, in April, Naresh Bhatt allegedly used his work laptop to search, ""How long does it take to get married after spouse die"" and ""What happen to debt died spouse.""', 'Police also shared that his conflicting statements, to police, the media and the public raised red flags.', '""It\'s like very tough,"" Naresh Bhatt, her husband, told WUSA9 in an interview on August 14.', 'WUSA9 asked him when he last saw or spoke to her. He said they ate dinner together on the night of July 31.', '""We ate on the evening of Wednesday. She was the one who cooked and do the kitchen stuff. We do not have any specific conversation. We do not have any argument or something like that,"" Naresh Bhatt.', '""It was like normal day we were taking care of our babies,"" he said.', 'He told WUSA9 he took their baby and went upstairs to go to sleep. He said it was the last time he saw her.', '""She never came to sleep?"" WUSA9\'s Katie Lusso asked him.', '""Yes, she came. I heard like noise or something like that. She came like you know she was doing dishes and stuff like that. I heard that,"" said Naresh Bhatt.', ""But, police say the information he shared with the media and the public, didn't match what he told investigators."", '""We stood back and listened and that was one of the things. We try to see what he was saying to the public and that\'s not what he was telling us was going on,"" said Chief Lugo.', 'RELATED: Everything we know about Naresh Bhatt', ""Despite numerous searches over the course of months, Mamta Kafle Bhatt's body has never been found. "", '""Searches ─ we\'ve done over 10. We\'ve done grid searches ─ searches with K9s,"" said Manassas Park Police Chief Mario Lugo during a previous interview with WUSA9. ""In terms of search warrants and subpoenas, I think we\'re pushing probably 30 that we have submitted and received information on.""', ""On Monday night he shared that to date, they've gotten over 40 warrants.

We\'ve also searched approximately 20 locations throughout Northern Virginia, Prince William County, Manassas, Manassas Park, Fairfax County and Loudoun County and we also went to Paige County,"" explained Chief Lugo.', 'RELATED: Mother and brother of Mamta Kafle Bhatt share their heartbreak following her disappearance', ""One of the last people to hear from Mamta Kafle Bhatt was her mother, who told WUSA9 in November that her daughter would only talk with her about good things, like her work and her 1-year-old little girl. The little girl has been with Mamta's mother and brother since they arrived in the United States."", '""My heart is hurt,"" said Gita Kafle. ""She was a person who was very hardworking, very beautiful very honest. She aspired to be somebody great and she worked really hard and she could be. I don\'t know what to say because I can never forget her but whenever I think about it I have my heartache.""', ""To the family, Chief Lugo shared Monday night that he hopes they understand that they haven't and won't give up on getting Mamta justice."", '""We never gave up. You know, this is a case that, you know, we didn\'t know about Mamta until she disappeared. There\'s a lot of people that knew Mamta and came forward. We\'ve learned a lot in this case about her and what she was dealing with and I want people to know that we were here to get justice for Monta and I think we accomplished that today by getting the first-degree murder charge. That\'s what was our goal from the beginning of this,"" said Chief Lugo.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
