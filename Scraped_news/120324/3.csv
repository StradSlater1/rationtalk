It also alleges that he sexually pursued female staffers, and that the organization ignored another staffer’s alleged sexual misconduct.', 'The report is the latest scrutiny into Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host with no prior government experience, ahead of what’s expected to be a tough Senate confirmation process. It comes on the heels of reports detailing a sexual assault allegation from 2017, which Hegseth has denied and in which no charges were filed.', 'Asked by CNN for comment about the magazine’s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said, “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.” Hegseth’s team had provided The New Yorker with an identical statement.', 'The seven-page whistleblower report was compiled by former employees of Concerned Veterans for America, the advocacy group where Hegseth was president from 2013 to 2016, and sent to its senior management in February 2015, The New Yorker reported.

Hegseth insists that the encounter with the unnamed woman was consensual.', 'Years later, Hegseth paid the accuser in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, his attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN in a statement last month. Parlatore said Hegseth settled because it was during the “Me Too” movement and he didn’t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. The statement did not share how much the accuser was paid as part of the settlement, although Parlatore said it was “a significantly reduced amount.”', 'Hegseth’s alleged conduct toward women came under further scrutiny over the weekend, when The New York Times reported that his mother sent an email to her son in 2018 that sharply criticized his treatment of women.', 'Penelope Hegseth told her son in the email that there are “many” women whom he has “abused in some way” and encouraged him to “get some help,” according to the email published by The Times.', 'According to The Times’ report, Penelope Hegseth wrote, “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”', 'Penelope Hegseth on Friday told The New York Times that she wrote the email “in anger, with emotion” and that she had immediately apologized in a separate email.

It also alleges that he sexually pursued female staffers, and that the organization ignored another staffer’s alleged sexual misconduct.', 'The report is the latest scrutiny into Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host with no prior government experience, ahead of what’s expected to be a tough Senate confirmation process. It comes on the heels of reports detailing a sexual assault allegation from 2017, which Hegseth has denied and in which no charges were filed.', 'Asked by CNN for comment about the magazine’s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said, “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.” Hegseth’s team had provided The New Yorker with an identical statement.', 'The seven-page whistleblower report was compiled by former employees of Concerned Veterans for America, the advocacy group where Hegseth was president from 2013 to 2016, and sent to its senior management in February 2015, The New Yorker reported. The magazine did not name the employees, and CNN has not independently reviewed the report.', 'The report, according to The New Yorker, alleges that Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team — and that the organization ignored a female employee’s allegation that another member of Hegseth’s staff attempted to sexually assault her at that strip club.', 'It claims that his management team “sexually pursued” employees and divided the organization’s female staffers into two groups — “party girls” and “not party girls,” The New Yorker reported.', 'In a separate complaint, which The New Yorker reported was emailed by a different employee to Hegseth’s successor as head of Concerned Veterans for America in late 2015, the employee alleged that while on a work trip to Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Hegseth and someone traveling with the group’s Defend Freedom Tour closed down a hotel bar and yelled multiple times, “Kill all Muslims!”', 'In the letter, the staffer criticized Hegseth’s “despicable behavior” and said it “embarrassed the entire organization.” The staffer also wrote about another incident where Hegseth “passed out” in the back of a party bus and then urinated in front of a hotel where the organization’s team was staying, according to the magazine.', 'The New Yorker reported that when reached for comment, the author of the letter, who was not named by the magazine, said: “If you print that, I will deny I wrote it.”', 'Hegseth’s time running Concerned Veterans for America came after an earlier, controversial tenure leading Vets for Freedom, a nonprofit backed by Republican billionaire megadonors.', 'A former associate of the group, the magazine reported, said the group’s donors became concerned about money being wasted on rumored parties that “could politely be called trysts,” and other inappropriate expenses. With the group mired in more than $500,000 in debt by early 2009, donors chose to wind it down and transfer most of its management to another veterans’ group. Hegseth’s role was reduced, and he ultimately departed years later.', 'Margaret Hoover, a CNN political commentator who was an adviser to Vets for Freedom between 2008 and 2010, told CNN’s Erin Burnett last month that Hegseth ran the organization “very poorly” and lost donors’ confidence. She said the organization had less than 10 employees and a budget of less than $10 million.', '“And he couldn’t do that properly,” Hoover said, raising questions about his ability to lead the Defense Department. “I don’t know how he’s going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years.”', 'CNN previously reported that a woman accused Hegseth of sexually assaulting her in the early morning hours of October 8, 2017, in Monterey, California, where Hegseth had a speaking engagement the night before. The accuser told police that Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone and then sexually assaulted her.', 'The Monterey County district attorney told CNN last month said that her office declined to file charges against Hegseth in January 2018 because “no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” She declined to comment further. Hegseth insists that the encounter with the unnamed woman was consensual.', 'Years later, Hegseth paid the accuser in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, his attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN in a statement last month. Parlatore said Hegseth settled because it was during the “Me Too” movement and he didn’t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. The statement did not share how much the accuser was paid as part of the settlement, although Parlatore said it was “a significantly reduced amount.”', 'Hegseth’s alleged conduct toward women came under further scrutiny over the weekend, when The New York Times reported that his mother sent an email to her son in 2018 that sharply criticized his treatment of women.', 'Penelope Hegseth told her son in the email that there are “many” women whom he has “abused in some way” and encouraged him to “get some help,” according to the email published by The Times.', 'According to The Times’ report, Penelope Hegseth wrote, “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”', 'Penelope Hegseth on Friday told The New York Times that she wrote the email “in anger, with emotion” and that she had immediately apologized in a separate email. She went on to defend her son, saying her own characterization of his treatment of women in the 2018 email “has never been true.”', 'CNN’s Alayna Treene contributed to this report.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Kill All Muslims!” at a Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, bar early on May 29, 2015, while on official business in the state.', 'Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth’s lawyer, told The New Yorker that “an advisor” to Hegseth was not “going to comment on outlandish claims” laundered through the publication “by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.

The Secretary of Defense is involved in every issue of national security. He’s involved in the use of nuclear weapons. He’s the one who approves sending troops into combat. He approves drone strikes that may involve civilian casualties. Literally life-and-death issues are in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, and entrusting these kinds of issues to someone who might be incapacitated for any reason is a risk we cannot take.”', 'Hegseth also reportedly drove the organization Vets for Freedom (VFF) into the ground financially.', 'In 2007, he became president of the group, which advocated for expanding the war in Iraq and was funded by several Republican billionaire donors.

Hegseth Cabinet Nomination: Defense Secretary Nominee Accused Of Rampant Drunken Behavior While Heading Veterans Nonprofits,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/12/02/hegseth-cabinet-nomination-defense-secretary-nominee-accused-of-rampant-drunken-behavior-while-heading-veterans-nonprofits/,"['President-elect Donald Trump’s Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth was forced to step down from the head of two nonprofit veterans groups he ran amid allegations of repeated drunken public behavior in front of staff, the New Yorker reported—the latest allegations against Hegseth that could threaten his confirmation in the Senate.', 'Pete Hegseth, former host of Fox & Friends, at the National Council of Young Israel Gala in New York ... [+]', 'December 2While serving as president of Concerned Veterans for America in 2014, Hegseth brought staff to a Louisiana strip club and had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage, according to a seven-page whistleblower report obtained by The New Yorker, and on another work trip, to Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, in May 2015, Hegseth drunkenly yelled “Kill All Muslims” while he was out partying late at a hotel bar, The New Yorker reported, citing a letter from a fellow staffer to a superior at the organization.', 'Hegseth, who was married to his second wife while serving as president of the organization between 2013 and 2015, regularly tried to “‘hook up’ with women on the road,” according to an email one of the whistleblowers sent to a higher up that was obtained by The New Yorker (Hegseth’s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, provided the magazine with a statement from “an advisor” to Hegseth that called the claims “outlandish” and stemming from “a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate”).', 'November 29In 2018, Hegseth’s mother, Penelope Hegseth, asked her son to “get some help and take an honest look at yourself” after “all the women (and I know it’s many) you have abused in some way” by being a man that “belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,” according to an email obtained by the New York Times, though she told the outlet she immediately apologized for the accusation, which she said was written “in anger, with emotion.”', 'November 25Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., was noncommittal about Hegseth’s nomination, telling NBC News the allegations he sexually assaulted a woman in a Monterey, Calif., hotel in 2017 were “a pretty big problem, given that we have . . . a sexual assault problem in our military,” adding the accusations demonstrate the need for background checks, and telling the network, “I’m not going to pre-judge him, but yeah, it’s a pretty concerning accusation.”', 'November 25The Guardian reported onew details from Hegseth’s 2020 book, “American Crusade,” in which he criticizes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations, calling the UN a “fully globalist organization that aggressively advances an anti-American, anti-Israel and anti-freedom agenda,” while claiming NATO is a “relic and should be scrapped and remade,” questioning why “Islamist Turkey” is a member.', 'November 24Despite the controversies surrounding Hegseth, a total of 33% of Americans polled by CBS/YouGov said he was a good choice for Defense secretary, while 28% said he’s not a good pick and 39% said they haven’t heard enough about him.', 'November 20New details from the 2017 assault allegations emerged in a police report: Hegseth’s accuser told police in Monterey, Calif., she was at an afterparty for a conference of the California Federation of Republican Women, where Hegseth was a speaker, when she confronted Hegseth about his allegedly inappropriate behavior with other women at the conference, then ended up in a hotel room with him where she remembers him hovering over her shirtless and ejaculating on her stomach.', 'The woman, identified as “Jane Doe” in the report, told police she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot” when she was with Hegseth in his room and that Hegseth “took her phone from her hands” then “blocked the door with his body” when she tried to leave, according to the report.', 'Hegseth, who told police the two had consensual sex that night, according to the document, responding directly to the allegations for the first time, told reporters at the Capitol “as far as the media’s concerned, it’s very simple, the matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared, and that’s where I’m going to leave it” when asked by a reporter if he sexually assaulted a woman in Monterey.', 'November 19At least one other Republican senator, Joni Ernst of Iowa—a member of the Senate Armed Services committee who has openly criticized the military’s handling of sexual assault allegations—expressed reservations about Hegseth, telling Politico the claims are worthy of a “discussion,” adding, “any time there are allegations, you want to make sure they are properly vetted.”', 'Hegseth, or any cabinet nominee that requires Senate approval, can afford to lose only three Republican votes to be confirmed for the job as the GOP will hold a slim 53-47 majority beginning next year. Other GOP senators have expressed support for Hegseth, including Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who told Politico after meeting with him that he is a “strong nominee” who “pledged that the Pentagon will focus on strength and hard power—not the current administration’s woke political agenda.”', 'PROMOTED', 'The sexual assault allegations first surfaced in a memo sent to Trump’s transition team from a woman who said she was friends with the accuser. The memo was obtained by multiple news outlets several days after Hegseth was nominated by Trump on Nov. 12.', 'Hegseth has firmly denied the allegations through his lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, who said Hegseth paid the woman a settlement in 2020 as part of a nondisclosure agreement. Parlatore said Hegseth entered into the agreement when he learned the woman and her husband hired a lawyer and told other people she planned to file a lawsuit against him. Hegseth told police he was intoxicated that night and did not know why the accuser returned to his hotel room with him, but that they had consensual sex, according to the police report. He said the woman, who was staying at the hotel with her husband, “showed early signs of regret” the next morning, and he assured her that he would not tell anyone about the encounter, the report states.', 'No. Police recommended the case to the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office for review, but charges were never filed.', 'Hegseth—who served in the National Guard—has intensely criticized military leadership, castigating their handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. He has also drawn controversy for criticizing diversity initiatives within the military, and calling for the dismissal of military leaders he believes are connected to “woke” policies. He has publicly and privately advocated for members of the military accused of war crimes. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported Hegseth wrote in his 2020 book “American Crusade” that if President Joe Biden won the election, the military and police would be “forced to make a choice” and that there would be “some form of civil war.” Trump has previously suggested he would use the military to go after domestic political opponents, which he described as “the enemy from within.”', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', 'In his 2024 “The War on Warriors,” recapped by The Guardian, Hegseth wrote that only men should serve in combat roles. “If we’re going to send our boys to fight—and it should be boys—we need to unleash them to win,” he wrote, adding they need “to be the most ruthless” and “the most uncompromising. The most overwhelmingly lethal as they can be.” Hegseth reiterated his stance in a recent podcast, telling host Shawn Ryan on Nov. 7 “I’m straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn’t made us more effective.”', 'Trump called Hegseth a “warrior” and “a true believer in America First” in a statement announcing the nomination on Nov. 12. The statement touts his service in the Army National Guard and his deployments to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan, along with his eight years as a Fox News host. A spokesperson for Trump’s transition team told the Associated Press in response to the police report being made public that it “corroborates what Mr. Hegseth’s attorneys have said all along: the incident was fully investigated and no charges were filed because police found the allegations to be false.” The police report does not say whether officials made a determination about the allegations.', 'New Sexual Assault Allegation Details Against Pete Hegseth Emerge: Here’s What To Know As Trump Defends Defense Secretary Nominee (Forbes)', 'Police Report Details 2017 Sexual Assault Allegation Against Pete Hegseth (Forbes)', 'Trump’s Defense Secretary Pick Pete Hegseth Named In 2017 Sexual Assault Probe (Forbes)', ""Sara Dorn is a Forbes news reporter who covers politics, with a focus on elections and Capitol Hill.

A lawyer for Hegseth dismissed the allegations as “outlandish claims” and attributed them to “a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate.”', 'Hegseth’s potential nomination was already facing questions about a woman who alleged he sexually assaulted her in a hotel room after an event in 2017. He denies her claims and says the incident was consensual.', 'A whistleblower report about Hegseth’s time leading Concerned Veterans for America from 2013 to 2016, The New Yorker wrote, said he was repeatedly drunk while on the clock, sometimes needing to be carried out of official events.', 'It further alleged that Hegseth, who was married to his second wife at the time, and other members of the group’s management team sexually pursued their female employees, informally dividing them into two camps they described as “party girls” and “not party girls.”', 'The whistleblower report claims that while Hegseth was its leader, the organization ignored staff’s concerns about the workplace, including an allegation by an employee that another staffer tried to sexually assault her at a Louisiana strip club. She was paid a settlement and signed an NDA, but the report says she experienced reprisal in the workplace thereafter, encouraging a toxic environment.', 'The alleged victim of the attempted assault also separately had to restrain Hegseth at one point in the strip club because “he was so drunk he tried to get on the stage and dance with the strippers,” the whistleblower complaint reportedly says.', 'Another female staffer, The New Yorker wrote, was said to have been sexually harassed by a colleague, but was afraid to make a complaint “because she desperately needs her job.”', 'The report was compiled by multiple former employees and sent to the group’s senior management in 2015.', 'A separate letter of complaint sent to Concerned Veterans for America in 2015, and which The New Yorker also reported on, reveals a shocking picture of Hegseth at his alleged surly, drunken worst: while at a bar in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, in May 2015, on an official visit with the organization, he allegedly chanted “Kill All Muslims! Kill All Muslims!” while visibly intoxicated.', 'The report details several incidents where staff said they had to remove or carry a drunken Hegseth, so inebriated he couldn’t walk and in some cases passed out, from events.', 'Hegseth resigned from Concerned Veterans for America under pressure in 2016, The New Yorker said, citing three sources aware of the circumstances, including one who contributed to the whistleblower report.', '“I’ve seen him drunk so many times,” one of the contributors to the report told The New Yorker. “I’ve seen him dragged away not a few times but multiple times.

According to the previously undisclosed report, which was compiled by several CVA employees and sent to the group’s management in 2015, Hegseth’s repeated drunken behavior had become an embarrassment to the rest of the staff.', 'On top of that, he used his position to essentially prey on young female staffers, dividing them into two groups — the “party girls” and the “not party girls.” The whistleblower report further claimed that CVA had become a hostile workplace, especially for women, with allegations that attempted sexual assaults and harassment had largely been ignored.', 'Meanwhile, in a separate letter of complaint to CVA management, one former employee “described Hegseth being at a bar in the early-morning hours of May 29, 2015, while on an official tour through Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, drunkenly chanting ‘Kill All Muslims! Kill All Muslims!’”', 'While much of the article centers on Hegseth’s boorish behavior and intoxication while leading CVA and a small nonprofit called Vets for Freedom, which has been described as an “AsroTurf” group backed by conservative billionaires, it also highlighted allegations that Hegseth grossly mismanaged the finances of both organizations.', '“V.F.F. soon ran up enormous debt, and financial records indicate that, by the end of 2008, it was unable to pay its creditors,” Mayer noted. “The group’s primary donors became concerned that their money was being wasted on inappropriate expenses, including rumors of parties that ‘could politely be called trysts,’ as the former associate of the group put it. The early sympathizer said, ‘I was not the first to hear that there was money sloshing around and sexually inappropriate behavior in the workplace.’”', 'Eventually, Hegseth was phased out as head of VFF after he admitted to donors in 2009 that the group had only $1,000 in the bank but owed $434,833 in unpaid bills. It was Hegseth’s poor management of the organization that led some of the group’s former advisers to express “grave concerns” about his ability to lead a department as large as the Pentagon.', '“I watched him run an organization very poorly, lose the confidence of donors,” conservative political commentator and ex-VFF advisor Margaret Hoover told CNN recently. “The organization ultimately folded and was forced to merge with another organization who individuals felt could run and manage funds on behalf of donors more responsibly than he could. That was my experience with him.”', 'The whistleblower report about Hegseth’s tenure at CVA, meanwhile, alleges that Hegseth was repeatedly intoxicated at many of the organization’s official events. “I’ve seen him drunk so many times. I’ve seen him dragged away not a few times but multiple times. To have him at the Pentagon would be scary,” one of the whistleblowers told the New Yorker, adding: “When those of us who worked at C.V.A. heard he was being considered for SecDef, it wasn’t ‘No,’ it was ‘Hell No!’”', 'While the complaint notes that CVA eventually instituted a “no alcohol” policy at its events in October 2014 due to the public behavior of Hegseth and other managers, Hegseth lifted the policy the following month. The night before the midterm elections that year, he got so inebriated while out with three young female staffers that it took two male staff members to carry him up into a hotel room after he was “completely passed out” in a van and “slumped over” a female employee.', 'Later that month, during a trip to Louisiana to assist with a Senate runoff race, Hegseth took his team to a strip club, where according to the report “he was so drunk he tried to get on the stage and dance with the strippers.”', 'A female staffer who helped restrain Hegseth at the strip club, meanwhile, alleged in the report that another male staff member tried to sexually assault her that night. She claimed that her CVA manager was dismissive and argued the male staffer wasn’t responsible for his actions due to his drunkenness. The report states that she eventually received a settlement after filing a formal complaint and hiring outside counsel.', 'According to the New Yorker, Hegseth ultimately resigned in 2016 under pressure from his post as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America.', 'As for the allegation that Hegseth sexually assaulted a woman at a California hotel in 2017, eventually resulting in him secretly paying off the accuser in 2020 to avoid a lawsuit, Hegseth and his lawyer Tim Parlatore told Mayer that “sources” told him the Monterrey police didn’t charge Hegseth because they learned “his accuser had previously brought a false rape charge against someone else, thus undermining her credibility.”', 'According to Mayer, though, the Monterey County District Attorney’s office told her Parlatore’s “claim is spurious” and that the “office had no such evidence” about additional false sexual assault charges levied by the accuser.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

In the email, Penelope wrote, “Sam is a good mother and a good person (under the circumstances that you created) and I know deep down you know that. For you to try to label her as ‘unstable’ for your own advantage is despicable and abusive. Is there any sense of decency left in you?

It’s physically, mentally and emotionally very difficult to go through that process, as I have,” Marshall said. “Somebody doesn’t go into the hospital and subject herself to that. And I have to say, I, as a woman and as a victim, I believe the victims, and this is a problem for me. ... And then on top of that, although Pete has an incredible military career, he doesn’t have the leadership career in the military that I feel the Department of Defense requires as their head.”', 'By contrast, Sen.

Pete Hegseth’s Secret History,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history,"['A whistle-blower report and other documents suggest that Trump’s nominee to run the Pentagon was forced out of previous leadership positions for financial mismanagement, sexist behavior, and being repeatedly intoxicated on the job.', 'After the recent revelation that Pete Hegseth had secretly paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of raping her in 2017, President-elect Donald Trump stood by his choice of Hegseth to become the next Secretary of Defense. Trump’s communications director, Steven Cheung, issued a statement noting that Hegseth, who has denied wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crime. “President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his administration,” Cheung maintained.', 'But Hegseth’s record before becoming a full-time Fox News TV host, in 2017, raises additional questions about his suitability to run the world’s largest and most lethal military force. A trail of documents, corroborated by the accounts of former colleagues, indicates that Hegseth was forced to step down by both of the two nonprofit advocacy groups that he ran—Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America—in the face of serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct.', 'A previously undisclosed whistle-blower report on Hegseth’s tenure as the president of Concerned Veterans for America, from 2013 until 2016, describes him as being repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity—to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization’s events. The detailed seven-page report—which was compiled by multiple former C.V.A. employees and sent to the organization’s senior management in February, 2015—states that, at one point, Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he had brought his team. The report also says that Hegseth, who was married at the time, and other members of his management team sexually pursued the organization’s female staffers, whom they divided into two groups—the “party girls” and the “not party girls.” In addition, the report asserts that, under Hegseth’s leadership, the organization became a hostile workplace that ignored serious accusations of impropriety, including an allegation made by a female employee that another employee on Hegseth’s staff had attempted to sexually assault her at the Louisiana strip club. In a separate letter of complaint, which was sent to the organization in late 2015, a different former employee described Hegseth being at a bar in the early-morning hours of May 29, 2015, while on an official tour through Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, drunkenly chanting “Kill All Muslims! Kill All Muslims!”', 'In response to questions from this magazine, Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Hegseth, replied with the following statement, which he said came from “an advisor” to Hegseth: “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through The New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.”', 'Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, described the report of Hegseth’s drinking as alarming and disqualifying. In a phone interview, Blumenthal, who currently leads the Senate committee that will review Hegseth’s nomination, told me, “Much as we might be sympathetic to people with continuing alcohol problems, they shouldn’t be at the top of our national-security structure.” Blumenthal went on, “It’s dangerous. The Secretary of Defense is involved in every issue of national security. He’s involved in the use of nuclear weapons. He’s the one who approves sending troops into combat. He approves drone strikes that may involve civilian casualties. Literally life-and-death issues are in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, and entrusting these kinds of issues to someone who might be incapacitated for any reason is a risk we cannot take.”', 'Blumenthal noted that an earlier nominee for Secretary of Defense, Senator John Tower, a Republican from Texas, was voted down by his Senate colleagues in 1989 because of concerns about his drinking and womanizing. It was the first time that the Cabinet pick of a newly elected President, in this case George H. W. Bush, was rejected by the Senate. “John Tower went down for these same kinds of issues,” Blumenthal said. “I don’t think it’s a partisan issue.”', 'In January, 2016, Hegseth resigned from Concerned Veterans for America, under pressure. An account in the Military Times said that Hegseth had “quietly resigned,” in a decision that was “mutual” with the organization, amid “rumors of a rift between the former C.E.O. and the group’s financial backers.” Hegseth, who had no other job lined up at the time, gave no explanation for his departure, other than saying, “Sometimes it just makes sense to make a transition.” C.V.A., for its part, released a statement saying that it thanked Hegseth “for his many contributions” and wished him well. But, according to three knowledgeable sources, one of whom contributed to the whistle-blower report, Hegseth was forced to step down from the organization in part because of concerns about his mismanagement and abuse of alcohol on the job.', '“Congratulations on Removing Pete Hegseth” is the subject line of an e-mail, obtained by The New Yorker, that was sent to Hegseth’s successor as president of the group, Jae Pak, on January 15, 2016. The e-mail, sent under a pseudonym by one of the whistle-blowers, included a copy of the report, and went on to say, “Among the staff, the disgust for Pete was pretty high. Most veterans do not think he represents them nor their high standard of excellence.” The e-mail also stated that Hegseth had “a history of alcohol abuse” and had “treated the organization funds like they were a personal expense account—for partying, drinking, and using CVA events as little more than opportunities to ‘hook up’ with women on the road.”', 'Pak, who had served as C.V.A.’s chief operating officer before taking over its presidency, and who no longer works there, declined to comment. A spokesman at Americans for Prosperity, the umbrella political group run by the far-right billionaire Koch family—under whose auspices Concerned Veterans for America was launched, in 2011—confirmed that Hegseth had resigned but declined to comment further on personnel matters. Breitbart News, a publication that acts as a publicist for Trump, attempted to discredit this article before it was published by claiming that it would be citing a “screed” about Hegseth written by a “jealous former coworker” who had been “fired.” In fact, the report disclosed in this article is not the same document, although there are some overlaps. (Nearly a dozen employees were laid off by C.V.A. during the time Hegseth worked there, and the proliferation of critical memos and letters to the group’s management speaks to the high level of discontent within the organization.)', 'The whistle-blower report makes extensive allegations. It describes several top managers being involved in drunken episodes, including an altercation at a casino and a hotel Christmas party at which food was thrown from the balcony. Hegseth, it says, was “seen drunk at multiple CVA events” between 2013 and 2015, a time when the organization was engaged in an ambitious nationwide effort to mobilize veterans to vote for conservative candidates and causes. The project gave Hegseth and his team the opportunity to travel far from the organization’s headquarters, in northern Virginia. Hegseth and his team gave speeches, assisted conservative campaigns, and collected voter data valuable for the Kochs’ political operation. As a decorated veteran who by 2014 had become an on-air contributor to Fox News, Hegseth was the public face of the group’s mission, conducting a whistle-stop tour with his team from city to city, packaged by C.V.A. as the Defend Freedom Tour.', 'I spoke at length with two people who identified themselves as having contributed to the whistle-blower report. One of them said of Hegseth, “I’ve seen him drunk so many times. I’ve seen him dragged away not a few times but multiple times. To have him at the Pentagon would be scary,” adding, “When those of us who worked at C.V.A. heard he was being considered for SecDef, it wasn’t ‘No,’ it was ‘Hell No!’ ” According to the complaint, at one such C.V.A. event in Virginia Beach, on Memorial Day weekend in 2014, Hegseth was “totally sloshed” and needed to be carried to his room because “he was so intoxicated.” The following month, during an event in Cleveland, Hegseth, who had gone with his team to a bar around the corner from their hotel, was described as “completely drunk in a public place.” According to the report, “several high profile people” who attended the organization’s event “were very disappointed to see this kind of public behavior,” though the report does not identify them.', 'In October, 2014, C.V.A. instituted a “no alcohol” policy at its events. But the next month, according to the report, Hegseth and another manager lifted the policy while overseeing a get-out-the-vote field operation to boost Republican candidates in North Carolina. According to the report, on the evening before the election, Hegseth, who had been out with three young female staff members, was so inebriated by 1 a.m. that a staffer who had driven him to his hotel, in a van full of other drunken staffers, asked for assistance to get Hegseth to his room. “Pete was completely passed out in the middle seat, slumped over” a young female staff member, the report says. It took two male staff members to get Hegseth into the hotel; after one young woman vomited in some bushes, another helped him into bed. In the morning, a team member had to wake Hegseth so that he didn’t miss his flight. “All of this happened in public,” according to the report, while C.V.A. was “embedded” in the Republican get-out-the-vote effort. It went on, “Everyone who saw this was disgusted and in shock that the head of the team was that intoxicated.”', 'According to the report, a volunteer for the organization during this period was so concerned about the rampant promiscuity and sexism that she sent an e-mail to C.V.A.’s headquarters complaining about a lack of professionalism, an unhealthy workplace, and an atmosphere in which women were unfairly treated. According to the whistle-blower with whom I spoke, the volunteer received no response. The New Yorker was unable to reach the volunteer, but a source unconnected to C.V.A. confirmed that the volunteer had also spoken to him about having sent an e-mail to the group’s top management because she had been upset by Hegseth’s frequent drunkenness.', 'In late November, 2014, Hegseth and his team deployed to Louisiana for a U.S. Senate runoff. This is when, according to the whistle-blower complaint, Hegseth took the C.V.A. team to the strip club, where “he was so drunk he tried to get on the stage and dance with the strippers.” A female C.V.A. associate, the report says, “had to get him off of the stage,” adding, “She had to intervene with security to prevent him from getting thrown out.” The whistle-blower continued, as if in disbelief, “A Fox News contributor, with the rank of captain (at the time) in the National Guard, and the CEO of a veterans’ organization . . . was in a strip club trying to dance with strippers.”', 'Meanwhile, the female staffer who had to restrain Hegseth at the strip club alleged that a different male staff member had attempted to sexually assault her there, according to the report. A C.V.A. manager, however, was described as dismissive, for arguing that her attacker had been drunk and therefore shouldn’t be held responsible. According to the report, the female staffer took steps to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and C.V.A. hired outside counsel. The female staffer declined to be interviewed. But, according to a source aware of the case, the matter was settled with a payment to the staffer, concealed by a nondisclosure agreement. As a result, the woman was “ostracized” and “experiencing reprisal” by the organization, which, the whistle-blower report said, “has become a hostile and intimidating working environment.” Another female staff member was also described as having been sexually harassed by a colleague, but was too intimidated to come forward “because she desperately needs her job.” The report declared, in bold print, “Fear of reprisal looms over every woman associated with the organization.”', 'In December, 2014, the group held an office Christmas party at the Grand Hyatt in Washington. Once again, according to the report, Hegseth was “noticeably intoxicated and had to be carried up to his room.” The report stated, “His behavior was embarrassing in front of the team, but not surprising; people have simply come to expect Pete to get drunk at social events.”', 'The 2015 federal tax filing by C.V.A. has an unusual note saying that “major programs developed in the last fiscal year were paused,” and it describes Hegseth as “President (outgoing).” By the start of 2016, Hegseth, who had been paid a salary of $177,460, was out of his job.', 'A separate letter obtained by The New Yorker, which was e-mailed by a different staffer on November, 2015, to Pak, Hegseth’s successor, expresses the upset that Hegseth’s behavior caused. “The organization is owed the truth,” the staffer wrote before he described two incidents that, he said, “change my perception of Mr. Pete Hegseth,” especially “as the face of C.V.A.” He went on to recount what took place in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. On May 29, 2015, the staffer said, Hegseth and someone travelling with the group’s Defend Freedom Tour closed down the bar at the Sheraton Suites Hotel. The duo yelled “Kill All Muslims” multiple times, in what the staffer described as “a drunk and a violent manner.” Hegseth’s “despicable behavior,” he wrote, “embarrassed the entire organization.” He went on, “I personally was ashamed and . . . others were as well.” The staffer’s letter cited a second incident in which, he wrote, Hegseth “passed out” in the back of a party bus, then urinated in front of a hotel where C.V.A.’s team was staying. “I tell you this because it’s the truth,” the letter concluded. “And I sincerely care about the mission of C.VA and the future of my kids and the country.”', 'Reached for comment, the author of the letter said, “If you print that, I will deny I wrote it.” When he was reminded that it had been sent from the same personal e-mail account that he still uses, he said, “I don’t care. I’ll just say it never happened.”', 'Hegseth has been open about resorting to alcohol during a period in his life when he had returned to the U.S. from active military duty and felt lost. In a 2022 interview with the Reserve & National Guard Magazine, he said that, after coming home, he felt isolated and unmoored.', 'Raised in Minnesota, Hegseth signed up for the Army R.O.T.C. in 2001 while attending Princeton, where he majored in politics and published the Princeton Tory, a pugnacious conservative journal that lambasted liberalism on campus. He published a commentary by another student mocking the view, expressed during the school’s orientation program, that sex with an unconscious partner constituted rape. As first reported online by the newsletter “Popular Information,” run by Judd Legum, the commentary claimed that rape required both a failure to consent and “duress,” which a passed-out woman couldn’t experience.', 'After graduating, in 2003, Hegseth worked briefly on Wall Street, as an equity-markets analyst at Bear Stearns. In 2004, he was deployed for a year to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where he oversaw a platoon of soldiers from New Jersey guarding detainees. Soon after returning, and still with the National Guard, he volunteered to serve in Iraq, for which the Army awarded him the first of two Bronze Stars for meritorious service. Afterward, he moved to New York, a transition that he has acknowledged was “jarring.” He told Reserve & National Guard Magazine, “I went from being in a combat zone to being in an apartment in Manhattan and without any contact other than phone calls here or an email here or there with the guys who I had served with.” He said, “I didn’t do much and I drank a lot trying to process what I had been through while dealing with a civilian world that frankly just didn’t seem to care.”', 'Advocating for veterans gave him a renewed sense of purpose, he said. In New York, he met a marine who was working for a small nonprofit organization called Vets for Freedom, which advocated for expanding the war in Iraq. In an interview, one early conservative sympathizer with the group described it to me as essentially an “AstroTurf” organization that had been devised by a handful of big-time political players to look like it was a grassroots veterans’ movement. Hegseth once told a former associate that V.F.F.’s donors included three Republican billionaires who have since passed away: Bernard Marcus, the Home Depot magnate; Jerry Perenchio, the former head of Univision; and Harold Simmons, a Texas entrepreneur.', 'Hegseth appealed to the backers, the early sympathizer told me: he was a handsome, articulate Princeton graduate who had served honorably in the military, and, at the time, he believed ardently in the surge in America’s war in Iraq. By 2007, Hegseth had become the organization’s leader. “I had no idea what I was doing,” he told the National Guard publication. “I didn’t know if it would work.”', 'In fact, under his leadership, V.F.F. soon ran up enormous debt, and financial records indicate that, by the end of 2008, it was unable to pay its creditors. The group’s primary donors became concerned that their money was being wasted on inappropriate expenses; there were rumors of parties that “could politely be called trysts,” as the former associate of the group put it. The early sympathizer said, “I was not the first to hear that there was money sloshing around and sexually inappropriate behavior in the workplace.”', 'In 2004, Hegseth had married his first of three wives, his high-school girlfriend from Minnesota, Meredith Schwarz. But he often lived apart from her while working in Washington, staying at a pool house owned by the parents of one of her college friends. In 2008, Schwarz filed for divorce after Hegseth admitted to multiple infidelities—his wife later learned that a journalist he’d introduced her to was among those with whom he was having an affair. The couple divorced in 2009.', 'Meanwhile, the finances of V.F.F. grew so dire that the group’s donors hatched a plan to take control away from Hegseth. The donors’ representatives hired a forensic accountant to review the books. The findings were appalling. In January, 2009, Hegseth sent a letter to the donors admitting that, as of that day, the group had less than a thousand dollars in the bank and $434,833 in unpaid bills. The group also had run up credit-card debts of as much as seventy-five thousand dollars. Hegseth said that he took full responsibility for the mess, but added that, unless the donors gave him more funds, V.F.F. would have to file for bankruptcy and close down.', 'One of the group’s backers initially agreed to Hegseth’s request. But, according to the early sympathizer, the donors decided, “Let’s shut this thing down. Pete can get another job.” The donors, who were strong supporters of America’s military role in Iraq and Afghanistan, arranged for another veterans’ group, Military Families United, which represented Gold Star families, to merge with V.F.F. and take over most of its management. “We tried to castrate him,” Hegseth’s former associate admitted. “It was a handoff.” Annual federal tax filings for V.F.F. show the group’s coffers draining and Hegseth’s compensation dwindling. In 2010, the records show, Hegseth was identified as the group’s “Executive Director/President” and was paid forty-five thousand dollars for thirty hours of work a week. The next year, he was identified as the group’s “officer,” and paid a salary of five thousand dollars for thirty minutes of work a week. In 2012, the tax filing again identified him as the group’s “officer,” and his compensation rose to eight thousand dollars, but the total grants received by the group that year totalled a mere eighty-one dollars.', 'Margaret Hoover, a Republican political commentator and political strategist who worked as an adviser to V.F.F. between 2008 and 2010, recently told CNN that she had grave concerns about Hegseth’s ability to run the Pentagon, the largest department in the federal government, given his mismanagement at V.F.F. “I watched him run an organization very poorly, lose the confidence of donors. The organization ultimately folded and was forced to merge with another organization who individuals felt could run and manage funds on behalf of donors more responsibly than he could. That was my experience with him.” Hoover stressed that V.F.F. was an exceedingly small organization, with fewer than ten employees, and a budget of between five million and ten million dollars. She told CNN, “And he couldn’t do that properly—I don’t know how he’s going to run an organization with an eight-hundred-and-fifty-seven-billion-dollar budget and three million individuals.”', 'By 2012, Hegseth had departed from what remained of V.F.F., and had launched an abortive bid for the Senate from Minnesota, where he was a captain in the state’s National Guard. He then volunteered for another tour of active duty, this time in Afghanistan, to train Afghan security forces. Upon completing his tour of duty, he was promoted to the rank of major. In 2012, Hegseth formed a political-action committee, MN pac, to help like-minded candidates, but, according to a report by American Public Media, a third of the funds in Hegseth’s pac was spent on parties for his family and friends, and less than half was spent on candidates.', 'In 2014, Hegseth joined Fox News, as a contributor. By then, he also was the C.E.O. of the Kochs’ Concerned Veterans for America group. But by 2016 Hegseth had been forced to step aside from the organization. “There’s a long pattern, over more than a decade, of malfeasance, financial mismanagement, and sexual impropriety,” Hegseth’s former associate told me. “There’s a fair dose of bullying and misinformation, too.”', 'It was as a celebrated veteran and weekend Fox News contributor that Hegseth appeared in October, 2017, as a dinner speaker at the California Federation of Republican Women’s fortieth biennial convention, in Monterey, California. His personal life was in tumult. In 2010, he had married a second time, to Samantha Deering, a co-worker at Vets for Freedom. He admitted in an essay that year that he had fathered a child “out of wedlock” before marrying her, the Times reported. Then, in August, 2017, while still married to Deering, he fathered a daughter with another woman, a producer at Fox, Jennifer Rauchet, whom he eventually married, in 2019. As he and Deering wrangled their way through a difficult divorce, as the Times first reported, his mother, Penelope Hegseth, sent him an e-mail excoriating him as “an abuser of women” who “belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego.” She admonished him, “Get some help and take an honest look at yourself.” (A Trump spokesman denounced the newspaper’s publication of the e-mail as “despicable” and noted that Hegseth’s mother had apologized to him for writing it.)', 'A former colleague of Hegseth’s at Fox recalled of him, “He had a kind of what-happens-in-Vegas-stays-in-Vegas kind of attitude, while his wife and kids were in Minnesota.” The colleague added, “He was a huge drinker. I can’t say if he had a problem, but he was very handsy with women, too. I’ve certainly seen him drunk.”', 'Following his dinner speech at the convention, according to a report released by the Monterey Police Department, Hegseth and other attendees moved to an after-party, and then on to a sports bar in the hotel. There, the woman who would become Hegseth’s alleged sexual-assault victim—a then thirty-year-old organizer working with the Republican Women’s group—tried to intervene when she thought that Hegseth had become pushy toward a female attendee at the conference. He had allegedly touched the other woman’s legs and tried to get her to come to his hotel room, the police report recounts. The female attendee told police investigators that she had sent distress signals to “Jane Doe”—as the alleged victim is called in the police report—in hopes of getting her to act as what she called a “crotch blocker.” One onlooker told police that she thought both women had been flirting with Hegseth. But a friend of the woman who had signalled for Jane Doe’s assistance confirmed her account, saying that her friend had told her that Hegseth’s advances had been unwanted.', 'A bit later, around 1 a.m., the hotel’s video-surveillance footage captured Jane Doe escorting Hegseth away from the bar, walking arm in arm. Soon afterward, according to a hotel employee’s statement to the police, the two engaged in a loud argument by the pool. The employee said that two separate guests had called to report the disturbance, and described Hegseth as “very intoxicated,” saying that he cursed at the employee when he approached them. Hegseth argued that he had freedom of speech. The alleged victim, who told police that she had drunk more than usual that day, but who had appeared “not intoxicated” to the hotel employee, apologized for Hegseth’s behavior to the employee, and told him that they were both Republicans. She then guided Hegseth toward his hotel room. Later, she told the police that they’d been arguing over what she regarded as Hegseth’s inappropriate treatment of women.', 'What happened next is disputed. Text messages from the alleged victim to her husband—who had accompanied her to the conference and was staying at the hotel, along with their two young children—suggest that she was less than enamored of Hegseth. According to the police report, she texted that he was “giving off a ‘creeper’ vibe” and made fun of the ladies who, she said, were “freaking drooling over him.” She lamented at one point, “I’m going to be here all night,” adding, “It’s awful.” Her husband, meanwhile, asked if he should make s’mores with the kids or go ahead and “continue winding them down.”', 'Hours later, the alleged victim’s husband was still waiting for her return. Worried, he’d searched the sports bar, but it was empty. Around 2 a.m., he texted her, saying, “Holy smokes lady . . . I don’t remember the last time you were socializing at nearly 2:00 am.” She responded oddly, typing, “Hahaha I know. I gotta make sure that fo”—dropping off mid-sentence. He responded, “Doing ok? My love? Worried about you.”', 'A few hours before dawn, the alleged victim returned to the hotel room that she was sharing with her husband and kids. She told police later that she couldn’t recall much of what had happened. But two days later she started to have frightening flashbacks and nightmares. She told police that she hazily recalled Hegseth taking her phone and blocking the door as she tried to leave. She recalled him on top of her, with his dog tags in her face. She recalled saying no a lot. Four days after the alleged assault, she went to a hospital and asked for a rape exam. She said that she thought someone might have slipped a drug into her drink and sexually assaulted her. She brought in the clothes she’d worn that night. According to the police report, she had developed an infection that could have resulted from a new sexual partner. She declined to name her alleged assailant. The nurse was legally required to report the incident to the police, who opened a criminal investigation. At that point, the alleged victim identified her assaulter as Hegseth.', 'Hegseth’s account was quite different. He told police that he had not been intoxicated but just “buzzed.” He had no memory of being belligerent or of being chastised about making noise by the pool, nor of having any sexual interest in his accuser. He said that he was confused when she stayed in his hotel room for what he said had “progressed” into a consensual sexual encounter.', 'The Monterey Country District Attorney’s office brought no charges against Hegseth, explaining that “no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” The alleged victim and her husband threatened to file a lawsuit, and in 2020 Hegseth secretly agreed to a financial settlement with them, in which he agreed to pay them an undisclosed sum. Both sides agreed to sign nondisclosure agreements concealing everything about the incident.', 'According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s transition team was blindsided by the sexual-assault story because Hegseth had failed to disclose anything about it, including the fact that he had paid off his accuser. He also failed to disclose that he had received a copy of the police report in 2021, long before the Monterey police’s recent release of it. The series of damning revelations has reportedly infuriated the transition team. “When we ask, ‘Is there anything else we need to know about?’ that is usually a good time to mention a police report,” a Trump adviser told Rolling Stone. “Obviously he remembered that this all happened and there is no way—I don’t think—he could have believed this wouldn’t come out once he got nominated.”', 'In 2016, Justin Higgins, a former Republican opposition researcher, vetted Hegseth for under-secretary roles in the first Trump Administration, on behalf of the Republican National Committee. In a commentary for MSNBC, Higgins wrote that, although he believes that Hegseth is “perhaps one of the least qualified picks for Secretary of Defense that we’ve seen,” he thinks that Hegseth “was likely chosen because he seems willing to say and do anything Trump wants.” It hadn’t hurt, Higgins added, that Hegseth belittled some war crimes, and that “Trump thinks he looks and sounds good on TV.” Hegseth has also been a strident opponent of gender equality in the military, proclaiming women unfit for combat, and calling the claim that diversity is a strength “garbage.” In 2021, he was barred from participating in President Biden’s Inauguration because a military officer was alarmed that Hegseth had tattoos of a Crusader’s cross and the motto “Deus Vult”—insignias popular with far-right militants—and had alerted superiors that Hegseth might constitute an “insider threat.”', 'On November 21st, Hegseth was cornered by reporters at the U.S. Capitol, as he called on senators whose votes he would need for his confirmation, accompanied by Vice-President-elect J. D. Vance. When Hegseth was asked about the sexual-assault allegation, he insisted that he had been exonerated of any wrongdoing. “The matter was fully investigated and I was completely cleared and that’s where I am going to leave it,” he told reporters.', 'In an interview, Tim Parlatore, Hegseth’s lawyer, told me that his client was completely innocent, and that his accuser “was the aggressor” and had “tried to blackmail him.” He also claimed that “sources,” whom he declined to identify, told him there was a shocking reason law-enforcement authorities hadn’t charged Hegseth: their investigation had discovered that his accuser had previously brought a false rape charge against someone else, thus undermining her credibility. Parlatore made the same allegation in the New York Post, which quoted Hegseth demanding that Monterey County law-enforcement officials release their investigative records on the accuser.', 'The defense’s claim that the accuser was a serial fabricator of sexual-assault charges is reminiscent of the bind that Anita Hill faced decades ago, during Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation process. Hill accused Thomas of sexually harassing her when he had been her boss at the E.E.O.C. Thomas denied Hill’s accusation, and his defenders attacked her credibility by spreading false rumors that she was an “erotomaniac” and a chronic liar. None of it was true. But it took time to disprove the falsehoods. Meanwhile, her credibility was damaged, and Thomas was confirmed.', 'A few days ago, I filed a public-records request with the Monterey County District Attorney’s office, asking for any information supporting the claim made by Hegseth’s lawyer that his accuser had levied sexual-assault claims against others. The answer came back promptly and definitively. The claim is spurious. The office had no such evidence. ♦', 'An earlier version of this article misstated Richard Blumenthal’s position on the Senate Armed Services Committee.', 'Little treats galore: a holiday gift guide.', 'What happened when the Hallmark Channel “leaned into Christmas.”', 'An objectively objectionable grammatical pet peeve.', 'Two teens went to prison for murder.

The findings of a forensic accountant hired by the organization’s donors were described as “appalling”, and one former staffer described parties that, “could politely be called trysts”.', 'Eventually, VFF merged with another non-profit in a way that removed Hegseth’s leadership power. Hegseth worked at VFF from roughly 2007-2012, and at CVA from 2014-2016.', 'The allegations come after Trump has stood by Hegseth following an investigation into sexual assault allegations by Monterey, California, police in 2017. In that incident, Hegseth was accused of assaulting a woman after a Republican women’s event.', 'Investigators recommended the complaint be forwarded to prosecutors for review. Hegseth paid a confidential settlement to the woman involved in the alleged incident in 2023 to head off the threat of a lawsuit.', 'At the time, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team said: the “report corroborates what Mr Hegseth’s attorneys have said all along: the incident was fully investigated and no charges were filed because police found the allegations to be false”.']"

Matt Gaetz, Trump’s brief pick for attorney general who dropped out over accusations of drug use and sexual misconduct.)', 'Since getting tapped for defense secretary, multiple disturbing accusations against Hegseth have emerged. The latest, revealed in a bombshell-packed New Yorker report late Sunday, centers on allegations of a drinking problem, sexual impropriety, and financial misconduct that reportedly forced Hegseth out of leadership positions from two different nonprofit advocacy groups catering to veterans.

Among the alleged reasons for his departure from VFF: Hagseth reportedly racked up more than $400,000 in debt for the organization.', 'One of Mayer’s main sources is a seven-page whistleblower report focused on Hegseth’s time at CVA, where he was president from 2013 until 2016. The report, compiled by former CVA employees, reportedly describes Hegseth as repeatedly drunk at work events, including one incident that required Hegseth to be restrained from getting on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team. The whistleblower report also reportedly alleges that Hegseth, who was married at the time, and other managers at the organization sexually pursued some of their female colleagues. Mayer cites another letter from a former employee that details an incident in which Hegseth reportedly drunkenly chanted “Kill all Muslims!” while at a hotel bar during a work trip.', '“I’ve seen him drunk so many times,” one of the authors of the whistleblower report told the magazine. “I’ve seen him dragged away not a few times but multiple times.

Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.”', 'Rape Allegation', 'A recently disclosed police report revealed that a woman accused Hegseth of raping her at a 2017 Republican women’s conference in Monterey, California. While no charges were filed and Hegseth claimed the encounter was consensual, he wound up paying the woman as part of a nondisclosure agreement, the Washington Post first reported last month. Parlatore, Hegseth’s lawyer, told the Post that the woman who made the accusation was “the aggressor in initiating sexual activity” and that Hegseth made the payment “knowing that it was the height of the MeToo movement” and afraid he could potentially lose his Fox News position.', 'His Mother Called Him “an Abuser of Women”', 'As my colleague Pema Levy wrote this weekend, Hegseth’s mother, Penelope Hegseth, wrote her son an email in 2018 in which she called him “an abuser of women,” adding, “your abuse over the years to women (dishonesty, sleeping around, betrayal, debasing, belittling) needs to be called out.” The letter, first obtained by the New York Times, reportedly focused on how Hegseth treated his ex-wife, Samantha, during their divorce proceedings. Penelope Hegseth told the Times she recanted the accusations she made in the email, alleging she wrote them in anger and immediately followed up to him with an apology.

We’re talking manhandling strippers, public drunkenness, lewd and obnoxious behavior—the kind of thing that would raise questions about someone slated to lead the Pentagon.', 'Except: In interviews with me, two former senior leaders of CVA have denied the “whistleblower” allegations against Hegseth. They insisted that he left the organization voluntarily, without any pressure bearing down on him from its funders. And unlike The New Yorker’s sources, one of Hegseth’s CVA defenders spoke on the record.', '“I was there for most of those alleged incidents, and this stuff is just complete fabrications,” said Sean Parnell, a former US Army airborne ranger who retired as a captain with a Purple Heart and two Bronze Stars and served as a senior adviser at CVA during Hegseth’s tenure. Parnell asserted that the “whistleblower” claims had come from “people who were let go as the organization was growing, who weren’t fulfilling their duties. They just weren’t.”', '“All false,” said a veteran of the Global War on Terror who served alongside Hegseth in a senior role at CVA. “These were false allegations made by a group of disgruntled employees fired by Pete.” In some cases, the CVA veteran said, the complainants attributed their own carousing to Hegseth. ', 'Parnell and the second CVA veteran also rejected The New Yorker’s claim that Hegseth was forced out of his position at the organization owing to personal misconduct. “That couldn’t be further from the truth,” said Parnell. “This was right before President Trump began his first term. Pete and I were on the media all the time, talking about national security and foreign policy. And he and I became big believers in Trump’s vision of foreign policy. The funders of that organization [CVA] didn’t necessarily believe that. And because of that policy difference, over what America’s foreign and national-security policy should be, Pete parted ways. It was 100 percent professional, political differences.”', 'The New Yorker also suggested that Hegseth’s departure from CVA was abrupt, leaving him with no immediate job options. This also wasn’t true, Parnell told me. “He was a Fox News contributor,” he noted, and in negotiations to become a full-time anchor at the cable network. “ABC was interested in him, as well, if memory serves. So it wasn’t just Fox.” ', 'The second CVA veteran echoed this characterization: “He left because his role on Fox was growing and he had a book deal. ‘Pete didn’t have another job lined up,’ the piece says, but very shortly after he left, he became a full-time Fox & Friends host.”', 'So why are establishment forces slinging so much mud at Hegseth? Said the second CVA veteran: “Pete believes that the wars we were involved in [after 9/11] were a disaster for us, for our armed forces, and for the people of those countries. Like a lot of veterans, he believes that he was lied to, and he believes he has to shake up the nat-sec complex. That’s why a lot of people are going after him.”', 'To be sure, Hegseth has yet to fully explain the evolution of his thinking on American security, from a War on Terror-era hawk to today’s more restrained view. And that’s the sort of thing lawmakers should focus on as they weigh his nomination—not decade-old personnel smears strenuously denied by his fellow veterans.', 'Sohrab Ahmari, a founder and editor of Compact, is at work on a book on the triumph of normal for HarperCollins.', 'SohrabAhmari', 'Sign up for our free newsletter today.', 'Copyright ©2024 Compact Magazine.

It also alleges that he sexually pursued female staffers, and that the organization ignored another staffer’s alleged sexual misconduct.', 'The report is the latest scrutiny into Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host with no prior government experience, ahead of what’s expected to be a tough Senate confirmation process. It comes on the heels of reports detailing a sexual assault allegation from 2017, which Hegseth has denied and in which no charges were filed.', 'Asked by CNN for comment about the magazine’s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said, “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism.” Hegseth’s team had provided The New Yorker with an identical statement.', 'The seven-page whistleblower report was compiled by former employees of Concerned Veterans for America, the advocacy group where Hegseth was president from 2013 to 2016, and sent to its senior management in February 2015, The New Yorker reported. The magazine did not name the employees, and CNN has not independently reviewed the report.', 'The report, according to The New Yorker, alleges that Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team — and that the organization ignored a female employee’s allegation that another member of Hegseth’s staff attempted to sexually assault her at that strip club.', 'It claims that his management team “sexually pursued” employees and divided the organization’s female staffers into two groups — “party girls” and “not party girls,” The New Yorker reported.', 'In a separate complaint, which The New Yorker reported was emailed by a different employee to Hegseth’s successor as head of Concerned Veterans for America in late 2015, the employee alleged that while on a work trip to Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Hegseth and someone traveling with the group’s Defend Freedom Tour closed down a hotel bar and yelled multiple times, “Kill all Muslims!”', 'In the letter, the staffer criticized Hegseth’s “despicable behavior” and said it “embarrassed the entire organization.” The staffer also wrote about another incident where Hegseth “passed out” in the back of a party bus and then urinated in front of a hotel where the organization’s team was staying, according to the magazine.', 'The New Yorker reported that when reached for comment, the author of the letter, who was not named by the magazine, said: “If you print that, I will deny I wrote it.”', 'Hegseth’s time running Concerned Veterans for America came after an earlier, controversial tenure leading Vets for Freedom, a nonprofit backed by Republican billionaire megadonors.', 'A former associate of the group, the magazine reported, said the group’s donors became concerned about money being wasted on rumored parties that “could politely be called trysts,” and other inappropriate expenses. With the group mired in more than $500,000 in debt by early 2009, donors chose to wind it down and transfer most of its management to another veterans’ group. Hegseth’s role was reduced, and he ultimately departed years later.', 'Margaret Hoover, a CNN political commentator who was an adviser to Vets for Freedom between 2008 and 2010, told CNN’s Erin Burnett last month that Hegseth ran the organization “very poorly” and lost donors’ confidence. She said the organization had less than 10 employees and a budget of less than $10 million.', '“And he couldn’t do that properly,” Hoover said, raising questions about his ability to lead the Defense Department. “I don’t know how he’s going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years.”', 'CNN previously reported that a woman accused Hegseth of sexually assaulting her in the early morning hours of October 8, 2017, in Monterey, California, where Hegseth had a speaking engagement the night before. The accuser told police that Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone and then sexually assaulted her.', 'The Monterey County district attorney told CNN last month said that her office declined to file charges against Hegseth in January 2018 because “no charges were supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” She declined to comment further. Hegseth insists that the encounter with the unnamed woman was consensual.', 'Years later, Hegseth paid the accuser in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, his attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN in a statement last month. Parlatore said Hegseth settled because it was during the “Me Too” movement and he didn’t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. The statement did not share how much the accuser was paid as part of the settlement, although Parlatore said it was “a significantly reduced amount.”', 'Hegseth’s alleged conduct toward women came under further scrutiny over the weekend, when The New York Times reported that his mother sent an email to her son in 2018 that sharply criticized his treatment of women.', 'Penelope Hegseth told her son in the email that there are “many” women whom he has “abused in some way” and encouraged him to “get some help,” according to the email published by The Times.', 'According to The Times’ report, Penelope Hegseth wrote, “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”', 'Penelope Hegseth on Friday told The New York Times that she wrote the email “in anger, with emotion” and that she had immediately apologized in a separate email. She went on to defend her son, saying her own characterization of his treatment of women in the 2018 email “has never been true.”', 'CNN’s Alayna Treene contributed to this report.', 'The-CNN-Wire', '™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
