Scott Walker.\n\nHis decision built on a July ruling, which found the law violated the Wisconsin Constitution’s equal protection clause because it allowed unions representing police, firefighters and other public safety workers to collectively bargain with the state, while it removed those rights from other public employees like teachers.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission and other state agencies more than a year ago by a group of unions representing public employees affected by Act 10.\n\nIn his Monday order, Frost chided Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled state Legislature, which intervened in the case and suggested he should not strike down any Act 10 provisions he found unconstitutional in July.\n\n“In reality, the Legislature argues that the Court can only render an empty judgment declaring parts of Act 10 unconstitutional, but can provide no remedy to stop enforcement of those unconstitutional provisions,” Frost said.\n\nWith that, Frost said his judgement is effective against the state immediately and requires agencies not to enforce unconstitutional provisions of the 2011 law.\n\n“If the Legislature wants this Court’s decision to not yet have effect, it must move this Court to stay enforcement of its decision pending appeal,” Frost said. “That has not yet been requested, so I do not address it.”', 'A statement from the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teacher’s union, heralded Frost’s ruling as siding with public service workers.

Walker took to social media with a video calling Frost’s ruling an example of “brazen political activism.” He claimed it also doubles as “an early Christmas present to the big government union bosses” hoping to dismantle GOP reforms passed during his administration.\n\n“Collective bargaining is not a right, it is an expensive entitlement. And this judge is wrong on all counts, not just on the policy, but on the legal issues as well,” Walker said.', 'The introduction of Act 10 in 2011 spawned massive protests at the Wisconsin Capitol and several lawsuits aimed at defeating it.

(CNS) — A Wisconsin judge issued a landmark decision on Monday to overturn Act 10, restoring collective bargaining powers for public workers after over a decade of protest.', 'Former Governor Scott Walker’s legacy legislation, Act 10, disarmed labor unions representing public employees for 13 years. The 2011 act created two distinct groups: “General” government workers and “public safety” workers.', 'The former group faced strict new rules. Collective bargaining was restricted to base wages, which were themselves capped by inflation, and unions in the general group became subject to annual recertification elections in which 51% of all employees — not just the ones who participated in the vote — had to vote in favor of the union in order to hold on to their representation.', 'While labor unions representing “general” public workers were in dire straits, “public safety” unions went untouched. This group included most, but not all, firefighters, law enforcement officers and state motor vehicle inspectors.', 'It took over a decade before a challenge to this law found its footing. In 2023, seven labor unions filed a lawsuit against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission arguing that Act 10’s distinction between general workers and public safety workers was a violation of the equal protection clause and needed to be struck down. They also claimed that certain public safety workers were only spared because they endorsed Walker in his 2010 bid for governor.', 'On Monday, Frost released his final judgment and order in the case, which effectively guts Act 10 by striking more than 85 sections of the law mentioning the distinction between general and public safety workers. Those are just the ones that neither side disputed. He also struck several sections that either side had argued should remain intact, including some which may affect existing labor contracts.', 'The labor unions, despite previous arguments to the contrary, objected to the striking of certain sections “out of an abundance of caution” to avoid leaving some terms undefined in other parts of Wisconsin law. However, Frost discarded this argument and scolded the unions for their change-up.', '“An unconstitutional law is null and void,” Frost said. “Striking it will of course impact some people in the State ... Plaintiffs asked to upset the current situation with public employee collective bargaining.”', 'In both its motion for dismissal and its objection to the labor union’s motion for judgment, the Legislature failed to offer a good reason for the law’s distinction between general employees and public safety employees, instead repeating the same attack on Frost’s power to strike parts of the law, Frost said.', '“The Legislature argues that the Court can only render an empty judgment declaring parts of Act 10 unconstitutional but can provide no remedy to stop enforcement of those unconstitutional provisions,” Frost said in his decision. “If that were true, the judiciary would not be a co-equal branch of government. Judicial decisions must have meaning and effect.”', 'Although the lawmakers could not explain the distinction, Walker made it clear on X, formerly Twitter, that it was always about limiting workers’ rights in a tweet following the judgment: “Collective bargaining is not a right. It is an expensive entitlement.”', 'Frost also struck some provisions of the 2015 Act 55 as fruit of the poisonous tree — several sections of that act relate to Act 10’s special treatment of public safety employees. If those sections were to remain intact, the restrictions to collective bargaining would go into affect for all government workers in the state, according to Frost. This, he says, was clearly not the intention of the Legislature in 2011, and so they, too, cannot stand.', 'In 2011, workers flooded to the Capitol building to protest the restrictions. Democratic Representative Darrion Madison says this ruling was long overdue: “Judge Frost’s ruling is a monumental victory for Wisconsin’s working class. All Wisconsinites deserve the opportunity to live in a state that treats all workers with respect and dignity.', 'Republican lawmakers quickly denounced the decision to overturn Act 10, citing contradictory facts related to the law’s benefits.', 'Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu called Frost an “activist judge” and charged other “liberal activists” with attacking reforms that he says have saved taxpayers “billions of dollars.""', 'State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said in his own statement that the law saved taxpayers $16 billion.', '“This lawsuit came more than a decade after Act 10 became law and after many courts rejected the same meritless legal challenges,"" Vos said. ""We look forward to presenting our arguments on appeal.”', 'Frost left open an opportunity for the Legislature to attempt to enact a new version of Act 10, without the employee distinctions.', '“To uphold the role of the judicial branch, I must strike unconstitutional statutes and restore the statutes to a constitutional basis,"" Frost said.

They would be treated the same as the police, firefighter and other public safety unions that were exempted under the law.', 'The ruling will almost certainly be appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. And although the high court is currently controlled 4-3 by liberal justices, an election in April will determine majority control for at least the next year.', 'Supporters of the law have said it provided local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.', 'Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions.', 'The law was proposed by then-Gov. Scott Walker and enacted by the Republican-controlled Legislature in spite of massive protests that went on for weeks and drew as many as 100,000 people to the Capitol. The law has withstood numerous legal challenges over the years, but this was the first brought since the Wisconsin Supreme Court flipped to liberal control in 2023.', 'The seven unions and three union leaders that brought the lawsuit argued that the law should be struck down because it creates unconstitutional exemptions for firefighters and other public safety workers. Attorneys for the Legislature and state agencies countered that the exemptions are legal, have already been upheld by other courts, and that the case should be dismissed.', 'But Frost sided with the unions in July, saying the law violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into “general” and “public safety” employees. He ruled that general employee unions, like those representing teachers, can not be treated differently from public safety unions that were exempt from the law.', 'His ruling Monday delineated the dozens of specific provisions in the law that must be struck.', 'Wisconsin Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he looked forward to appealing the ruling.', '“This lawsuit came more than a decade after Act 10 became law and after many courts rejected the same meritless legal challenges,” Vos said in a statement.', ""Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state's largest business lobbying organization, also decried the ruling."", '“Act 10 is not only constitutional, it is a critical tool for policymakers and elected officials to balance budgets and find taxpayer savings,"" said WMC President Kurt Bauer. “Thanks to Act 10, the state, local governments and countless school districts have saved billions and billions of dollars — protecting Wisconsinites from massive tax increases over the last decade-plus.”', 'The Legislature said in court filings that arguments made in the current case were rejected in 2014 by the state Supreme Court. The only change since that ruling is the makeup of Wisconsin Supreme Court, attorneys for the Legislature argued.', 'The Act 10 law effectively ended collective bargaining for most public unions by allowing them to bargain solely over base wage increases no greater than inflation. It also disallowed the automatic withdrawal of union dues, required annual recertification votes for unions, and forced public workers to pay more for health insurance and retirement benefits.', 'The law was the signature legislative achievement of Walker, who was targeted for a recall election he won. Walker used his fights with unions to mount an unsuccessful presidential run in 2016.', ""Frost, the judge who issued Monday's ruling, appeared to have signed the petition to recall Walker from office.

We realize there may still be a fight ahead of us in the courts, but make no mistake, we’re ready to keep fighting until we all have a seat at the table again.”', 'Betsy Ramsdale, a teacher in the Beaver Dam Unified School District and union leader, said the decision was a long time coming. “We’re confident that, in the end, the rights of all Wisconsin public sector employees will be restored,” she said. “Educators’ working conditions are students’ learning conditions, and everyone benefits when we have a say in the workplace.”', 'Rocco DeMark, a building service worker at Racine Unified School District and worksite leader for SEIU Wisconsin, said “after 14 years of battling for our collective bargaining rights, we are thrilled to take this step forward.

Public safety employees are exempt from the collective bargaining limitations imposed on ""general"" public employees.', 'Frost agreed.

I am unaware of any such precedent (...).""', 'In the earlier ruling on the motion to dismiss the case, Frost pointed out the law treats different groups of public safety employees differently.', '""Nobody could provide this Court an explanation that reasonably showed why municipal police and fire and State Troopers are considered public safety employees, but Capitol Police, UW Police and conservation wardens, who have the same authority and do the same work, are not,"" Frost said.', 'In his latest ruling, he said the courts cannot decide how the Legislature meant to define a public safety employee in Act 10. The courts, he said, ""cannot decide who should be included or excluded, absent guidance from the Legislature.""', '""Interpreting \'public safety employee\' after striking the legislated definition would be an exercise in the absurd,"" Frost wrote in Monday\'s ruling.', 'Frost, who was appointed to the Dane County Circuit Court in 2020 by Democratic Gov.
