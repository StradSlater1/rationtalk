Supreme Court to confront dispute over gender-affirming care for transgender minors,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-gender-affirming-care-transgender-minors-tennessee/,"['Watch CBS News', 'By Melissa Quinn', 'December 3, 2024 / 9:34 AM EST / CBS News', 'Washington — The Supreme Court is set to convene Wednesday to hear arguments in a landmark case involving access to gender-affirming care like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.', ""The case concerns the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that bans this medical care for transgender adolescents. Half the states have measures on the books that are similar to Tennessee's, and advocates for transgender rights are warning that if the Supreme Court upholds the ban, it would open the door to state lawmakers outlawing gender-affirming care for adults."", 'The dispute is the first in which the justices will consider the constitutionality of state efforts to regulate medical interventions for transgender youth, but it comes as Republican-led states have enacted a slew of restrictions targeting transgender individuals, including policies on sports teams and restroom access.', ""President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restrict medical treatments for transgender minors and bar transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. And while the Biden administration will argue Wednesday that the Supreme Court should invalidate Tennessee's law, the incoming Trump administration could reverse the government's position once it is in power early next year."", 'That shift in stance, though, may not preclude the high court from issuing a decision in the case, expected by the end of June.', '""It\'s very difficult for these teenagers, who already face a difficult scenario, when there\'s this institutional governmental rejection of who they are,"" said Dr. Susan Lacy, a Memphis-based physician who challenged Tennessee\'s law alongside three families. ""That\'s very difficult to be told either you don\'t know who you are — being told that you\'re wrong, you don\'t know what you\'re talking about, your parents are trying to manipulate you, all of that kind of rhetoric is really difficult for these kids.""', ""Known as SB1, Tennessee's Republican-led legislature approved its ban on certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria in March 2023. Puberty blockers and hormone therapy have been used to treat gender dysphoria for decades, but in the past three years, GOP-controlled state legislatures have adopted measures restricting access to these treatments for minors."", 'Tennessee\'s law prohibits health care providers from administering any puberty blocker or hormone if they\'re meant to enable ""a minor to identity with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\'s sex."" The state argues that it has a ""compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,"" and in barring procedures that ""might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.""', 'The use of these treatments for conditions such as precocious puberty, congenital defects or other diseases is allowed in Tennessee.', ""The Biden administration argues that Tennessee's ban draws lines based on sex and discriminates against transgender people, in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. The Justice Department has argued that the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, rather than the more relaxed standard applied by the lower court, rational basis review."", '""Most immediately, SB1 prohibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their doctors from making critically important and intensely personal decisions about the appropriate medical treatment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical condition,"" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who will argue on behalf of the federal government, wrote in a filing with the high court.', 'But Tennessee officials assert that the law is a routine exercise of state power to regulate medicine, and it is medical use and purpose — not sex — that dictate the availability of treatments. The state, they have said, is trying to protect children from the ""life-altering risks"" of gender-affirming care, which they said is ""risky"" and ""unproven.""', '""While the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,"" state officials wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.', 'The challenge before the high court was brought by three families and Lacy, who began providing gender-affirming care eight years ago. One of the challengers, a transgender girl identified in court filings as L.W., was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of 12 and began taking puberty blockers, followed by hormones.', ""Today, the state's ban means L.W., now 16, must travel to another state to receive her treatments."", '""Tennessee\'s ban on gender-affirming medical care is an active threat to the future my daughter deserves,"" Brian Williams, L.W.\'s father, told reporters in a press call hosted by the ACLU. ""It infringes not only on her freedom to be herself, but on our family\'s love for her.""', ""The ACLU is representing the families who challenged Tennessee's law. Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the group, will make history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court when he participates in oral arguments Wednesday."", 'A federal district court ruled for the Biden administration and the challengers, finding that Tennessee\'s ban likely violates the Constitution\'s Equal Protection Clause. The court ruled the law discriminates based on sex and targets transgender people, and said the benefits of the health care outlawed by the law are ""well-established.""', ""But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and allowed Tennessee's law to take effect. The measure, the divided panel found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex."", '""Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,"" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.', ""The Biden administration and the families appealed the 6th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed in June to review the ruling."", 'The Williams Institute, a think tank that conducts research on sexual orientation and gender identity law, estimates there are roughly 1.6 million people ages 13 and older who identify as transgender. There are more than 300,000 transgender youth between the ages of 13 and 17 who live in states where access to puberty blockers and hormones is restricted, according to the center.', 'Daniel Trujillo, a 17-year-old transgender boy who lives in Tucson, Arizona, began social transitioning when he was 8 years old and was prescribed puberty blockers after years of discussions between his parents, pediatrician and, later, a clinical psychologist.', '""I myself am proof that gender-affirming care works and it helps people and it saves lives,"" he told CBS News. ""When I was experiencing a lot of dysphoria, it was really hard for me to focus on things that mattered. I couldn\'t focus on school. I was very anxious and internalizing whatever I was experiencing, and once I was able to feel more comfortable in myself and feel affirmed with me, as who I am, my parents were able to see the shift, my friends and family could see the shift.""', 'In 2022, then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that prohibits ""irreversible gender reassignment surgery"" for minors. An earlier version of the proposal would have also outlawed puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but it failed in a state senate committee.', ""Still, Lizette Trujillo, Daniel's mother, said that had the state banned those treatments, the family would have moved elsewhere to ensure her son could continue to receive medical care. "", '""That felt really scary, because here is my child who is emotionally well, who has maintained strong self-esteem, feels love, he\'s doing well. And then to have the state infringe on our right and totally change our trajectory or change his life felt awful, it felt scary and felt unjust,"" she told CBS News.', 'Medical interventions in minors experiencing gender dysphoria began in Europe in the late 1990s, when Dutch health care providers started offering puberty blockers. In 1998, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommended puberty blockers at the start of puberty and hormone treatment for transgender youth at 16.', 'In recent years, though, some health authorities in European nations have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth.', 'Sonia Suter, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, said the Supreme Court could side with Tennessee and conclude that it should give deference to the state legislature in regulating health care because of medical uncertainty and disagreement among experts.', 'Citing an independent review from the United Kingdom, after which England\'s National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria, Suter that it could ""make it easy for the U.S. Supreme Court to say, you know what, there is clearly medical uncertainty here and therefore we\'re not going to second-guess.""', 'In filings with the Supreme Court, Tennessee officials warn that treatments for gender dysphoria carry health risks, such as negative impacts to fertility, diminished bone density and a higher risk of cancer.', 'But Lacy, the provider who has roughly 700 transgender patients out of roughly 3,000 who visit her practice, said she has not seen any major complications affecting long-term health.', '""When I first started providing trans care, the most compelling piece of it was that, prior to any sort of physical changes or obvious transitional changes, the first thing that people would tell me is that they felt like there was sort of a sense of mental clarity that they experienced,"" she said.', 'If not treated, gender dysphoria can lead to physical and psychological harms, the Biden administration has warned, including depression and self-harm. Up to one-third of transgender high school students attempt suicide in a given year, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', '""It\'s this goose chase trying to find safety, which is not the American dream that everyone talks about,"" Daniel Trujillo said of the patchwork of state laws restricting gender-affirming care. ""All American citizens should be able to live freely wherever they want to and live fully wherever they want to.""', 'Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

The Supreme Court Is Set To Weigh In On The Future Of Health Care For Trans Youth,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-skrmetti-transgender-youth-gender-affirming-health-care_n_674e283de4b0d426caf14cbb,"['', 'The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear arguments for the most important transgender rights case it has ever reviewed — one that could have significant consequences on the future of lifesaving gender-affirming care for youth in the country.', 'At the heart of the case, United States v. Skrmetti, is the question of whether a Tennessee ban on such care violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex. The Tennessee law, Senate Bill 1, encourages minors to “appreciate their sex” by prohibiting puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy for the purposes of allowing young people to live as an “identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex.”', 'The Department of Justice, Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union, who petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case, have argued that Tennessee’s law amounts to sex discrimination because it specifically bars transgender youth from these medications while allowing cisgender youth to undergo the same treatments for other conditions, such as early puberty.', '“This case contains some of the worst leaning into sex stereotypes that I’ve ever seen in a statute,” said Sasha Buchert, the director of the nonbinary and transgender rights project at Lambda Legal, the oldest LGBTQ+ law firm in the U.S. “It’s clearly a sex-based consideration because this is the same care that [they’re] just banning for trans people. But even further, there is this gender conformity aspect to the statute, which I think is implicit in all of these bans that we’ve seen. It’s just that Tennessee didn’t want to hide it.”', 'Tennessee has argued that the law does not specifically target trans people, although the state acknowledges that the ban sets “age- and use-based limits” on puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries for the “purpose of gender transition.” (Gender-affirming surgeries are not an issue in the Supreme Court case, however, as a district court threw out a challenge to those procedures.)', 'The law has faced legal challenges since the Tennessee legislature first passed it in March 2023. One month later, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of a trans teen identified as L.W., two other families of trans youth, and a Memphis-based doctor. The DOJ then joined the suit.', 'That summer, a district court found that the ban likely violated the U.S. Constitution and issued a preliminary injunction on parts of the law regarding puberty blockers and hormones. Tennessee’s attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which overturned that ruling. The Biden administration then asked the Supreme Court to review this case, arguing that any ban on trans health constitutes sex discrimination.', 'Since the Supreme Court only took up the Biden administration’s appeal, the court will not be weighing in on the question of whether the state law violates the “fundamental right of parents” to make medical decisions for their children, which is a central question in a separate lawsuit, L.W. v. Skrmetti.', 'The outcome of United States v. Skrmetti will provide much-needed legal clarity for trans youth and their families amidst an increasingly anti-trans political climate. Twenty-six states have passed laws restricting health care providers from prescribing puberty blockers and hormones, as well as performing surgeries on transgender youth.', 'Lower courts across the country have handed down conflicting rulings when these laws have been challenged. By and large, district court judges have attempted to block these bans, finding them unconstitutional after applying “heightened scrutiny” — a high legal standard used in civil rights cases that forces the government to prove a vested interest in the application of the law. Appeals court judges, on the other hand, have typically used “rational basis,” a lower form of review, when overturning previous injunctions of these bans.', 'Chase Strangio, the co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project, said on a press call Monday that if the Supreme Court rules in favor of Tennessee, it could “erode protections when it comes to sex-based discrimination,” especially in the context of medical care, long term. Strangio, the first trans lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court, is set to deliver a 15-minute oral argument on behalf of the three families of trans youth and the Memphis-based doctor on Wednesday.', 'However, if the Supreme Court rules as the district courts have by applying “heightened scrutiny,” then it will determine that bans on trans health care constitute sex discrimination, similar to how the high court determined in the Bostock v. Clayton County case that discrimination against trans employees is also sex discrimination.', '“This isn’t just about health care,” Buchert said. “This is about a view that the state has of what normativity is — about how someone should be in the world existentially. It’s not just preventing care, there’s a clear philosophical purpose that is to force people to live consistent with what they view as the appropriate sex.”', 'There is a body of scientific evidence to show that puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy substantially reduce gender dysphoria in adolescent patients, dozens of medical associations argued in briefs submitted to the Supreme Court in September. Doctors, medical groups, LGBTQ+ advocates, Democrats, Republicans and trans individuals have submitted briefs on the efficacy of gender-affirming care to alleviate dysphoria and prevent suicide.', 'However, Tennessee’s brief to the court is skeptical of gender-affirming care. It argues that these medical interventions are “experimental” and claims that at one point a Tennessee hospital, Nashville’s Vanderbilt University Medical Center, began providing trans health care in order to “make a lot of money.” The brief discusses at length how certain “media reports” about Vanderbilt providing gender-affirming care to minors exposed the hospital’s true intentions.', 'It is not clear what “media reports” the brief is referring to. However, the hospital first came under scrutiny in September 2022, when conservative political commentator Matt Walsh made a series of posts on social media accusing it of opening its trans clinic to turn a profit and criticizing its treatments for trans youth.', 'Later that month, Skrmetti announced that his office had opened an investigation into the clinic, demanding hundreds of patient medical records, as well as information about Vanderbilt’s employees and volunteers. In the aftermath of the investigation, a health care worker at the clinic told HuffPost that the medical center canceled appointments for certain surgeries for cisgender youth that currently do not fall into the category of trans health care but could be seen as “pathways to gender affirmation.”', 'United States v. Skrmetti comes at a pivotal time for trans rights in the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to “stop” gender-affirming care for minors nationwide, which he has equated to “child abuse” and “sexual mutilation.” The incoming president has also appointed Russell Vought, the co-author of Project 2025, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Project 2025, the blueprint for a second Trump term, includes dozens of policies that erase federal protections for LGBTQ+ people, including allowing Medicare and Medicaid to deny coverage for gender-affirming care and removing trans-inclusive protections from Title IV.', 'Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, an organization that has helped hundreds of families of trans youth travel out of state in light of these bans, said that communities are figuring out how to get the care they need in the immediate short term.', '“We’re thinking about what can we do today? What can we do tomorrow?” she said. “How can we be prepared if a ruling like that does come down next summer and bans go into effect?”', 'State bans have imperiled thousands of trans youth, many of whom have had to travel hundreds of miles to continue care.', 'Harleigh Walker, a 17-year-old trans girl, and her father have had to travel 200 miles from Auburn, Alabama, to another state in order for her to make telehealth visits and continue receiving estrogen. Alabama’s ban went into effect in January, almost two years after the state legislature passed the law.', 'Harleigh has spent much of her teenage years obsessing over her school’s debate team and collecting vinyl records. She has also become an advocate, meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris as well as testifying to the U.S. Senate about her experiences and dispelling misinformation about her health care.', 'She told HuffPost that she has known she was trans since she was 10 years old, after resonating with videos of Gigi Gorgeous, a trans Canadian YouTuber. In April 2022, Harleigh and her family met with Alabama lawmakers to share how being able to access puberty blockers, and later estrogen, helped her become the girl she always knew she was. However, when the state became the second to ban gender-affirming care for youth that year, she felt betrayed by her representatives — and she now worries about how the Supreme Court’s decision could impact her future.', '“I was pretty heavily bullied for being trans,” Harleigh said about her middle school years. “But then I built up confidence in who I was. I think there’s been a transition from being bullied by my peers to being bullied by lawmakers and adults.”', 'Harleigh plans to pursue a degree in law and one day go into politics. Though her father, Jeff Walker, is a huge fan of Auburn University in Alabama, the family understands that she will likely attend college out of state, as Alabama’s ban applies to anyone under 19.', '“We had some time as a family to figure out what was best for her and how to support her on her journey,” Jeff Walker said, speaking in a room flanked by Auburn flags and signage. “It’s gut-wrenching to see what is said about the trans community or parents of trans children. And as a dad, it’s really hard to take.”', 'Brian Williams, the father of the teen identified as L.W., said during the press call Monday that his family came to every medical decision together and sought out the advice of other family members, patients they knew, and doctors.', 'After nine months of consultations, L.W. began puberty blockers at 13. Now 16 years old, L.W. is busy making her own music, designing video games, and looking ahead at college. Last year, she said that she’s fighting Tennessee’s law because “I know how important this care is for tens of thousands of transgender youth like me.”', 'Today, more than 90% of trans teenagers live in states that have passed laws restricting trans rights in some way: the ability to access health care, participate in sports, use school bathrooms, or use the correct pronouns in school. An estimated 113,900 trans youth live in states that have restricted transition-related care for minors, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.', 'Over the last two years, HuffPost has spoken with dozens of families of trans youth and trans adults who live in states with various kinds of bans on gender-affirming care. These restrictions have created a culture of fear, forced families to travel hundreds of miles out of state, and forced some adults to stockpile their hormones or forgo transition altogether.', 'Legal and medical experts alike worry that a decision against the plaintiffs could have widespread implications beyond trans youth. Advocates worry that the case could call into question the future of legal challenges around sex discrimination, wreak havoc on health care overall and make it more challenging for trans adults to access health care on state insurance plans.', 'Morissa Ladinsky, a pediatrician and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that the impact of these bans on her patients has been extremely difficult. Even if they’re able to travel to receive care, young trans people are facing sleep issues, anxiety, and academic decline from the fear produced by these bans. Ladinsky said that one of the biggest misconceptions she has seen about health care for young trans people is around the timeline and thoroughness of the care.', ""Don't let this be the end of the free press. The free press is under attack — and America's future hangs in the balance. As other newsrooms bow to political pressure, HuffPost is not backing down."", ""Would you help us keep our news free for all? We can't do it without you."", ""Can't afford to contribute?

It is individualized and optimized for each patient,” she said, noting that youth and their families meet with medical providers, including psychologists and endocrinologists, as well as chaplains.', 'But states are losing medical professionals over restrictions to care, Ladinsky said. Alabama has experienced a physician shortage in the wake of its ban on gender-affirming care and the end of federal abortion protections. Medical professionals have similarly left states like Tennessee, Florida and Texas, which have passed their own bans on reproductive and trans health care.', '“There’s a downstream fallout from these bans that affects the health of the people in my state,” said Ladinsky, who has worked in pediatric medicine for 30 years and opened Alabama’s first pediatric gender clinic in 2015. “Doctors are not coming to Alabama, and it is unequivocal that the downstream consequences of some of these health care bans or even fears of deepening health care bans are very real, very prescient, and may be driving physicians away from states where they’re sorely needed.”', ""By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Legally, lawsuits concerning transgender rights have been percolating in the lower courts. On Wednesday one of those cases – which asks whether the state or parents are responsible for protecting vulnerable children – will be argued before the high court.', 'Transgender issues are relatively novel for the courts, and the justices have issued few rulings directly affecting them. The decision in United States v. Skrmetti – a complex, emotional lawsuit pertaining to medical care for transgender youth – has the potential to be a seismic one.', 'Who should decide the best way to protect vulnerable children – their parents, or the state? That question lies at the heart of the biggest transgender rights case in U.S. Supreme Court history.', 'Transgender Americans have existed for generations, but as their visibility in society – and their rights under the law – have grown in recent years, so has pushback. Hundreds of anti-trans bills, such as legislation restricting bathroom usage and banning the discussion of gender identity in schools, have been enacted in 2024 alone, as states react to perceived threats to equality of the sexes and a rise in youth identifying as transgender.', 'Specifically, the U.S. is seeing an increase in the number of minors receiving a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a mental disorder defined as a person’s distress at the mismatch between their gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Treatments for the condition, which range from therapy to medication and surgery, are intended to help a person align their outward, physical traits with their gender identity. (Surgery is rarely prescribed for those under age 18.)', 'Some of these treatments, known broadly as gender-affirming care, have been prescribed for decades to children and teens without controversy. (One example is to prevent early puberty in girls, which can lead to adverse health effects.) But state lawmakers have been limiting their use to treat gender dysphoria, citing concerns that children could undergo permanent physical changes treating a mental illness that could be transient.', 'In the past three years, 26 states have enacted laws and policies limiting youth access to gender-affirming care. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Skrmetti, a case challenging one such law enacted by Tennessee.', '“It’s one of the biggest cases of the term, and possibly the biggest case the court has decided on transgender rights,” says Craig Konnoth, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.', '“Its impact depends on how narrowly or broadly the court rules,” he adds. “It could decide the effect of trans rights cases around the country.”', 'On constitutional questions, this Supreme Court is committed to interpreting the founding document in line with the original meaning of its authors. Thus, the decision in Skrmetti could hinge not on the text of the Tennessee law or on the science behind medical treatments for gender dysphoria, but on history and tradition.', 'That analysis may focus on one conflict: the rights of parents versus the rights of a government when it comes to the health and well-being of a child. These are arguments that have brought together some unlikely bedfellows.', 'In one amicus brief, a group of scholars argues that there is a strong history and tradition of states having limited powers to interfere in medical decisions that parents make for their children. Two of the scholars are William Eskridge, a Yale Law School professor central to the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights in recent decades, and Steven Calabresi, a co-founder of The Federalist Society and former clerk to conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.', '“From the beginning, American ‘family life’ has been a ‘private realm’ that ‘the state cannot enter’ without strong public justification,” they write, quoting a 1944 Supreme Court opinion.', 'The 14th Amendment “translated traditional responsibilities of parents into constitutional rights – with due allowance for states to adopt neutral public health regulations,” they add.', 'Other scholars take a different view. When there is no clear medical consensus on the safety or effectiveness of a pediatric treatment – as Tennessee claims in this case – the state has an especially strong interest in regulating the availability of that treatment, says Jonathan Blumstein, a professor at the Vanderbilt University Law School.', '“This is part of a longer tradition of governmental protection of children,” he adds. “When a state faces this clinical uncertainty, it can protect minors from the use of surrogate decision-making.”', 'Transgender Americans account for about 1% of the U.S. population, and roughly 1 in 5 of them are aged 13 to 17, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. The percentage of teens who identify as transgender almost doubled between 2016 and 2022, the Williams Institute reported. In about the same time span, according to clinicians, gender dysphoria diagnoses have “increased significantly,” or “nearly tripled.”', 'Exactly what accounts for this trend is unclear, experts say, and scientific research on the benefits and efficacy of gender dysphoria treatments is mixed. All these details tie in to the Skrmetti case. However, the high court only needs to resolve one question: Does the Tennessee law violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution?', 'That clause, a provision of the 14th Amendment, holds that no state can “deny any person ... the equal protection of the laws.” Over the past 160 years, the clause has been read to protect the rights of various minority groups, from newly freed slaves to same-sex couples.', 'The Tennesee law, SB1, bars health care providers from treating minors with puberty blockers, hormones, or surgeries when it’s for the purpose of “enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or treating “distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.”', 'Though the treatments are allowed for cisgender youth, or those whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth, Tennessee claims that, because the law applies based on age and medical condition, it doesn’t run afoul of the equal protection clause. Fundamentally, the state argues that it has the right, and the responsibility, to protect children from risky and potentially irreversible medical treatments.', '“The supposed benefits of these interventions are ... unproven at best and illusory at worst,” state officials write in their brief. In passing SB1, “Tennessee acted rationally, reasonably, and compassionately to protect its children.”', 'Last year, a District Court judge disagreed, blocking the law in part because it “expressly and exclusively targets transgender people.” But months later, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed that decision, reinstating the law.', 'Three transgender teens diagnosed with gender dysphoria filed the lawsuit, and the Department of Justice has intervened on their behalf. Their argument is also a simple one. Because SB1 applies only to minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria, they claim the law inherently discriminates on the basis of sex, and thus is unconstitutional.', 'Tennessee “categorically bans” treatments only for gender dysphoria, meaning the treatments are banned for “a tiny of fraction of minors, while [remaining] available for all other minors,” the U.S. writes in its brief.', '“By defining the prohibited medical care based on the patient’s sex assigned at birth,” the U.S. adds, “SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.”', 'In justifying this claim, the U.S. and its supporters point to the Supreme Court’s last major transgender rights decision. In a shock 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, the high court held that a federal antidiscrimination law protecting employees from being fired “because of [their] sex” also protects employees from being terminated based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.', 'The justices have not weighed in directly on a transgender rights case since Bostock, but experts say the court could take a different view of the transgender plaintiffs this time around.', '“The plaintiffs are hoping that Bostock signals a modicum of friendliness to LGBTQ rights and people” from the court, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. “Whether it does, I just don’t know.”', 'The court has become more conservative, for one, with Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett replacing the progressive Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Another variance, experts say, is that while Bostock involved interpreting a statute, Skrmetti will involve interpreting the Constitution itself.', '“Reading Bostock to dictate the meaning of a constitutional provision is ‘implausible,’” argues Tennessee, quoting a concurring opinion from Justice Neil Gorsuch – author of the Bostock majority – in a later case.', 'The case is certain to be historic in at least one respect.

Skrmetti is about the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision will shape gender-affirming care in America.', 'This week, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear U.S. v. Skrmetti, a case that could redefine access to health care for transgender youth and shape constitutional protections against sex-based discrimination. The challenge centers on a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming medical care for minors, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.', '', '', 'At the heart of the lawsuit is L.W., a 16-year-old transgender girl, whose family contends that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause and interferes with parental rights. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, they argue that the ban is an unconstitutional intrusion into private medical decisions.', 'During a press call Monday morning, L.W.’s father, Brian Williams, shared how his family has been impacted. He described the long journey of supporting L.W. after she came out as transgender and the life-changing role of gender-affirming care.', '', '', '“Every decision we make as a family is to help give our children the future they deserve,” Williams said. “When L.W. first came out as transgender, it was the start of a long but loving process of learning, growth, and patience.”', 'Williams recounted how, after extensive consultations with medical experts and therapists, L.W. began puberty blockers at 13 and hormone therapy a year later. Now, she is a thriving teenager who enjoys making music, designing video games, and planning for college.', '', '', '“Her joy, her smile, and her confidence would not be what they are if it were not for the healthcare we and her doctors know is right for her,” he said.', 'The Tennessee law, SB 1, has forced the family to travel to another state for care — a burden they know many others cannot afford.', '“Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming medical care is an active threat to the future my daughter deserves,” Williams said. “It infringes not only on her freedom to be herself but on our family’s love for her.”', '', '', 'He urged others to approach transgender youth and their families with empathy. “At the very least, we’d ask others to do what we did all those years ago when L.W. first came out to us: open your hearts and listen.”', 'Also speaking on the call was Rick Colby, a Republican lobbyist and the self-described “conservative” father of a transgender son, Ashton, who transitioned in 2012. Colby described how supporting Ashton through his transition transformed his understanding of gender identity and his priorities as a parent.', '“One cold February Sunday night, I got a call that he was near suicide at college in Dayton, Ohio,” Colby said. “So I jumped in my car and drove down, and that started a years-long process of helping my son transition and become the person he was always meant to be.”', '', '', 'Colby, who said he’s been a Republican since working on Ronald Reagan’s 1984 presidential campaign, criticized his party’s push to ban gender-affirming care.', '“Yes, I’m a Republican, but first and foremost, I’m a parent and a dad,” he said. “Being transgender is a real thing, and if it’s a real thing, in my view, it transcends any political ideology.”', '', '', 'He called Tennessee’s law and others like it a “one-size-fits-all government mandate” that disregards families’ needs and professionals’ medical expertise. All major medical associations support gender-affirming care as proven, effective, and necessary medical care.', '“I believe government should not be creating barriers to opportunities for transgender people,” Colby said. “They have the right to achieve the American dream just like everyone else.”', 'The plaintiffs argue that Tennessee’s law discriminates based on sex by banning treatments only when they are intended to affirm a gender identity different from the one assigned at birth. Similar treatments remain legal for cisgender minors for other medical conditions, such as precocious puberty.', '“This law targets transgender youth, banning treatments solely because they allow someone to live in a way inconsistent with their sex assigned at birth,” said Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney representing the family. “That’s classic sex discrimination.”', 'Strangio, who will be the first out transgender lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court, will share argument time with attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice, which has also joined the fight against the law. He said the Supreme Court must hold Tennessee’s law to the same constitutional standard as other laws that classify based on sex.', '', '', 'The outcome of U.S. v. Skrmetti could have far-reaching consequences. Currently, 23 states have enacted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors. Advocates warn that if the Supreme Court upholds Tennessee’s law, it could encourage states to impose even stricter bans, including on care for transgender adults.', '“This case is not just about trans kids; it’s about whether our courts will uphold equal protection under the law,” said Sasha Buchert, director of Lambda Legal’s Nonbinary and Transgender Rights Project, which is co-counsel in the case.', 'Colby, meanwhile, hopes his experience as a parent will resonate with lawmakers and the public alike.', '“I hope that the promise of America extends to transgender people like my son and other young people,” he said.', 'As arguments begin on Wednesday, families, advocates, and supporters will rally outside the Supreme Court. The decision, expected next year, could become a defining moment in the fight for transgender rights and access to healthcare in the United States.', 'For Williams, the goal is simple: to ensure his daughter can grow up without barriers imposed by the state.', '“We are asking for her freedom to be herself without fear,” he said.']"

But it didn’t take long to realize that hormone treatments for trans folks weren’t so different from those she’d been providing for years to cisgender patients. She already knew how to use pills, patches, gels, and injections, with their different formulations and side effects, to reduce menopausal night sweats, hot flashes, and brain fog. Patients who took hormones for gender dysphoria told her they felt a similar sense of relief. “It didn’t matter about socioeconomics, age, race, feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy,” Lacy says. Often the first reaction was, “I finally feel like I can think straight.”', 'Now a gynecologist in solo practice, Lacy has more than 300 adult trans patients. At one time, her patient list also included trans teenagers with the consent of their parents. But last year, Tennessee prohibited the prescription of certain medications to minors to treat the distress many trans people feel when their bodies do not align with their gender identity. Under the law, cisgender kids could keep receiving the meds: puberty blockers for those who start puberty too early, for instance, or testosterone or estrogen for teens who enter puberty late. But if the purpose was to treat gender dysphoria, those same medications were forbidden.', 'On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a landmark lawsuit challenging the Tennessee ban, brought by the Biden administration’s Department of Justice, Lacy, and three trans minors and their families. United States v. Skrmetti is one of the biggest cases of the term and the first major trans-rights case to be heard by the court since far-right lawmakers and policy groups launched a coordinated campaign inundating statehouses with hundreds of anti-trans bills a few years ago. Legal experts say the Skrmetti case could shape the landscape for trans rights for years to come, while testing how far the Court’s conservative supermajority is willing to extend its 2022 decision allowing states to ban abortion: Will the justices give states free reign to outlaw yet another form of healthcare?', '“Before treatment, I hid,” one plaintiff, 15-year-old Ryan Roe, wrote in a declaration asking a federal judge to put the ban on hold. But with hormone therapy, “I am raising my hand in class again and participating in all aspects of school. I feel stronger—physically, mentally and emotionally. I feel so happy with myself and that makes me feel like I can do and be more.” ', 'That changed, he added, when Tennessee lawmakers began debating the gender-affirming care ban. “Hopelessness creeped in again.”', 'The Skrmetti arguments are happening at a time of intense fear and vulnerability for the trans community. President-elect Donald Trump and his allies bet on transphobia to take back the White House and Congress, pouring millions into anti-trans campaign ads and vowing a broad crackdown on what Trump refers to as “left-wing gender insanity” (though the extent to which trans issues swayed the electorate remains unclear). Supported by groups like the Heritage Foundation, the think tank behind Project 2025, and Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious-right legal behemoth, states have made particular targets of trans young people, restricting their use of school bathrooms and locker rooms, their participation in sports, and discussion of LGBTQ-related topics in classrooms and libraries. ', 'They have also targeted medical care, with nearly half of states outlawing gender-affirming treatments for people under 18, cutting off access for an estimated 118,300 trans teens. The bans have been enacted over the objections of virtually all leading US medical associations, which consider such treatments clinically appropriate. One study of almost 12,000 trans teenagers found that those who received hormone therapy reported lower rates of depression and suicidality compared to those who wanted but didn’t receive the treatment. When Tennessee’s ban took effect, Lacy says, “the biggest sense from the patients was despair—anger and despair.” Parents, meanwhile, were frustrated: “Why can I not make this decision for my child?”', '“It is painful to even think about having to go back to the place I was in before I was able to come out and access the care that my doctors have prescribed for me,” one of the plaintiffs, a 15-year-old trans girl known as L.W., wrote in a declaration. She struggled to focus and connect with friends, and got sick when she had to use the boy’s bathroom at school.', '“It is painful to even think about having to go back to the place I was in before I was able to come out and access the care that my doctors have prescribed for me.”', 'L.W.’s mother, Samantha Williams, wrote in a declaration of her own that starting gender-affirming medical care had improved her daughter’s physical and mental health: “She has more confidence, she is fully present, and not only does she accept hugs, but she also gives hugs.” The Tennessee ban prompted Williams and her husband to consider moving their family away from relatives, work, and the community where their two children had grown up. “I do not want to see her go back to the dark place she was in prior to coming out and receiving the life-saving treatment she needs,” Williams wrote.', 'LGBTQ-rights organizations have filed lawsuits over almost every gender-affirming care ban, with Skrmetti the first case to reach the Supreme Court. Now, justices are being asked to set the standard under which lower-court judges must evaluate whether laws like Tennessee’s violate the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. The justices’ eventual decision could have implications not just for gender-affirming care bans, but for future anti-trans laws in statehouses and Congress. “It will tell the next administration whether it’s open season to continue with these attacks on trans young folks and transgender people more broadly,” says Jenny Pizer, chief legal officer of the LGBTQ civil rights organization Lambda Legal, “or whether there’s going to be some limits.”', 'There’s a potential wild card in the mix: When Trump takes office, his Department of Justice is likely to try to reverse the Biden administration’s position and withdraw the case. Pizer says that if that happens, there’s no telling how the Supreme Court would respond. They could agree to kill the case, deny the request, or push a decision off till next term. Or, they could let the federal government withdraw but allow the case to proceed, with only the Tennessee families and Lacy as plaintiffs.', 'Legally speaking, the main issue in the case boils down to the question of whether bans on gender-affirming care are a form of sex-based discrimination. If they are, then states going forward will have to prove, when challenged, that the bans are “substantially related” to an “important state interest.” That’s a fairly high bar—one that would require judges to weigh the medical and scientific evidence around the prohibited treatments. When trial courts have looked at that evidence in the past, they’ve overturned the bans, siding with the trans youth and their families.', 'In fact, that’s what happened in the Middle District of Tennessee federal court, where the Skrmetti case started. “The Court acknowledges that the state feels strongly that the medical procedures banned by [the law] are harmful to minors,” District Judge Eli Richardson wrote last year in an order temporarily blocking the law. “The medical evidence on the record, however, indicates otherwise.”', 'Richardson’s decision wasn’t controversial at the time—every federal judge, including Trump appointees, who had looked at gender-affirming care bans up until that point had blocked them. But the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees Tennessee, went the other way, ruling 2 to 1 that the law did not discriminate based on sex, and thus it didn’t have to meet the higher level of scrutiny. (The judges also shot down the plaintiffs’ two other arguments—that anti-trans discrimination is unique and merits a closer look by the courts, and that the ban violates parents’ right to direct their children’s medical care.) In the 14 months since that decision, more courts have upheld gender-affirming care bans for minors, including in Ohio, Oklahoma, and Missouri.', 'If the Supreme Court agrees with the Sixth Circuit’s approach, courts going forward will apply the lowest level of scrutiny to gender-affirming care bans. The result, says Jess Braverman, legal director at the advocacy group Gender Justice, would be “like a rubber stamp.”', 'Casual Supreme Court observers would be forgiven for thinking that the question of whether anti-trans discrimination counts as sex discrimination has already been settled. In his majority opinion in the court’s last major trans-rights case, Bostock v. Clayton County in 2020, Justice Neil Gorsuch stated, “It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” But since that ruling, which involved a funeral home employee who was fired after transitioning, conservative lawyers and public officials have been trying to limit Bostock from being applied to situations beyond employment. The result has been an escalation of the legal battles over federal protections for trans people: Do existing sex-discrimination laws shield them at school? What about at the doctor’s office?', 'In arguing that Tennessee’s ban discriminates based on sex, DOJ lawyers point to the text of the law, which explicitly says that the state wants to “encourage[e] minors to appreciate their sex” and forbid treatments that might “encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.” The “purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live like boys and girls,” appellate judge Helene White summarized in a dissent from the Sixth Circuit ruling. Under the law, kids can receive puberty blockers and hormone therapy if the medications are provided to help them conform their bodies to their sex assigned at birth, but not if the treatments are provided to help them not conform. “There is no way to determine whether these treatments must be withheld from any particular minor without considering [the minor’s] sex,’” DOJ lawyers argue in their Supreme Court briefing.', 'Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti contends that the ban does not discriminate based on sex. Instead, he says, the law is a health care regulation that applies to everyone. “The law draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes,” he argues in his brief. “Boys and girls fall on both sides of that line.”', 'In making that argument, Skrmetti repeatedly cited Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the 2022 case that overturned the federal right to abortion. As Susan Rinkunas has noted over at The New Republic, the Tennessee AG is picking up on an aside by Justice Samuel Alito in the Dobbs ruling that Mississippi’s abortion ban didn’t violate the Equal Protection Clause because, according to the justice, the ban didn’t discriminate based on sex. To back up this assertion, Alito cited a Supreme Court ruling from 1974, Geduldig v. Aiello, which held that an insurance policy specifically excluding pregnancy-related coverage was not a form of sex discrimination, and applied to everyone. That ruling and a related decision were deemed so outrageous at the time that Congress swiftly enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to override them.', 'Now, there is a risk that when the Supreme Court decides Skrmetti, it will apply the same reasoning from Geduldig and Alito’s sidenote in Dobbs: Even when laws restrict medical treatments that only matter for certain groups—like pregnant women, or trans people—those laws aren’t inherently discriminatory, because not every member of that group requires that type of care. “It’s kind of like our Supreme Court is a bunch of freshman philosophy students,” Braverman says. “It’s like they’re all asking, ‘Do we see the same color when we see yellow?’ Except lives are at stake.”', '“It’s kind of like our Supreme Court is a bunch of freshman philosophy students. It’s like they’re all asking, ‘Do we see the same color when we see yellow?’ Except lives are at stake.”', 'To Braverman, it’s no surprise that the arguments being used to defend bans on gender-affirming care are the same as those used to defend bans on abortion. “It’s the same people who are litigating it in court, and they’re making the same argument,” Braverman says. “If we treat what’s happening to transgender people as though it’s happening in a vacuum, everyone’s going to lose all their rights.” If the Supreme Court sides with Tennessee, for example, states might be emboldened to try banning other types of sex-specific healthcare, such as IVF or birth control, the ACLU warns.', '“The real question in this case is, ‘Can powerful interest groups like the Heritage Foundation or Alliance Defending Freedom make up lies about your health care, and then use those lies to make your healthcare illegal?” Shawn Thomas Meerkamper, senior staff attorney at the Transgender Law Center, said in a briefing for journalists. “Because that’s what’s happening here.”', '“One of the things that I think is so concerning about these laws is allowing legislators with no medical knowledge to restrict care for a specific diagnosis,” Lacy says from her office in Memphis. When the Tennessee ban came down, she tried to help her young patients find ways to keep up their existing prescriptions. Some families drove across the border to a clinic in Illinois or flew to other states where the medications were still legal. But for patients needing new prescriptions, her hands were tied.', 'She thinks about the families that never call her office in the first place—the “chilling effect” stopping parents from even considering medical care as an option after their children come out as trans. “I think when that law was passed, a lot of those parents just said, ‘Nope, can’t even deal with it,’” Lacy says. “Prior, they would say, ‘Well, let’s go in and let’s at least have the conversation.’”', 'Beyond the chilling effect, Lacy fears how laws like Tennessee’s worsen hostility toward transgender people. She worries about her own daughter, who came out as trans as a young adult, being judged based on how others perceive her gender identity. “There’s just a fear of the risk of existing in the world where the state is saying that you don’t have a right to exist,” Lacy says. “And that’s very, very frightening.”', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

But the truth is that it’s more than just medical. It’s love and acceptance.”', 'A subset of young people may be offered additional interventions such as puberty blockers to ease distress and give them time to explore their gender identity.', 'The drugs, known as GnRH agonists, block the release of key hormones involved in sexual maturation. They’ve been used for decades to treat precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.', 'The medication starts after a young person show early signs of puberty — enlargement of breasts or testicles. This typically occurs around age 8 to 13 for those assigned female at birth and a year or two later for those assigned male at birth.', 'The drugs can be given as injections every few months or as arm implants lasting up to a year or two. Many of the effects are reversible — puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.', 'Young people can stay on puberty blockers for several years.', 'After puberty blockers, trans adolescents go through puberty either with or without hormone treatment.', 'Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone — hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.', 'Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions.

Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.', 'Research on long-term hormone use in transgender adults has found potential health risks including a modest risk for blood clots with estrogen and negative cholesterol changes with testosterone.', 'Gender-affirming surgery in transgender teens is far less common than hormone treatment. When it is done among transgender youth, it’s almost always breast reduction surgery in older transgender males.', 'Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare.

At the case’s core is the crucial question of how much judicial scrutiny laws regarding transgender individuals demand.', 'The legal standards invoked by black-robed jurists may seem dry and arcane. But in a case testing the reach of the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee, those standards set the terms of the debate and determine which side has the greater burden to prove its case.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nHe’s the first known transgender lawyer to argue before Supreme Court. For Chase Strangio, the mission ‘is not lost on me’', 'Should regulations on transgender issues be regarded as a type of sex discrimination warranting “heightened scrutiny” and an important governmental interest to justify them, as the Biden administration and transgender advocates argue? That’s how some federal judges have seen it as they’ve struck down anti-trans policies, including those preventing minors from obtaining gender-affirming care.', 'Or should a ban on transgender care be subject only to “rational basis” review, which requires a state to show that it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest? This method usually applies to commonplace business rules and requires judges to defer to state legislators.', 'The answer to this threshold issue in Wednesday’s case will go a long way to determine the protections afforded transgender Americans in the future.', 'The Tennessee ban enacted last year is one of at least 25 state prohibitions on gender-affirming care, according to KFF. It arrives at the Supreme Court as new fights have erupted over competitive sports and bathroom policies, at schools and in the halls of the US House of Representatives.

Or, alternatively, the Supreme Court may be persuaded to leave an increasingly fraught area of the law to elected legislators and the democratic process.', 'Adding to the suspense of this closely watched case, the lower court ruling now before the justices was tailored to the current right-wing bench. It was written by a conservative US appellate judge who is among the most respected by the justices and crafted in terms that would fuel their interest in narrowly construing rights.', 'The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals imposed the lowest level of review, saying bans on transgender care do not amount to sex discrimination. As such, it broke from precedent on sex-based classifications and a pattern among judges who’d found that bans on gender-affirming care necessarily discriminate based on sex because they are tied to a minor’s sex at birth and cover only treatment that transgender people choose to undergo.', 'The Supreme Court has laid out three tiers of scrutiny in such debates over equal protection of the law: “strict scrutiny,” the toughest review, for any government classification based on race, national origin and religion, and demanding a compelling governmental justification; “heightened,” or intermediate, scrutiny, for classifications based on sex, requiring that the law serve an important governmental objective; and, finally, “rational basis,” requiring only a rational relationship between the regulation and a legitimate government interest.', 'A key factor in the calculation is whether the people at the heart of the case are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and unable to vindicate their rights through the usual political process.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nSupreme Court’s transgender care fight creates conservative ‘reckoning’ over parental rights', 'Throughout decades of cases, the high court has described Black Americans and other racial minorities as a “suspect class,” needing the greatest constitutional protection, and it has deemed victims of sex discrimination a “quasi-suspect class.”', 'US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who will argue the Biden administration’s appeal of the 6th Circuit decision, says the sheer existence of the bans enacted over the past three years helps demonstrate that transgender people represent a “quasi-suspect class” entitled to heightened constitutional protection.', '“(T)ransgender individuals have not been able to meaningfully vindicate their rights through the political process in much of the country – as evidenced by the recent wave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Tennessee and other States,” she wrote in a filing to the court.', 'In the decision now before the justices, a panel of the 6th Circuit ruled by a 2-1 vote that the Tennessee ban on transgender care does not amount to a sex-based classification, so no reason exists “to apply skeptical, rigorous, or any other form of heightened review to these laws.”', 'Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a highly regarded conservative who has been on the bench since 2003 and is now chief judge of the 6th Circuit, said the Tennessee law cannot be viewed through the usual lens for government policies that set out different treatment for men and for women. He said such bans should be considered mainly in the context of a restriction on medical treatment for minors.', '“The laws regulate sex transition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex,” Sutton wrote, concluding that the state could justify its ban based on its responsibility to protect the health of children. Sutton, an appointee of President George W. Bush, emphasized the potential for irreversible medical consequences, such as sterility.', 'Sutton was joined by Judge Amul Thapar, an early Trump appointee to the 6th Circuit who’d also been considered for the Supreme Court during Trump’s first term. He may be in contention yet again should a vacancy arise.', 'The Biden administration said the 6th Circuit’s rationale would subject anti-trans laws “to no greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning compounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling hotdog pushcarts from New Orleans’ French Quarter.”', 'The 6th Circuit panel majority also brushed aside the Supreme Court’s leading precedent on transgender rights, Bostock v.

In this case, the laws do not deny anyone general healthcare treatment based on any such stereotypes; they merely deny the same medical treatments to all children facing gender dysphoria if they are 17.”', 'Bringing into play the high court’s interest in originalism, Sutton wrote at the outset that the challengers could not rely on the “original fixed meaning” of the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee.', '“That prompts the question whether the people of this country ever agreed to remove debates of this sort – over the use of innovative, and potentially irreversible, medical treatments for children – from the conventional place for dealing with new norms, new drugs, and new public health concerns: the democratic process,” he wrote, “Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field.”', 'Known as SB1, the Tennessee law prohibits physicians and other health care providers from prescribing any puberty blocker or hormone that would enable a minor “to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex.”', 'It also bans any treatment to address “purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.” (The law permits puberty blockers and hormones for other purposes, such as to treat congenital conditions and early puberty.)', 'Physicians have prescribed such drugs to treat gender dysphoria, that is, the distress resulting from the incongruence between a person’s sex and their gender identity. Gender-affirming care, according to research cited in briefs supporting the plaintiffs, can reduce adolescents’ depression, anxiety, self-harm and risk of suicide.', 'The text of the disputed law says it reflects Tennessee’s “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty” and a desire to prohibit medical care that would “encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.”', 'Three transgender youths, their parents and a physician sued under the Constitution’s equal protection and due process clauses. The Biden administration joined their side under a law that allows the government to intervene in equal protection lawsuits brought by private parties.', 'When the justices agreed to hear the Biden administration appeal of the 6th Circuit’s decision, in the case now called United States v. Skrmetti, it said it would take up only the equal protection issue. The court declined to review the question of parents’ rights to make medical decisions for their children based on due process grounds.', 'Like the challengers who started the Tennessee case, Solicitor General Prelogar emphasizes the difficulties faced by trans children and their families.', '“For many parents, questions about how best to raise transgender adolescents – including whether and how to take steps to enable them to live in accordance with their gender identity – are extraordinarily challenging,” Prelogar wrote in her brief.', 'Referring to one of the youths, a 13-year-old transgender boy known by a pseudonym, Prelogar wrote, “John Doe’s mother put the point in plain terms: ‘This is what I think many people don’t understand: no parent would choose to make their child different, or choose a harder path in life for their child.’”', 'Prelogar will share time in the well of the courtroom with the ACLU’s Chase Strangio, who represents the trans youths and their parents.', 'In his written filing, Strangio addressed the consequences of the 6th Circuit’s legal reasoning. “It will effectively immunize all forms of government discrimination against transgender people from meaningful constitutional scrutiny. And it will force the families at the center of this case (and countless others like them) to lose the very medical care that has allowed their children to grow and thrive.”', 'Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ and HIV Project, will be the first openly transgender person to argue before the justices.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nFrom champagne to speeches, would-be Trump Supreme Court justices draw conservative buzz', 'When Tennessee Solicitor General Matthew Rice then steps to the lectern, he will defend the level of scrutiny used by the 6th Circuit and urge the justices to uphold the prohibition on hormones and other treatment.

Boren, the court struck down a state law that allowed women to buy low-alcohol beer at age 18 but forbade men from doing so until age 21. The justices declared that such a sex-based classification violates the guarantee of equal protection unless it is substantially related to an important governmental objective.', 'In the state’s brief, Rice described such laws the justices began reviewing in the 1970s as “classic sex classifications.”', '“Tennessee’s law draws no similar sex-based line,” he wrote. “SB1 does not ‘prefer one sex over the other,’ ‘include one sex and exclude the other,’ ‘bestow benefits or burdens based on sex,’ or ‘apply one rule for males and another for females.’”', 'Tennessee officials emphasize that the ban on transgender treatment refers to sex but does not differentiate based on sex. The law prevents minors desiring a gender transition – whether they be male or female – from using puberty blockers and hormones.', 'The current Supreme Court has been eliminating or constricting individual rights, most dramatically the reversal of abortion rights in the 2022 case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which Tennessee officials repeatedly cite in their briefs.', 'The court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, however, broke ground in the opposite direction. By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that Title VII’s protection against sex bias in the workplace can apply to gay and transgender employees.', 'The decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, was tied to the specific text of Title VII prohibiting discrimination “on the basis of sex.” The 6th Circuit declined to apply Bostock to the current dispute over the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of “equal protection of the laws.”', 'If the Supreme Court adopts that 6th Circuit approach, it likely will not affect reliance on Bostock for Title VII workplace cases.

And as she declined to endorse the Tennessee ban, she referred to language from the Bostock opinion that said if the government treats differently “a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in (a person) identified as female at birth,” or vice versa, the person’s “sex plays an unmistakable …. role.”', 'A few weeks after the Supreme Court issued Bostock, the 4th Circuit relied partly on that decision as it sided with a Virginia transgender boy, Gavin Grimm, who had been denied use of his school’s boys bathroom. Looking to standards regarding constitutional equal protection, the 4th Circuit concluded that “heightened scrutiny” applied to Grimm’s claim because the bathroom rule rested on a sex-based classification and because transgender individuals constituted “at least a quasi-suspect class.”', 'The 4th Circuit panel added: “After the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, we have little difficulty holding that a bathroom policy precluding Grimm from using the boys restrooms discriminated against him ‘on the basis of sex.’”', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Skrmetti on Dec. 4, trans youth and LGBTQ+ advocates across the country will be watching with bated breath.', 'The case, which centers on a Tennessee law, will allow the U.S. Supreme Court Justices to decide whether gender-affirming-care bans for minors are unconstitutional under the basis of sex discrimination.', 'It’s the first major trans rights case to reach the nation’s highest court after statehouses have passed scores of anti-trans laws in recent years restricting transgender Americans’ ability to use the bathrooms of their choice, play on women’s sports teams, and access certain kinds of health care.', '“The central arguments are about not just the legitimacy of trans healthcare, but about, in some sense, the legitimacy of trans people as members of civic life and public life,” Chase Strangio, co-Director for Transgender Justice with the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project who is arguing for the plaintiffs in this case, told TIME.', 'Tennessee’s law Senate Bill 1 (SB1), which the Biden Administration, a doctor, and three families challenged, prohibits doctors from prescribing pharmaceutical and surgical care for transgender minors that are looking to gender transition. Tennessee is home to more than 3,000 transgender adolescents, and across the U.S. there are some 300,000 transgender youth aged 13 to 17, according to UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute.', 'Gender-affirming care refers to the social, psychological, and medical care prescribed to trans individuals to support their gender identity when it conflicts with the sex they were assigned at birth. The type of care a minor receives varies from child to child, but the Association of American Medical Colleges says gender-affirming care includes counseling on changes in a child’s social expression (like name changes or hairstyle), puberty blockers, hormone therapy, or surgery—though research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found minimal to no use of gender-affirming surgeries on transgender and gender diverse minors in the U.S. Decisions on the type of gender-affirming care a minor patient receives require consultation between a parent and doctor. Twenty-four states passed gender-affirming care bans for minors, though some are not currently in effect, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Other states, including Florida, have ongoing litigation challenging care restrictions for transgender adults.', 'What the Supreme Court Justices decide will have significant ramifications for trans youth in Tennessee and beyond—and the stakes could extend to trans adults as well, says Human Right Campaign (HRC) senior director of litigation Cynthia Weaver. “Certainly, how the Court comes out in this Skrmetti case will have some impact on laws that further restrict care for adults,” she says. “It may also encourage or discourage other states to contemplate further restrictions on adult care.”', ""In U.S. v. Skrmetti, the Supreme Court will decide whether Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause."", 'The case was filed in 2023 on behalf of Dr. Susan Lacy, a medical doctor, Samantha and Brian Williams of Nashville, Tenn. and their teenage transgender daughter, and two other anonymous families. The Biden Administration is also a party in the case in support of plaintiffs.', ""Tennessee’s Senate Bill 1 (SB1) prohibits doctors from prescribing certain types of treatment for transgender minors, including puberty blockers and hormones. Minors who are seeking that same medication “for other medical purposes,” the state said in a brief, are permitted to take that medication. “The legislature determines that medical procedures that alter a minor's hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, or otherwise change a minor's physical appearance are harmful to a minor when these medical procedures are performed for the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with,” a gender identity different from the minor’s sex at birth, to “protect the health and welfare of minors,” SB1 says."", 'The plaintiffs, however, argue that Tennessee’s law violates the Equal Protection Clause, because it bans medical treatment in what they say are “explicitly sex-based terms,” according to their brief.', 'Read More: The First Out Trans Lawyer to Argue Before the Supreme Court Is Feeling the Pressure', ""The Supreme Court will need to decide what level of scrutiny is applicable for Tennessee’s gender-affirming care ban. Respondents believe SB1 should be subject to rational basis review. Laws that do not discriminate against people based on their sex, gender, or other protected class have to pass the rational basis test. “[It] basically means that they have to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest,” says UCLA Law School professor emeritus Eugene Volokh. Volokh uses state laws regulating medical marijuana as an example. “If a state wants to say, ‘We don't want to allow marijuana even for medical purposes, because we think that, on balance, marijuana doesn't have sufficient medical benefits to outweigh the harms that it can cause,’ that's a rational decision for a state,” he says."", 'The plaintiffs, on the other hand, are arguing for a higher bar for the law to meet, which would make it harder for Tennessee to justify the ban. Under heightened scrutiny, the Supreme Court would have to analyze the laws the state is passing under a more careful review because they would impact a particular population based on a protected characteristic: race, sex, religion, etc.', 'The District Court applied heightened scrutiny to the case and enjoined the law, but the Sixth Circuit disagreed and applied a rational basis test, which allowed the law to stand. That decision was appealed up to the Supreme Court.', 'There’s also an important precedent that may affect this case. In 2020’s Bostock v. Clayton County, which concerned a plaintiff who was fired after expressing interest in a work gay softball league, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was heard alongside Bostock and involved a woman who was fired for being transgender, the Supreme Court ruled in plaintiffs’ favor. It was the first time the Supreme Court found that sex discrimination protections extended to sexuality and gender identity. If the Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in Skrmetti, it would reaffirm that position.', 'The Supreme Court could rule in a number of different ways.', ""It could find that SB1 violates the Constitution and overturn the ban, which would be a win for LGBTQ+ advocates. Or it could hand down a narrow ruling that would determine the level of scrutiny that applies but send the case back to a lower court to apply that standard.  It could instead find that gender-affirming care bans for minors should only receive a rational basis review, which would likely leave the law in place and also affect laws restricting gender affirming care for adult patients, and healthcare more broadly. “There's potential, because this is a sex-based argument, for this court to say, ‘Actually, we don't really think that differentiation based on sex deserves any heightened protection.’ And so that could also alter any other types of cases that are broad based on sex discrimination, beyond transgender people,” says Ulrich."", 'Read More: Trans and Abortion Rights Activists Are Ultimately Fighting for the Same Thing', ""The incoming Trump Administration could also affect the case. The United States is a party in this case, because the Biden Administration sided with the plaintiffs. But “most people expect that the federal government, once the administration changes, will change their position and switch to supporting Tennessee's law,” says Ulrich."", 'Experts are mixed on what effect that could have. Weaver says that with oral arguments already in motion, and the independence of the Supreme Court from other branches of government, there should be no impact. But Ulrich says it is possible the Court could decide to take on a new hearing to see whether they want to accept the petition from the ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing plaintiffs.', 'No matter the outcome, the Supreme Court is set to weigh in on one of the most contentious issues in the country. Transgender rights have become a potent political talking point, and about 50% of Americans believe changing their gender is morally wrong, per a June 2024 Gallup report. But only 34% are in favor of banning gender-affirming-care for transgender minors, the same poll found.', 'Medical providers are largely in support of this type of care. Every major medical and mental health association in the U.S. has espoused the benefits of gender-affirming-care on the mental health of transgender youth, per GLAAD. A peer-reviewed study published in the journal Nature Human Behavior found that when anti-transgender laws are passed, suicide attempts by trans and nonbinary minors increase anywhere from 7 to 72%.', ""“Looking at the LGBTQ+ movement broadly as it relates to gay and lesbian people versus where we are with trans people, I think this is really an inflection point,” Strangio said. “It's not just affecting trans people, it'll affect all LGBTQ people. It'll affect all people who experience gender-based discrimination.”"", 'Contact us at letters@time.com.']"

Supreme Court to hear historic argument on transgender rights,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-transgender-care-skrmetti-rcna182505,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By Jordan Rubin', 'The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing Wednesday in an appeal involving transgender rights that could be the most important case of the court’s term.', 'The legal question in the case, called United States v. Skrmetti, is whether a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors violates the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. How the court answers the question could affect similar laws across the country and transgender rights more broadly.', 'Three lawyers are set to argue to the justices in Washington. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar represents the federal government and Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice represents the state, whose attorney general is Jonathan Skrmetti (hence the case name, United States v. Skrmetti). American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Chase Strangio represents the original plaintiffs in the lawsuit: transgender adolescents, their parents and a doctor who treats adolescents with gender dysphoria. Strangio will be the first openly transgender lawyer to argue at the court.', 'It’s not unprecedented for more than two parties to argue in a case. But the dynamic could be especially important here because the incoming Trump administration could take a different position than the Biden administration, which intervened in the suit against the state law. So it’s possible the group Strangio represents will be the only adversarial party to Tennessee when the justices eventually decide the case, if the federal government tells the court it no longer disagrees with the state after Trump takes office next month.', 'A decision is expected by the summer, when the court usually finishes ruling on cases heard during the term that started in October.', 'For now, at least, the federal government opposes the state. Arguing that the law, called SB1, is unconstitutionally discriminatory, Prelogar’s office wrote in a brief ahead of the hearing that, under the law:', '... an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can. And that focus on sex and gender conformity is deliberate: SB1 declares that its very purpose is to “encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex” and to ban treatments “that might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.”', '', '“That,” the federal government argues, “is sex discrimination.”', 'Defending the law, the state wrote in its own brief that it’s “not unconstitutional discrimination to say that drugs can be prescribed for one reason but not another.” The state further argued that the law doesn’t classify people based on sex but rather “creates two groups: minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.”', 'Like the federal government, the private parties represented by Strangio argue that the law “imposes differential treatment based on the sex an individual is assigned at birth.” In support of their position, they cite the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which said that an employer violates federal civil rights law when they fire someone for being gay or transgender.', 'Notably, that 6-3 ruling was authored by Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, so those justices’ questions at the hearing will be among the important ones to watch for.', 'Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in Donald Trump’s legal cases.', 'Jordan Rubin is the Deadline: Legal Blog writer.

Upcoming Supreme Court decision could transform transgender health care,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/transgender-health-care-supreme-court-decision-rcna182008,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The Supreme Court will consider a law restricting transition-related health care for minors for the first time Wednesday, and legal experts say the court’s decision could affect access to transition-related care nationwide for both minors and adults for decades to come. ', 'The key legal question the court will consider is whether a Tennessee law that bars puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery for trans minors discriminates on the basis of sex.  ', 'The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal argue that it does, because it prohibits such care only as treatment for gender dysphoria. The law makes exceptions for minors who need the treatments for other reasons. Puberty blockers, for example, can be used to treat children who experience precocious, or early, puberty, and physicians can still perform surgery on infants who are born with sex characteristics that fall outside the standard male or female binary. ', 'Just days after the ACLU filed suit against Tennessee’s law in April 2023, the Justice Department intervened and filed its own complaint against the law, arguing that it discriminates against trans youths on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court granted the Biden administration’s appeal of a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding Tennessee’s law. The court won’t consider the part of the law that bans surgery, which wasn’t covered by the lower court’s injunction.', 'In his reply brief to the Supreme Court, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti argued that the law doesn’t discriminate based on sex but rather “draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes” and that “boys and girls fall on both sides of that line.” The attorney general’s office also argues that there is uncertainty around the risks and benefits of transition care for minors and that the state is allowed to pass legislation in an effort to protect minors.', 'Harleigh Walker, 17, a trans girl in Auburn, Alabama, said she’s worried about how the court’s decision could affect her future. Since Alabama’s ban on transition-related care for minors took effect in January, Walker and her father, Jeff, have had to travel 200 miles to another state, where Walker will sometimes sit in the car or in a hotel room to do a telehealth visit so she can continue receiving estrogen. ', 'Walker plans to attend college out of state, because Alabama’s law applies to anyone under 19, the state’s age of majority, so Walker wouldn’t be able to receive care in the state until her sophomore year.', '“Whenever this legislation was introduced in Alabama and state legislatures across the country, it was obviously a huge shock, and it had a lot of unsafety and uncertainty, but I knew that I was still safe under the general umbrella of the United States of America, and I could go to another state that has more of an open mind about trans people and access to health care, but with Trump being elected and this Supreme Court decision … it’s horrifying that there’s a possibility that this could affect health care access for transgender adults,” Walker said. “It’s scary to think that I won’t be safe for the rest of my life in this country, and I hope that that’s not the case.”', 'Trans youths, their families and providers of transition-related care have told NBC News that state restrictions on such care have created a confusing patchwork of laws across the country that has led many families to have to travel out of their home states for care. As a result, legal experts say, the court’s decision could determine what access to such care looks like for years to come not only for minors but also for adults because of some of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed policies. ', '“The reason that transgender people’s health care is now protected under the Affordable Care Act is because there is a broad recognition that denying it would be unlawful sex discrimination under the Affordable Care Act,” said Shannon Minter, the legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group. “So if the court says no, excluding this care is not discriminatory, then that would really gravely endanger our coverage under the Affordable Care Act.”', 'Last year, three trans youths, their parents and a doctor asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block Tennessee’s law, which took effect in July 2023 but includes a provision that allows doctors to wean youths off of medication for nine months until March 31, 2024. ', 'One of the plaintiffs, a 15-year-old trans girl referred to as L.W. in the lawsuit, said last year that she’s fighting the law because “I know how important this care is for tens of thousands of transgender youth like me.” ', '“It scares me to think about losing the medication that I need, and if this law continues, my family may have to leave Tennessee — the place I have lived and loved my entire life,” she said, adding that she doesn’t know where her family could go given how many states have passed similar legislation. ', 'The ACLU and Lambda Legal noted in their petition to the Supreme Court that circuit courts have become split on the restrictions. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a law in Arkansas, while the 6th and 11th circuits have allowed laws in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama and Florida to take effect. ', 'Twenty-three states restrict puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgery for trans minors; 18 of those measures have been challenged in court, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. ', 'As of April, an estimated 113,900 trans youths lived in states that have restricted transition-related care for minors, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. ', 'Many families with trans kids have had to work around care restrictions to continue care for their children. Some families have left their home states entirely. Others, like the Walkers, travel hundreds of miles to access care. ', 'Dr. Izzy Lowell, founder and director of the telehealth clinic QueerMed, serves trans teens and adults nationwide. She said her clinic has seen an increase in minor patients since the restrictions on transition care began taking effect, particularly across the South. She estimates that the clinic serves 800 to 1,000 minor patients and that 80% to 90% of them live in states that restrict care for minors. ', 'Patients in states with restrictions who have the resources to travel can go to states without such laws for telehealth appointments with the clinic, which is governed by the laws of the states patients are physically in during the appointments, Lowell said. ', '“A lot of my job right now is travel agent,” Lowell said. She talks with nearly every patient about where they live, what states they can and can’t travel to or when they might be on vacation or even on layovers at airports in other states. For example, she said, the clinic saw a patient who was on a layover at Boston Logan International Airport. ', 'She said the effects of the care restrictions have been really difficult for patients. ', '“I think in medicine in general, we underestimate the really significant health risks of stress, and this is stress times 10,” she said. “It’s being openly hated, discriminated against. People are fearful, truly fearful for themselves and for losing treatment, which is devastating, life-threatening for people.”', 'The election and Trump’s promises to bar trans health care for minors nationwide and prohibit Medicaid from covering trans care have increased that fear, she said. The clinic’s new patient registrations increased from an average of 10 to 15 per week to 250 on Nov. 6, the day after the election, and 150 on Nov. 7, she said. In the following week, it averaged 50 new registrations per day. ', 'Regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court case, Lowell said, her plan is to never stop providing transition-related care “to the full extent that it’s legal,” even in the face of increasing backlash. ', 'An arsonist destroyed Lowell’s practice based in Georgia last year, and she said the FBI is investigating the incident as a hate crime.', '“There’s no way to plan ahead for this, other than to keep going and do everything we can for people for as long as we can,” she said. “We won’t stop until we absolutely have to.”', 'Jo Yurcaba is a reporter for NBC Out.', '© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '']"

Barbara Comstock, an anti-Trump Republican who opposes Tennessee’s law. “If you decide a state can do this, then it puts all parental decisions at risk of being overruled by the government.”', 'The Supreme Court will hear arguments December 4 in the most important transgender rights case the justices have ever tackled, reviewing a Tennessee law enacted last year that bans gender-affirming care for minors and imposes civil penalties for doctors who violate the prohibitions.

In one appeal that has been pending at the Supreme Court for months, a group of Wisconsin parents say their school district is violating parental rights by hiding transgender support plans – allowing students to change their pronouns and bathroom use without informing parents.

And the banned use is justified because it carries too many risks without enough proven benefits, Tennessee contends.', '“The legislature determined that the cost-benefit calculus warranted permitting the surgeries and drugs subject to SB1 for some reasons and not others,” the state’s lawyers told the Supreme Court in a filing. “That is not discrimination.”', 'Leading medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, say the evidence shows puberty blockers and hormone therapy can reduce depression, anxiety and the risk of suicide for adolescents with gender dysphoria.', 'The federal district court judge who first heard the case found the doctors the state relied on to argue the treatments are too risky were “minimally persuasive based on the current record.”', ""More:Sarah McBride says transgender bathroom bans at Capitol are 'attempt to misdirect' from big issues"", 'In its briefs to the Supreme Court, Tennessee emphasized that some European countries have tightened restrictions on the treatments.

To her relief, the North Carolina law made exceptions for children who were already receiving treatment.', '“I should just be able to go five minutes down the road and have my child taken care of and medication easily received and not have to have a 12-hour trip,” Sarah told CNN, using a pseudonym out of concern for her family’s safety.', 'Parents like Sarah and transgender communities across the United States will be paying close attention Wednesday as the US Supreme Court hears arguments in US v. Skrmetti – a case that could determine whether states can ban certain forms of gender-affirming care for trans children and teens.', 'The case, brought by the Biden administration on behalf of families of trans youth, challenges the constitutionality of Tennessee’s gender-affirming care ban, which restricts puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors and enacts civil penalties for doctors who violate the law.', 'Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti argued in court documents the law ensures “minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy.” Attorneys for the plaintiffs, however, point to major medical organizations that have said the treatments are safe and may be medically necessary.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nIn transgender care case, Supreme Court to consider how far equal protection goes', 'Since the state law was enacted last year, parents like Sarah have gone to extraordinary lengths to seek out-of-state treatment for their trans children. Some have told CNN they are dipping into their life savings and taking on debt so they can afford the costly travel.', 'The direction and scope of the court’s decision would be pivotal for both sides and felt by transgender communities nationwide. A win for the plaintiffs could signal that trans people are protected from discrimination under the Constitution’s equal protection clause and bolster efforts to fight anti-trans laws that have swept the nation in recent years.', 'But a win for the state could advance efforts by Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, and other conservative groups that vowed to restrict how trans people can access health care and perform other everyday tasks in ways that align with their gender identity, including playing sports and using the restroom.', 'As the parties present their oral arguments on Wednesday and wait for the court’s ruling to be handed down next year, here’s how the decision could affect trans communities:', 'If the court rules the Tennessee ban is unconstitutional, it will deliver a resounding win for transgender rights advocates. Similar state laws would be effectively invalidated, and trans youth would gain greater protections in accessing gender-affirming care, legal experts say.', '“That would be a monumental achievement for the trans legal movement, and it remains a distinct possibility,” said Kate Redburn, co-director of Columbia Law School’s Center for Gender and Sexuality Law.', 'For the children and teens who have been unable to get care to treat their gender dysphoria – the mental distress a person feels when they feel their sex assigned at birth doesn’t align with their gender identity – being able to access this health care could have a transformative effect, said Dr. Maurice Garcia, director of the Cedars-Sinai Transgender Surgery and Health Program.', '“Gender dysphoria is an enormous distraction from life. It’s a barrier to living life in a normal, full way, where you enjoy your day, you enjoy going out with friends, you enjoy being in public,” Garcia said.', 'Gender-affirming care, which for youth may include puberty suppression or hormone therapy, helps transgender people live in accordance with their gender identity. Access to these treatments can help ease anxiety and depression, which occur at high rates among transgender youth – largely because of stigma and social isolation, Garcia said.', 'Currently, 26 states across the US have passed laws restricting gender-affirming care for trans youth, though bans in Montana and Arkansas have been temporarily blocked, a CNN analysis of data from the Movement Advancement Project shows. The Williams Institute, a public policy think tank at the University of California Los Angeles, estimates more than 110,000 teens live in the states where bans are in effect.', 'The court’s decision would undermine only bans that are structured similarly to Tennessee’s – in a way that trans rights advocates say discriminates between trans and cisgender children – meaning some state bans could remain in effect, said Redburn.', 'It’s also possible the Supreme Court could send the case back to the appeals court to consider Tennessee’s law with “heightened scrutiny” – a higher legal standard than the appeals court used last year when it upheld the ban. Applying heightened scrutiny to gender-affirming care restrictions would require states to show they have an important government interest that is “substantially related” to banning the treatments.', 'Lawyers for the Biden administration, who have argued the Tennessee ban would not pass this stricter standard for review, have suggested the justices could consider whether the law passes constitutional muster under heightened scrutiny instead of leaving it to the lower court.', 'Sarah, the mother in Tennessee, said the stakes for receiving hormone therapy could not be higher for her child. Before receiving the treatment, she says, her son became withdrawn and increasingly frustrated as puberty transformed his body in ways he hated. By the time he was 15, he had attempted suicide three times, she said. But since undergoing testosterone therapy, her son feels confident, outgoing and more at peace with himself.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nHe’s the first known transgender lawyer to argue before Supreme Court. For Chase Strangio, the mission ‘is not lost on me’', '“I had friends of ours come up and tell me how much they could see that difference and the light in his eyes,” Sarah said. “Within a few months (of receiving hormone therapy) it was just a huge change. It was amazing.”', 'But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would not be the end of the fight over health care access for trans communities, said Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the Williams Institute.', '“I think we’d expect to see states continue to innovate ways to ban access to gender affirming care,” said Redfield, who co-wrote a brief to the court in support of the plaintiffs.', 'Redfield pointed to Arkansas, where the state’s ban on gender-affirming care has been blocked by a judge. Even so, Republican lawmakers passed another law last year that allows patients who received gender-affirming care as minors to file a malpractice lawsuit against their doctor for up to 20 years after they turn 18 – a far longer period than is typically allowed for medical injury claims. The law, which she called a “backdoor ban,” would make it very difficult for physicians to get malpractice insurance coverage and effectively disincentivizes doctors from providing the treatment.', 'A court ruling that upholds the Tennessee law would bolster the national patchwork of trans health care bans, making gender-affirming care for minors much more difficult to access in half of the country and potentially opening the door for wider restrictions for trans people, Redburn said.', 'Transgender advocates fear the lack of health care access could exacerbate mental illness among trans minors and, in extreme cases, push some families to leave the state entirely.', 'In general, transgender youth grapple with significant mental health issues, research shows. A 2018 study found trans youth reported mental health problems at rates sevenfold higher than their cisgender peers. About half of transgender and nonbinary youth in the US reported considering suicide, and 14% made an attempt, according to a 2024 survey.', '“Untreated gender dysphoria can be all-consuming,” said Shawn Meerkamper, a managing attorney at the Transgender Law Center.', 'In a brief written to the court, Meerkamper and other LGBTQ advocates argued that lack of access to gender-affirming care has caused some trans youth “extreme distress, including severe anxiety and depression, substance issues, self-harm, and/or suicidality.”', 'As families in states with trans health care bans grow increasingly desperate, Meerkamper said he has seen people split up their household, sending one parent to live in another state with their trans child while the other parent and siblings stay behind because of work and school obligations.', 'Nearly half, or 45%, of transgender and nonbinary people surveyed by the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, said they or their family have considered moving to a different state because of “LGBTQ+-related politics and laws.”', 'Sarah has already explored what it would take to uproot her family to a state where her trans son could receive treatment. “I will do whatever will keep us safe and him happy,” she said.', 'By ruling that Tennessee is not discriminating against trans youth based on their sex, and therefore are not shielded by the equal protection clause, the court could provide a green light for conservative lawmakers to extend their health care restrictions to trans adults, according to Redburn.', 'Lawyers for the plaintiffs also argue that the decision could have implications for Americans writ-large, providing a “stepping stone towards further limiting access to abortion, IVF, and birth control.”', 'They point to the possibility that the court could apply part of its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, which allowed states to ban abortion. In a short aside in his Dobbs decision, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that abortion regulations do not discriminate based on sex and would not require heightened scrutiny – the stricter standard used to determine the constitutionality of laws that classify individuals based on certain characteristics.', 'Tennessee has relied heavily on this argument while defending its gender-affirming care ban. The state argues its law equally applies to both trans girls and trans boys and should be considered a regulation of medical care.', 'Such medical regulations for minors is an issue that should be left to elected officials, the state argues.', '“Nothing in the Constitution deputizes Petitioners to override the legislature’s judgment and demand a policy they believe to be more favorable,” Tennessee officials wrote in a court brief.', 'But attorneys for the plaintiffs argue the law clearly discriminates based on sex because it does not apply to cisgender children. For example, a doctor could prescribe puberty blockers to a cisgender child undergoing puberty too soon but could not prescribe the same medication to a trans child to prevent them from undergoing puberty in a way that would exacerbate their gender dysphoria.', 'No matter the outcome of Skrmetti, Meerkamper said, transgender communities would still have other legal avenues to fight laws restricting trans rights, as several district courts are considering challenges to anti-trans laws.', '“We’re always going to be here, and we’ve always been fighting and surviving because we’ve always had to, and that’ll be true no matter what happens at the Supreme Court,” he said.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

SCOTUS must uphold that,” by Sen. Ken Yager, Nov. 27 (online) and Dec. 1 (print).', 'Senator Yager’s attack on transgender people feels like a “What’s  Wrong with This Picture” puzzle.The scene looks normal. Yet, a one-way-street sign points up. A worker on crutches wears rollerblades. Uncle Sam waves the Union Jack. All the details are wrong.', 'Yager says that “children are not equipped to make life-altering decisions.” Parents,  however, sign the contracts and pay the bills, not children.', 'Yager suggests that gender identity is a new problem for youth in the U.S.  Archeological evidence, however, shows transgender identities go back thousands of years.', 'Transgender people are present around the world. Gender transition occurs from age 5 to 70-plus. Most transgender people are adults.', 'Yager reports “heartbreaking stories” of mistreatment of children. Yet, during legislative hearings, no Tennessean claimed harm. Parents and children were enthusiastic about the care. The premier Journal of the American Medical Association supports gender-affirming care for youth. Satisfaction with the care is high.', 'One person at the hearing claimed harm. A California employee of a hate group called Do No Harm gave testimony in legislatures around the country. Billionaire investor Joseph Edelman is Do No Harm’s principal funder.Dissatisfaction comes from bullying by others.', 'Here is the kicker. Yager’s ban caused harm. Suicide rates increased markedly in states that banned medical care compared to states that did not ban medical care.', 'Yager mentions new bans in 26 states. Political motives drove these laws, not a concern for children. Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s first TV ad of 2024 was a dishonest attack on transgender adults.', 'Tens of millions of dollars pushed anti-trans ads in the 2024 presidential election. Rather than clarify medical issues, the ads deliberately misled just like Yager’s broadside.', 'Malcolm Getz is a professor emeritus of economics at Vanderbilt University.

Supreme Court to hear historic argument on transgender rights,https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-hear-historic-argument-115821944.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing Wednesday in an appeal involving transgender rights that could be the most important case of the court’s term.', 'The legal question in the case, called United States v. Skrmetti, is whether a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors violates the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. How the court answers the question could affect similar laws across the country and transgender rights more broadly.', 'Three lawyers are set to argue to the justices in Washington. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar represents the federal government and Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice represents the state, whose attorney general is Jonathan Skrmetti (hence the case name, United States v. Skrmetti). American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Chase Strangio represents the original plaintiffs in the lawsuit: transgender adolescents, their parents and a doctor who treats adolescents with gender dysphoria. Strangio will be the first openly transgender lawyer to argue at the court.', 'It’s not unprecedented for more than two parties to argue in a case. But the dynamic could be especially important here because the incoming Trump administration could take a different position than the Biden administration, which intervened in the suit against the state law. So it’s possible the group Strangio represents will be the only adversarial party to Tennessee when the justices eventually decide the case, if the federal government tells the court it no longer disagrees with the state after Trump takes office next month.', 'A decision is expected by the summer, when the court usually finishes ruling on cases heard during the term that started in October.', 'For now, at least, the federal government opposes the state. Arguing that the law, called SB1, is unconstitutionally discriminatory, Prelogar’s office wrote in a brief ahead of the hearing that, under the law:', '... an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can. And that focus on sex and gender conformity is deliberate: SB1 declares that its very purpose is to “encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex” and to ban treatments “that might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.”', '“That,” the federal government argues, “is sex discrimination.”', 'Defending the law, the state wrote in its own brief that it’s “not unconstitutional discrimination to say that drugs can be prescribed for one reason but not another.” The state further argued that the law doesn’t classify people based on sex but rather “creates two groups: minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.”', 'Like the federal government, the private parties represented by Strangio argue that the law “imposes differential treatment based on the sex an individual is assigned at birth.” In support of their position, they cite the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which said that an employer violates federal civil rights law when they fire someone for being gay or transgender.', 'Notably, that 6-3 ruling was authored by Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, so those justices’ questions at the hearing will be among the important ones to watch for.', 'Subscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in Donald Trump’s legal cases.', 'This article was originally published on MSNBC.com']"
Left-Wing Media Rally To Defend Transitioning Children Ahead Of SCOTUS Case ,https://www.dailywire.com/news/left-wing-media-rally-to-defend-transitioning-children-ahead-of-scotus-case,"[""Every major media outlet reviewed by The Daily Wire portrayed the case as endangering the rights of 'transgender children'"", 'Ahead of a major Supreme Court case on gender transition procedures for children and young people, left-wing media outlets are overwhelmingly describing surgeries, hormones, and puberty blockers for children as “care” — and suggesting that restricting these procedures endangers children. ', 'On December 4, the United States Supreme Court will hear United States v. Skrmetti, which deals with Tennessee’s law banning irreversible gender transition procedures for children. Left-wing legal groups led by the ACLU and President Joe Biden’s Justice Department sued to stop the law from taking effect, ultimately leading to the Supreme Court taking up the case. ', 'Every major media outlet reviewed by The Daily Wire is portraying the case as endangering the rights of “transgender children” and the ability of these children to access necessary medical procedures. These outlets also portrayed transgender surgeries, hormones, and puberty blockers as “care” necessary for these youth. ', 'CNN, for example, reported that the Supreme Court is “reviewing a Tennessee law enacted last year that bans gender-affirming care for minors.”  The outlet argues that the case creates a “conservative ‘reckoning’ over parental rights,” and in a separate story, argues that “trans Americans continue to be a key target for Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, who has frequently attacked the community during his reelection bid.”', 'USA Today writes that “GOP-led states” are “trying to restrict gender-affirming care, sports participation and bathroom access for transgender people,” adding that Donald Trump has spent “millions of campaign dollars attacking transgender rights.” ', 'This framing mirrors the rhetoric of major activist organizations, including the ACLU, Human Rights Campaign, and GLAAD. All of these groups support gender transition surgeries, hormones, and puberty blockers for minors, and they promote activist assertions that young people suffering from gender dysphoria may commit suicide if they do not have access to so-called “gender-affirming care.” ', 'The 19th News cites alleged experts who said the case “will decide whether Tennessee can continue to ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth,” warning that it “could imperil the ability of all Americans to make decisions about their health care, experts say.', 'One of these experts, Shannon Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, argues: “If we don’t win here, it’s going to be open season on any health care related to transgender people…It would be devastating. I mean, absolutely catastrophic.” ', 'CHECK OUT THE DAILY WIRE HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE', 'Recent research has shown that, contrary to these claims, such procedures actually increase the likelihood that minors will attempt suicide. According to an April study, “Gender-affirming surgery is significantly associated with elevated suicide-attempt risks, underlining the necessity for comprehensive post-procedure psychiatric support.”', 'Readers won’t find that research cited in the Washington Post, which described transition procedures as “gender transition care for people younger than 18,” arguing that “major medical associations have said lower rates of depression and suicide in transgender individuals.”', 'The New York Times, meanwhile, reported that the law bans “certain medical treatments for transgender minors,” arguing that Republicans have “pushed to curtail transgender rights in recent years.” ', '“Many American medical groups have endorsed youth gender treatments as evidence-based and necessary,” the Times argues. In a separate piece, the Times refers to gender transition procedures for children as “the rights of transgender minors.” ', 'None of the outlets appear to have included the perspective of detransitioners, a growing cohort of individuals who tried to transition before realizing such a thing is impossible. These individuals, such as Chloe Cole, describe how they suffered devastating mental and physical consequences from surgeries and hormonal drugs. ', 'KFF, supposedly an “independent source for health policy research, polling, and news” often cited by major outlets on abortion topics, refers to the subject at hand as “youth access to gender affirming care.” ', 'The Tennessean published an entire profile on the “Tennessee family behind the Supreme Court’s trans health care case,” including a photo shoot with the teenage boy who identifies as a girl and is one of the plaintiffs in the case. ', 'The outlet’s coverage of the case is very clearly biased against the state Republicans who enacted the law. An Instagram post from the Tennessean suggested that Tennessee was “dangerously hostile” to young people who identify as transgender.', '“Tennessee Republicans voted to make it illegal for transgender youth to be prescribed certain medications and treatments used to treat gender dysphoria,” the outlet states.

Transgender care for minors gets first Supreme Court review: What to know,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3244426/transgender-care-minors-first-supreme-court-review-what-to-know/,"['The Supreme Court will soon hear arguments in a landmark case that could set a pivotal precedent on states’ authority to regulate transgender hormone therapy procedures for minors.', 'At the heart of the set for oral arguments Wednesday is whether Tennessee’s Senate Bill 1 (SB1), a law barring puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries for minors, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.', 'While Republican lawmakers, including incoming President-elect Donald Trump, have sounded alarms about matters of fairness surrounding biological men competing on female sports teams, a larger underbelly of concern is brewing over the more than 14,000 minors who have undergone transgender-related procedures since 2019.', 'SB1 is “a law that is directed at children and at protecting children from the irreversible effects of some very serious procedures,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti told the Washington Examiner in early October.', 'The case was initially brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other top law firms in defense of “families with transgender adolescents,” according to a press release from the ACLU. President Joe Biden’s Justice Department intervened in the case after a federal appeals court upheld Tennessee’s law, asking the Supreme Court to take up the dispute.', 'Oral arguments at the high court on Dec. 4 will represent one of the most significant constitutional debates, marking the first time the justices will weigh in on the legality of bans targeting transgender procedures for minors. Meanwhile, advocates of protecting children, as well as pro-transgender activists, are preparing to rally at the Supreme Court as early as Tuesday.', 'Here is what you need to know before oral arguments commence at the Supreme Court on Wednesday at 10 a.m. EST.', 'The justices are tasked to decide whether SB1 unlawfully discriminates under the Fourteenth Amendment or constitutes a legitimate exercise of state authority to protect minors from medically and scientifically uncertain procedures.', 'Tennessee argues the law is rooted in valid medical and age-based distinctions, not invidious discrimination, while challengers at the ACLU contend it violates equal protection by singling out minors who contend they want to change their gender.', 'This case invites the Supreme Court to clarify the boundaries of state power in regulating contentious medical practices, much as it did in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. The outcome will have far-reaching implications not only for Tennessee but also for more than 20 other states with similar laws on the books.', 'Tennessee’s SB1 prohibits medical interventions intended to allow “a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or to treat “purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity,” according to the text of the statute.', 'While the law’s prohibitions outlaw invasive surgeries for minors, the ACLU’s dispute focused more narrowly on the prohibition of puberty blockers for minors, arguing the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause is implicated because it does not prohibit such medicines for minors facing other ailments besides gender dysphoria.', 'The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the law, with Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton finding that SB1 “treats similarly situated individuals evenhandedly” and does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny. However, the challengers have emphasized the Biden administration’s support for heightened review under the reasoning of Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which extended Title VII protections to gender identity.', 'Christopher Green, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law, contends that the justices could take a novel approach to the equal protection clause or a viewpoint that it functions to protect people and property from violence, not discrimination. Green was cited by Justice Clarence Thomas in a 2022 14th Amendment case over gerrymandering in South Carolina', '“So under that view, really what the court should be doing in all these antidiscrimination cases is looking — instead of at the equal protection — looking at ‘citizenship,’ and ‘equal citizenship’ in particular,” Green said.', 'The case comes to the high court amid growing concerns over the safety and efficacy of medical interventions for minors. Puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, according to Tennessee and its supporters, carry risks of irreversible harm, including diminished bone density, fertility problems, and increased risks of cancer and cerebrovascular disease.', 'The medical community in the United States remains divided on the use of gender-transition treatments for minors, with more and more doctors now speaking up about the irreversible consequences of these hormone-altering drugs.', 'Dr. Jared Ross, a senior fellow at the nonprofit organization Do No Harm, highlighted these risks in an interview with the Washington Examiner, describing the emotional pressures parents and guardians face to agree to transitioning their children.', '“These are desperate parents looking for answers, and this is often sold as a silver bullet … We know this path starts with social transition, moves to puberty blockers — promoted as safe and reversible — and eventually leads to irreversible surgeries. But we know these claims are not true,” Ross said.', 'Critics of SB1 say the law rejects a supposed “medical consensus” that supports these interventions.', 'However, Skrmetti’s office argues in court filings that this so-called consensus is politically driven, pointing to a doubling of transgender-identifying minors from 0.7% to 1.4% in recent years while adult rates have remained constant.', 'Tennessee has garnered robust support, with dozens of amicus briefs filed in favor of the law, including one signed by 56 physicians from various specialties, including Ross. Nearly 14,000 minors received transgender-related treatments between 2019 and 2023, including nearly 6,000 surgeries, according to data cited in DNH’s brief.', 'Many of the briefs supporting Tennessee say the state’s law echoes policy shifts in European nations, including Sweden and Finland, which have tightened restrictions on medical interventions for minors amid concerns over long-term consequences. Those pro-Tennessee briefs also raise flags about groups such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which utilize their questionable studies to push the notion that minor transition procedures are “medically necessary” for survival.', 'Europe’s decision to pump the brakes on these expanding medical sciences coincides with a rising number of detransitioners, individuals who regret or reverse gender-transition procedures, are increasingly speaking out about the irreversible effects of these treatments, further fueling the debate.', '“We’ve seen a growing number of detransitioners who start to speak out about being pressured into these procedures and about the damage that these procedures have done to their bodies, irreversible damage, in some cases,” said Skrmetti.', 'The Skrmetti case will be argued by three main parties, including Tennessee Solicitor General James Rice, in favor of the law, while Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and an ACLU attorney will share argument time against SB1.', 'Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Rights Project, will present arguments on behalf of families that sued against SB1. Strangio, 42, is also a biological female who identifies as a man and is set to become the first transgender individual to argue before the nine justices.', 'Some legal experts have raised questions about what the justices will ultimately do if the incoming Trump administration reverses its legal position from the current Biden administration’s stance and begins to side with Tennessee’s law and what that will mean for their decision in the case. Ed Whelan, the Antonin Scalia chairman in Constitutional Studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said an opinion from the late Justice Sandra Day O’Connor might offer clues to this question.\n\nO’Connor’s writing in Director of Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v. Perini North River Associates (1983) says once a case is “properly brought here, the case-or-controversy requirement can be satisfied even if the parties who are asserting their adverse interests before this Court are not formally aligned as adversaries,” Whelan cited in a recent National Review post, suggesting the Supreme Court here could likewise continue crafting their ruling.', 'While legal experts interviewed by the Washington Examiner were optimistic the majority on the Supreme Court is likely to uphold Tennessee’s law, they offered a variety of possible routes the justices could take when they issue a ruling sometime before June next year:', '1. Affirmation of SB1: The Supreme Court could uphold the law, ruling it a constitutional exercise of state authority to protect minors.', '2. Partial Ruling: Justices may find aspects of the law, such as bans on surgeries, constitutional while striking down restrictions on puberty blockers or hormones.', '3. Complete Rejection: The Supreme Court could find the law to run afoul of the Constitution’s equal protection clause and remand it back to the district court to likely rule against SB1.', 'CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER', 'If the decision is made on the merits of the case, it will resonate far beyond Tennessee. An affirmation of SB1 could encourage other states to implement similar bans, while a rejection could impose new constitutional limits on state regulation of transgender care.', 'Oral arguments can be livestreamed beginning at 10 a.m. EST Wednesday on the Supreme Court’s webpage.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"
