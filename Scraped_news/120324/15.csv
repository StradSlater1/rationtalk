In general, I’ve found it's important to review the background check, the committee work and the public hearing.”"", 'Trump announced his selection of Patel to lead the FBI over the weekend. Christopher Wray, the current leader of the bureau who was originally appointed by Trump in 2017, has been confirmed to a term through 2027. That means Patel, if confirmed, would usurp Wray from the seat years ahead of schedule.', 'Trump can only afford to lose three Republican votes on any nominee if Democrats are unified in opposition.

In Trump’s statement announcing his intent to nominate Patel, he commended the soon-to-be nominee for playing “a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution.”', 'Trump has personally railed against the FBI, particularly after agents conducted a search for classified documents at his residence at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.', 'A number of GOP senators on Monday evening said they thought Patel could be confirmed.

So lawmakers must now ready yet another stopgap that keeps federal agencies running on static funding — after they already punted on spending back in September.', 'Schumer said on the floor Monday that ""both sides are making progress negotiating on a bill that will pass the House and Senate with bipartisan support.""', ""“We need to keep divisive and unnecessary provisions out of any government funding extension, or it will get harder to pass a CR in time,” he added. “For now, I'm pleased negotiations are on the right track.”"", ""Republicans had been waiting for Trump to indicate if he preferred a stopgap bill that punted funding decisions into his term or if he wanted lawmakers to negotiate new spending levels now, so he could focus on other legislative priorities as he took over the executive branch. Trump has been uncharacteristically silent on the issue, but lawmakers are running out of time to incorporate the president-elect's stance into bipartisan and bicameral talks if they want to avoid a shutdown. Johnson has said he and Trump talk frequently about funding, but the speaker won't divulge the details of those discussions."", 'If Trump weighs in with sweeping demands closer to the deadline, when many details have already been hammered out, it could increase the chance of a deal falling apart. Neither party wants a shutdown at this point.', 'The length of the funding patch, known as a continuing resolution or a CR, as well as what special exceptions are included and how much disaster aid is attached will be the main focus of negotiations.', 'House conservatives are advocating for a new March deadline, which would bring it perilously close to a late-April trigger that would mean sweeping funding cuts unless Congress passes a bill with new spending levels by then. Democrats and many appropriators in both parties want an earlier deadline, both to defuse the risk of those cuts and to give federal agencies budget certainty sooner.', 'Leaders also aim to clear tens of billions of dollars in disaster aid this month, likely attached to a funding patch, despite calls from some GOP senators for a standalone vote. The White House requested more than $98 billion in emergency funding to help cover the costs of recent natural disasters, including Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton.', 'And Democratic and Republican negotiations are each pushing to add funding for other priorities that could prompt partisan skirmishes. GOP lawmakers also want to leave out funding the White House sought for things like climate and education programs.', 'The speaker long ago swore off a pre-Christmas so-called omnibus spending package that bundles the dozen individual measures that keep federal agencies funded each year, a mammoth bill that now regularly totals over a trillion dollars. Congress is out of time to pass all 12 bills individually through both chambers, a process that lawmakers now struggle to complete every year.', 'Conservatives in the House have long protested the omnibus process and would likely be incensed if Johnson green-lighted such a bill now. They favor passing a stopgap bill this time, arguing Trump and the GOP majorities next term should set spending levels. Given Johnson needs to keep GOP lawmakers unified behind him before the formal Jan. 3 speakership vote, resorting to a stopgap this month helps him by delaying Republican infighting until after he has re-secured his post.', 'Lead Art: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) talk at the Capitol.

The caucus hasn't met in over a year, after Republicans grew deeply frustrated with centrist Democrats in the group for not stepping in to help rescue McCarthy's speakership."", 'Their meeting could be a sign the caucus will start up its bipartisan work ahead of next Congress, which will retain an incredibly thin margin.', 'By NICHOLAS WU and DANIELLA DIAZ', 'The Senate Judiciary Committee does not have the resources to conduct in-depth background checks of Cabinet or federal judicial nominees if the FBI does not conduct them, Chair Dick Durbin said Monday.', ""“What the FBI pours into these nominees, we can't match at the Senate Judiciary,” Durbin said."", ""But the Illinois Democrat expressed confidence with how his Republican successor, incoming Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), would run the confirmation process, saying he trusted the Iowan would “handle it professionally, and I'm counting on him to do that.”"", 'ANTHONY ADRAGNA', 'Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is urging the incoming Trump administration to mull recusal options for any federal judges that opt to “unretire” from active service following the results of the November election.', 'The comments come on the heels of a deal on judicial confirmations that could leave Trump with four more circuit court nominations to fill. Should judges reverse course following the results of elections, McConnell argued they could place a “finger on the scale” of impartiality.', ""Majority Whip Dick Durbin noted there have been countless breaks in precedent over the last decade on federal judicial vacancies, such as when McConnell declined to consider a Supreme Court vacancy during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency.

We keep promises and meet deadlines!” What nation would not want to say that sometimes?', 'It was unfair of those who tweeted, “In Britain it’d still be a charred heap while they did a bat survey”, since the 1980s’ York Minster restorers did well too. But in our potholed public realm, it is hard not to reflect that in the same week as the Notre Dame fire a smaller, newer icon of engineering came to grief: and Bazalgette’s 1887 Hammersmith Bridge is still closed to motor traffic five years later because nobody agrees who should fix it.', 'Alas, “c’est l’Angleterre”. French citizens can probably cite plenty of their own potholes, Raac-built schools, dodgy cladding and untended urban dereliction, but you can’t help envying them that triumphant “C’est la France!” moment.', 'The passion around the world to raise Notre Dame again set me thinking about churches. Dedicated unbelievers plus Jewish and Muslim leaders all collected for the re-opening of an ancient Christian symbol; 1,300 workers gave a special cheer to the Muslim, Azzedine Hedna, who raised the scaffolding.', 'A cathedral is not some civic ornament or tourist trap but a place of Christian worship, yet even the most faithless or actively hostile can hardly help relating to it.', 'Smaller ancient churches do that too: Philip Larkin’s poem Church Going expressed this perfectly. Visiting casually, he glances at “some brass and stuff up at the holy end”, sniggers at the hectoring verses on the lectern, donates an Irish sixpence and wonders whether, as Christianity fades, only superstitious sentimentalists and historians will visit the “accoutred frowsty barn”. Yet he ends up standing in silence and accepting it as “a serious house on serious earth”: a place where a visitor can surprise a hunger in himself to be more serious, even if only because the dead lie all around.', 'He perfectly captures the reluctant awe which makes old stone reach out to the impatient modern heart. In the first pandemic year, before vaccines and with Welby closing all the churches, I was walking past our St Andrew’s and the 15th century ruins of its even longer history. Music broke the lockdown silence: two young women with cello and harp playing under the arched porch.', 'Not, they said sheepishly, for reverence’s sake but for the acoustic. But it felt electric: six hundred years of human skill, prayer and gathering reached out defiantly from a serious house where the faithless and devout, the merry and the sorrowful had gathered and sung.', 'In Dunblane after the 1996 school massacre people in shock instinctively turned to the cathedral, some who had never before been inside. Even on ordinary weary days there can be unexpected reassurance in some flinty old church, incongruous amid glass-and-plastic towers, billboards and burger houses — Ipswich has several such. Even when a church is extended, given lavatories for the congregation or totally laicised for community use, it breathes a timeless steadiness. The long dead laboured to build it, wanted its tower taller than the trees, greater than mankind.', 'So now let me abruptly and unsettlingly pivot to the subject of Rachel Reeves, the Treasury and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. There is a serious current worry about something noticeably unmentioned in the budget. Buildings age fast these days, with pollution and traffic vibration. At the moment, under the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme (LPWGS) church (and mosque, and temple) repairs get relief from VAT.', 'As any groaning householder knows, new-builds escape that 20 per cent tax, but it is levied on any repairs to existing ones. LPWGS, introduced 20 years ago by Gordon Brown, lets VAT be claimed back. But that expires in March next year, and 36 MPs and many church leaders and charities are begging Ms Reeves to renew it and not, as they fear, claw back the typical £25-40 million a year to fill the famous “black hole”.', 'The National Churches Trust points out that the UK is unusual in Europe because these buildings — 38,500 of them Christian — are almost entirely the responsibility of local people, and used not only by worshippers but community groups of all ages. “Most of the UK’s food banks are based in churches, more than there are UK branches of McDonald’s,” says the trust.', 'Add to that the historic and artistic interest, and the Larkin moments about which I emoted a few lines back, and wince at how many churches are already on or beyond the edge of closing. The Church of England repairs backlog alone is more than a billion pounds. So it would be national self-harm to make it 20 per cent harder for people to keep all those roofs, towers and crumbling corners safe.', 'Given the propensity of ministers to blunder into precisely such self-harm, the warnings are needed.

Money and leadership are essential, but the most important thing of all in any prestige building project is the quality of the labour. Top people work fast and produce top results. Mediocre craftsmen, no matter how much time they are given, can only ever produce mediocre results.', 'At the Notre-Dame rebuilding, great care was taken by the leadership to cast far and wide for the absolute creme de la creme of craftsmen, wherever they were to be found. ', 'As a result, among the 250 companies and hundreds of engineers, masons, carpenters, stained glass specialists and other professionals enlisted to work on the rebuilding, there were people from all over the world.', 'The master carpenters, for example, working to recreate the wooden beams of the cathedral’s roof trusses, were from the United States, the UK, Spain, Denmark, Bosnia and India, as well as France.', 'They included Christians, Jews, Hindus and Muslims, all chosen because of their high level of skill in using the traditional medieval methods of craftsmanship, skills now in retreat under the onslaught of computer precision, mass production and the relentless advance of industrial technology. ', 'When Europe’s great cathedrals were built over a thousand years ago, they, too, were at the forefront of science. Their size, their height and their sheer complexity were the very embodiment of the latest engineering technology.', 'Nothing comparable had been seen on the European continent before except in modern Spain and Portugal, where Arab Muslims, originally from Syria, had been ruling for nearly 800 years, and in Sicily, where Arab Muslims originally from Egypt and North Africa, had been ruling for over 250 years.', 'These men had a deep understanding of geometry, building stresses and vaulting techniques, knowledge that had been widespread across the Islamic world since the eighth and ninth centuries', 'In both the caliphate of Cordoba and the emirate of Sicily, the construction world was dominated by Arab Muslim structural engineers and craftsmen, men who were both literate and numerate, unlike their European Christian counterparts.', 'These men had a deep understanding of geometry, building stresses and vaulting techniques, knowledge that had been widespread across the Islamic world since the eighth and ninth centuries when the great Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom) centre of learning in Baghdad was at its peak. ', 'It is no accident that the first stone vaulted structures appeared in Latin Christendom just 10 years after the fall of Toledo, where the 10th-century ribbed vaulted mosque dome of Bab al-Mardum - today the church of Cristo de la Luz - is still extant and visitable.', 'Likewise, in Pisa, where there was no pre-existing local building tradition or school of architecture, Pisa Cathedral (1064) and then the Leaning Tower appeared suddenly on Italian soil soon after the Pisans’ successful military campaigns against the Arab rulers in Sicily.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Pisa’s original cathedral dome was supported on Islamic-style squinches and slender pointed-arch windows, while the engineering challenges of the tower would have required advanced geometrical knowledge - the famous lean is the result of subsidence, not faulty construction. ', 'More proof of Arab involvement in churchbuilding comes in the Arabic numerals, with their distinctive cursive shapes, carved as assembly marks, found by chance in the roof timbers at Salisbury Cathedral (1220s) during a dendrochronology study sponsored by English Heritage. They were also an accidental find, carved as position markers on the stone sculptures, on the famous Wells Cathedral West Front (1175).', 'Since English craftsmen at that time could only manage the simple straight lines of Roman numerals, and Arabic numerals did not enter general use in Britain till several centuries later in the 1500s, the carpenters and masons employing them as early as the 12th and 13th centuries were clearly highly educated foreigners, brought in by wealthy bishops and abbots keen to sponsor the absolute top level of construction money could buy. ', '', '', '', '', 'At Wells Cathedral, construction was halted when the funds allocated for the building were diverted, following the death of the bishop, to pay the huge litigation costs between rival claimants to his bishopric of a court case in Rome at the papal curia.', 'The masons, no longer being paid, simply marked up their final sculptures with Arabic numbers to indicate their correct niches on the West Front, then moved on to their next commission.', 'When the dispute was finally resolved 15 years later, local masons were the only ones on the scene to erect the sculptures.', 'To them, the Arabic symbols were just incomprehensible hieroglyphs, so they put them in the wrong niches, even adjusting the niches to make them fit.', 'Researchers in the most recent restoration have now established that, had the sculptures been put back in accordance with their original Arabic sequencing, they would have fitted perfectly.  ', 'The masons’ marks on display on the back wall of the Cordoba Mezquita are overwhelmingly Arab names written in Arabic script, showing how the 10th-century craftsmen were literate centuries ahead of their European Christian counterparts.', 'They were the products of a sophisticated society where learning was encouraged by the ruler and enjoyed by all, thanks to free education offered by mosque schools. In Christian Europe, only the clergy and a handful of the upper classes could read and write.', '', '', '', '', 'Names in themselves can be misleading. In the town of Corleone, for example, inland from Palermo, there were Christians called Muhammad, Abdullah, Ahmad and Ali, living alongside Muslims with Greek names, who could pass for Sicilian Christians.', 'Donation records in Greek during the Norman period in Sicily use phrases like ""Roger who was once called Ahmad"", showing how local Muslims adapted their names to fit in better to the new environment and new masters, just as foreign workers arriving in Britain today might adapt their names or be given nicknames that are easier to remember and pronounce. Jews have done the same thing across Europe and America for centuries.', 'When the names of craftsmen first started to appear in the Latin chronicles, like William of Sens, thought to have worked on Notre-Dame, and much vaunted for introducing six-part rib vaulting to England at Canterbury Cathedral in 1174-77, we cannot assume he was Christian. He might have been Muslim, or Mozarab (an Arabised Christian).', 'Either way, in order to have had the requisite mathematical and geometrical knowledge for rib vaulting at that time, he must have been schooled in the Islamic tradition.', 'At the recent Notre-Dame rebuilding, a traditional carpentry company called Atelier de la Grande Oye, founded by French Muslim Paul Zahnd, was among those chosen to build the wooden frames supporting the new roof.', 'In an email to me, he expressed great pride at this honour, a pride likely to have been felt in equal measure by the top Muslim craftsmen working on Christian buildings in medieval times.', '""As French Muslims,"" he wrote, ""we are very proud and happy … to communicate our beautiful crafts and our faith, which are of course perfectly compatible, feeding one another … we prayed all along the work, to bless the trees, our craft, our friendship, the Almighty who allowed us to be part of the project, to bless all the people who work with us, to celebrate the beauty and majesty of our creator … some of us are affirmed Muslims claiming our faith and our joy to rebuild a cathedral."" ', '', '', '', '', '', 'What an irony that across Europe, at the time of writing, there are increasingly loud calls from far-right parties to rid their country of immigrants, especially Muslims, in order to save the ""purity"" of their own race and culture, evidently unaware that their very civilisation was built on the superior skill of immigrants. ', 'All the evidence has shown that it is not necessary to be a Christian in order to create Christian art, just as people of all faiths and none can enjoy and appreciate church music, church architecture, Islamic decorative styles and mosque architecture.', 'Muslims could put their expertise to use in churches, just as Christians could build mosques, and indeed have done, throughout history.', 'The important consideration was not their religion but their skill.

"Gargoyles, stained glass and the spire: How Notre-Dame was restored",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qdj80py3no,"[""French President Emmanuel Macron has toured Paris's Notre-Dame cathedral live on TV, giving the public a first look inside the building since much of it was destroyed or damaged in a huge fire in 2019."", 'From the spire to the stained glass, it has been completely transformed. It is not just a renovation after the fire, but a complete overhaul including removing decades of crud and soot built up since the last restoration.', 'Here we take a look at some of the key features of the repair work and how it was achieved.', 'The collapse of the spire was the climax of the 2019 fire. Many people thought it was medieval, but in fact the original was taken down in the 1790s because it was deemed dangerous.', 'Its replacement, which burned down five years ago, was put up decades later as part of a neo-Gothic reconstruction conducted by architect Eugène Viollet-Le-Duc.', 'This time, carpenters used a mix of the traditional and the computerised to design and build the massive wooden base.', 'It was lifted into place by Europe’s largest crane, then a scaffolding shell was mounted allowing workers to assemble the steadily rising structure.', 'Like the rest of the roof, the spire is lined with lead. At the top a new gilded cock has been fitted to replace the original that fell in the fire. It was recovered but was too damaged to go back.', 'Inside the new cock are holy relics including a thorn from the cathedral’s Crown of Thorns, and a parchment with the names of 2,000 people who worked on the renovation.', 'The most striking feature of the renovated cathedral is the luminosity of the stonework. This is because all the limestone blocks have been cleaned, or in some parts replaced.', 'Replacement stone was sourced in quarries in northern France. Experts were able to detect tiny features in the original stone – like certain fossils – that helped them to determine the geographical origin.', 'The vast majority of the masonry was undamaged, but it was covered not just in age-old accretions of dust and dirt from the past, but also in a layer of soot and lead powder from the fire. It was cleaned with high-power vacuums, and then with a spray which peeled off to remove the dirt.', 'Overall some 40,000 square metres of stone were cleaned.', 'To rebuild the vaulted ceiling beneath where the spire had stood, masons had to relearn the principles of Gothic architecture – using a wooden frame to put the stones in place and crowning it all with the keystone.', 'It was the wooden roof that burned – all 100 metres of it. None of the 800-year-old timbers survived. But the decision was quickly made to replace them as faithfully as possible – with oak from the forests of France.', 'By happy coincidence an architect called Remi Fromont had conducted an in-depth study of the timber frame as part of his university thesis. This served as a template for carpenters.', 'Some 1,200 oak trees had to be found, with the stipulation that they be straight, free from knots and a condition called ""frost-crack"", and 13 metres long.', 'Much of the wood was hand-sawn then hewed into shape with axes, just as the beams were in the 13th century.', 'Altogether there are 35 ""fermes"" (the triangular structures that take the weight) running the length of the building.', 'Many of the exterior sculptures – including the famous (but not medieval) gargoyles and chimaeras – were damaged by high-pressure hoses used to fight the fire. Many were already in poor condition because of pollution.', 'A workshop was set up in front of the cathedral to repair and where necessary replace these statues. Five of the gargoyles (products of Viollet-le-Duc’s imagination) were scanned by computer, and then re-made in limestone.', 'Inside the cathedral, the most famous sculptures – such as The Virgin of the Pillar and The Vow of Louis XIII – emerged unscathed. But they have all been cleaned and given minor repairs.', 'The cathedral\'s many paintings have also been cleaned. These include the ""Mays"" – massive scenes from the life of Christ which were an annual gift to the cathedral in the 17th Century from the goldsmiths of Paris.', 'One of the most remarkable changes to the cathedral is the return of colour to the choir and many of the side-chapels.', 'Here again, the fire offered an opportunity to rediscover the glories that lay beneath decades of crud and soot. Blues, reds and golds have re-emerged, combining with the creaminess of the rejuvenated limestone to create a lightness that must be much closer to the original experience.', 'The same is true of the stained-glass windows. These were undamaged, but filthy. They were dismantled, removed, cleaned, and returned. The big rose-windows were left alone.', 'Again, much of what the visitor sees today is not actually medieval – but the product of the medieval imagination of Viollet-le-Duc.', 'The great organ – built in the 18th Century – was unaffected by either heat or water on the night of the fire. What did for it was the accumulation of a yellow dust - lead monoxide - in its pipes.', 'The whole structure – 12 metres high, six keyboards, 7,952 pipes, 19 wind-chests – was disassembled and taken to workshops outside Paris.', 'Sheep-leather linings were replaced and new electronic controls were added. After reinstallation the instrument was re-tuned – a task which takes several months as each pipe is minutely altered.', 'On 7 December, the Archbishop of Paris’s first words on entering the reclaimed cathedral will be: “Awake oh organ, Let God’s praise be heard!”', 'The eight bells of the north tower were also removed in 2023 – a massive operation given their size. They were cleaned and treated, and then returned a few weeks ago. The biggest of the bells is called Emmanuel.', 'Visitors will also notice a change to the liturgical lay-out of the cathedral, whose altar, lectern and seating were all destroyed. A simple bronze altar has been created, with new chalices for the sacraments.', 'There are 1,500 new wooden chairs for the congregation, and a new reliquary behind the choir to hold the Crown of Thorns.', 'New vestments have also been created for clergy by designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.', 'Renovation work at Notre-Dame has been a boon for archaeologists, who have been able to access underground areas that date back to hundreds of years before the cathedral was built.', 'Among the many sets of bones they discovered are those believed to belong to the Renaissance poet Joachim du Bellay.', 'Another major discovery was the carefully buried remains of the medieval rood-screen, which originally separated the sacred part of the church from the congregation.', 'This 11-metre stone partition, built in the 13th Century, contained rich and colourful sculptures depicting the life of Christ. It was dismantled in the 18th Century following a change in church rules.', 'But clergy clearly hoped the remains would be rediscovered because the parts appear to have been lain with great care beneath the ground. It is hoped they can be pieced together and put on display.', 'Despite the success of the renovation, work is not complete. There is still scaffolding around much of the eastern end, and in coming years the outside walls of the apse and sacristy will need treatment.', 'There are also plans to redesign the esplanade, and to create a museum in the neighbouring Hôtel-Dieu hospital.', 'French President Emmanuel Macron visits the rescued, renovated and refurbished cathedral in what is a breathtaking visual treat.', 'The gothic cathedral in Paris has been refurbished following a devastating fire in 2019.', 'Thales UK, which has its headquarters in Berkshire, employs more than 7,000 staff across the country.', 'We spoke to passengers taking part in the first Eurostar journey from Waterloo on 14 November 1994.', 'A Paris court orders a medical examination of the French actor accused by two women of sexual assault in 2021.', 'Copyright 2024 BBC.

‘Notre-Dame still retains some of its mystery’: the surprises revealed in the restoration,https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/12/02/notre-dame-still-retains-some-of-its-mystery-the-surprises-revealed-in-the-restoration,"['The rose window in the northern arm of the transept undergoing restoration in 2021', 'Photo: © Yves Gallet, 2021', 'The fire that tore through the roof of Notre-Dame devastated the cathedral, leading many to fear for the World Heritage Site’s future. But despite the tremendous loss, the fire has given experts an exceptionally rare opportunity to investigate parts of the cathedral’s structure that were previously unreachable, revealing forgotten burials and providing insights into the working methods of medieval artisans.', ""“The worksite enabled us to collect an enormous and unprecedented amount of data on the materials used in the construction of the cathedral's masonry, and on the way in which these materials were worked and put up together,” says Yves Gallet, a professor of the history of medieval art at Bordeaux-Montaigne University, who leads the working group studying the cathedral’s masonry. “In order to do this, we had to be able to examine the walls, pillars and vaults very closely—which we were able to do from the scaffolding, with unrivalled precision in observing and recording the data, and with the possibility of taking samples from places that had not previously been accessible.”"", 'Once firefighters had quelled the blaze, experts began the complex work of securing the building and sorting the piles of damaged materials, both for study—to guide future restoration—and in the hope that some could be reused. These specialists were divided into nine working groups—among them, metal, stone and glass—and the archaeologists excavated spaces where scaffolding and cranes would be installed, and conducted geophysical surveys. As melted lead had contaminated the air and materials, the researchers had to conduct their collection and analysis with extreme care. Experts drove remote-controlled robots—one with a bucket, one with a claw—to pick up materials and move them to safe zones, wore protective clothing and masks, and even used decontamination showers on site.', 'Members of the stone working group examine a wall in the 12th-century Gothic cathedral', 'Photo: © Aurélien Letouzé', 'As work progressed, archaeologists revealed the remains of a first-century building beneath the Soufflot crypt; excavated more than 1,000 sculpted fragments of the rood screen destroyed in the 18th century; and identified over 100 burials of both laypeople and clergy. Significantly, they also found two lead coffins in the transept\xad—a place of honour for burial. One of these coffins contained the remains of Canon Antoine de La Porte, who died in 1710 and was identified by a plaque on the coffin lid. The other body was anonymous, but has since been identified as Joachim du Bellay, a 16th-century poet and one-time canon at Notre Dame.', '“We identified a deceased male between 30 and 40 years old, who had been autopsied and showed bone and meningeal lesions caused by tuberculosis,” says Eric Crubézy, a professor of biological anthropology at the University of Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier, who studied the body. “These findings form a set of arguments pointing towards Joachim du Bellay. Indeed, individuals buried in the cathedral within this age range were rare, and the probability of finding such lesions was even rarer. All these elements strengthen the hypothesis of an identification with Joachim du Bellay, whose biography we have re-examined.”', 'Researchers made discoveries above ground too. The fire revealed previously unknown iron elements in the cathedral’s structure, studied by the metal working group, while the wood working group has examined the roughly 10,000 pieces of the building’s burned wooden roof to understand more about its assembly and construction, and even to reconstruct France’s climate in the Middle Ages. The stone working group, meanwhile, gained valuable insights into the methods used by medieval stonecutters.', '“The fire had also caused some of the vaults to collapse, making it possible to examine them ‘from the inside’,” Gallet comments. “Some surprising discoveries were made, such as the very thinness of the vaults, the presence of hundreds of masons’ marks, and the remains of one of the 12th-century oculi [circular windows] in the chevet [eastern end]walls, although these oculi were thought to have been removed in the 13th century, which will allow us to better reconstruct the aspect of Notre-Dame in its original 12th-century state.”', 'These discoveries confirm the deep knowledge of the medieval stonecutters and masons, Gallet says, but shows that they were experimenting too. In the nave, the stonecutters appear to have hesitated when coordinating the ribs that support the vaults, for example. Once all this data has been digested and cross-referenced with the results from the other working groups, experts will no doubt need to revise the detailed chronology of the cathedral’s 12th and 13th century construction phases, Gallet adds.', '“The most surprising thing is to be able to discover so many new things about a cathedral that is undoubtedly the most famous in the world, and to realise that despite its fame, Notre-Dame still retains some of its mystery,” Gallet says. “What’s also surprising is to realise that the construction is full of approximations and irregularities, even though it is considered to be the epitome of perfection in Gothic architecture.”', ""Though the Parisian cathedral's nave is expected to reopen to the public by the end of 2024, work to restore the entire site could last until 2028"", 'A small army of carpenters combined traditional craftmanship with digital design tools to rebuild the medieval roof frame known as ""the forest""', ""Over four years, and often perched on scaffolding, Axelle Ponsonnet has documented the project's progress behind the scenes"", 'The 19th-century spire has collapsed on the medieval landmark', '']"

I’m infinitely grateful to you, France is infinitely grateful to you.”', 'Resurrecting Paris’s Notre Dame, one of the world’s most celebrated buildings, from the ravaging flames in 2019 came with a hefty price tag.', 'It was estimated to cost a whopping 700 million euros ($737 million), according to from Rebuilding Notre Dame de Paris, the public body headed by Philippe Jost, which was tasked with the restorations.', 'In total, a staggering 846 million euros ($891 million) was raised through donations from 340,000 donors in 150 countries. Jost has previously said that any donated money that isn’t spent on the reconstruction will likely be used to “benefit the cathedral” in other ways.', 'French President Emmanuel Macron concluded his visit to Notre Dame with a lengthy address honoring the hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other tradespeople who helped restore the cathedral in just a bit more than five years.', '“We’ve never seen such a construction site. You have all participated in the construction project of the century,” Macron said.', '', 'The French leader, who choked up with emotion toward the end of his speech, profusely thanked the audience for helping him “keep this promise to rebuild Notre Dame in five years.”', '“You did it. And it’s an immense source of pride for the entire nation. I’m infinitely grateful to you, France is infinitely grateful to you,” Macron said.', '', 'Notre Dame’s formal reopening will take place on December 7 and the first public mass will be held the following day.', 'From inside Notre Dame, CNN’s Senior International Correspondent Melissa Bell saw the finished labors of the cathedral for the first time.', '“As you walk in, what hits you is just how light and bright it is,” Bell said.', '“You realize that before the fire, many centuries of worship and passage and life had meant that it was very dark. There was something really somber when you came inside. That has been completely transformed,” she said.', '', '“It isn’t so much they’ve restored it to its glory of five years ago, but that they’ve restored it to its glory of many centuries ago.”', '“It’s incredibly beautiful but it almost feels like a different cathedral,” Bell added. “You can see it for the first time.”', 'French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “very happy” to be among those who helped rebuild Notre Dame to wrap up his final visit to the cathedral before its formal reopening on December 7.', '“You have transformed ashes into art,” Macron told the crowd, which included more than 1,300 people who worked on the restoration, gathered inside the cathedral.', '', 'Macron’s office said it had also invited donors who had written to the president to express their sadness after the cathedral went up in flames.', 'Outside the cathedral, dozens of artisans, scaffolders, roofers, sculptors, painters, engineers, technicians, fire safety officials and members of the public stand and cheer as President Emmanuel Macron wraps up his tour.', 'They’re now getting a tour of the new look Notre Dame before Macron speaks.', 'Many cheer and clap as they enter to see inside.', 'According to the Elysee, “The president was keen to invite those citizens who wrote to the Elysée Palace the day after the fire to express their sadness, and who contributed to the reconstruction with a donation. Among them were pensioners, a translator and a family carer, all of whom came to be present for this final site visit and to discover the restored Notre Dame.”', '', 'To wrap up the tour, Macron is taking a look at the grand organ.', 'The organ is 12 meters wide, 10 meters tall and has over 8,000 pipes and 115 stops, while it didn’t catch fire it did get damaged by lead dust that was released by the blaze.', 'The Elysee said the stop is important as it is the “return of its voice.”', 'Speaking to Macron, Christian Lutz, an organologist and contractor for the organ restoration project, said the instrument reflected the best of the of French organ workmanship throughout history.', 'Lutz said the Grand Organ had pipes from the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries and had become “a condensed summary of the whole history of the French organ.”', 'This post has been updated with additional information.', 'President Emmanuel Macron, First Lady Brigitte Macron and Philippe Jost — who is charged with overseeing the Rebuild Notre Dame project — have moved into the cathedral’s most sacred space – the Choir of Notre Dame, which features a bronze tabernacle on architect Viollet-le-Duc’s altar and the statues that make up the Vow of Louis XIII.', 'The choir is a place for religious worship in Notre Dame. According to the cathedral’s website, it is pointed towards Jerusalem, the place where Christians believe Jesus Christ was crucified.', 'Incidentally, the sculptures had only been restored four months before the blaze in 2019. In the aftermath, the statues had to be carefully steam-cleaned and restored from fire damage – a process that took two and a half months. But behind those sculptures, the Choir’s Glorious Cross stood tall, undamaged by the fire in the church.', 'According to the Elysee, the Cross is now viewed as a symbol of resistance.', 'We’re onto the last stage of the tour of walkways, taking in the southern ambulatory, which is one of several spaces where people can move around the choir, observe the painted chapel walls and be in pensive thought.', '“We’re always between the past and the present in Notre Dame,” Clara Baier, construction manager at the cathedral said, as she spoke to the president about the restoration efforts. “We’re between the ancient and modernity.”', '', 'The renovation: This space had to be decontaminated and thoroughly cleaned due to the presence of lead dust released during the fire. After being thoroughly cleaned, the creamy colors of the limestone walls have been revealed once more.', 'Ariel Weil, the mayor of central Paris – which includes the 1st through 4th arrondissements – told CNN’s Anna Coren that the Notre Dame cathedral is “almost brand new.”', '“For the first time, it’s been entirely cleaned up,” Weil said. “It’s amazing.”', 'During the interview, Weil recounted what it was like the night Notre Dame went up in flames:', '“We stepped in the cathedral, in the dark mess of the cathedral. It was 1 am or 2 am, [I was] with the President, we had to walk over the pipes and over all of the debris, and it was gloomy, and we were happy it was saved, but we saw the extent of the damage and the amount of work that it would need. And to see that five years down the line, it’s been repaired to the point that it’s more beautiful than it ever was, maybe in the past 100 years. It is very moving.”', '', 'Weil described entering the refinished church as almost “disturbing looking” because what was once a somber, dark interior of a cavernous gothic cathedral now shines brightly.', 'Weil said that once the church reopens to the public, the city expects 14 to 15 million people to visit each year.', '“I’m sure that people are going to flock massively to the site,” he added.', 'The south rose window, offered as a gift by King Louis IX, has been restored to its full glory.', 'It’s not the first time it’s been rebuilt, had to be reconstructed in the 18th and 19th centuries too.', 'President Emmanuel Macron is meeting with Marie Parant, who restored wall paintings in the St Marcel’s chapel at Notre Dame Cathedral.', 'All the artwork in Notre Dame was restored at once — a first in the building’s history.', 'Twenty-nine chapels surround the interior of the cathedral. They were not part of the original plans for the space but added in the 13th century, with each following a pattern: a starry blue ceiling, two walls decorated with consistent motifs, and one wall featuring a historical scene.', 'Macron’s next stop is one of those chapels named for Saint Marcel.', 'According to the Elysee, the wall painting found here “illustrates the transfer of the relics of Bishop Saint Marcel from the suburb that bears his name to the cathedral, where they were preserved until the Revolution and became the object of particularly fervent devotion.”', '', 'The paintings of the chapel were covered in decades worth of dirt, but according to Philippe Jost, who has overseen the construction effort, have now been resurrected to their original colors.', '“We forgot that the chapel’s 19th century paintings had such an array of colours,” Jost said ahead of the unveiling.', '', 'Jost paid tribute to Parant, who worked with dozens of people to clean the artworks and restore them to their original colors.', 'President Emmanuel Macron has now toured a mural in the north enclosure of the choir, restored by Maud Pouliot.', 'The chancel screen is on a rood screen — an ornate partition that separated the nave from the choir. It was badly damaged, but restoration started on the screen in September 2022 and was completed by the summer of 2023.', 'While it was being restored by Pouliot, ancient engravings were discovered which depicted part of the scene of the Last Supper, an important story in Christian doctrine.', 'The Elysee said the pieces were cleaned with a gel then reattached with a filler from a syringe. Then, the missing pigments are reapplied.', 'Julien Le Bras, the CEO of one of the firms charged with rebuilding Notre Dame’s spire and its base, told French President Emmanuel Macron that he and his fellow artisans worked to restore one of the most iconic pieces of the cathedral.', '“We’ve all fought to restore France’s image,” Lebras told Macron while showing him the new base of the spire from inside the roof of Notre Dame.', '', 'The spire’s collapse was a particularly dramatic and tragic moment during the 2019 fire that nearly destroyed the cathedral.', 'Lebras explained that his company partnered with several competitors from across France, putting aside their “small rivalry” to rebuild one of Notre Dame’s most iconic architectural elements.', '“We put all the patience, all the energy, all the heart we had into trying to beautify this work,” Lebras said.', 'President Emmanuel Macron’s next stop on his tour of the cathedral, at the framework of the transept crossing, is significant as it’s where the new spire rests.', 'It was one of the most emotional and recognizable moments of the 2019 fire that engulfed Notre Dame: When the spire tumbled into the church as bright orange flames climbed out of the building.', 'The oak frameworks and lead roofing of the nave, choir and transept of Notre Dame were reconstructed to look exactly like the originals, according to Rebuild Notre Dame.', 'The rebuilding of these areas provided the base on which the iconic spire could be rebuilt.', 'Some background: First designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century, the spire was one of the key architectural elements of the church. It was 96 metres tall and collapsed in the 2019 fire. Its replacement was installed and released of scaffolding early last year.', 'The new design of the roof above the transept crossing also has a new built-in feature: being fireproof.', '“While the roof frames have been recreated as faithfully as possible, they have nonetheless been endowed with a modern fire protection and prevention mechanism completely renewed,” the Elysee said.', '', 'Among those strategies include twostop fire trusses which separate different areas of the roof to stop fire from spreading, and a security hub where all important information is conveyed, the Elysee said.', 'If you want to see it for yourself, check out this video of the first interior shots in the cathedral:', 'Described by the Elysee as “one of the most symbolic” moments of the visit, the medieval roof structure above the choir is a key element of Notre Dame’s Gothic architecture.', 'Before the fire, the roof was nicknamed “the forest” because it was made with oak trees from across France, and due to the density of the vaults. It was the epicenter of the blaze before it collapsed, according to the French government.', 'To ensure the integrity of the cathedral’s reconstruction, carpenters in charge of the choir and nave’s framework traveled with foresters to source 1,200 oak trees from several forests around the nation for the roof structure over the nave and choir.', 'Once the trees arrived at the carpenters, they recreated the 13th century methods to ensure the structural integrity of the beams once more. The wood was worked just as it had been in the Middle ages — while still green, shaped by hand-axe before being left to dry.', 'President Emmanuel Macron has stopped to look at the statue of the Virgin of Paris.', 'The statue, also known as the “Virgin of the Pillar” was first sculpted in the 14th century and arrived at Notre Dame in the 19th century.', 'After the fire, a stark image of the statue stood, resolute as burnt wood and collapsed stones surrounded it.', 'The intersection of Notre Dame forms a Latin cross, according to the cathedral’s official website. The transept is the horizontal arm of that cross and is the third stop on Macron’s tour of the reconstructed site today.', 'There, Macron is meeting with Henry de Reviers, a director of restoration company Lefevre, which was involved in the restoration of the cathedral, along with other companies.', 'Liturgies take place in the transept, and notably the north rose window still has original 13th-century stained glass.', 'But, it was an area that was badly damaged in the 2019 inferno. According to Philippe Jost, charged with overseeing the Rebuild Notre Dame project, the destruction of the vault in the transept was one of the “most regrettable” parts of the damage caused. The spire had been directly above that vault, but came crashing into the cathedral when it collapsed.', 'The great vault at the crossing is the tallest in the cathedral, nearly 35 meters high and on it rests the spire.', 'Before reconstructing the great vault, France’s National Institute for Preventative Archaeological Research conducted a survey to ensure no artifacts would be damaged. In doing so, they found tombs in the cathedral, according to the Elysee.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

The Photos of the Notre Dame Restoration Are Bumming Me Out,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story/the-photos-of-the-notre-dame-restoration-are-bumming-me-out-160604090.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'It was supposed to be the prize at the end of a gloomy day spent traversing the pothole-riddled road from Armenia to Georgia and vertiginous mountain passes in blinding rain. But when my boyfriend and I arrived, we found the ancient Akhaltsikhe Castle (Rabati) cartoonishly new. Just a few years before, this fortress dating back to the 9th century had been restored and rebuilt. I don’t know if it was the freshness of the mortar or that the stones were recently hewn, but it all felt like a theme park. Especially when contrasted to the number of historic monasteries we’d visited in Armenia, valiant but worn in their battle against time and the elements.', 'I was reminded of that disappointment this week, and of my conflicting desires as a history-lover, when photos were published of the restored interior of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. Where once the stones of its vaulted halls were darkened with centuries of soot and grime, they are now sparklingly clean. Wandering its paved floors, even the shadows had shadows. Now the new Notre Dame is as brightly lit as a department store.', 'Perhaps I will feel differently once I see it in person (it reopens to the public in a week), but the rebirth of Notre Dame feels to this American more Gothic Revival than Gothic. If I’m being less generous, it’s giving LVMH takeover. If I’m being downright catty, millennial makeover.', 'I’m not Parisian, so I’m aware that my preferences aren’t those of a city battling not to be turned entirely into a museum à la Venice and Rome. But the main allure for Americans to Europe—which Europeans so gleefully mock us for—is being able to see, touch, smell, and experience the passage of time. There’s a reason people prefer the Marais and Saint-Germain-des-Prés to the squeaky-clean Belle Epoque neighborhoods around Parc Monceau and the like.', 'I appreciate that this new Notre Dame, this bright and warm space, is likely how Gothic architecture was meant to be experienced by its creators. Our desire or demand that Gothic or anything Medieval be somber and grey is as historically inaccurate as statuary inspired by the Greeks being left unpainted or thinking that Renaissance and classical villas had spartan and “clean” interiors.', 'But there was a little slip made on the tour President Macron took yesterday that I think encapsulates my frigid reaction. Speaking to Macron, Philippe Jost, the head of the reconstruction task force, declared, “I believe you are seeing the cathedral like it has never been seen before.”', 'I agree, I’m just not sure that’s a good thing.', 'In R.F. Kuang’s recent fantasy best-seller Babel, there is a section in which a professor and students debate what it means to “truly” translate an author’s work. Without getting too into the weeds, it talks about the battle between translating “word for word” versus trying to translate the spirit of a work. If you go word-for-word, you lose the meaning, but if you try to translate ideas you are inevitably going to introduce your own biases and so on.', 'The same goes for restoration. Do you go back and recreate exactly what was once there, restoring everything to pristine original condition as at Akhaltsikhe? Do you leave part of the ravaged-by-time ruins in place and rebuild or restore part of it so visitors can have a sense of both? Or do you merely keep the ruins from crumbling further?', 'What if the newly-formed Greek government in the early 19th century had decided to restore the Parthenon to its appearance before its destruction in a Venetian bombardment? I wonder how what we consider “classical” tastes would have changed if we’d decided to go around repainting Greek statues as they would have been.', 'What about rebuilding Medieval castles? I often find it very hard to imagine what was once there, when walking inside what is often just a crumbling set of stone walls. I think one of the things that makes Pompeii so alluring is that it’s easy to visualize the streets, houses, and buildings with how much is left. What if the Roman Forum was more than a bunch of lopped-off columns?', 'The thousands of craftsmen who worked on Notre Dame scrubbed its stones of centuries of filth, revealing the light Lutetian stone. Tiled floors were cleaned. And wall paintings returned to their original luster.', 'So it must be asked. Is the “real” Notre Dame the Notre Dame as it looked when it was first built? When additions were made over the centuries? In my mind, it’s the Notre Dame I saw for the first time nearly 20 years ago. The one where Esmerelda was hiding in its shadows from Claude Frollo.', 'Historically, it was considered desirable for the restorers of painters to inhabit the style of the painters whose work they fixed up. You, as a viewer, shouldn’t be able to tell anything was touched up. Some even saw their job as perfecting that which hadn’t been perfected. That’s sort of how Viollet-le-Duc saw his job when renovating Notre Dame in the 19th century. “To restore a building is not to preserve it, to repair, or rebuild it,” he claimed. “It is to reinstate it in a condition of completeness which could never have existed at any given time.”', 'Now, the trend is for you to be able to see restoration work. Whether a building or a painting, the newer parts are often done in different materials to make it obvious where work was done. Deceiving viewers is a no-no.', 'Part of me wishes they’d done a version of this and left us a little section of the old Notre Dame, a place where your mood was inevitably shifted by the combination of beauty and tangible history.', 'Oh well, c’est la vie.', ""Author of the weekly newsletter Getting Around with William O'Connor and the aviation editor for Travel + Leisure.

It's taken 5.5 years and three-quarters-of-a-billion donated dollars for this World Heritage phoenix to rise from the ashes."", 'After the fire, President Macron set a five-year deadline for the restoration of Notre Dame, which some people thought was insufficient time. But a dedicated and skillful army of artists, artisans and craftsmen has succeeded.', 'And, today, a week before a service of rededication, the French president came for a final incident of inspection.', 'Dr. Dorothee Chaoui-Derieux, Chief Heritage Curator, Ministry of Culture (through interpreter): The cathedral, as you will rediscover, is very different from the one everyone remembered.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', ""Archaeologist Dorothee Chaoui-Derieux led teams identifying and cataloging collapsed remains, so they could be correctly used in the reconstruction. She's also a founder of the Artisans Choir. This is one of their last rehearsals before Notre Dame reopens for worship."", 'Dr. Dorothee Chaoui-Derieux (through interpreter):', 'The masonry in particular was very dark. It was the dust of centuries that had finally accumulated. Me, in my memory, I really had the image of a very, very dark, very dark cathedral. The stained-glass windows had not been cleaned for a very long time as well. There, we will find a stone that is very, very blond.', ""It's true that it's a cathedral of light today that we're going to rediscover, which doesn't correspond at all to the image we had of it, but I'm sure it will really please all those who will have the chance to rediscover it."", 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'One imperative was to reconstruct the distinctive ornamental spire fashioned from 500 tons of timber and coated with 250 tons of lead.', 'Patrick Jouenne was the lead carpenter.', 'Patrick Jouenne, Lead Carpenter (through interpreter):', ""It's going to come back to the Parisian landscape for many years to come. It's truly a source of pride personally and for the group of carpenters who worked with me. It's really an honor."", 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'As Jouenne watched flames consume the spire, a sixth sense drove him to give up his job southwest of Paris.', 'Patrick Jouenne (through interpreter):', ""I'm a believer but not very religious. I always thought that I would be the one to rebuild the spire. Was it a gift or at least a sign? I never doubted it. When I left my job, I didn't have confirmation that I'd be working on the rebuild, but I always felt like something was guiding me."", 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'He set about recreating the 19th century vision of architect Eugene Viollet-Le-Duc.', 'Patrick Jouenne (through interpreter):', 'We had to use exactly the same techniques as before or at least assemble things as closely as possible to make it look 100 percent like what was there before. So I looked back at the documents from 1858 by the carpenter at the time. And, wow, what an honor to touch the papers drawn by the former workers involved in the project. It was really moving.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'Mission accomplished. The workers gathered in the nave to listen to the president singing their praises.', 'Emmanuel Macron, French President (through interpreter):', 'We owe this metamorphosis to you. You were the magicians of this construction site and you changed charcoal into art.', 'Dominique Perrault, Architect (through interpreter):', ""In France, there's a very, very important historical heritage. There are schools dedicated to preserving this know-how."", 'Malcolm Brabant:', ""Dominique Perrault is one of France's most distinguished architects and town planners, renowned for modern designs and repurposing historic buildings."", 'Dominique Perrault (through interpreter):', ""And the know-how of all these craftspeople is a marvel, a treasure, and Notre Dame is an absolute perfect demonstration of this. It's wonderful what has happened to Notre Dame, this new life and a country, truly a country behind this restoration, behind this ambition of restitution."", ""At last, France has risen up as one to say, let's rebuild. Let's rebuild. Let's rebuild right away."", 'Malcolm Brabant:', ""Thanks in no small part to the leadership of this man, whose royal sense of humor disguises a passion for his vocation. This humble cubicle is the domain of Philippe Villeneuve, the chief architect of France's national monuments."", 'Philippe Villeneuve, Chief Architect (through interpreter):', 'When I was young, I used to build my model of Notre Dame out of wood, cardboard, whatever you like. And when I closed the vault of the north transept, which was the first vault we closed, well, I felt like I was still 16.', ""But then I was working on the real thing, and that's where I still can't quite get over the fact that I'm the one in charge."", 'Malcolm Brabant:', ""Villeneuve insists that no corners have been cut in the drive to meet President Macron's deadline."", 'Philippe Villeneuve (through interpreter):', ""When you look at the photos just after the fire, when you look at the way it looks now, you say to yourself, there's no way we could have done this in five years or so. In fact, we were able to do it because we had the means, thanks to the donors, both large and small."", 'And we really have to thank them, because this is the first time we have been able to say that we built a cathedral almost entirely from the inside out.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', ""So what's the judgment of Villeneuve's peers?"", 'Dominique Perrault (through interpreter):', ""Perhaps, if we'd been under Napoleon, we might have imagined something different. And maybe, in 50 years, 200 years, when Notre Dame catches fire once again, maybe there will be other ideas."", 'But, today, as we have seen with the Olympic Games, Paris is a city that puts great importance on its heritage. Restoring Notre Dame to its original form was certainly the right choice.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'But is there anything you would have done differently?', 'Dominique Perrault:', 'No.', 'Anna Russakoff, American University of Paris: Notre Dame lives up to the old medieval motto of Paris, that she floats with the waves, but never sinks.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'Anna Russakoff is professor of art history at the American University of Paris.', 'How do you think history would judge the reconstruction of Notre Dame?', 'Anna Russakoff:', ""I think they did a very solid job. They have really preserved a lot of the monument and kept it in a way that's quite recognizable to people and also preserving a lot of the earlier medieval building techniques and materials."", 'And this is something that hopefully will last for hundreds of years to come.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'Even in driving snow, people come to feast their eyes. Among them, Dr. Paul Rock, who, as a history major, first visited Notre Dame 35 years ago. Rock is now senior pastor at the American Church in Paris.', ""Dr. Paul Rock, Senior Pastor, American Church in Paris: I believe that we're all inherently spiritual, and there's something about this space, even in a secular state like France, that brings people together and calls together both the historical and also the revolutionary past that brings us to higher ideals of equality and unity and love."", '(Bells Ringing)', 'Malcolm Brabant:', 'The bells, the bells of the sound of worship are making their presence felt after a long absence. This was the return of a medieval statue known as the Virgin of Paris.', 'Dr. Paul Rock:', 'Thousands of Parisians in this secular country sang songs and held candles and processed back with her to Notre Dame. To me, it was just the epitome of, yes, things burn down and the world can feel very divided, and we fall down, but, with perseverance, we stand back up again.', 'And so Notre Dame, to me, is a symbol of the perseverance of hope.', 'Malcolm Brabant:', ""These past five years may have seemed like an eternity, but, viewed through the prism of Notre Dame's 860-year-long history, the fire and her renaissance are just a moment in time."", 'For the ""PBS News Hour,"" I\'m Malcolm Brabant in Paris.', 'Watch the Full Episode', 'Nov 29', 'By Thomas Adamson, John Leicester, Associated Press', 'Dec 07', 'By John Leicester, Associated Press', 'Jun 08', 'By Associated Press', 'Malcolm Brabant', 'Malcolm Brabant has been a special correspondent for the PBS Newshour since 2015.', 'Support Provided By:\nLearn more', 'Support PBS News:', 'Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.', '', 'Read Dec 03\nSouth Korean president declares emergency martial law, says opposition sides with North Korea', 'Watch Dec 02\nTamara Keith and Leigh Ann Caldwell on reaction and backlash to Biden’s pardon of son', 'Read Nov 26\nWho are Trump’s Cabinet picks?

Notre Dame is back – but not quite as you knew her,https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/style/notre-dame-reopening-restoration-intl/index.html,"['Politely hidden behind construction hoarding, razor wire and a gauze of scaffolding, “Our Lady of Paris” has been healing.', 'Five years after the flames roared and the world held its breath, Notre Dame cathedral is coming back to life.', '“It’s a wonder. Even for us who are very often in the cathedral, it doesn’t get old, it gets more beautiful every day,” Philippe Jost, the head of the effort to rebuild Notre Dame, said in November.', '“There’s a Sistine Chapel effect,” he said of returning to the beloved landmark, with something to see and discover wherever you look.', 'With the cathedral set to open to the public on December 8, even today, the cause of the catastrophic fire that blazed through the monument on April 15, 2019, remains a mystery, though investigators believe it was accidental.', 'Regardless, the numbers behind the reconstruction efforts are striking. Restoring the historic monument to its former state has cost an estimated €700 million ($737 million), according to Rebuilding Notre Dame de Paris, the public body headed by Jost which is responsible for the work. Overall, €846 million ($891 million) were raised in donations from 340,000 donors in 150 countries, with the extra funds used to restore other monuments.', 'Beyond that, there are the materials used in its rebuilding: The tallest oak felled was 27 meters tall (88 feet high), 1,300 cubic meters of stone were replaced, 8,000 organ pipes (belonging to France’s largest instrument) cleaned and retuned, 1,500 solid oak pews hewed – all the work of 2,000 dedicated artisans.', 'The result of their labor is even more impressive.', 'A few steps beneath the cascading statues of the cathedral’s magnificent façade, dark gives way to light.', 'The naked columns of the cathedral soar up to the ceiling; the walls, stripped of centuries of dust and grime, appear brand new.', 'The cost of the fire hasn’t just been financial – the careful cleaning and restoration has stolen some of the mystical gloom and charm that visitors will remember.\u202fBut those responsible hope it will ensure the health of the building for centuries to come.', 'France’s President Emmanuel Macron set an ambitious target for reconstruction five years ago and, with his visit on Friday, returned to thank the hundreds who doused the flames and helped with restorations.', 'Over much of the preceding 2,055 days, the site had been a hive of industry, with teams cleaning marble mosaics, retouching frescoes and clambering over the anthill of scaffolding that filled the center of the landmark.', 'CNN teams have visited Notre Dame several times since the fire, even as the work ploughed on through Covid-19’s stranglehold on France.', 'For CNN cameraman Mark Esplin, one change has been most striking. He recalls how there was still a “huge hole in the ceiling” when he was granted permission to tour the site in 2019, adding: “You could see right up to the sky.”', 'Like many in 2019, a CNN team watched in horror, mere meters away, as the cathedral’s spire was wrapped in flames before toppling to the ground.\u202fLate in the evening, they heard hundreds of people gathered around the landmark raise their voices in hymn.', '“I remember the smell … Mark and I got so close that my jacket stank of smoke for days,” recalls Senior Producer Saskya Vandoorne.', 'Today, the octagonal base of the new 315-foot spire – almost identical to the one designed in the 19th century by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc – has filled that void in the ceiling. Seen by so many as a symbol of strength and dedication to the rebuilding efforts, the wooden spire finally shed its scaffolding and returned to the Paris skyline early last year.', 'Hearing the bells ring out last month for the first time since the fire was another important milestone.', 'The eight restored bells of the cathedral’s northern belfry, which was partially destroyed in the fire, tolled in early November as part of a technical test before Notre Dame’s grand reopening weekend on December 7 and 8.', 'Some Parisians hailed the return of the almost-life size statue of the Virgin Mary to Notre Dame, which also took place in November, as “miraculous.” Considered the symbolic heart of the cathedral, it was somehow spared in the fire.', 'Its return last month – during an evening procession attended by hundreds - was yet another sign of the deep emotion that this recovery has sparked in the hearts of so many in France.', 'For Monseigneur Patrick Chauvet, who was rector of Notre Dame de Paris at the time of the fire, the memories are still raw.', '“It was an apocalyptic vision, the cathedral was upside down,” he said of his first look inside Notre Dame after the blaze.', '“I haven’t fully recovered from it; it’s engraved in the depths of my being.”', 'On the night of the fire, with the air still acrid with smoke, Macron made a solemn promise.', '“We will rebuild Notre Dame. Because that’s what the French expect and because it is what our history deserves,” he said outside the ruins of the cathedral.', 'It was then that he set the bold deadline of five years to rebuild, which to many seemed an impossible task.', 'Few beyond those directly involved have been allowed in to see how the specialized laborers and craftspeople have replicated the techniques and materials of the cathedral’s original construction.', 'But for those soon to revisit Notre Dame, this improbable victory is best seen by looking up.', 'The ceiling is a lattice of some 1,200 oak logs – the “forest” as workers call it – which were felled in a former royal wood, just like the beams that held up the original roof.', 'Harvested in France’s west, and fashioned into towering frames in the country’s northeast, the oaks of Notre Dame’s newly soaring roof, wound their way back to Paris along the River Seine.', 'Atop sits the spire, with a golden phoenix now at its summit, symbolically replacing the rooster that was found amid the rubble of the fire.', 'Remarkably, most of the original beams of the cathedral dated from before 1226, with the oldest from a tree felled in 1156.', 'Even today, the country boasts the world’s largest reserve of mature oaks, a unique boon for the rebuilding efforts. Three of the oaks used in the restoration were 230 years old, according to France’s National Forestry Office.', 'Carpenters with the “savoir faire” to fashion the trees into medieval-style frames were plucked from across France and the world, a move similar to all the highly specific skills required for the restoration: stone masons, metal workers, organ builders and more.', 'These artisans, working in concert with larger companies, were able to repurpose antiquated building practices at scale, in lieu of faster and cheaper modern building techniques.', 'For the man tasked with overseeing the cathedral’s reconstruction, using those traditional methods was crucial. “It’s authenticity, it’s the care to respect the monument,”\u202fJost told CNN.\u202f“We use the same materials, oak and stone, and with the same techniques.”', 'Stripped bare of her usual trappings – the pews, hymn books and candles of everyday worship, the tourists of our age and the pilgrims of centuries past - Paris’ treasured cathedral has not been the same.', 'But despite the indignity of the restoration - the noise, plastic sheeting and metal bars - the majesty of Notre Dame is undeniable.', 'Perhaps the most recognizable elements within Notre Dame are its famed stained-glass windows – masterpieces of French Gothic art – and, in particular, its three rose windows set into the north, south and west facades.', 'While the glass extraordinarily survived the fire, it required careful restoration to resolve smoke and lead damage as well as extensive cleaning after decades of weathering and wear and tear.', 'Years of grime have been removed, restoring the vibrant colors so that once more, lipstick reds and lapis lazuli blues bathe the cathedral’s interior when the daylight shines through.', 'In the days, months and years ahead, Notre Dame - hailed as one of the greatest instances of French Gothic architecture – will retake its place in Paris’ cultural pantheon.', 'Many will be eager for their first visit to this newly restored landmark. And the fiery colors of those famous windows will surely be all the proof needed that Notre Dame – scarred and wounded but transformed – lives on.', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.
