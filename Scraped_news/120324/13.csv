Syrian Rebels’ Surprise Offensive Highlights Assad Regime’s Weakness,https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness,"['Photo: OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP/Getty Images', 'Critical Questions by Natasha Hall', 'Published December 2, 2024', 'On November 27, Syrian opposition-armed groups launched a surprise offensive. With Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in the lead, rebels in northwest Syria quickly swept through the western Aleppo countryside. With little to no resistance from the Syrian regime and their allies, rebels were able to capture Syria’s second-largest city, Aleppo, within a day. By the evening of November 30, the rebels had taken over 100 kilometers of the strategic M5 highway linking Aleppo and Damascus. This is the first rebel offensive and a major shift in frontlines in years. The last significant change was in early 2020 when the regime displaced nearly a million people into Idlib from other parts of the province and Hama province.', 'Q1: What led to the surprise rebel offensive?', 'A1: Prior to this offensive, the frontlines in Syria’s long-running war had been relatively frozen for four years. To maintain those frontlines, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah protected the Assad regime, while Turkey preserved the opposition-held northern parts of the country, and the United States maintained forces in northeastern and eastern Syria.', 'That fragile stasis collapsed as Assad’s allies, Iran and Hezbollah, have been significantly weakened. In recent months, Israel decimated Hezbollah leadership and rank and file and penetrated highly secure locations in Iran. Hours before the offensive in Syria, Hezbollah struck a ceasefire deal with Israel, in which Israeli forces vowed to prevent weapon transfers to Hezbollah, and they have continued to strike arms shipments in Syria and Lebanon.', 'Russia has been bogged down in Ukraine and unrest in Georgia. However, the Kremlin has been pushing for normalization between Ankara and Damascus and has been frustrated by Assad’s intransigence. In the face of Assad’s refusal to reconcile, Turkey may have allowed for a rebel offensive for the first time in years to encourage the regime to reconsider.', 'Within this context, the Syrian regime had been bombarding the northwest for weeks to deter rebels from exploiting their moment of weakness. Though the opposition had been planning the offensive for months, these attacks likely increased the momentum of the rebel push.', 'Q2: How significant are these rebel gains? What does it reveal about the regime’s strength?', 'A2: This lightning-fast offensive is a monumental shift in the Syrian conflict and highlights the regime’s inherent weakness. Only after years of siege and heavy bombardment, with the help of Iran and Russia, was the regime able to capture all of Aleppo city in 2016. Within a day, rebels were able to take the city with little resistance. Rebels even captured affluent western parts of the city that had remained in regime control throughout the war.', 'The push south along the M5 highway, however, interferes with the main interests of the regime’s allies. Iran and Hezbollah use Syria as a supply route for arms and materiel. Russia has a naval and air base in Tartous and Latakia, respectively. These essential nodes of Russian power on the Mediterranean lie just over 100 kilometers from where the rebels have advanced.', 'However, despite the weakness of the Syrian regime and its allies, there are few proponents of HTS overthrowing Assad. International and regional stakeholders have long decided that Assad’s survival is preferable to an uncertain alternative. The United States and Israel may benefit from limited rebel gains to disrupt Iranian and Hezbollah supply networks, but they are displeased with HTS’ significant advances. Without governments committed to seriously threatening Assad’s power in Damascus, the opposition’s unprecedented gains may be lost as Assad’s allies recoup and launch a counterattack.', 'Q3: Who are the rebels behind this offensive, and what are their objectives?', 'A3: HTS, the most powerful and disciplined of the armed opposition groups, has led the current offensive. Its leader, Abu Mohammad al Jolani, was once the commander of Jubhat al Nusra—an Al Qaeda offshoot. While Nusra renounced Al Qaeda and rebranded as HTS, Turkey and the United States still designate HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS has maintained power in Idlib for years by controlling most economic sectors and their potency on the battlefield. Since taking Aleppo, they have tried to reassure residents, including minorities, that they will not harm them.', 'The other main umbrella group is the Syrian National Army, composed of Turkish-backed armed groups. They were less prominent in the initial offensive against the regime but have been fighting the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces and captured Tel Rifaat.', 'These clashes point to how the rebels are hemmed in by outside interests, especially Turkey. While these groups would want to push towards Damascus and overthrow Assad, Ankara is more interested in forcing a compromise on Damascus and eliminating the threat it sees from Kurdish groups in Syria. Likely, as a result of these limitations, the rebels stopped short of Hama city. They may have chosen to solidify their wins and avoid further antagonizing foreign interests.', 'Q4: How has the United States responded, and what should its strategy be?', 'A4: The U.S. response has been largely muted, aside from a statement from the White House released on Saturday, emphasizing that it was not involved in the offensive and their concern that the offensive was HTS led.', 'While the lame-duck Biden administration is unlikely to become deeply involved, failing to take advantage of this unprecedented moment would be a significant loss for U.S. interests. The window to shift dynamics in Syria is also short as the regime’s allies come to the rescue. Engaging in this unprecedented moment could be an opportunity to curb the regime’s repressive behavior and destabilizing activities and encourage refugee returns.', 'In the near term, the United States should work with Turkey to protect opposition-controlled areas and their supply routes from attacks, which could involve chemical weapons. The United States could use this moment to secure a deal that is acceptable to Russia and Turkey, that forces the regime to release detainees and protect returnees, and pressures the rebels to moderate. Failing to engage constructively allows adversaries to shape Syria according to their interests, to the detriment of the United States and the Syrian people.', 'Natasha Hall is a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.', 'Critical Questions is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Cook', 'December 1, 2024 2:16 pm (EST)', 'Steven A. Cook is Eni Enrico Mattei Senior Fellow for Middle East and Africa studies and Director of the International Affairs Fellowship for Tenured International Relations Scholars at the Council on Foreign Relations.', 'During the height of the conflict in Syria nearly a decade ago, Aleppo was divided between government-controlled and rebel areas, but with the help of Russian airpower and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad was able to regain control over the entire city by the end of 2016.  Since about that time, conflict in Syria was static with the rebels largely confined to the Idlib governate, which is adjacent to the Aleppo governate.', 'More on:', 'Syria', 'Syrian Civil War', 'Clearly, the armed opposition to Assad has taken advantage of the fact that Israel has done significant damage to Iran’s so-called axis of resistance, especially Hezbollah. A greatly weakened Hezbollah and a Russia distracted by its fight in Ukraine make it harder to defend the Assad regime. That does not mean that Hezbollah or the Russians will not help. Both are deeply invested in Syria, but they do not have the forces they had in 2015 and 2016 that were used to crush the insurgency. ', 'After Aleppo’s fall, Assad’s grip on power seems tenuous. A major question is what is happening in Damascus. There were unconfirmed reports not long after Aleppo fell that Assad and his family were in Moscow, that there were scuffles on the streets of the capital, that different units of the Syrian army were in conflict, and most dramatically, that the presidential palace was overrun. Most of these reports are likely the result of disinformation, but what is happening within the councils of power in Damascus will be critical for how this new phase of the Syrian conflict unfolds.', 'No doubt the battle lines have changed and Syria is an active war zone again. But it is important to be cautious about gauging the prospects for the groups that have taken Aleppo and the countryside near the city of Hama. There are no international journalists in Syria and the reports coming out of the country are likely to be rife with misinformation and disinformation.', 'So far, we know that the rebellion—an amalgam of extremist groups, Turkey-backed fighters, and Kurds (though not necessarily organized Kurdish forces)—has wrested control of Aleppo and is driving toward Hama and other cities. The primary group behind the offensive is believed to be Ha’yat Tahrir al-Sham (known as HTS or Tahrir al-Sham), which emerged at the outset of the Syrian civil war. It is an offshoot of an Al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al Nusra. HTS is on the State Department’s list of terrorist organizations.', 'In Aleppo, Syrian government forces melted away. Whether the rebel groups can consolidate their gains depends on the response from the regime, the Russians, Hezbollah, and any other groups the Iranians might deploy to help Assad. There are reports that Russian forces in Syria have undertaken airstrikes to support the regime. However, it remains to be seen whether the government and its allies can mount a significant defense.', '', '', '', 'Russia is, of course, fully engaged in its fight in Ukraine, but it does have forces in Syria including warplanes and attack helicopters, military police, and soldiers that are spread across twenty bases. Much of the Russian military support for Assad came in the form of indiscriminate bombing of rebel areas from the air, while Hezbollah supported the regime on the ground. It is possible—indeed likely—that Russia will use the Hmeimim air base in northwestern Syria to do much of the same. Air power alone will not likely be sufficient to beat back the rebels. With government forces unable or unwilling to fight the insurgency and Hezbollah unable to muster the same forces it once did, the Russians find themselves in a difficult situation in Syria. There is no question that Moscow will want to defend its position in Syria, but it is unclear yet whether that includes defending Assad.', 'Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was supposed to meet with his Turkish counterpart in Ankara on Sunday but instead flew to Damascus to assess the situation in Syria. Before turning to Moscow, Bashar al-Assad sought support from Tehran after the 2011 Syrian uprising proved beyond his control. Iran is deeply invested in Syria with dozens of military bases and other facilities because the country is critical to Tehran’s support for Hezbollah—whether as a pipeline for weapons, a place to manufacture weapons, or a command post for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders who coordinate with the Lebanese militant group. Iran’s strategic position in the region was already deteriorating; the rebel attack on Aleppo and the apparent renewed threat to the Assad regime put it further in jeopardy.', 'Turkey. The Turkish government has in recent years sought to normalize ties with Syria. This is a major turnaround for Ankara, which demanded an end to the Assad regime after the 2011 civil war began and occupied territory in Syria’s northwest. It seems likely that the Turks are now reassessing their overtures to the regime. If President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his advisors believe that Assad is likely to fall, Turkey could renew its effort to be uniquely influential in a successor government in Damascus. Based on Erdoğan’s previous approach to the Arab uprisings more than a decade ago, this means support for Islamist groups. A considerable role for Turkey in a post-Assad Syrian would help the Turks manage the problem (for them) of Kurdish autonomy in Syria. It would also help facilitate the return of millions of mostly Kurdish refugees that have made their way to Turkey over the last dozen years seeking safety from the war.', 'If Turkey were to renew its push for regime change in Damascus, it would put Ankara once again in conflict with major Arab states such as Iraq and the United Arab Emirates who have already indicated support for Assad. Presumably, Egypt and Saudi Arabia also support the Syrian regime given their wariness of the Islamist political groups that have enjoyed Turkish support.', 'Israel. Breaking the Iran-Syria axis would not doubt benefit Israeli security by undermining the weapons pipeline to Hezbollah. At the same time, Assad’s possible fall poses significant challenges to Israel, especially if Turkish-backed Islamists were to come to power in Syria. Of course, much has to happen before Assad falls. For the moment, Assad’s problems in Syria are Iran’s problems in Syria and that is good for Israel.', 'United States. The are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria clustered around a base in al Tanf. They are there to help what is known as the Syrian Democratic Forces contain the Islamic State. The rebel takeover of Aleppo and other areas does not change this mission; in fact, the extremist elements within the rebellion could make this mission more urgent.  It remains an open question whether those forces will remain after U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on January 20. During his first term, he twice vowed to withdraw those forces, but instead under pressure from advisors opted to redeploy some of them. Consistent with his “America First” worldview, he may opt this time to withdraw them regardless of the situation in Syria, which currently does not pose a threat to Americans or the American homeland.', 'This work represents the views and opinions solely of the author.

The push is among the rebels’ strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country’s borders.', 'It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control.', 'The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups.', 'Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria’s rebels with the opportunity to advance.', 'Here’s a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting:', 'Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that’s killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements.', 'The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria, as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo.', 'Coming after years with few sizeable changes in territory between Syria’s warring parties, the fighting “has the potential to be really quite, quite consequential and potentially game-changing,” if Syrian government forces prove unable to hold their ground, said Charles Lister, a longtime Syria analyst with the U.S.-based Middle East Institute. Risks include if Islamic State fighters see it as an opening, Lister said.', 'Ford said the fighting in Aleppo would become more broadly destabilizing if it drew Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other.', 'The U.S. and U.N. have long designated the opposition force leading the attack at Aleppo — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known by its initials HTS — as a terrorist organization.', 'Abu Mohammed al-Golani emerged as the leader of al-Qaida’s Syria branch in 2011, in the first months of Syria’s war. It was an unwelcome intervention to many in Syria’s opposition, who hoped to keep the fight against Assad’s brutal rule untainted by violent extremism.', 'Golani and his group early on claimed responsibility for deadly bombings, pledged to attack Western forces, confiscated property from religious minorities and sent religious police to enforce modest dress by women.', 'Golani and HTS have sought to remake themselves in recent years, focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action, researcher Aaron Zelin noted. His group broke ties with al-Qaida in 2016. Golani cracked down on some extremist groups in his territory and increasingly portrays himself as a protector of other religions. That includes last year allowing the first Christian Mass in the city of Idlib in years.', 'By 2018, the Trump administration acknowledged it was no longer directly targeting Golani, Zelin said. But HTS has allowed some wanted armed groups to continue to operate on its territory and shot at U.S. special forces at least as recently as 2022, he said.', 'At the crossroads of trade routes and empires for thousands of years, Aleppo is one of the centers of commerce and culture in the Middle East.', 'Aleppo was home to 2.3 million people before the war. Rebels seized the east side of the city in 2012, and it became the proudest symbol of the advance of armed opposition factions.', 'In 2016, government forces backed by Russian airstrikes laid siege to the city. Russian shells, missiles and crude barrel bombs — fuel canisters or other containers loaded with explosives and metal — methodically leveled neighborhoods. Starving and under siege, rebels surrendered Aleppo that year.', 'The Russian military’s entry was the turning point in the war, allowing Assad to stay on in the territory he held.', 'This year, Israeli airstrikes in Aleppo have hit Hezbollah weapons depots and Syrian forces, among other targets, according to an independent monitoring group.

Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, it was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group.', 'According to Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group’s current ideology is rooted in local rather than global goals.', ""“I still consider them extremists. They still have some foreign fighters in their ranks, and they also backed Hamas' October 7 attack against Israel,” Zelin told VOA, referring to the attack carried out by the Palestinian militant group in 2023, which killed about 1,200 people."", 'HTS Is estimated to have up to 30,000 fighters, largely concentrated in northwestern Syria.', '“They essentially situate themselves as what I describe as sort of these political jihadists, where theology no longer guides every action they do, like ISIS or al-Qaida, whereas they put in a lot more political considerations related to this, but they are still very much interested in jihad, as we can see the way that they frame this fight,” Zelin said, referring an acronym for the Islamic State.', '“One of the ways that I look at the issue is that they essentially went from global jihad to a local regime,” he added.', 'Turkey-backed rebels', 'Among the other armed groups involved in the Aleppo offensive was the Syrian National Army, or SNA, an umbrella organization for several factions backed by Turkey.', 'The SNA was established in 2017 as the armed force of the Turkish-backed Syrian Interim Government, which had gained control of parts of northwestern Syria. The SNA previously took part in two Turkish-backed offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019.', 'Some groups aligned with the SNA have been known for their radical Islamist ideology. Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Suleiman Shah Brigade and the Hamza Division, two main factions within the SNA, for “serious human rights abuses against those residing in the Afrin region of northern Syria.”', 'Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, said, “It appears that there is tentative, fragile collaboration between HTS and the SNA, following years of tension and infighting.', '“While Turkey had belatedly intervened in the rivalry in respect to security in Syria’s northwest, it’s clear that Ankara invested in fostering greater partnership between HTS and the SNA to conduct this offensive into Aleppo,” she told VOA.', 'Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday during a press conference with his Iranian counterpart in Ankara that the latest escalation in Aleppo was the result of long-standing unresolved issues rather than external interventions. He attributed the violence to the Syrian government’s refusal to engage in dialogue with the opposition.', 'As the Aleppo offensive was launched, another was simultaneously announced by the Turkey-backed SNA against U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in the northern countryside of Aleppo province, primarily around the town of Tel Rifaat. Turkey regards the SDF a terrorist organization.', 'Rose said these different priorities could determine whether the HTS-SNA partnership can last.', '“While the SNA is pushing towards Tel Rifaat against SDF forces, HTS is concentrating on establishing proto governance in strategic locations in Aleppo,” she said. “Turkey will likely play on this rivalry and use it to its advantage as it seeks to redraw battle lines and create leverage with the Assad regime, the U.S., Iran and other actors engaging in Syria.”', 'Several other groups that operate independently are also part of the Aleppo offensive, including Ahrar al-Sham, a coalition of armed Islamist factions established at the beginning of Syria’s conflict. Another Islamist group, the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, emerged in Aleppo in 2014 and has maintained close ties with HTS.', 'This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish service.', '']"

Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.', 'During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad’s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.', 'To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.', 'Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel’s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria – but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.', 'The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.', 'In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.', 'The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.', 'Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.', 'Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of ""astonishing"" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.', 'Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.', 'The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.', 'HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK. (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)', 'The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.', 'The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.', 'Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what’s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.', 'Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.', 'The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.', 'Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.', 'Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.', 'Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.', 'The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that ""the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security… No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means"".', 'Pedersen added that there had been ""a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process"" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that “the Syrian people will decide the future of Syria”.', 'The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.', 'It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support.

Aleppo is just the beginning,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/the-fall-of-aleppo-is-just-the-beginning,"['New Times,\nNew Thinking.', 'The advance on the city is a Syrian drama, reflecting both rebel success and regime failure. ', 'By Robin Yassin-Kassab', 'It was a moment millions of Syrians thought they could no longer hope for. In a matter of days, rebel forces swept out of the north-western corner of the country in which they had been crammed, into the city of Aleppo and beyond. ', 'The dominant power in the rebel coalition is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a militia which began in 2011 as an offshoot of al-Qaida, but which has since purged its most extreme elements and greatly moderated. With at least 20,000 members, it’s still an authoritarian Islamist organisation, but is not at all “like Isis”, as some observers are claiming. HTS doesn’t field a “religious police” to interfere in people’s private lives, and it has a far more tolerant approach to religious minorities and dissent than Islamic State. It isn’t popular with the people in the areas it operates – at least it wasn’t until 27 November when the offensive was launched. People have protested its authoritarianism for months. Unlike the regime of Bashar al-Assad, HTS has largely tolerated these protests. But even if Syrians don’t like HTS, they do support the offensive. That’s because they wish to return to their hometowns and cities after Assad and his allies expelled them years ago. ', 'At first the rebel offensive looked like a limited operation, perhaps agreed between Turkey and Russia to force Assad to negotiate. But as the regime lines collapsed and the rebels entered Aleppo, pushing Iran’s militias out and liberating prisoners from Assad’s dungeons, it soon became clear that events had slipped out of foreign control. This is primarily a Syrian drama, reflecting both rebel success and regime failure. ', 'The rebel coalition – the largest factions after HTS are Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Azza – contains unified military forces operating much more efficiently and professionally than ever before. Tight operational security kept preparations for the attack on Aleppo secret, and the combined arms assault was well-coordinated when it came. Even more impressive than the military improvements is the obvious social progress. Rebel messaging to the inhabitants of Aleppo has stressed respect for the rights and lifestyles of all religions and sects. So far, this has been backed up in practice. Unveiled women walk the streets without harassment, and services are held in churches. The rebels have even set up a phone line through which citizens can report violations, such as violence or harassment, by the rebels. It is important civil revolutionaries continue to hold the rebels to the high standards they seem to have set for themselves. It was a mistake, a decade ago, to ignore the growing criminality of rebel groups, which did so much damage to the revolutionary cause. ', 'For now, very unusually, electricity is on in the whole city. Public buildings are being guarded from looters. The rebels already look something like a government, in stark contrast to Assad’s regime, a narco-mafia underpinned by local warlords and foreign imperialists. ', 'But why is the regime collapsing now rather than last year? When Assad clawed back Aleppo from the revolution forces in 2016, 80 per cent of his ground forces were foreign Shia militias organised by Iran, and his air force was Russian. Today, Iran’s regional militia system has been decimated by Israel, and Russia is preoccupied with its assault on Ukraine. In these conditions, the unsustainability of the Assad regime becomes glaringly apparent. The economy cratered years ago, largely as a result of the regime’s destruction of the national infrastructure and its expulsion of over half the country’s population. This means that even many of the hitherto loyalist communities are now desperate for change. ', 'Enormous challenges certainly lie ahead. Russian and Assadist revenge bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods is underway, and intensifying. It was such scorched earth tactics against liberated areas which caused a refugee crisis, and opened the way for Islamic State, a decade ago ', 'Rebel abuses of civilians may yet escalate. Also joining the fight are the Syrian National Army (SNA) – remnants of the Free Syrian Army but now under Turkish control – which are more secular than the troops currently in control of Aleppo, but are also far less disciplined. Turkey belatedly gave them permission to move, but so far only in the Tel Rifaat area north of Aleppo, which they liberated from a joint force of Assad troops and the Kurdish PYD. There are already reports of abuses and looting there. ', 'At this stage, there is no democratic opposition ready to inherit control of the country. The hundreds of quasi-democratic revolutionary councils that once spanned liberated areas have been crushed, and most of the original civil activists are dead, imprisoned, or in exile. But if Assad falls, or at least if large areas of the country become safe from bombing, then millions of Syrians currently enduring  existence in tents or the slums of neighbouring countries will be able to return. Then civil society, and democratic opposition, will begin to reconstitute itself. ', 'What Syria needs now is a diverse but united national front. If other parts of Syria manage to expel Assadist forces, HTS and SNA influence will be diluted by people from other backgrounds and with other ideas. There are signs this may already be happening. Armed residents in Daraa and Homs provinces are attacking regime installations, while the semi-autonomous Druze community in Sweida roundly rejected Assad over a year ago, and has been demonstrating daily in support of the revolution.  ', 'Western governments should give up the absurd idea that the regime which has murdered hundreds of thousands of Syrians will ever bring stability. They should do what they can to discourage Russian and Assadist bombardment, and they should accept Syrian self-determination. The Western chattering classes, left as well as right, should resist the welter of Islamophobic and racist propaganda that Syrians are usually subjected to, and should seek to understand Syria on its own terms, not as an adjunct to other conflicts. More representative government in Syria, and in the wider Arab world, is in everyone’s interests.

The offensive unites a number of rebel factions, but is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which for more than a decade has controlled much of the Idlib province, the primary remaining rebel stronghold in Syria. (New York Times)', 'This offensive took nearly every observer by surprise, underscoring just how much the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, had drifted off the world’s radar since reaching a point of stasis in the late 2010s. In the meantime, President Bashar al-Assad—who had become an international pariah for his conduct of the war, including the use of chemical weapons against civilians—began to rebuild ties with a number of the regional states that had once sought to topple his autocratic regime.', 'Now, though, this offensive is a reminder that absent a stable political resolution, frozen conflicts can heat back up quickly. And the resurgence of fighting puts back into the spotlight all of the contradictory tensions between the actors involved in the Syrian civil war, which has pit allies and partners outside the conflict against each other, and enemies outside the conflict on the same side in the fighting on the ground.', 'Already a subscriber?

Now the city is under insurgent control, and no one is sure whether the government forces have it in them to stop the insurgency from penetrating farther south, perhaps even to Damascus.', 'These events may have been unexpected, but they are also oddly familiar. Ten years ago, the northern-Iraq city of Mosul fell to a Sunni jihadist insurgent group, after the Iraqi army collapsed and then vanished. That group was the Islamic State, which had recently broken from al-Qaeda. And like the Syrian regime, led by Bashar al-Assad, the Iraqi government was close to Tehran. In both cases, the fall of a whole city seemed implausible until images of jihadists wandering around Mosul and Aleppo circulated on social media. In both cases, the incredulity at what had just happened swiftly gave way to morbid curiosity about what might happen next, if the jihadists proceeded to the capital. Both cases, finally, share an underlying dynamic: Syria and Iraq allowed themselves to become tools of Iran, and therefore never developed competent states themselves. When their citizens rose up to object to a government that cared more about Iran’s wishes than their own, the states were too hollow and incompetent to crush the uprising.', 'More Stories', 'Yahya Sinwar’s Death Was Preordained', 'Israel’s ‘Hand of God’ Operation', '']"
