What Biden’s visit to Angola says about Lobito Corridor and US-China rivalry,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3288759/what-bidens-visit-angola-says-about-lobito-corridor-and-us-china-rivalry,"['Joe Biden set to be the first US president to visit the African nation as the West vies with China for access to mineral resources', 'When Joe Biden arrives in Angola on Monday on his first African visit as US president, he is likely to land at a China-built airport and then be driven along a highway also built or financed by China.', 'Biden’s three-day visit at the tail-end of his term is expected to seal his legacy in Africa, specifically the Lobito Corridor – a US-invested railway and logistics project connecting Angola with Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).', 'The US challenge to China in Africa also comes amid a race for access to mineral resources, at a time when Angolan President Joao Lourenco is seeking to diversify the country’s oil-dependent economy and reduce excessive reliance on China.', '01:21', 'China-built hydropower station in Angola enters main construction phase', 'Angola received billions of dollars from China to build its housing, roads, hydroelectric dams and railways after a decades-long civil war ended in 2002, and used oil shipments to repay those loans until 2017, when the late Jose Eduardo dos Santos was president. Lourenco, his successor, says some of those resource-backed loans hurt the economy.', 'In an interview published by The New York Times on Thursday, Lourenco said having debt bound to collaterals such as oil “was disadvantageous for the country”.', '“We are paying off the debt. If you would ask me now if I had to take a new loan under the same conditions, I would say no.”', 'The Lobito Corridor is Washington’s biggest project in Africa in decades. It involves refurbishing an existing section of the 1,344km (835-mile) railway line from the Angolan port of Lobito to the southern DRC, and building a 800km track through northwestern Zambia, with plans to also extend it to the Indian Ocean shores of Tanzania.', 'According to Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance at the University of Cape Town, Angola is a logical choice for Biden due to its critical role in the geopolitics of minerals and the race for resources essential to the global energy transition.', '“The Lobito Corridor, backed by US funding, is not only a key logistics project but also a counterweight to China’s entrenched presence in Angola and the broader region,” Lopes said.', '“Angola is emblematic of this rivalry,” he said, while noting that China had not only invested heavily in Angola’s oil sector and infrastructure but its footprint extended also into financing roads, railways and telecoms technology.', 'The oil-rich coastal nation is also increasingly pivotal to the supply of minerals like copper and cobalt from its landlocked neighbours Zambia and the DRC. Both are critical materials for electric vehicle batteries and other renewable technologies.', '“By choosing Angola, Biden underscores the strategic importance of the Lobito Corridor as a US-backed alternative that connects regional economies to global markets without relying on Chinese capital,” Lopes said.', 'Biden will also be the first ever US president to visit Angola, keeping a promise he made during the US-Africa Leaders’ Summit in 2022, according to Ovigwe Eguegu, policy analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Development Reimagined.', '“It also shows the importance of the Lobito Corridor project, which is the most practical step the Biden administration has taken towards securing the US critical and strategic minerals supply chain,” Eguegu said.', 'He also highlighted Lourenco’s efforts to tilt Angola’s mostly China-facing foreign relations towards more balanced ties with both the US and China.', '“Angola is an indisputable partner of the Lobito Corridor project which the Biden administration has clearly shown commitment towards realising,” he added.', 'W. Gyude Moore, a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development and a former \xadLiberian public works minister, said the Biden administration and its allies in Europe had put significant political capital behind not completely ceding the African infrastructure space to China, using Lobito Corridor as the marker.', '“Angola thus became a focal point as the end of the [Lobito] line. That the line would increase access to strategic minerals made it even more important,” Moore added.', '01:25', 'China-funded infrastructure across Africa force difficult decisions for its leaders', 'A White House briefing last week revealed that the US had spent or invested more than 80 per cent of the US$55 billion that Biden promised the continent at the 2022 Leaders Summit in Washington, and a record number of senior US officials had travelled to Africa since then.', 'According to former US official Cameron Hudson, the US believes that it has moved Angola from the Chinese orbit into the American orbit and Biden’s visit is intended to cement that change.', '“This visit plants the flag of US influence in Angola earned over many years of diplomatic and financial investment,” said Hudson, who is now a senior associate with the Africa programme at Washington’s Centre for Strategic and International Studies.', 'He also expects incoming president Donald Trump to continue to deepen ties with Angola because of its strategic value to the United States and “because he will also want to prevent China from regaining its momentum in the country”.', 'Washington had invested more diplomatically and financially in Angola than in any other African country, Hudson said. “The problem for Washington is that it is simply unable to replicate this level of engagement across very many countries in Africa.”', '']"

China is the top player in Congo, which has become an increasing concern to Washington.', ""China signed an agreement with Tanzania and Zambia in September to revive a rival railway line to Africa's eastern coast."", ""While Biden's trip is taking place in the waning days of his presidency, Donald Trump will likely back the railway and remain a close partner to Angola when he returns to the White House in January, according to two officials who served under the previous Trump administration."", 'Tibor Nagy, a retired career ambassador and top envoy to Africa under the last Trump administration, said Trump will likely have two overarching concerns regarding Africa. The first is competition with China and Russia, the second is access to critical minerals.', '""This checks both boxes,"" he said in an interview, referring to the Lobito Atlantic Railway.', 'The project is backed by global commodities trader Trafigura, Portuguese construction group Mota-Engil and railway operator Vecturis.

Others remain unrealized, such as gaining two permanent seats for Africa at the U.N. Security Council.', 'Beyond the railway project, Washington has also done little to advance access to vast reserves of African minerals it says are critical for national security and has racked up other diplomatic setbacks.', ""This summer, it lost America's major spy base in Niger and has not been able to find an ally that will host those assets. This leaves the U.S. without a military foothold in the vast Sahel region that has become a hotspot of Islamist militancy."", 'Angola has long nurtured close ties with China and Russia but has recently moved closer to the West. Angolan officials say they are keen to work with any partner that can advance their agenda to promote economic growth and hope the project spurs investment in a range of sectors.', '""China has only gained prominence because Western countries have probably not been paying much attention to Africa,"" Angola\'s transport minister, Ricardo Viegas d’Abreu, said in an interview.', 'GROWING TIES WITH ANGOLA', ""Biden's visit reflects a turnabout in U.S. ties with Angola after a complicated and bloody history. The U.S. and the Soviet Union backed rival sides in the nation's 27-year civil war. Washington established relations with Angola in 1993, almost two decades after it gained independence."", '""It\'s probably poetic justice that the United States should finance the rehabilitation of this route to which it had contributed destruction so many decades ago,"" said Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, a former Zambian government minister who also ran part of the railway that is to form the Lobito corridor.', 'Biden administration officials have said the Lobito rail project is not a one-off, but a test run to prove the private-public partnership works, and it will lead to other major infrastructure projects in Africa. They also hope it will deepen U.S. ties with Angola, including in security cooperation.', ""Critics have questioned whether the project, which has no date for completion, will deliver the promised goals. A particular source of scrutiny is a second phase which would connect the railway to Africa's east coast through to Tanzania, potentially offering a rival route to China."", ""Judd Devermont, until recently Biden’s top Africa adviser, said Congo wants to diversify its mining partners and rejected the idea that connecting the project to an eastern port in Tanzania undermines the effort to loosen Beijing’s grip on Congo's minerals."", '“The Congolese have been very clear that they don’t want to see their entire mining sector dominated by China,” he said in an interview. “It benefits everyone if there’s an easy way to move across the continent, whether that’s critical minerals or just moving stuff from India to Brazil to New York.”', '(Additional reporting by David Lewis in Nairobi, Simon Lewis in Washington and Miguel Gomes in Luanda; Editing by Frances Kerry and Chris Reese)']"

The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly. It's part of the broader initiative, the Partnership on Global Investment and Infrastructure, that the president has laid out.

How does the U.S. leadership deal with that?', ""Brown: You’re absolutely right. It is an extremely young continent, and it is the future. President Biden often talks about how by 2050, one in four humans on Earth will be from Africa. So that's very much guiding President Biden's engagement with the continent.

On December 2, US President Joe Biden will travel to Angola for what is likely the final foreign trip of his presidency. It’s also his first to Sub-Saharan Africa, and it fulfills a promise Biden made during the US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022 to travel to the continent. Yet the trip comes in the twilight of his term, which raises questions about the urgency and scope of US attention to the region, as well as about how the incoming administration should build on Biden’s outreach. Below, Atlantic Council experts share their insights on what Biden’s trip signals about where US diplomacy in Africa is headed.', 'Click to jump to an expert analysis:', 'Benjamin Mossberg: Biden’s trip shows the success of Angola’s reforms', 'Joseph Lemoine: The Lobito Corridor reveals how the US focus is shifting from aid to investment', 'Alexandria J. Maloney: Trump should anticipate the need for US engagement in Africa', 'William Tobin: The Lobito Corridor shows that the United States can deliver on the right kinds of investment', 'Alexander Tripp: The US can outcompete China in Africa—it just needs to do so more frequently', 'With his first trip to Africa, just twenty-nine days before the end of his term, Biden is highlighting the positive news story that is Angola. Historical narratives of Angola, including a difficult period of Portuguese colonialism, a decades-long civil war, and nearly forty years of authoritarian dictatorship under José Eduardo dos Santos, trend toward the negative. Following the 2017 election of João Lourenço as president, Angola has worked to implement an economic reform program to increase macroeconomic stability, strengthen public sector governance, and attract greater levels of foreign direct investment. The visit of a US president to Angola shows that the narrative today is different and that Angola is focused on the future.', 'I joined Brian Nelson, the US Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, on his first trip to Angola in March 2022. While there, I saw the impact of these reforms firsthand. At home, Angola made strides to implement reforms to combat corruption, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Abroad, Angola worked with its neighbors and international partners to provide mutual assistance and improve coordination.', 'These credible efforts show the private sector that Angola is open for business. Without these reforms, projects that Biden is set to visit, such as those in the Lobito Corridor or in the telecommunications sector, would not be possible. These positive signals should continue. Risk-rating agencies and financial institutions should look to Angola to further integrate the country into the global financial system. US executive branch agencies should continue to work with their Angolan counterparts to strengthen the country’s capacity to fight corruption and money laundering while encouraging more US firms to seriously consider investing in Africa’s seventh-largest country. Angola’s leaders are writing a new narrative, and the visit of a sitting US president shows that the United States is serious about the future.', '—Benjamin Mossberg is the deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center. Previously, he led US Treasury Department efforts to combat corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, and financial crimes on the African continent.', 'Collaborating with African nations is vital for US economic and national security interests and should be balanced with promoting peace, stability, and a brighter economic future on the continent. Demand for critical minerals such as copper, cobalt, and lithium is surging, driven by their essential role in powering electronics and advancing green energy technologies. Africa, with its abundant reserves, is increasingly becoming a focal point for US efforts to secure these resources. ', 'Biden’s upcoming two-day trip to Luanda, Angola—his first official visit to Sub-Saharan Africa—marks a significant moment in his presidency. It is the result of intensifying US-China competition on the continent, as Beijing currently dominates many African mining sectors. His meeting with Lourenço is aimed at reaffirming bilateral ties and advancing the Lobito Corridor project. Launched in 2023 as a partnership between the United States, European Union (EU), Angola, and other African entities, the corridor aims to connect Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Angolan port of Lobito via rail. With more than three billion dollars already mobilized, the project is envisioned as the first step toward a new transcontinental railway linking the Atlantic and Indian oceans.', 'The Lobito Corridor is a flagship initiative under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), the rebrand of Biden’s “Build Back Better World” initiative. It was adopted by the Group of Seven (G7) in 2022 in a bid to create infrastructure investment partnerships between G7 countries and developing nations. The PGII serves as an opportunity to strengthen US-Africa relations by shifting the focus from aid to investment, spurring trade, commerce, and private financing with the aim of generating economic growth in all participating countries. The effort also serves as a counter to China’s own infrastructure projects in the region—Chinese companies have invested more than twelve billion dollars in Angola over the past decade to construct canals, railways, and other infrastructure as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.', 'As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, sustaining investment in the Lobito Corridor is imperative. This initiative strengthens US-Africa trade, promotes local economic development, and serves as a strategic tool to counter China’s influence. It also aligns with the Trump-era Blue Dot Network’s commitment to high-quality global infrastructure standards, delivering mutually beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders involved.', '—Joseph Lemoine is the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Freedom and Prosperity Center. Previously, he was a private sector specialist at the World Bank.', 'A productive US foreign policy toward Africa under the Trump administration would focus on relationships and investments that align with US strategic and commercial interests. Biden’s trip emphasizes Angola’s growing geopolitical importance as a regional power and key partner in the diversification of the global supply chain, particularly for critical minerals vital to today’s technologies. Angola has been a prime strategic partner to the United States in the region, through infrastructure initiatives such as the multibillion-dollar, EU-supported Lobito Corridor project. Given Trump’s “America first” stance on lessening multilateral engagement, there probably will be a shift toward more bilateral programs, such as through Prosper Africa and the Export-Import Bank of the United States. ', 'The Trump administration should anticipate the need for US engagement in Africa in response to China’s continued influence on the continent. With the expansion of the BRICS grouping, nations in the Global South are furthering economic ties despite rivaling interests. This dynamic can be expected to deepen economic relations among BRICS nations across Africa while increasing competition with US markets. US policy toward humanitarian aid should be expected to shift toward a more “self-reliant” model for African nations and an overall reduction of US financial commitments to foreign aid. Under the new Trump administration, counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa will likely emphasize combating extremism through military and diplomatic channels. ', 'If the Trump administration is serious about security, trade, and advancing long-term US economic interests, it will consider major US strategic involvement and investments with African nations.', '—Alexandria J. Maloney is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center.', 'The Biden administration has championed the notion that the United States must prioritize investment, not aid, and put a focus on commercial diplomacy with African nations. In this respect, Biden’s visit to Angola does more than deliver, belatedly, on the pledge he made to visit the continent during the 2022 US-Africa Leaders Summit. In addition, the visit offers the president the opportunity to showcase that the United States is capable of delivering on the kind of relationship that leaders on the continent desire: one that delivers investment of the nature that can close the infrastructure gap, estimated to be roughly $100 billion by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. ', 'This was recognized in the White House’s US Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa, released in 2022, which articulated the aim to “advance shared prosperity, leverage the best of America’s private sector, and promote equitable growth.” In Angola, Biden will showcase the United States’ ability to partake in this model, through the Lobito Corridor, a public-private railway project linking the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia to Angola’s Atlantic port of Lobito. ', 'The United States has supported this effort with a $553 million loan to the Lobito Atlantic Railway and a $250 million loan to the Africa Finance Corporation. These investments, along with contributions from partners such as the EU and the African Development Bank—as well as private sector concessionaires such as Trafigura, Mota-Engil, and Ventricles— have leveraged more than four billion dollars in financing.', 'Still, the United States must do more to prove it can be the economic partner of choice for Africa’s capital-starved governments and enterprises. The United States has yet to devise a strategy that can enable the US private sector to compete on the same level of Chinese firms on the continent. Since 2013, when the Belt and Road Initiative was launched, China has outpaced the United States in new foreign direct investment to Africa. The United States has long strides to walk in improving its economic ties with the continent. The Lobito Corridor, featuring Angola’s Port of Lobito, offers the hope that at least it can be done. ', '—William Tobin is an assistant director at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, where he focuses on international energy and climate policy.', 'As can be clearly seen from Biden’s laggard trip to Africa, the continent is not at the forefront of US foreign policy concerns. This trip was already overdue when it was postponed in October. Now, post-election, there is a risk that it will symbolize little more than keeping a promise made roughly twenty-four months ago.', 'However, on a strategic level, the Lobito Corridor represents a win for the Biden administration and the United States. Angola has historically not been aligned with the United States, with Cold War legacies front and center. As the Washington Post put it in January, Angola “long turned to China for infrastructure and to Russia for tanks and missiles.” So, the fact that it is now partnering with the United States, over China and Russia, is significant. And it is no doubt helped along by the Biden administration’s strategy of not approaching relations with African nations under the guise of great-power competition.', 'It cannot be overstated that this represents a US success. China has long dominated these types of deals on the continent, and economic power can transfer into hard power. As was recently demonstrated in Peru, with the opening of the deep-water megaport of Chancay, US absenteeism opens the door for Chinese influence. These Chinese ports, as well as bringing in economic opportunity, also bring in potential strategic threats. Today’s port could be tomorrow’s naval base.', 'As such, the Lobito Corridor is more than just a railway line across the continent connecting the globe with some of the most valuable minerals in a twenty-first-century economy. It is also leading to what will become a major global trading port. ', 'Washington should recognize that Beijing’s interest in the continent far outmatches its own. China’s first overseas military base was built in Djibouti, in East Africa, and rumors persist that it is looking for an Atlantic base in the west as well. ', 'The Lobito Corridor seems to have kept China’s “String of Pearls” at bay for now, but it is only one project on a continent that covers roughly 20 percent of the Earth’s landmass and whose population will be 25 percent of the world’s total by 2050. The Lobito Corridor is so far a success, but it will need to be the first of many. Notably, the United States has been keen to emphasize that the Lobito Corridor will bring with it plenty of local economic opportunity. If anything, the Lobito Corridor shows that the United States can outcompete China—it just needs to do so more frequently. Add in the withdrawal of EU and US troops in the Sahel and their replacement by Russian forces, and the Lobito Corridor is a much-needed win for US presence on the continent.

Biden Jr.’s visit to Angola, we celebrate the transformation and deepening of the U.S.-Angola relationship.  This trip marks the first visit ever by a sitting U.S. president to the Republic of Angola, and the first visit of a U.S. president to sub-Saharan Africa since 2015.\n \nThis visit comes on the heels of a meeting in November 2023, when President Biden hosted President João Lourenço in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C.  In the time before and since, U.S. and Angolan counterparts have worked closely to advance both Presidents’ visions to expand impactful high-standard economic opportunities and improve global and regional security.  Together, the United States and Angola acknowledge the past horrors of slavery and its legacy, while looking forward to a bright future of continually deepening collaboration between our nations.  Today, President Biden and President Lourenço will meet in Luanda at the Presidential Palace to discuss trade, investment, and infrastructure; security and stability; and deepening U.S.-Angolan cooperation.  Tomorrow, President Biden will travel to Lobito, Angola for a Summit on infrastructure investment in the region with leaders from Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania, and Zambia. Information on continuing and new U.S.-Angolan partnership initiatives is provided below.\n \nTRADE, INVESTMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DEVELOPMENT\n \nAt the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022, the United States committed to focus on partnership with Africa through investment.  Advancing two-way trade and investment bolsters participation in the global economy, accelerates sustainable development, and scales innovation and entrepreneurship, resulting in increased economic opportunity for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.  The United States and Angola are also working with other partners through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) to enhance trans-continental connectivity from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans that enables additional commercial investment.  Tomorrow, President Biden and President Lourenço will co-host a multilateral Lobito Trans-Africa Corridor Summit to further accelerate the development of this critical economic corridor.', 'LEADING GLOBALLY AND REGIONALLY TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND PROMOTE THRIVING SOCIETIES\n\nTogether the United States and Angola are enhancing the security, safety, and well-being of their people by tackling shared challenges.  In addition to traditional security challenges, increasingly, we face also threats such as climate change, food insecurity, and disease that do not recognize or respect national borders.  Together, we are enabling more professional and accountable government actors that protect civilians, safeguard natural resources, and build more resilient health systems, and ensure no one is left behind.', 'CELEBRATING THE U.S.-ANGOLA RELATIONSHIP\n\nThe United States and Angola are bound by enduring historical ties and invigorated by our dynamic future.  We share a commitment to reckon with the horrific history of the trans-Atlantic trade of enslaved people by striving to reconnect cultures and celebrating collaboration between our nations.  People are at the heart of this connection.  Today, there are nearly 12 million Americans of Angolan descent.  These relationships—rooted in family, friendship, and community—improve and enrich our lives.  They drive our cooperation, underpin our shared values, and elevate our aspirations.', ' \n###', '', '', 'The White House\n1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\nWashington, DC 20500']"

Biden's Angola visit aims to showcase his attempts to rival China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9jyv827do,"['Joe Biden has begun his long-anticipated maiden visit to sub-Saharan Africa as US president but it comes amidst uncertainty over future US-Africa relations as Donald Trump prepares to succeed him in January.', ""Biden's visit to oil-rich Angola seeks to underline an attempt by America to focus more on trade and heavy investment in infrastructure, in what some analysts see as the most direct counter yet to China’s influence on the continent."", '""It’s a perfect marriage of convenience,"" Angolan analyst Edmilson Angelo told the BBC.', 'Biden’s choice of Angola is significant - he is the first US president to visit the country, signalling a dramatic improvement in relations between the two nations.', 'Angola was firmly in the political orbit of China and Russia after independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, but since taking power in 2017, President João Lourenço has steered it towards closer relations with the US.', '""Lourenço’s administration has seen Angolan foreign policy move away from ideology towards pragmatic multipolarity, becoming truly non-aligned,"" said Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think thank.', 'Biden will highlight his signature initiative in the region – a railway line that will stretch for 1,344km (835 miles), connecting the cobalt, lithium and copper mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the copper-belt region of Zambia, to the Angolan port city of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean.', 'Apart from oil, Angola is also rich in minerals, including cobalt and lithium, which are essential for making batteries for electric vehicles.', 'Once completed, the Lobito Corridor will help transport these important minerals from the resource-rich heart of Africa across to Europe and the US.', 'On its website, the Lobito Corridor Investment Promotion Authority (IPA), says the US involvement ""represents the first alternative from Washington DC to China’s Belt and Road Initiative"" that is aimed at building a series of trade routes that tie several countries in Africa, and elsewhere, to the Asian giant.', ""Biden's visit comes at the tail-end of his presidency, with no clarity yet on whether the Trump administration will continue with the project."", 'Dr Vines believes it ""may survive the Trump presidency as it is primarily aimed at competing against China"".', 'However, he points out that both Western and Chinese firms will be able to use the infrastructure, and that ""may make its value questionable to Trump, a US president who will likely define his administration in large measure by competition with Beijing"".', 'Lourenço expressed hope that the Trump administration would build on the initiative.', '""Powers come and go, so, all we have to do is to be ready to work with those that will be in power,"" he told the New York Times ahead of Biden\'s visit.', 'The Lobito Corridor is a joint project between the three African countries, the US, other G7 powers and private investors.', '""We have a collective commitment for global support among the G7 countries of $600bn [£470bn] and over – through 2027,"" said Helaina Matza, the acting special coordinator for the project at the US Department of State.', 'Lourenço defended the investment, dismissing concerns that it mimics the colonial-era exploitation of Africa’s resources.', '""Today, when we export the minerals, we export them in the interest of the African countries, different from what used to be in the colonial period when they were extracted without the consent of our indigenous people,"" he told the New York Times.', 'But more and more African countries are considering reducing the export of raw materials to promote local processing.', 'Anthony Carroll, a minerals expert at the US Institute of Peace, said that if this happens, it could derail the projected economic impact of the corridor.', 'He is optimistic that the vast deposits of copper in DR Congo and Zambia will keep the Lobito Corridor viable as there exists ""a steady demand"" for it globally.', 'Lithium and cobalt have a more ""cyclical"" demand, he says.', ""The US Geological Survey estimates that DR Congo has nearly half the world's cobalt deposits."", 'The vast central African country currently accounts for about 63% of the global supply of the mineral, the bulk of which is exported raw.', 'Mr Angelo is optimistic that African countries will incrementally grow their

2002.', 'The conflict destroyed the colonial-era Benguela railway line, which is part of the corridor, with only 3% of it in use at the end of the conflict.', 'Efforts to revive it then began, with China being the first to invest in it.', 'Between 2006 and 2014, China invested about $2bn to renovate the railway through a rail-for-oil deal.', 'But Lourenço has expressed regret over the deal, telling the New York Times that it was ""disadvantageous"" to Angola.', '""If you would ask me now if I had to take a new loan under the same conditions, I would say: \'No\',"" he said, adding that Angola would, nevertheless, pay off the debt.', 'China’s massive infrastructure investment, through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, has been criticised for driving countries in Africa, and Asia, into deep debt.', ""The US' move into massive infrastructure investments in Africa would exist alongside Chinese-backed projects, representing a more multipolar approach."", 'China already controls up to 80% of copper mines in DR Congo, one of the world’s largest producers of the mineral.', 'With the global focus moving to greener energy, including electric vehicles, the mines of central Africa will become more and more attractive.', 'The American shift to investing in infrastructure in the region comes therefore as no surprise.', ""Already, work has started along the Lobito Corridor, with the first phase of it encompassing the upgrading of the existing railway from the port to DR Congo's border, with funding from the US Development Finance Corporation."", 'Ms Matza said the second phase would include 800km of new railway, starting in Angola.', 'The goal is to eventually connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean through Tanzania.', 'Beyond transporting minerals,

Biden in Angola: What’s behind the last-ditch Africa trip?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/2/biden-in-angola-whats-behind-the-last-ditch-africa-trip,"['It’s a chance to redeem his legacy in Africa, experts say. But it won’t be easy.', 'United States President Joe Biden is visiting Angola this week on his first-ever bilateral trip to Africa as president – weeks before he leaves the post to Donald Trump.', 'Biden arrived in the Angolan capital, Luanda, on Monday, after a brief stop in the West African nation of Cape Verde. The three-day trip to Angola, many analysts say, represents a final, desperate attempt to fulfil a promise Biden made long ago, and counter China’s expanding influence on the continent.', 'The anticipated visit, which was pushed back from October due to Hurricane Milton, will see Biden visit the Lobito Port, which is at the heart of US trade relations with Angola. There, he will assess an ongoing critical minerals infrastructure project that is set to see vast supplies of cobalt and copper delivered to the West.', 'Here’s what to know about Biden’s Africa visit and why Lobito is important:', 'Analysts say Biden’s failure to visit any African country – except Egypt for COP27 in November 2022 – until now shows that his administration has not prioritised the continent.', 'Biden first promised to visit Africa in December 2022, two years into his presidency – which some note was already too late.', 'He made the promise at a US-Africa leaders summit in Washington, where 49 African leaders gathered. The US “is all in on Africa and all in with Africa”, Biden declared at the time. He also announced a support package of $55bn to the African Union.', 'The Biden administration has hosted several African leaders in the White House, but the promised visit never materialised – until now.', '“Presidential trips to Africa are rare enough that they always matter,” Cameron Hudson, a senior Africa analyst at the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera.', '“This one would matter less coming as it does at the very end of a lame-duck presidency. Ironically, [an Africa trip] probably matters more to Biden, who is searching to establish a legacy in Africa…than for Africa, which is already preparing for his successor,” Hudson added.', 'Africa’s significant natural resources, rapidly growing population of 1.3 billion, and sizeable voting power in the United Nations – with 54 country votes – make the continent an increasingly important strategic player.', 'US influence on the continent has been waning for years, even as China and Russia have strengthened their presence in several countries.', 'China has since 2013 overtaken the US to become Africa’s largest trade partner. This year, the US lost a major spy base in the West African nation of Niger, and its army got kicked out of Chad. That has left it struggling to find a military foothold in the Sahel region which has become a hotspot of violence by a range of armed groups.', 'In 2022, the White House released an ambitious Africa strategy document that shifted from the first Trump administration’s focus on trade relations.', 'Rather, the document promised, the US would push for Africa to have leadership roles at international platforms, including permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council and membership of the G20. Analysts lauded the approach as “modern” and “ambitious” at the time but enthusiasm for it quickly faded as little action followed.', 'Several top officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have visited African countries at various times.', 'Meanwhile, Biden found time to travel elsewhere. He has visited the United Kingdom alone five times, apart from numerous other visits to Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.', 'In contrast, President Xi Jinping of China and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin have visited African countries at least twice as heads of state.', 'The visit to Luanda will see Biden focus on an $800m US-backed railway project in the Lobito Corridor. The passage is a strategic trade route that connects the resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia to Angola, which hosts the port of Lobito, located on the Atlantic Ocean.', 'Funded largely by the US and the European Union, the Lobito Atlantic Railway project will see an existing rail network in the Lobito Corridor upgraded. That would allow for the faster export of cobalt and copper, amongst other minerals, mined from the DRC’s Kolwezi mining town, to the West.', 'The DRC is one of the world’s largest producers of copper and cobalt. The minerals are key components of batteries that power electric vehicles, which the US and EU are eager to develop more of as demand for clean energy supply chains grows.', 'Washington has provided a $550m loan to start the project. The African Development Bank and the Africa Finance Corporation are also involved.', 'The rail line is about 1300km (800 miles) long and will likely see extensions into mineral-rich regions in Zambia. Portuguese company Trafigura is leading a three-company consortium that will operate the railway for 30 years under a concession agreement. In August, the company said it shipped the first container of minerals to the US via the Lobito Port.', 'Analysts say the US faces challenges in the corridor. China has eyes on the region, too, and has already locked in much of the minerals that would theoretically be sold to Western countries within its huge Belt and Road Initiative, notes researcher E.D Wala Chabala in a paper for the Berlin-based think tank, Africa Policy Research Institute.', '“Not only are the Chinese ubiquitously present on the African continent, but China is already far ahead in building supply chains for cobalt, lithium and several other essential metals and minerals,” Chabala wrote.', 'In September, China’s state engineering corporation signed a concession agreement to operate the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), another railway line in the corridor that links central Zambia to the port of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania.', 'US officials say the visit is meant to highlight the close ties between Angola and the US.', 'At present, Luanda is also playing a lead role in mediating a spat between the DRC and Rwanda, concerning ongoing violence in eastern Congo.', 'Angola was, until a few years ago, a heavy borrower from China. It has also been historically close to Russia: During Angola’s 27-year civil war, the US and the former Soviet Union backed rival sides, leading to cold ties between Luanda and Washington.', 'However, the government of President Joao Lourenco, which has been in place since 2017, has favoured stronger ties with Washington. The two countries have deepened trade relations and by 2023, US-Angola trade totalled approximately $1.77bn. Angola is the US’s fourth-largest trade partner in sub-Saharan Africa.', 'In 2021, and more recently, in November 2023, Biden hosted President Lourenco at the White House.', 'However, analysts say Washington’s view of Lourenco’s government ignores alleged human rights violations under his watch. Lourenco is unpopular amongst many Angolans due to high living costs, corruption, and mounting crackdowns on dissent. In June, authorities opened fire on protesters angry at inflation, killing eight people in the central Huambo province. Several others were arrested in cities across the country.', 'Analysts say Biden’s refusal to acknowledge those concerns over alleged rights abuses is a stain on his legacy.', '“Many observers believe that Biden’s visit may inadvertently embolden an unpopular president,” said Florindo Chivucute, director of Friends of Angola, a group advocating for stronger democratic values in Angola and based in Luanda and Washington, DC.', '“While the US lags behind China in terms of trade and political influence in Angola, it should not compromise its core values of democracy and human rights in an attempt to catch up,” he said.', 'While President Biden has finally fulfilled his promise to visit Africa, his administration hasn’t been able to accomplish some of the other goals it set for itself.', 'The African Union was admitted as a permanent member of the G20 in September 2023. However, no African country is still a permanent member of the UNSC.', 'In September 2024, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced that her country would support two permanent UNSC seats for Africa. However, she warned that those seats would not have veto power, a position that many analysts criticised because it would set up a two-tier system – one for UNSC members with vetoes, and the second for those without that power.', 'A Trump presidency, meanwhile, is likely to focus only on trade relations, as it did the first time, experts say.', 'The incoming administration will likely want to compete with Chinese and Russian influence, and land access to critical minerals, Tibor Nagy, a top envoy to Africa under the last Trump administration, told the Reuters news agency.', 'There, at least, projects like the Lobito Railway could see sustained US investment. “This checks both boxes,” Nagy said, referring to the railway project.', '', '', '', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

Read it now.', 'In this article:', 'When US President Joe Biden touched down in Angola’s capital, Luanda, on Monday it was the culmination of several years of focus and intense lobbying by the Angolans.', 'But after spending nearly $20 million in lobbying fees since 2019, according to regulatory filings examined by Semafor Africa, the big question now is whether Angolan President João Lourenço’s government will face a backlash with an unpredictable Donald Trump in the White House.', 'At stake is the US-backed multibillion-dollar Lobito Corridor project, which includes building and revamping railways from Angola’s western Lobito port through to critical mineral hubs in neighboring Zambia and DR Congo. Biden is proudly highlighting the corridor as an exemplar of the kind of African investment that the US should support to counter Chinese influence on the continent.', 'Most Angolans and US-Africa watchers believe a Trump White House will ultimately keep the Lobito Corridor in place, and might even try to spin it as Trump-inspired. It was one of the first projects to be backed by the revamped US Development Finance Corp, which started in Trump’s first term. “I don’t think they will retract it’s because it’s a viable investment that showcases the viability of African infrastructure,” said Samaila Zubairu, chief executive of Africa Finance Corp, which has played a key coordinating role on the project alongside the US government.', '', 'The United States has helped mobilize some $5 billion for the Lobito Corridor initiative, coordinating not only rail but also digital connectivity and green energy infrastructure. And, while much of the focus for Lobito has been on loosening China’s influence on the supply chain for so-called green minerals used for renewable energy batteries, there are even more immediate opportunities with the country’s agribusiness, say investors.', 'Luis Lelis, chief executive of BAI, Angola’s biggest bank by assets, said the corridor’s implementation would give the sector a big boost and “create jobs for the youth.”', 'AFC’s Zubairu agreed: “We’ve had more enquiries about [Lobitio’s] agricultural value chain than the critical minerals’. It shows that any [piece of infrastructure that unlocks value is a good thing.”', 'Angolans have anticipated Biden’s visit with excitement and “expectations are high,” said Dr M’zée Fula Ngenge, chairman of Luanda-based African Diamond Council.', 'Angola had a tense relationship with the US for decades after independence in 1975, through the dying years of the Cold War, because its leaders were close to the Soviets. But the relationship has improved in the last couple of decades with Luanda becoming one of Washington’s closest allies on the continent.', '“They’ve wanted this for years, to get recognition and respect from the US,” said Jeanine Scott, the US head of Angolan holding company Omatapalo, speaking from Luanda.', 'The Lobito Corridor is the kind of sprawling opportunity that everyone projects their desired outcome onto. For the outgoing White House and its Democrat supporters, it is the capstone of Biden’s US-Africa strategy. It has stood out as a success at a time when Republicans have criticized the Biden administration’s handling of conflicts in Sudan and the eastern DR Congo in the last couple of years, as well as the return of military governments in the Sahel region.', 'Some will see Biden’s visit to Angola as almost irrelevant now, given the wave of change sweeping through Washington DC since last month’s election — and the Angolans are watching closely. However, my sources tell me that Trump won’t change position on the Lobito Corridor for two key reasons. First, because his likely US-Africa advisors or appointees are mostly admirers of the project. They see it as a model to expand on in sub-Saharan Africa, moving away from aid and humanitarian projects to more trade and investment.', 'The second reason is China. While the Biden administration was subtle about naming China as a competitive reason for its actions in Africa, Trump’s White House will be much more obvious about it. With China hawks like his secretary of State nominee Sen. Marco Rubio in place, positioning Lobito Corridor as an anti-China move could see Trump doubling down on support for the initiative.', 'But the sheer unpredictability of Trump’s approach to policymaking means nobody can be sure how it will play out under his White House. That uncertainty is the reason some in Luanda remain nervous. These are “realistic concerns,” says Fula Ngenge.', 'Angola’s Washington lobbyists have pushed back strongly at the idea a second term with President Trump would undermine the US-Angola relationship. Angola’s “fast-growing relationship” with the US started under Trump’s first term, argues Squire Patton Boggs, a Cleveland, Ohio law firm whose Washington lobbyist arm took in the majority of the nearly $20 million Angola’s government spent on lobbyists since 2019.', 'The firm points out that President Lourenço’s official relationship with the US dates back to his time as his country’s defense secretary in 2017 when he met with then US Secretary of Defense James Mattis.', 'Transparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.', '']"
