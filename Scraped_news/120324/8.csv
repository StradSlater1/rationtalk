', 'Much of his plan, Wikler suggested in an interview, will reflect what Democrats have done in Wisconsin. That includes putting a focus on building up state party infrastructure across the country to develop what he calls a “nationwide permanent campaign.”', ""“I'm running on a platform to unite, fight and win,” Wikler told the Journal Sentinel on Monday. "", '“Because in Wisconsin, the frontlines of the most contested battleground state in the country, we’ve been able to unite the party to fight in races down-ballot and up-ballot and to win beyond what a party should have been able to hope to win, even in some of the toughest conditions.” ', 'Wikler, 43, began his career in politics volunteering on Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s first congressional campaign and later directed MoveOn.org’s effort to stop Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act.', 'Since becoming Wisconsin Democrats’ chairman in 2019, however, he’s developed a reputation as a well-connected and effective fundraiser who party leaders have credited for their successes in the country’s most evenly divided state. ', 'His entrance into the contest to lead the Democratic Party is no surprise. Top Wisconsin Democrats in recent weeks had encouraged Wikler to run for the post, and party leaders on Capitol Hill have repeatedly praised him as the country’s “preeminent state party chair.”', ""Current DNC chair Jaime Harrison isn't seeking reelection, and DNC members will elect their new chair on Feb. 1. The committee plans to host four candidate forums throughout January. "", ""Wikler joins Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and New York state Sen. James Skoufis in announcing bids for the DNC post, though other candidates are expected to jump into the contest. "", ""In an interview, Wikler pointed to Democrats' recent successes in Wisconsin — including Gov. Tony Evers’ reelection in 2022, flipping the state Supreme Court into liberal control in 2023 and recent gains in the state Legislature last month — as evidence of his preparedness for the job. "", 'He called for a “nationwide permanent campaign” and a “50-state strategy” that would largely reflect Wisconsin Democrats’ efforts to organize year-round with help from county parties and neighborhood teams throughout red, blue and purple counties. Some of those efforts have included training people to reach their own communities through door-knocking and social media.', 'That plan at the national level, Wikler said, would mean the DNC partnering with state parties and Democratic committees “to build a state-by-state strategy that is grounded in the state parties and allows them to run a coordinated campaign on a year-round basis, not just in the few months before an election.”', '“That’s been our Wisconsin strategy,” Wikler said of the party’s organizing. “I think that needs to be the national strategy, too.” ', 'The next DNC chair will be tasked with charting a path for Democrats after a Nov. 5 election that saw Trump win every swing state and Republicans gain the majority in the Senate, giving them control of Congress.', 'In Wisconsin, Wikler has been credited for reducing Democrats’ losses. While the wave of Republican support swept across the country last month, the shift toward Trump was less pronounced in Wisconsin than it was in other swing states. ', 'Wisconsin was the closest contested state in the presidential election — Trump won by just 0.9% — and Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin narrowly hung onto her Senate seat, as other Democratic incumbents lost elsewhere.', 'On Monday, Wikler said the biggest task for Democrats is to figure out how to communicate with voters “who have the least time to think about politics and have the biggest challenges in front of them.” ', ""He said voters this cycle who felt the lasting impacts of inflation didn't listen to messages from either campaign but “voted for change,” adding that Democrats need to make “absolutely clear that we are fighting for them on their side, and the other side is trying to rip them off.”"", 'If elected, Wikler said he would remain based in Madison. He noted he would also spend time in D.C. while traveling the country “to make the case to raise resources and to work with our partners to win elections everywhere.”', ""He didn't say how many of the 448 DNC members have pledged to support him, saying only that he’s been “really gratified by the support I've already found in my first wave of calls.” "", 'And the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, he added, would be fine without him. ', 'He said the state party has an “extraordinary depth of talent” to continue its consistent organizing across Wisconsin, and he added that he would continue to prepare for the next state Supreme Court race this spring even as he runs for DNC chair. ', 'His top focus now, however, is getting into a position to try to replicate Wisconsin Democrats’ successes at the national level. ', '“What we’ve learned in Wisconsin I think can make an enormous difference everywhere,” Wikler said. ']"

SLAVEN VLASIC/GETTY IMAGES FOR MEDIA ASSETS, INC.', 'Sponsor Message', '', 'Get it in your inbox.', 'Sponsor Message', '', '', 'In the days following last month’s elections, as Democrats across the state and across the country began analyzing what went wrong for the party as it lost the presidency and both houses of Congress, state Sen. James Skoufis spoke up. He posted an eight-part thread on X laying out his takeaways from his own reelection in a purple district won by Donald Trump. “It’s not rocket science,” Skoufis wrote, before offering points including “show up everywhere,” “spread a populist message,” and “stop engaging in woke politics.”', 'It turns out Skoufis was previewing his national platform for the party. On Saturday, he announced a run for chair of the Democratic National Committee, promising to bring the lessons he’s learned winning in a purple district to the Democratic Party writ large. He called his home of Orange County – which includes urban, exurban, suburban and rural portions – “a microcosm, where most Democrats aren’t winning anymore, or struggle to eke it out.” By contrast, Skoufis touted in his campaign launch, he “won on tough Trump turf – three times.” ', 'On Election Day, Skoufis won reelection by over 13 percentage points. That’s a stark improvement from 2022, when his Republican challenger came within two percentage points of defeating him. This time around, Skoufis was aided by the presence of a Conservative third-party candidate, who appeared to siphon some votes away from his Republican challenger. Skoufis ran over 23 points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the district by double digits.', 'Despite his impressive electoral history, Skoufis doesn’t hold any party leadership positions in Orange County, let alone with his chamber’s campaign arm or the New York Democratic Committee. His own attempts at playing kingmaker in the Hudson Valley haven’t amounted to much. He endorsed former staffer Gabi Madden, who challenged democratic socialist Assembly Member Saraha Shrestha in a nearby district and was soundly defeated. Part of his sales pitch also lies in his electoral prowess in swing districts. ', ""Skoufis’ comfortable reelection victory was not unique but part of a larger string of Democratic victories across New York state. While Democrats faced tough losses across the country, they performed fairly well in the state, flipping three seats and holding onto two other swing districts. Skoufis’ state Senate district overlaps entirely with the 18th Congressional District, represented by Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan, who also held onto his seat in a tough district where he comfortably overperformed Harris. Ryan offered his own election postmortem, which had similarities to Skoufis’ takeaways, but struck a different tone. “First and foremost, if you're using the words ‘moderate’ or ‘progressive,’ you're missing the whole f***ing point,” Ryan wrote in his own thread on X."", ""Scott Minkoff, associate professor of political science at SUNY New Paltz, told City & State that Skoufis’ bid to lead the national Democratic party faces steep odds. “He won a swing district, not even in a very high-salience election or a state election or something like that, right? Like a good governor or congressional race or something? So I don't know, it's weird.”"", ""But political consultant Alec Lewis, who has worked with Skoufis during previous reelection campaigns, said that while he’s entering the DNC chair race as an outsider, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible he’ll win. “I think what's exciting about this is that he genuinely feels that he has nothing to lose and only everything to gain,” he said. And for Skoufis, his lack of party leadership credentials is a bonus, not a potential detriment. “We’ve tried the operative approach and machine approach, yet here we are,” Skoufis told City & State. “There’s an enormous appetite to try something new… All we should care about as a party is getting back to winning.”"", 'Skoufis has painted himself as an outsider for the DNC position, which is certainly true when it comes to Beltway politics. The state legislator is virtually unknown in D.C. “His views and that of his district should certainly be represented in the Party’s leadership,” said Basil Smikle, a former executive director of the state Democratic Party. “The biggest hurdle is the amount of ground to cover getting to know DNC members who vote in the process.” Skoufis told City & State that he has already made around 100 calls to voting members so far, and that the response has been “exceptionally positive.”', 'The Cornwall Democrat is no Albany outsider. He has held a position in the state Legislature for a decade, first in the Assembly and now in the state Senate. Considered particularly ambitious by political insiders, Skoufis has long been rumored to be eyeing a seat in Congress. But he denied that his DNC chair run is a preview for a congressional campaign against neighboring Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, who is publicly exploring a run for governor. ', '', '', 'Some in the Hudson Valley view the move as nothing more than an exercise in profile building, ahead of an eventual run for higher office. If that’s the case, it seems to be working. His run for DNC chair has already netted him a Newsnation appearance and a splashy write-up in The New York Times – the first time he’s been featured in the paper since his wedding announcement in 2017.', 'Skoufis said if he wins the election to be DNC chair, he will give up his seat in the state Senate next year after the budget passes. That means that his hard fought, purple seat will become open, to be determined in a special election with candidates chosen by the very machine politics that he decries. But he’s confident that the district will remain blue even if he leaves. “I’m fully committed to keeping the seat in Democratic hands and believe a special election is eminently winnable with a strong, independent-minded Democrat,” he said.', 'NEXT STORY: The NYC mayoral field is growing.

It’s also happening to Russia as you read these words, although that’s another article altogether.', 'And now they’re screwing up America again, much as they did in the 1920s. If they succeed, it will be both disastrous and perhaps bloody, a word that Trump himself has recently used to describe his plans for the next four years.', 'America has been through two great cycles since our founding, as brilliantly explained by Neil Howe in The Fourth Turning Is Here and Peter Turchin in Elites, Counter-Elites, and the Path of Political Disintegration. Turchin also summarized his thesis in a tight but concerning article for The Guardian last week titled “The deep historical forces that explain Trump’s win.”', '(I’ve also written about these cycles of history multiple times over the years, here, here, here, here, here, etc., but it deserves a fresh examination in the light of Trump’s electoral win and the crucial decision facing the Democratic Party in February.)', 'Howe explains how every 80 years or so (as our elders die out) we lose access to the lessons our grandparents learned, particularly those about the importance — nay, the necessity — of regulating great wealth so it doesn’t turn government into a vehicle to exclusively serve the morbidly rich.', 'When the rich take over, he notes, bad things happen: it was roughly 80 years from our founding when oligarchs in the South starting the Civil War, 80 years from the Civil War to oligarchs on Wall Street kicking off the Republican Great Depression, and we’re roughly 80 years out from that right now as wealthy oligarchs have just seized all three branches of our government.', 'Turchin points out how, in back-to-back 40-year segments, the obscenely rich are brought to heel over four decades, but then rise up and take over again during the next forty years. Over and over again.', 'The cover of his book Ages of Discordprovides a graphic that visually explains his hypothesis, showing a red line for the accumulation of great wealth from 1780 to 2020 and working class wealth with the blue lines. Today, we’re about 40 years from Reagan’s counter-revolution against the New Deal, a program FDR put into place in 1933 that saved America and created the largest middle class the world had ever seen. (I’m radically simplifying both of these scholar’s works: I recommend you buy and read their books for more detail.)', 'In summary, Trump’s election was a reflection of the success of the anti-New Deal counter-revolution launched with the Reagan Revolution in 1981, in which America’s most wealthy essentially took control of our government.', 'Much of this was accomplished through a process of destroying unions, cutting taxes on the rich while borrowing from the future to fund them, and allowing corporations to search the world for the cheapest labor and least regulation (“free trade”). While it’s rarely mentioned in our increasingly-oligarch-captured media, they called this “neoliberalism” (as I detail in my new book The Hidden History of Neoliberalism: How Reaganism Gutted America).', 'FDR’s New Deal created massive prosperity for the American working class, lifting us from 15 percent of Americans being in the middle class in 1933 to two-thirds of us at that status when Reagan took office in 1981. (Today, we’re well below 50 percent.)', 'Because of forty years of success of FDR’s New Deal, a third of American workers had the protections of a union when Reagan took office, brand-spanking-new schools dotted the countryside, college was so cheap as to be virtually free, hospitals and health insurance companies were required to be nonprofit so healthcare was affordable, and housing supports meant that the cost of the average home was about twice the average annual income.', 'The main beneficiaries were my generation, the boomers, who came of age at the peak of the New Deal’s effects, before Reaganism bit hard into American workers starting in the 1980’s, stealing over $50 trillion of our wealth in just 44 years and handing it off to the oligarchs in the top .1 percent.', 'When my generation was in our 30s, we controlled about 21 percent of the nation’s wealth; today people in their thirties only control 4.6 percent of America’s wealth. Average home prices today are ten times average annual income today. College is unaffordable, as is healthcare.', 'Forty-four years of Reaganism, embraced by both parties until 2020, have wiped out the middle class while making the rich into the super-rich. When Reagan came to office, billionaires were a rarity (there were only 7 of them) and they were constrained by law from owning politicians or having an outsize influence in elections.', 'And then Republicans took over in 1981 and began their war on the American Dream.', 'In the most recent election — thanks to five corrupt Republicans on the Supreme Court with their Citizens United decision — several hundred American and foreign billionaires largely funded Trump’s campaign, massively outspending Democrats through PACs and dark money SuperPACS.', 'Peter Turchin identifies a three-step process that leads to revolutionary outcomes like the election of Trump this year: “popular immiseration, elite overproduction and state breakdown.”', 'First, the rich get control of the political system and change the tax code and regulatory state to gut worker income and organizing power, “immiserating” (impoverishing) the middle class.', 'We saw this with Reagan and Republicans on the Supreme Court dismantling union rights and workers’ power, followed by the passage of “Right To Work For Less” anti-union laws in state after Republican-controlled state.', 'The rich then redirect the government’s efforts away from supporting working class people to converting the wealth of the nation into their own coffers. The most obvious example of this are the “tax cuts” — cumulatively totaling over $35 trillion — put into place by Reagan, Bush, and Trump. Up next will be the programs supporting the middle class Elon wants to destroy with the enthusiastic support of his billionaire bros.', 'I put “tax cuts” in quotation marks, by the way, because they’re really not tax cuts: those taxes will eventually be paid. Just not by the people who should have paid them; they succeeded in pushing them out decades into the future with the assumption they’ll be paid for either by raising taxes on working people, cutting benefits to the middle class and poor, or both. Instead of “tax cuts,” we should rightly call them “tax deferrals” or “tax redistributions.”', 'Finally, as more and more of the nation’s wealth is stolen from the middle and transferred to the top one percent, the nation’s people lose confidence in the institutions that should have been defending, protecting, and supporting them. They see that no matter how they vote, no matter what they do, no matter how loud they protest, they’re still screwed and the morbidly rich are still getting richer every single day.', 'This leads to Turchin’s “state breakdown,” which we’ll be witnessing in real time starting on January 20th. Step-by-step, those parts of the state that work for and protect the middle class and poor are taken apart, while those parts that protect the rich (prisons, police, the military) are exalted.', 'Average working people know they’ve been screwed; they just don’t realize it’s the morbidly rich who did it to them unless there’s an outspoken class warrior like FDR or Harry Truman calling it out.', 'Thus, they vote for whoever they perceive as most likely to “shake things up,” “destroy the deep state,” or “make the country great again” by restoring the wealth of the middle class.', 'Sometimes we choose right, as Americans did in 1860 with the election of Lincoln, and in 1932 by choosing FDR. The country was on the brink of disaster with massive fascist movements growing during each era; Lincoln and FDR defeated them and saved our nation’s democracy.', 'This time, though, the billionaires had such a grip on the media and the message, much of it through their ownership of media (Xitter, Washington Post, LA Times, Fox “News,” massively subsidized podcasts, rightwing radio, etc.) and also with a tsunami of advertising cash that they convinced Americans that Trump — a billionaire rapist and convicted criminal who has promised to again cut taxes for his billionaire buddies — was the champion of the little guy.', 'As Trump, Vance, and Musk celebrated Thanksgiving, their toast had to include the word “suckers.”', 'The result of this choice, already being exultantly proclaimed by the Project 2025 authors coming into the new Trump administration, will be the further disintegration of government’s protective ability for working class people, turning it instead toward the wish-lists of billionaires and massive corporate monopolies and oligopolies.', 'This could become a death knell for American democracy.', 'As Turchin noted in The Guardian:', 'The extreme irony here is that Joe Biden was actually the first president since Jimmy Carter to reject Reagan’s neoliberalism, walk a picket line, raise taxes on the rich, and start breaking up the giant corporate monopolies.', 'He was the counter-revolution to the Reagan Revolution. And he — and the Democrats who controlled Congress for his first two years — were damn effective at it.', 'The problem is that Biden, Harris, and particularly the DNC were so incompetent at messaging what they were accomplishing — and the billionaire media was so good at gaslighting us — that the majority of American voters believed the nation was in a recession and a full-blown state of crisis on election day.', 'This is now going to have to play out over the next two and four years, and the major thing that will determine if we enter complete state breakdown (and the associated possible bloody civil war) will be whether the Democratic Party rejects the neoliberals within its own ranks and makes a forceful argument for returning to the systems of the New Deal and Great Society that protected and enriched working class people.', 'If Democrats fail at this critical messaging as badly as they did over the past four years, our experiment in American democracy may well be doomed. This loss of trust in government followed by elite and then autocratic takeover is very much the scenario that played out, for example, in the early years of Putin’s ascendance in Russia. We can all see how that turned out.', 'If Democrats succeed at finding their voice, however, and Trump overreaches in ways that awaken the public and lead to a wholesale rejection of the GOP in 2026 and 2028, America may get the second chance we ultimately won during the past two 80-year cycles.', 'And the choice Democrats make for the leadership of their party — a person who will have substantial influence and power now that there’s no elected “leader” of the party in the White House, Senate, or House of Representatives — may well decide the fate of American democracy.', 'Ben Wikler could actually save our nation.
