The Times of Israel reported the Israeli army told civilians to limit their movement outside homes and avoid gatherings.', 'Lebanese media on Friday reported a fresh wave of Israeli strikes in retaliation, which follow a similarly intense wave of Israeli strikes late Thursday.', 'The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, posted a video to its X and Telegram social media accounts that it said showed a “Hezbollah terrorist” entering what the IDF said was a Hezbollah military structure near Kfar Kila in southern Lebanon.', 'Shortly after the figure enters the building, it is destroyed in a blast that the post said was caused by an Israeli aircraft.', ""The IDF also indicated it had conducted a targeted strike in Beirut. In a post to its X account, Lebanese news service L'Orient Today posted footage it said was taken in a Beirut suburb of damage caused by the airstrikes."", 'In a statement, the IDF said the strike, based on intelligence, had killed the head of Hezbollah’s operations unit, Ibrahim Aqil, along with two commanders of its elite Radwan forces.', 'The IDF said Aqil began his involvement with Hezbollah in the 1980’s, and played a role in many terror activities, including the terror attack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983 and several attacks in northern Israel in recent years.', 'The exchanges late Thursday and Friday came despite international calls for restraint. The United Kingdom has called for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, and White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday the United States is “afraid and concerned about potential escalation.”', 'Other top U.S. officials said they do not believe such an escalation is inevitable.', '“We still believe that there is time and space for a diplomatic solution,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday.', ""“War is not inevitable up there at the blue line [between Israel and Lebanon], and we're going to continue to do everything we can to try to prevent it,” he added, saying the U.S. is continuing with what he described as “intense diplomacy” to lower tensions."", 'As for the Israeli airstrike targeting Beirut, Kirby said the U.S. was not involved and was not given advanced notification by Israel.', '“I am certainly not aware of any prenotification of those strikes,” he said, calling it “not atypical.”', 'Retaliation vows', 'Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah vowed retaliation Thursday against Israel for the detonations of electronic devices that killed at least 37 people this week.

""The enemy crossed all boundaries and red lines.”', 'As usual, Nasrallah spoke by video from an undisclosed location. Iran-backed Hezbollah, which typically convenes rallies for supporters to watch his speeches on a big screen, did not do so this time.', 'Because of the lethal devastation from the device attacks, Lebanon has banned passengers flying from Beirut’s international airport from carrying pagers or walkie-talkies on board their flights. The ban applies to checked and carry-on luggage, as well as cargo.', 'Security experts this week told Western media outlets that Mossad agents are thought to have intercepted a shipment of the pagers from a company in the Hungarian capital of Budapest to add the explosives to the devices before they arrived in Lebanon for distribution among Hezbollah members.', 'A New York Times account disputed that scenario, however, reporting that its sources in the intelligence community said Israel created a front company, B.A.C. Consulting, to manufacture the electronic devices with explosive PETN-laced batteries that could be detonated remotely.', 'The company produced some ordinary pagers for sale on the commercial market, the newspaper said, but its singular aim was to manufacture the lethal devices to deploy in Israel’s fight against Hezbollah.', 'The first batches of the pagers were shipped to Lebanon in the summer of 2022 in small numbers, but production was quickly ramped up after Nasrallah denounced the use of cellphones because they could be tracked by Israeli intelligence and the low-tech pagers and walkie-talkies could not.', 'Hsu Ching-Kuang, founder of Taiwan-based manufacturer Gold Apollo, told reporters Wednesday his company did not manufacture the pagers, even though its corporate markings were on them when the remains of the exploded devices were examined Tuesday.', 'He said Gold Apollo had authorized its brand to be used on devices produced and sold by B.A.C. in Budapest.', 'Assassination plot foiled', 'Meanwhile, Israel’s military announced the arrest of an Israeli citizen suspected of involvement in an Iran-backed plot to kill Israeli officials.', 'Israeli authorities said in a statement that the person arrested was a businessman with connections in Turkey who attended at least two meetings in Iran and that potential targets of the plot included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.', 'The arrest took place last month, the statement said.', 'International moves', 'Gallant said Thursday he spoke by telephone with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about the situation in the region, including “Israel’s defense against Hezbollah threats.”', 'The Pentagon said Austin reiterated “unwavering U.S. support for Israel in the face of threats” from Iran, Hezbollah and other Iranian partners in the region.', '“The secretary emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring regional adversaries and efforts to de-escalate tensions across the region,” a Pentagon spokesperson said.', 'Following diplomatic talks in Paris on Thursday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah.', '“Tonight, I’m calling for an immediate cease-fire from both sides,” he told Reuters. “We are very, very clear that we want to see a negotiated political settlement so that Israelis can return to their homes in northern Israel and, indeed, Lebanese to return to their homes.”', 'The pager and walkie-talkie attacks followed Israel’s announcement that it was broadening of its goals in the war against Hamas militants in Gaza to include the securing of northern Israel from Hezbollah rocket attacks.', 'VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.

Even as he spoke on Thursday, however, sonic booms echoed above Beirut as Israeli fighter jets roared over the city, flexing Israel's military might."", 'But as the U.S. warning Thursday indicated, the next moves — be they further retaliation from Hezbollah or ground operations by the IDF against the group — could have major consequences.', '""Ultimately, if they [Israel] do invade, they would have to occupy"" southern Lebanon, regional analyst Makram Rabah told CBS News. ""This would lead to a kind of a slow, depleting war for Israel, and this would, more importantly, legitimize Hezbollah.""', 'But hundreds of Hezbollah fighters were likely injured by the explosives attacks, which almost certainly left the group\'s communications networks in complete disarray.

This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants.', 'Israel’s operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reports, and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Beirut refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila. It’s one of the bloodiest events in the region’s recent history.

Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000.', 'As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon’s fractious political landscape. The ragtag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, plus some civilians.', 'A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah.', 'Support from Iran: The group made no secret about its ideological allegiance to Tehran and received a steady flow of funds from the Islamic Republic. This helped propel Hezbollah to prominence. It became a participant in Lebanon’s civil war, which ended in 1990, and led a fight against Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon, ultimately driving them out in 2000.', 'A terror designation: In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a “resistance” group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization, largely since Argentina blamed the group for the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, killing 85, also in the capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah denied responsibility for those attacks.', 'Read more about Hezbollah here.', 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for an urgent phone consultation with some ministers and security officials, an Israeli official confirmed to CNN.', 'Official meetings are unusual during Shabbat but not unprecedented during wartime.

Ibrahim Aqil: a founder member of Hezbollah’s military wing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/ibrahim-aqil-a-founder-member-of-hezbollahs-military-wing,"['Aqil, who has reportedly been killed by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, had risen through the ranks of the organisation', 'Ibrahim Aqil, who is reported to have been killed by an airstrike in Beirut on Friday, was one of the last founder members of Hezbollah’s military wing to have survived more than 40 years of conflict with Israel.', 'Aqil, who was in his early 60s, had risen through the ranks and reached a senior position in the organisation. Exact details of his role are unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces described him as “the head of the Hezbollah terrorist organization’s operations team, the acting commander of the Radwan [special forces] unit”.', '“He was one of the really senior old-timers but was never really the face of anything. He was always a number two or number three, but had just been promoted in the last five to 10 years,” said Hussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington and an expert on extremism in Lebanon.', 'Aqil was one of a group of young Shia men originally from the south of Lebanon but living in Beirut who were energised by the 1979 Iranian revolution and recruited by the country’s Revolutionary Guards into a network known initially as Islamic Jihad and then later as Hezbollah.', 'Their military aim, guided by their Iranian mentors, was to fight the US, which had despatched a peacekeeping force to Beirut; and Israel, which had occupied much of Lebanon. Their political objective was to turn Lebanon into an Islamic state aligned with Tehran. Almost all have been killed since, probably by Israel.', 'Fuad Shukr was killed in an airstrike in July, almost certainly by Israeli security services working with the IDF. Shukr, who was 63 when he died, was Hezbollah’s chief of staff, and reportedly tasked with obtaining its most powerful weapons.', 'The most prominent member of the original group was Imad Mugniyeh, who was blamed for dozens of lethal attacks on US, Israeli and Jewish targets over 25 years and died in a car-bomb explosion in Damascus in 2008 that was attributed to the Mossad.', 'The US had accused Mugniyeh of playing a central role in the bombings of the US embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the US Marine Corps barracks in October 1983, which killed 241 US personnel. A French barracks was also bombed at that time, killing 58 people.', 'Aqil was also accused of being involved in these operations. A US Justice Department notice describes him as “ a principal member of Hizballah’s terrorist cell the Islamic Jihad Organization”, which claimed responsibility for the two 1983 bombings in Beirut. The notice also says Aqil directed the taking of US and German hostages in Lebanon and held them there, also in the 80s.', 'Evidence that Mugniyeh masterminded the two 1983 bombings is thin, however, and it is more likely that he and Aqil played a more minor role, leveraging their deep network of contacts and knowledge of southern Lebanon and Beirut to provide crucial logistical support.', '“Aqil was one of the nucleus of five people around Mugniyeh who were there at the start of the whole Hezbollah military enterprise,” said Abdul-Hussain.', 'Coming so soon after the extraordinary pager explosions which killed 37 people and injured thousands of ordinary Hezbollah operatives, the strike on Aqil suggests a concentrated and urgent Israeli effort to eliminate the organisation’s higher command.', 'Hezbollah will find it hard to replace men such as Shukr and Aqil, and their assassinations are likely to demoralise even committed senior members. Both men were reportedly close to the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.']"
