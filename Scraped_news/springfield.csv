In the face of those threats, schools have evacuated and closed, local colleges have canceled on-campus activities and temporarily moved instruction online, organizers of the city's popular annual CultureFest have canceled the event and many Haitian residents have confined themselves to their homes out of fear for their safety."", '""For now, I\'m just careful because if I don\'t need [to go] outside, I don\'t go,"" said Evens Édouard, a Haitian resident of Springfield who works as a quality inspector for an automotive safety glass company in a nearby city.

', ""Alongside the fears ignited by shooting and bomb threats, Trump's Friday pledge to start mass deportations in Springfield should he be elected have also left other Haitians in his community worried about their immigration statuses, Édouard said. Some are making plans to move, while others are hoping to save money before leaving town, he added."", '""I think everybody\'s scared,"" he said, adding: ""If you\'re Haitian you\'re concerned. It\'s like feeling scared for everybody that\'s Haitian.""', 'The disruption has left Springfield\'s thousands of Haitian residents trapped in a fresh hell created by far-right conspiracy theorists and neo-Nazis, the situation enflamed by their very own senator, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, and the former president. These attacks are also part of a broader right-wing effort targeting all forms of immigration, legal or not and spearheaded by Trump\'s commitment to large-scale deportations.  Allegations of what Trump claimed at the debate to be widespread ""migrant crime"" have also spread, fueling debunked claims of Venezuelan gangs commandeering apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado, and most recently, dredging up falsehoods about African immigrants in Dayton, Ohio, another city some 70 miles west from the state capital, were grilling cats.  ', ""As the far-right conspiracy theories circulate and Trump and Vance continue to espouse anti-immigrant rhetoric, they further ostracize Springfield, Aurora and Dayton's immigrant populations, posing a threat to their safety and impacting their quality of life.

"", '""Trump and Vance’s comments reflect the ongoing stigmatization of migrants through the lenses of race, illegality, and crime,"" Jamella Gow, a professor of sociology at Bowdoin College whose research focuses on how immigration, race, and Blackness intersect for Black migrants, told Salon in an email.

Mike DeWine further denied the claims, admonished the accusers and defended the Haitian migrant community."", '""What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal.

', 'Lindskoog speculated that the Republican candidates\' purpose in boosting these baseless claims is energizing a political base that still responds to racism and xenophobia. The move is one of the ""calling cards of Trumpism and Trump\'s politics,"" he argued, referencing Trump previously claiming immigrants crossing the border were ""rapists"" and referring to Haiti, El Salvador and various African nations as ""shithole countries."" ', '""It\'s the politics of fear,"" Lindskoog told Salon. ""Anxious Americans who are concerned about issues of race and the economy and all these things respond to these lies, sometimes about immigrants and criminality. It\'s a long playbook going back a long time.""', 'That playbook extends back to the anti-Chinese sentiment of the late 19th century, when politicians were making similar false claims and sparking ""tragic incidents of mob violence"" against Chinese communities, he explained. Those attacks also ""paralleled"" acts or racial terror against Black Americans other migrant groups.

But the harm the falsehoods have brought to the city's Haitian residents in the aftermath of the debate has been immense.

Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.', 'The ""demonization"" of Haitian\'s migration to South Florida, especially in the 1970s and 80s, led to the U.S. implementing harsher laws policing migrants fleeing their nation by sea, she explained. Working-class Haitians and Cubans were also the first to ""systematically be detained"" as part of that immigration policy. Those practices carried over into the current detention and deportation strategies used against Central American migrants in the last decade and employed under the Trump administration, including “Remain in Mexico” program and Title 42, ""all of which made it difficult for all migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to gain access.""', '""By focusing on migrants as the so-called problem, politicians can distract focus from the real problems people in the U.S. are facing such as access to affordable housing, consistent employment, and a fair cost of living,"" Gow added ""Setting up migrants and Haitians as a well-trod \'scapegoat” allows politicians to skirt around real issues and ultimately make communities of color (migrant or not) less safe.""', 'Trump and Vance\'s comments also must be understood as part of a longer history of the nation\'s attitude toward Haiti, she explained. ""At the island nation’s founding, policy-makers and thinkers saw the nation and its people as \'dangerous,\' \'rebellious\' Blacks who (as evidenced by the U.S. occupation of the nation from 1915-1934 and later interventionist missions in the 20th century) are deemed necessary to occupy, “civilize” and control.""', ""In Springfield, Haitian migrants comprise about a quarter of the population, amounting to over 15,000 of the blue-collar city's nearly 60,000 residents. The overwhelming majority live in the city legally, with many having settled there in recent years after receiving Temporary Protected Status (TPS) due to political turmoil, economic instability and environmental disasters in Haiti."", ""Haitians who've now built lives in Springfield were attracted to the area because of its relatively low cost of living and the wealth of employment opportunities bolstered by the city chamber of commerce's work to create jobs. City leaders have said the immigrant community has since boosted its economy and development.

That includes supporting each other, helping each other find work and bringing with them the richness of their culture, including the ""culinary art"" — one that he felt he had to emphasize does not include eating cats or dogs — while contributing to the fabric and the growth of the city they now call home.', '""We are people,"" Édouard said.

The acrimony falls on the small city of Springfield, where thousands of migrants have settled temporarily after legally being admitted to the U.S. Yost, a candidate for governor in 2026, has vowed to pursue legal action, though he hasn’t said what.', 'But does Yost believe there’s any truth to the claim about migrants eating pets and geese, which have been refuted by local officials?', 'In an interview, Yost suggested there is some limited evidence that Haitians are eating geese stolen from a park but not cats and dogs. At other points he seemed to contradict himself and say there was no evidence of geese being eaten either. He criticized media for confusing a lack of supporting evidence with writing off the possibility entirely.

Mere words never justify a criminal act.”', 'Do you agree with Trump that Haitians in Springfield should be deported?', '“I agree that illegal immigrants should be deported from wherever they have come.”', 'Right, but these are legal immigrants, here under temporary protective status.', '“That makes it a different question. I am an officer of the law. I am bound by the law.

There’s substance here of schools that are being overwhelmed with non-English speaking students that they weren’t prepared for in terms of fiscal capacity or teachers. There are impacts on the health care system that does not have enough doctors or nurses to handle this increased demand. There are impacts on the county and state social service networks with more than 4,000 people, immigrants receiving public assistance. Those things deserve to be debated.

Ohio's GOP Governor Has A Message For Trump About 'Hurtful' Pet-Eating Lies,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-dewine-trump-vance-pets_n_66eaaa1be4b00648275b41c1,"['', 'Ohio Gov.

A bomb threat tied to a rumor-turned-lie about the city’s growing Haitian immigrant population had forced an evacuation. Ms. Pankratz addressed it delicately.', 'Historians have long warned that people in the United States need to stop demonizing one another. The costs of acidic rhetoric are on display in Springfield, Ohio, where discredited rumors became a political football.', '“What do you notice? ... What do you wonder?” she asked. ', 'Her students offered their observations and questions. So as Ms. Pankratz helped the little ones board a bus bound for the high school, she shared what she could.', '“Snowhill is not safe for us to be in right now,” she told them. “We need to go to a place that is safe for you. And remember: My No. 1 job is to keep you safe.”', 'Dozens of bomb threats have escalated physical safety concerns in this Midwestern city sandwiched between Dayton and Columbus. Multiple schools and city buildings have been evacuated both this week and last, and residents interviewed talk about a simmering sense of unease and daily life disrupted. In a nutshell, Springfield has come under verbal siege.', 'The city is a parable of the effects that coarsening political discourse has had on U.S. society. Long decried by historians as corrosive, once unleashed, politicized hatred cannot be contained within its banks. And, as Springfield shows, it hurts everyone. ', 'Tensions were brewing here before a discredited rumor about the community’s Haitian immigrants eating neighborhood pets gained traction online. Then it was amplified by the GOP presidential ticket. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, repeated the incendiary claim in interviews, on the debate stage, and on the campaign trail. Gov. Mike DeWine, a fellow Republican, and city officials have said the claim is not true. ', 'Suddenly, Springfield found itself thrust into the national spotlight as the latest backdrop for heated immigration rhetoric less than two months before the election.', 'Governor DeWine has appeared alongside local leaders in a bid to assuage fears and announce extra security precautions: three dozen state troopers monitoring city schools, “vulnerability assessments” of critical infrastructure, tower cameras strategically placed around town, and bomb-sniffing dogs.', 'The threats have originated from both foreign and domestic sources, Mr. DeWine says, with many coming from overseas.', 'Regardless, the swatting attempts have gobbled up time and resources. Residents like Ms. Pankratz feel disheartened. Frustrated, even.', '“Why are adults pulling children into this?” she asks. “What do the lives of children have to do with politics?”', 'The bus full of evacuated children chugged forward Friday, passing her house on a nearby street. Ms. Pankratz looked longingly at her front porch and told her students she wished they could be there, eating pancakes with each other.', 'The image conjures a joy and unity she hopes to see rise from the aftermath of this turbulent chapter in the city’s history.', 'New Diaspora Live, billed as the Midwest’s most diverse studio, occupies a window-framed office inside a popular coworking space in Springfield.

He realized the radio station, where he serves as a radio host and executive manager, plays a pivotal role in changing the narrative.', '“We understood that if we don’t address this situation, there is no place safe in America,” he says.', 'Mr. Jerome came to the United States three years ago. He never intended to stay long-term, but while here, the Caribbean nation’s then-president was assassinated. The violent act threw Haiti into civil upheaval, compounded by an earthquake, and created a humanitarian crisis. The multilingual entrepreneur settled in Springfield, lured by a friend who thought he could help the city’s growing Haitian immigrant population.', 'It is unclear how many Haitians live in Springfield, although the city website estimates that there are at least 12,000 immigrants overall. The U.S. Census Bureau does not track that data, making it difficult to pinpoint exact numbers. Many Haitians have a legal designation given through a federal program known as Temporary Protected Status. As the name suggests, it temporarily shields certain immigrants from deportation if civil unrest, natural disasters, or other unfavorable conditions would make returning to their home countries dangerous. For his part, Mr. Jerome estimates that about 10,000 Haitians are in the city now.', 'Temporary Protected Status recipients are eligible for work permits, and when the initial migration surge started, Springfield had what Haitian immigrants needed next – a job. They’re working in warehouses, manufacturing centers, and in the service industry, city officials say. Others are launching their own businesses, such as restaurants and grocery stores.', 'Governor DeWine has said business leaders told him the Haitian immigrants took positions they were struggling to fill postpandemic. The employment boost, in turn, has been helping power the economy of this once-vibrant manufacturing city.', '“Springfield is on the move,” Mr. DeWine said at a press conference Tuesday. “I couldn’t have said that 10 years ago.”', 'That’s not to say growing pains don’t exist. Residents say tensions have been bubbling over issues such as unsafe driving habits, language barriers at the grocery store, and long lines at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. There have been concerns about rent increases and, on the flip side, worries about immigrants’ living conditions and vulnerability to exploitation. Schools, too, have felt the strain of serving hundreds of new-to-country students.', 'A tipping point came in August 2023 when a school bus crash involving a Haitian driver killed 11-year-old Aiden Clark. Politicians, including Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance, latched onto the tragedy for what Aiden’s father has described as “political gain.” He has pleaded with them to stop using his son’s name for that purpose.', '“After the accident, that’s when everything started changing, because it created a situation of fear,” says Mr. Jerome, who ramped up information about safe driving on the radio station.', 'Still, the city’s Haitian community retreated a bit, he says. It scaled back this year’s plans for a Haitian Flag Day event earlier this year.', 'The baseless accusations about cats and dogs – since recanted by two local women – stoked those fears within the Haitian community and triggered a ripple effect across Springfield. The bomb threats have caused school attendance to plunge. One school logged 200 students absent out of roughly 500 earlier this week. Wittenberg University moved classes online all week.', 'The city also canceled its upcoming CultureFest celebration, leaving colorful banners attached to streetlights as signs of what has been lost. City officials called it the “most responsible course of action,” given ongoing safety concerns.', 'Laura Koveleski, who is Haitian through her mother’s side of the family, strikes a more optimistic tone. She grew up in Springfield before it became a magnet for her fellow Haitians.', '“There’s a blessing in disguise in this because now that we have eyes, we definitely have threats, which is a negative, but we have opportunity,” she says.', 'If anyone is keenly aware of this duality enveloping the city, it’s Casey Rollins, executive director of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Springfield. ', 'The neighbor-oriented organization has been assisting newly arrived Haitians since 2017. That’s when the first few Haitian immigrants began knocking on the door, seeking help so they could find a job and get settled. Now, a line often forms outside in the morning. Ms. Rollins says the Springfield chapter of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul never intended to jump into immigrant services; it simply evolved to meet the need.', '“We’re not bringing anybody here,” she says. “We’re just embracing the stranger once they are here.”', 'Many are no longer strangers. They have shared meals and holidays together. But the vitriol directed at Springfield and its immigrants has cast a nervousness over the building. Ms. Rollins keeps a watchful eye on the front windows, mentally taking note of who is coming and going. The retired teacher knows that police officers – some her former students – are just a text or call away if danger arises.', 'This is not what brings her to tears, though.', 'Over the past week, she has fielded hundreds of supportive calls and emails from people around the world. Lawyers want to provide legal assistance. Doctors and professors want to host education seminars. Others want to donate time, money, or prayers. An anonymous couple, captured by surveillance cameras, even left eight pieces of Haitian artwork at the organization’s back door. Amid the avalanche of messages, Ms. Rollins stayed up until 2 a.m. one day responding to each person. ', '“I’m like crying through this, thinking, ‘God, this is amazing. This is amazing. It validates what we’re trying to defend,’” she says.', 'What they’re trying to defend is this: a group of Haitian immigrants huddled around a computer Tuesday afternoon. Their leader, a man who says he immigrated here three years ago and speaks English, was helping them apply for work authorization.', 'Ms. Rollins says Haitian immigrants typically don’t seek household necessities. More often, they come to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for interpreters, computer access, and mentors who can guide them through filing paperwork.', 'In her quest to not let the political noise be a distraction, Ms. Rollins keeps this mantra in mind: “Stop criminalizing, stop demonizing, stop politicizing, and start humanizing.”', 'Back at Snowhill Elementary School, classes resumed Monday. Many students didn’t show up, Ms. Pankratz says, forcing teachers to shuffle lesson plans yet again. The chaos and fear have stymied learning, but one thing has not changed: Ms. Pankratz continues telling her students, including two Haitian children, that she loves them.', 'It’s a message she wants the city’s youngest members to grow up hearing.', 'The next generation includes Mr. Jerome’s baby daughter. The radio host says fatherhood has sharpened his resolve to help Springfield move forward.

Some schools and government buildings shuttered on Thursday over unspecified threats, and officials who spoke against the rumors were doxxed online.

These annoyances are not the end of the world, but they are frustrating nonetheless.', ""Then, there are the more serious issues. There are multiple car crashes daily. I've personally witnessed more than a few. It has become almost impossible to drive on the south end of town. I can't drive to my mother's house without calculating whether to go down a different street or take another route. Crashes occur daily, sometimes hourly. It's really bad, and it's straining police services. About six months ago, I was involved in a car crash (not with a Haitian immigrant) and it took police three hours to respond.

DeWine on ABC News on Sunday pushed back on the claims spread by Vance and Trump, saying many members of the Haitian community “are very good workers” and improving the Springfield economy. DeWine said the rumor was “a piece of garbage that was simply not true,” adding there was “no evidence at all.” Springfield Mayor Rob Rue also criticized the rumors and said the city was being “smeared,” adding political leaders on the national stage need to understand the impact their words can have on cities like Springfield.', 'Despite local leadership reiterating that the claims being spread are unsubstantiated, Vance defended his claims Sunday. He told CNN’s Dana Bash he was trying to highlight problems in Springfield that were previously being ignored, and said he wanted to “create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people.” Vance clarified he did not admit to making up the stories, but said he meant they were “creating the American media focusing on it.”', 'DeWine announced a number of other precautions to increase security in Springfield.
