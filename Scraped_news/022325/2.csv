However, her party is set to stay out of power as its coalition partners refuse cooperation with the far right.', '', 'Merz, a corporate lawyer and a multimillionaire who has never been a minister, has had a prolific career in diverse fields, including the military, law and judiciary.

He entered full-time politics in 1989. Merz is also a licensed private pilot and owns two airplanes.', ""Political career: He has been a part of CDU since 1972 but in 1989, Merz became a conservative member of the European Parliament. In 1994, he made his way to the Bundestag, the German federal parliament, after winning an absolute majority in Hochsauerlandkreis constituency. After holding key positions in the CDU, he went on to become the party's parliamentary leader in 2000. Two years later, his rise ended and in 2009 Merz decided to leave politics. He found himself sidelined after 2005's political setback, when the CDU/CSU bloc formed a government in Germany along with SPD."", 'Break from politics: For a decade he worked as a corporate lawyer while also taking the helm of Atlantik-Br¼cke, a lobby advocating transatlantic ties and made a glorious career in law and finance.', 'Return to politics: When Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018, Merz saw an opportunity to return to politics. However, he lost his bid to succeed Merkel by a thin margin to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. In 2020, he wasn’t considered for succession as the party played its bet on Armin Laschet.', 'In 2022, the party elected him chairman on his third attempt for the job. “I am deeply moved,” Merz said after the vote, fighting back tears.

That move was praised by some but condemned by others, mainly on the right of the political spectrum. It has also become less popular over recent years.', 'So far, Merz has promised to stop what he called illegal migration, pledged “zero tolerance” on crime and said he will reverse marijuana legalisation.', 'With the CDU currently ahead in the polls, Merz is tipped to win the election.', 'But in late January, Merz drew controversy when he put a non-binding motion to Germany’s parliament to strengthen border controls and accelerate deportations.

That makes its elections Sunday a test of whether this bulwark can – and should – hold.', 'Germany’s history has given rise to a democracy uniquely tasked with resisting the populist wave sweeping the West. The government has powers to clamp down on free speech that it sees as dangerous to democracy. It can even ban parties, as it did to a communist party and an openly neo-Nazi party during the Soviet era. The AfD is under surveillance by the domestic intelligence service.  ', 'Yet the forces that are pushing Western democracies toward populism are here, too – and in some respects, even stronger. The economy is stagnant, with few prospects for a quick turnaround. Inflation is rampant, and includes the highest energy costs in Europe. And immigration is seen as out of control, punctuated by a string of violent attacks by asylum-seekers.', 'That makes this election something of a battleground for how far populism can spread. Germany is perhaps the West’s last and most difficult beachhead.', 'Frustrated by these features of German democracy, United States Vice President JD Vance last week pointed the finger at German politicians, saying “there is no room for firewalls.” But here in Germany, there is a sense that something much deeper is at work.', 'The firewall has always been a product of German voters’ desire for order and stability – a trust in the government’s competence. Its rupture would signal a fundamental breach in that core post-World War II political contract. Sunday’s elections will offer an indication of how many German voters feel driven to that extreme.  ', '“I have lost my faith,” says Holger Rousseau, sitting at a café on Berlin’s Alexanderplatz.', 'He rattles off a series of strong German leaders from the past and wonders where they have gone. It seems to him that Germany’s leaders of today don’t care about the people the way they once did. “They are not there for the voters.”', '“The country has lost the values that it stood for,” adds his wife, Britta.', 'She won’t reveal the party she supports, but she says parts of the AfD platform are good, including its get-tough stance on immigration. And she does not dismiss the fact that 20% of the population wants the AfD to be in government. She doesn’t see the danger some others do.', '“The German people are clever enough not to repeat the past,” she says.', 'Since the end of World War II, the deep, motivating fear here has been a repeat of 1933, when the National Socialists were invited to form a government. While few experts see the AfD as a reprise of the Nazis, the party’s willingness to evoke Nazi-era slogans and to endorse virulent anti-immigrant rhetoric have so far made them untouchable.', 'But the Rousseaus show how that view is shifting. And even among those who are strongly against the AfD, there is an understanding of why the AfD is growing.', '“I’ve never before witnessed people being so unsure about who to vote for,” says Philipp M., a Berliner who asked that his last name not be used for privacy reasons. “There’s a sense that, no matter who you vote for, nothing will change.”', '“I don’t think 20% of the people are Nazis,” he adds. “Half of that vote are probably people who are just unsatisfied.”', 'This trend has defined recent politics in the West, with populist parties and leaders from the U.S. to France to Britain capitalizing on a loss of faith in politics.', '“The AfD has effectively positioned itself as, ‘We’re the only alternative to the politics of today,’” says Eric Langenbacher, a professor and Germany expert at Georgetown University.', 'The actual threat presented by the AfD is open to wide interpretation. Elon Musk has been campaigning on AfD’s behalf, rejecting the idea that AfD is even right wing. The AfD remains splintered between moderate and radical wings, with both maintaining significant influence. The leader of the radical wing, Björn Höcke, has repeatedly used a phrase – “Everything for Germany” – that has been banned because of its connection to Nazi stormtroopers.', 'More generally, the party represents a reversal of much of what modern Germany has been built on. That is both its appeal and why the demand for the firewall endures. While Germans strongly support new immigration measures, the AfD’s rhetoric about massive deportations is seen by many as having a worryingly racial element. Its anti-European Union stance is in contrast to Germany’s defining role in building a unified Europe since World War II. And its desire to more fully embrace German history goes against deep revulsion toward the Nazi past.', '“The majority of Germans still don’t feel comfortable being nationalistic,” says Hope Harrison, a history professor and Germany expert at George Washington University.  ', 'Germany’s status as a bulwark against populism will likely be determined not Sunday, but in the years to come. It’s possible that the AfD could become more mainstream, as parties like the Greens have in the past.', '“A party evolves,” says Jackson Janes of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. “It’s possible that it becomes a more acceptable coalition partner.”', 'It’s also possible that the AfD becomes more appealing if Germany’s new government cannot come to grips with the challenges facing the country.

Germany Election Results: Center-Right Leader Declares Victory—And Elon Musk-Boosted AfD Celebrates,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/02/23/germany-election-results-center-right-leader-declares-victory-and-elon-musk-boosted-afd-celebrates/,"['Germany’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) declared victory Sunday as exit polls and early results suggest the party garnered the biggest vote share in the country’s elections—and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is projected to nab a historic number of votes after billionaire Elon Musk’s endorsement.', 'Voters in Germany elected their next parliament—which in Germany is known as the Bundestag—but did not directly elect the next German chancellor, as one is chosen, rather, based on which party has the highest share of votes.', 'Early exit polls cited by multiple outlets project the CDU—the party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel—is expected to get the highest share of votes in this election, likely positioning its leader Friedrich Merz to be the next chancellor.', 'Merz declared victory shortly after the polls closed Sunday, proclaiming CDU has “won the Bundestag election” and he is “aware of the responsibility that now lies ahead,” as quoted by BBC News.', 'AfD is projected to receive the second-highest vote share, as the right-wing party has grown in popularity among young voters and attracted support from Musk and Vice President JD Vance—its performance is expected to be the best of any far-right party in Germany since World War II, with leader Alice Weidel hailing a “historic result.”', 'Early exit polls show CDU with approximately 30% support while AfD has approximtely 20% of the vote, according to polls cited by The Guardian and The New York Times.', 'The Bundestag is now led by the center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) and leader Olaf Scholz, who conceded defeat Sunday after exit polls showed the SDP running in third place behind CDU and AfD with approximately 16.5% of votes.', 'Germany’s elections are seen as particularly important in Europe, as the country has the largest population in the European Union and the highest GDP.', 'Results are now rolling in, and it will likely become clear in the coming hours how the final results match up with the exit polls. Determining who will lead as chancellor will take longer, as it first has to be determined which parties will control the Bundestag, and then the leader is chosen by its members.', 'When Germans vote Sunday, it will only determine who’s elected to parliament and how the Bundestag will be divided between the parties based on the popular vote. Germany has a variety of political parties and it’s unlikely that any single party will win an outright majority, so different parties have to band together and form a coalition that has majority support to make decisions in the legislature. Once a coalition is formed, the German president—different from the chancellor—will propose a chancellor to lead the government, which is then voted on by parliament. The entire process can take weeks or months, Euronews notes.', 'Merz, the anticipated next chancellor of Germany, is a conservative figure who returned to politics after previously leaving to pursue a corporate career in the 2000s. He’s a longtime rival of Merkel who had left politics after she ascended to power in Germany, and previously lost two votes to lead the CDU in 2018 and 2021. He holds more conservative views than Merkel and represents a further-right faction of the party, particularly on immigration. Merz garnered widespread backlash in January when he got an anti-immigration resolution passed in the Bundestag with help from some AfD politicians, which was viewed as breaking the longtime “firewall” of major parties not working with the far-right party. He has since reiterated his vows not to work with AfD.', 'AfD is Germany’s furthest right major party, though the leadership itself has insisted it’s not far-right but rather a “libertarian, conservative” party. It has also denounced associations with Nazism. The party was formed in 2013 as an anti-European Union party but has broadened to embrace a variety of right-wing positions, most notably a hardline stance on immigration after Germany accepted a particularly high number of migrants from countries like Syria. The party is putting forth its first candidate for chancellor in this election, Weidel, a former Goldman Sachs analyst who Al Jazeera notes has been with the party since its formation in 2013. The party has gained popularity more recently among younger voters as it has made inroads via TikTok, BBC News notes, with younger men particularly backing the party. Anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany has also been fueled by a string of violent attacks that were allegedly committed by immigrants, with the BBC reporting five such attacks have taken place since May, most recently a stabbing Friday at Berlin’s Holocaust memorial.', 'While AfD is poised to get the second-highest share of votes in Germany’s elections, other leaders in the German government, including Merz, have vowed not to work with the party. That means that even though AfD is poised to get a significant number of seats in the Bundestag, CDU is expected not to form a coalition with it, and instead work only with other political parties. AfD co-chair Tino Chrupalla on Sunday called on other parties to work with AfD, however, saying the party has been “given a mandate to bring about political change.” “We have received the confidence of the voters and that should be something everybody else accepts as well,” Chrupalla said, as quoted by the BBC.', 'Musk has repeatedly boosted AfD, including by appearing by video at a rally, hosting a conversation with Weidel and authoring an op-ed in a German newspaper praising the party. He continued praising AfD on X ahead of Sunday’s election, pinning a post to the top of his profile that says “AfD!” with a string of German flags and responding “Yes” on Sunday to a post saying German voters should vote for the party because their “life depends on it.” Vance also drew controversy from other German leaders when he met with Weidel in February and chastised European leaders in a speech for not working with far-right parties like AfD. President Donald Trump hailed CDU’s victory in a Truth Social post Sunday, claiming the conservative party had prevailed after Germans “GOT TIRED OF THE NO COMMON SENSE AGENDA.” “THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR GERMANY, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,” Trump wrote.', 'The head of Germany’s leading Jewish organization expressed concern Sunday about the AfD’s strong showing. “It must concern us all that a fifth of German voters are giving their vote to a party that is at least partly right-wing extremist, that openly seeks linguistic and ideological links to right-wing radicalism and neo-Nazism, that plays on people’s fears and only offers them ostensible solutions,” Josef Schuster, who leads the Central Council of Jews, told newspaper Die Welt, as quoted by the AP.', 'Germany is holding its election sooner than scheduled, after Scholz’s three-party coalition government in the Bundestag fell apart late last year when the chancellor fired then-Finance Minister Christian Lindner amid growing infighting. Scholz then faced a vote of no-confidence from the Bundestag in December, which The Guardian reports he deliberately called and lost in order to force a new election. The anticipated rise in support for AfD comes as far-right populist parties throughout Europe made inroads and gained power in recent years, including in Austria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal.', 'Alison Durkee is a senior reporter covering breaking news, with a focus on legal issues and U.S. politics.

The far right rising,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2025/02/german-election-afd-far-right-rising,"['New Times,\nNew Thinking.', 'Ahead of a historic German election, the AfD is courting the global right – and threatening to upend European politics.', 'By Annette Dittert', 'It is time to say goodbye to Germany as an oasis of stability. Like many in Britain, I have long looked to it as a bastion of good, sensible, borderline-boring politics – especially during the Brexit chaos of the post-referendum years. Not any more.', 'As the country goes to the polls on 23 February, there is a real danger that its position as a lynchpin of liberal democracy in Europe might suffer lasting, if not irreparable damage. The election will also have an immeasurable impact on how Europe reacts to Donald Trump’s apparent willingness to surrender Ukraine – which will affect the security of the whole continent. In this situation, it is crucial to have a stable German government playing a leading role in Brussels.', 'Yet, such a government is by no means certain. On the contrary, there is a real possibility that the Federal Republic will emerge from these Bundestag elections ungovernable. Neither of the two main centrist blocs – the Social Democratic Party (SPD) or the centre-right alliance of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) – are polling anywhere near high enough to look as if they will form a government on their own. And, as the political landscape fractures, even a majority for a two-party coalition is looking unlikely. Meanwhile, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) is at above 20 per cent – the highest it has ever polled and in second place behind the CDU/CSU.', 'Germany is now preparing for weeks or months of wrangling before something approaching a functioning government can be installed – if at all. Despite its size, the AfD will not be part of the next government: every other centrist party has expressly excluded the prospect of entering a coalition with it. The CDU leader Friedrich Merz – who will, barring a real upset, head Germany’s next government – has staked his political future on a categorical refusal.', 'But while the political centre has ruled out coalitions with the AfD, that doesn’t mean it is equipped to resist the draw of its politics. Whatever kind of coalition Merz might be able to form after the election, the AfD will be governing from the sidelines, destabilising his administration and undermining his political authority. In a way, the CDU leader only has himself to blame. Having made a habit of nabbing the far-right party’s issues and parroting its patterns of speech – particularly when it comes to issues such as immigration – he has drawn the AfD into the centre of the election campaign. In late January, he even used AfD votes to obtain a majority for a parliamentary motion – in breach of a long-standing taboo in German politics known as the “firewall” by which no centrist party should ever cooperate with the far right.', 'After an Afghan asylum seeker stabbed two people to death in an unmotivated criminal attack in the city of Aschaffenburg on 22 January, Germany’s smouldering debate around immigration was reignited. In an effort to secure his strongman image, Merz not only declared Germany to be an “unsafe country” – rhetoric that up until then was used by the AfD – he also proposed a series of measures to tighten the country’s borders, which would practically end free movement within the EU on a permanent basis.', 'In a weak attempt to protect the “firewall”, Merz garnished his draft motion with condemnations of the AfD in the hope the party would not back it – and that the SPD and the Greens would be swayed to vote with him. Yet the AfD leadership voted with Merz and the CDU, while the SPD and Greens voted against the proposed legislation on the grounds that it was incompatible with EU law. The motion passed (though, this close to the election, it will not be implemented). The firewall had cracked: it was the first time a German centrist democratic party had pushed through a piece of legislature on a national level with the support of a far-right extremist party.', 'Moreover, having previously promised not to cooperate with the AfD, Merz severely damaged his own credibility. In an effort to restore the firewall, he has reiterated that he will not form a coalition with the AfD following the election. However, who’s to say that he won’t, having broken one taboo in January, break the next? If coalition talks with other parties fail, could he try to lead a minority government, which would occasionally need further support from the far right to pass legislation?', 'Something that has been considered inconceivable in Germany since 1945 has now become a distinct possibility: a far-right party shaping, however indirectly, the nation’s government. The AfD isn’t just any right-wing populist outfit, either. It was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but has become increasingly radical with each passing year. Today it is one of the continent’s most extreme far-right groups: still anti-EU, but also pro-Vladimir Putin, and determined to destroy the democratic foundations of postwar Germany. It has proved too toxic for France’s Marine Le Pen, who booted it out of her “Patriots for Europe” grouping in the European Parliament in 2024 for being too extreme. German courts have even ruled that one of the AfD’s leaders, Björn Höcke, may officially be referred to as a “fascist” without constituting defamation. And in parts of former East Germany, local AfD groups are cooperating with neo-Nazi groups.', 'The AfD has sought to make migration the core issue of every electoral campaign – and Merz has helped the far-right party do just that. His error in January was to tie a single horrifying attack to wider problems in immigration policy, playing right into the AfD’s rhetoric instead of pursuing workable solutions. Indeed, the policy proposals he has now passed with AfD support will be almost impossible to implement. Merz, in a distinctly Trumpian fashion, has said that when he is in power, he will close Germany’s borders and refuse entry to all “illegal” immigrants on a permanent basis. This neglects how it is simply not possible to close the Federal Republic’s 4,000-kilometre-long border – German police unions estimate that such an endeavour would require at least another 10,000 new officers to guard the border – and ignores the inconvenient truth that German chancellors do not have the same executive power as US presidents. What’s more, his CDU/CSU is polling at 30 per cent, meaning he would need the SPD and probably one other party to form a government – partners who will not support permanent border closures that might be refused in European courts.', 'The predictable result of those negotiations is that Merz will be forced to scale down his rhetoric – leading, in turn, to further frustration among voters while the AfD triumphantly wields proof of its enduring criticism that the mainstream parties simply cannot deliver when it comes to stemming migration. He’ll leave the AfD looking like the only real opposition to what will likely be an unstable three-party coalition government.', 'Perhaps even more significantly, Merz’s policies are incompatible with European law. They contravene one of the pillars of the common market: the Schengen Agreement on freedom of movement. This also plays into the AfD’s agenda, as it wants to extricate Germany from the EU. While Schengen does allow border closures in exceptional circumstances, they must be time-limited, and several European legal experts doubt whether the attack in Aschaffenburg or even similar attacks constitute a national emergency of the kind required to justify such measures – all the more so because the number of refugees arriving in Germany is actually declining.', 'It is true that the country is struggling with way more than its fair share of asylum seekers, and that the joint European asylum system is in urgent need of reform. Yet giving national legislation precedence over European law would, in the medium term, likely weaken Germany’s position by provoking retaliatory measures from neighbouring countries who have already expressed their displeasure at Merz’s campaign proposals. Austria, for instance, has made it very clear that it would not take back any asylum seekers from Germany; Poland has adopted a similar stance.', 'In the summer of 2024, EU member states agreed on reforming the Common European Asylum System, adopting stronger entry checks at external EU borders with a view to spreading the load of asylum seekers across the bloc more equitably. Admittedly, this is a tedious, slow process not due to be implemented until 2026, but it is the only way to get a grip on migration without undermining the entire European project.', 'Merz knows all of this. Several members of his party have tried to explain away his pandering to the far right as a deliberate, calculated provocation during the election campaign meant to burnish the CDU’s right-wing credentials. After the election, they insist, he’ll moderate his position again. Yet this is a dangerously naive underestimation of the extent to which normalising far-right narratives undermines conservative positions and can, over time, destroy right-of-centre parties.', 'This is already happening. In late January, the CDU deputy leader Carsten Linnemann defended Merz’s strategy by saying that voters “have had enough of the AfD being branded Nazis and all the prattling on about the ‘firewall’”; another member of the party told the weekly Die Zeit that he was fed up with hearing “that some f***ing court order means we can’t do this or the Geneva Convention says we can’t do that”. This is the speed at which parts of the centrist conservative CDU have embraced AfD positions – and Merz may soon find that, in his efforts to position the CDU more firmly right of centre after the Angela Merkel years, he has gone much further than he meant to. If coalition talks with other centrist parties fail following the election, he will be under increased pressure from some quarters of his own party to form a minority government tolerated by the AfD.', 'Especially now the AfD has been given the official seal of approval from the very country that returned Germany to democracy after the Second World War. The Trump administration is openly supporting a far-right party with extremist members who consistently seek to minimise Nazi crimes. After having hailed the AfD as “Germany’s future” repeatedly on X, Elon Musk held an online talk with AfD leader Alice Weidel on 9 January, when he called on Germans to stop focusing on their historical guilt. At the Munich Security Conference on 14 February, the US vice-president JD Vance demanded that German centrist politicians should tear down the firewall against the AfD, before later meeting with Weidel.', 'The Trump administration is hardly ignorant of history. To the contrary: its support for the AfD is an attack on Germany’s historical conscience. This is because the firewall is the practical-political result of Germany’s memory of the totalitarian horrors of Nazi rule, a hard line drawn around the dangers of extremism. When Musk and Vance call for its destruction, they know exactly what they are doing. Supporting the AfD and normalising it for the German mainstream is an attack on historical conscience as an inoculation against authoritarian nationalism. The erosion of the firewall also has implications far beyond German borders. If Germany’s immunity to totalitarianism is lost, then it will be not just the EU’s largest country which has fallen, but the political and moral foundation of the EU itself. It’s notable that Hungary’s illiberal prime minister Viktor Orbán, who has long railed against the EU from within, hosted Weidel earlier this month. Following the meeting, a rare event between a sitting European leader and an AfD politician, Orbán said it was clear that the party was “the future”.', 'Yet nothing is certain. The sheer crudeness of Vance’s Munich speech has done the moderate wing of the CDU a service by showing the US’s intervention for what it is: a destructive force intent on destroying the EU. Merz has roundly rejected Vance’s foray into the campaign and once again underlined the importance of the firewall. In this way, Vance may have inadvertently pushed Merz’s CDU away from the AfD – and potentially galvanised Berlin’s political centre into installing a functioning government without excessive delay.', 'It’s a critical moment for Europe. The likelihood of a Russian attack on eastern Europe or the Baltic states has risen sharply, and a new German government will need to reassume its leading role in Brussels as soon as possible while rekindling its close alliance with France and Poland.', 'In this sense, the Bundestag election is not just a watershed moment for Germany, it’s one for global politics as well. If Berlin’s democratic centre holds, then so too will the EU in its present form. Yet if Germany – a country whose history has made it, thus far, the most immune to authoritarian tendencies in the 21st century – suffers a further tectonic shift in the foundations of its stable liberal democracy, the European project, too, will be shaken to its core.', '[See also: Angela Merkel’s first principles]', '', '', '', 'This article appears in the 19 Feb 2025 issue of the New Statesman, Europe Alone', 'Related']"

Without naming it, Vance was defending a far-right political party called Alternative for Germany (AfD), best-known for its commitment to deporting as many immigrants as the country’s airports can process. Vance said he “happen[s] to agree” with voters worried about “out-of-control migration.” But he was aghast at the idea that governments would try to silence their citizens, whatever their views. “There is no room for firewalls,” he said. “You either uphold the principle of democracy or you do not.”', 'Germany’s establishment leaders have long accepted a different binary: Either you put up a “firewall” (Brandmauer) against far-right extremists, or you risk losing your democracy to literal Nazis.

But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election."", ""The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%)."", ""The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government."", '""I\'m just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form,"" says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break.""', ""The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table."", ""Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world."", 'Merz\'s longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany\'s parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction.

He says Merz has strong beliefs: ""Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people,"" says Röttgen. ""And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist.""', ""Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies."", 'The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. ""I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively,"" says Puglierin. ""But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population.""', 'After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says.', ""Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic."", 'Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz\'s potential leadership.

Primarily, of course, those consequences will be felt in Germany itself, with its extended economic stagnation, its anxieties about migration and borders, its traditional fears about borrowing, its nervousness about military commitments, and its sudden lurching anxiety that the US is ready to allow Russia to threaten the lands on its eastern frontier.', 'Germany’s inherent importance, though, means the election will also help determine whether Europe – not just the EU – is able to cope with Trump’s second term. Will that Europe be able to deliver the defence and security to protect not merely Ukraine, a daunting enough task, but the Baltic republics, Poland and the other former Soviet satellite states too? Can it reform its faltering economic model? These are reverberations that Britain cannot avoid, even if it wants to.', 'Needless to say, the German election has received only a fraction of the attention that this country’s political class lavishes on a US election. Equally predictably, much of that very limited amount of attention is absorbed by a fixation – one that is shared to a degree by the German media – with the populist anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. As a result, however, the likely victor on Sunday, the centre-right CDU-CSU coalition under the probable next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has barely been scrutinised at all.', 'This contest is occurring against a backdrop of economic failure, not success. The German economy shrank in 2023 and again in 2024. It seems likely to stay in recession again this year. It adds up to the longest period of economic stagnation since the fall of Hitler in 1945. Whoever emerges as chancellor after Sunday will face choices very similar to those confronting Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.', 'The reasons for Germany’s decline are not hard to understand. Germany’s dependence on Russian energy meant prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine. Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition government, in power since 2021, has scaled back that dependence – renewables now produce 60% of German energy – but not eliminated it. German car exports have become more expensive, while China has surged ahead in the production of cheaper electric vehicles. A tariff war with the US now looms.', 'All this has provided a system shock to a country still strongly conditioned by its craving for postwar stability. “We have used up our old success, and not invested in new things,” the commentator Theo Koll told the UK in a Changing Europe podcast this week. “We have for a long time lived in a kind of ‘Gore-Tex republic’ … we wanted it nice and cosy inside and all the unpleasant things had to be outside.”', 'This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.', 'The rise of the AfD, amid the perception that irregular migration is out of control, is the single most visible sign that the old political era has ended. It has been quickened by violent killings where migrants are suspects during the election campaign in Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and, last week, Munich. The latest Politico poll of polls puts the AfD on 21%, double what it secured in the previous federal election in 2021, running second to the CDU-CSU on 29%, but ahead of Scholz’s SPD on 16% and the Greens on 13%.', 'By that token, though, a victory for Merz’s CDU-CSU on 23 February would be genuinely significant. It would be significant even though 29% would be a decline from the 42% that the parties took under Angela Merkel in 2013. It would show, in Europe’s heartland, that the line can be held against populism of the right. This is not a trivial lesson, especially after the debacle of the French assembly election last year.', 'It would also be a vote of confidence, albeit a relatively weak one, for one of Europe’s few remaining big parties of the centre right. Once-powerful parties like the French Gaullists can only look on with frustration and envy – to say nothing of Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives. Not least, it would also be a rebuke to those like Elon Musk and JD Vance who have actively promoted the AfD from abroad.', 'Yet it would also pose two big questions. The first, and more immediate, would be the coalition that Merz would construct and the content of its programme. Everything here depends on which parties qualify for the Bundestag and on how many seats each wins. Merz has repeatedly ruled out governing with the AfD, so his main coalition partner could be Scholz’s diminished SPD or, less likely in view of Merz’s commitment to growth, the Greens.', 'If the polls are right, however, whatever Merz comes up with is likely to be a weak coalition. This would give him relatively little leeway to drive reforms of the kind he advocates – familiar themes to UK readers, like benefit cuts, ending business red tape and raising defence spending. He is, though, open to loosening the constitutionally enshrined “debt brake”, which is blocking much-needed public investment. It is likely to take until Easter before we know the full coalition picture.', 'The other, intimately related, question would be about Germany’s borders. Merz triggered huge protests when the AfD backed his bill allowing Germany to turn asylum seekers and other migrants back at the border. This prompted a rare rebuke from Merkel, that Merz had abandoned a historically resonant firewall against far-right support. Yet border controls matter for any state that seeks to ensure the security, including the social welfare, of its citizens, and Germany is not the only country where voters are demanding greater effectiveness.', 'Sunday’s election is a critical European moment, and would be even if Trump did not exist. The key question is not, at least at this stage, about the rise of the extreme right. It is about the continuing viability of the centre right, or the adaptability of what Merkel, from early in her career as party leader, dubbed “the new social capitalism”. The current recession has put this vision to an unforgiving test. Merz will be judged by the outcome, if he wins power. It is a moment that matters for Germany – but also for us.', 'Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist']"

The AfD’s victory in the state in elections last year made it the first far right party to win any sort of election since the Nazi era.', 'Yet the trend of young voters choosing the AfD for their politics is a phenomenon that is a rising across Germany.', 'Polls for the upcoming election on Sunday, and the AfD’s success in regional elections last year, show the party has transformed from regional to national force.', 'If European election results last year - which saw an 18% increase in 16–34-year-olds voting for the AfD - are a barometer, the rise nationally among the same group could form a significant part of the AfD’s likely climb into second place.', 'The AfD in Thuringia is designated an extremist organization by German domestic intelligence and Höcke is its leader.', 'But many of the young people we spoke to didn’t attempt to hide their admiration for Höcke, with some saying they came specifically to listen to him.', 'Dante Reidel, a 26-year-old student, standing next to a stall selling the German far-right magazine “Compact,” said he is also a designated extremist.', 'For Reidel, Höcke is an idol, “it’s also about the personalities… who embody certain values.

In particular the veneration of nationalistic, expansionist and militaristic periods of history.', '“Prussian virtues, things like diligence, discipline. These are things that are important, including the cardinal virtues from antiquity,” he said.', 'At the rally, CNN also met 23-year-old Eric Engelhardt, head of Thuringia’s Young Alternatives, and seemingly another disciple - he spent his evening photographing Höcke.', 'The next day, CNN spent time with Engelhardt in his hometown of picturesque Sonneberg, as he campaigned and posted flyers in people’s letterboxes.', 'The Young Alternatives are also nationally designated as extremists. It is part of the reason that they recently voted to disband and reform more formally under central AfD control. Engelhardt says the designation is a conspiracy against them and that they have no extremists in their ranks.', 'When asked about why so many young people are voting for the AfD, he repeats the now-common AfD refrain.', '“Migration is the mother of all crises. We have a lot of illegal immigrants in this country… who are not behaving. And I think that many of the problems we have today… are also caused by migration, by uncontrolled mass immigration,” Engelhardt says.', 'The same week, a car driven by an Afghan migrant tore through a peaceful protest in central Munich. A 36-year-old woman and a 2-year-old died from their injuries.', 'It marked the third attack in as many months. An Afghan migrant killed two in a Aschaffenburg knife attack in January, and a car-ramming at a Christmas market in Magdeburg killed six last year.', 'The spate of attacks has catapulted the issue of migration to the fore.', 'The AfD’s response has been to call for “remigration”: The mass return of migrants.', 'The term has Nazi connotations. Engelhardt called it a “scientific term” and says the deportation of people is not what they are calling for but rather, they want a tighter migration policy more generally.', 'AfD leader Alice Weidel, however, told CNN in January she would immediately start “sending out all the illegals” should she win the election.', 'Regardless of the designations, connections to extremist individuals and reforming of his political association, Engelhardt remains certain that Germany’s future lies in the hands of the young.', 'He said “something has changed” in young German voters.', '“The fact many young people want to vote for the AfD means that we also have a future.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

It is also an election defeat, [and] I think that needs to be said once clearly, from the start, given a result like this,” Scholz said at the party’s headquarters, as he thanked campaigners and supporters. He said he took responsibility during the previous federal vote, when the SPD achieved a better performance and that “this time the election result is bad and therefore I also have responsibility for this election result.”', 'Scholz also congratulated Merz and the CDU-CSU on their own voting outcome.', 'The CDU and its regional sister party the Christian Social Union were topping the polls in the lead-up to the election, with support dipping slightly just ahead of the vote. The far-right AfD was polling in second place, followed by the SPD.', 'This marked a drop in support for the SPD, which took the top spot during the 2021 election, followed by the CDU/CSU. The AfD clinched fourth place at the time.', 'Germans cast two votes on Sunday, one to directly elect a member of parliament to represent their constituency and one for a party list. The second vote determined the proportional make-up of the German Parliament, the Bundestag, with parties sending their candidates to Berlin to ensure representation.', 'Parties also must meet a 5% threshold to be able to garner seats in parliament. Crucially, the groups that tend to secure around this level of votes often become so-called kingmakers of coalition building after the election.', 'A key focus around the election has been how smaller parties fare, which could impact both coalition building and the ability of the incoming government to reform constitutional rules, for example around spending and debt. They would need a two-thirds majority to do so.', 'Observers were also closely watching the performance of the far-right AfD amid a broader rightward political shift across the Western world.', 'The election comes at a tumultuous time for Germany, both politically and economically.', 'The Sunday vote is only the fourth early election in the country’s history and took place after the former ruling coalition made up of the SPD, the Green party and the Free Democratic Party collapsed late last year, in another rarity for local politics. Deeply rooted long-term disagreements among about economic, fiscal and budget policies had led to the union’s effective break-up.', 'Such policies will also be top of the agenda when it comes to the post-election coalition building process and then governance, especially due to the sluggish German economy, which contracted in both 2023 and 2024. Further concerns lie ahead, including a strong focus on exports, a housebuilding crisis and difficulties in the key auto sector.', 'The new ruling coalition will also need to contend with a fierce domestic debate about migration, the rising popularity of the far right, and broader tensions between Europe and the U.S. as President Donald Trump advances his trade and Ukraine war policies in his second term.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

Eighty Percent of Germans Voted Against the Far Right. Can That Happen Here?,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/afd-loses-german-elections/,"[""A pre-election protest against Germany's far-right AfD party in Dusseldorf.Imago/Zuma"", '', 'The day before the German election, I was sobbing uncontrollably over a video that my German family sent me. It shows a table on a sidewalk, set with pretty porcelain and a sign “Feel like coffee like at Grandma’s?” As passersby sit down, a young man with a guitar carefully pours a cup and offers cream and sugar. Then he sings: “Oma, you’ve been gone a while, but I remember how you’d sit down at our kitchen table and say ‘Never again is now.’” ', 'The viral video, created by a Hamburg singer as part of a day of action against the extreme right, is a little corny. It’s definitely part of the “remembrance culture” that some sneer at. But for, I dare say, anyone who grew up in Germany somewhere between the 1950s and 2000s, it’s a gut punch. The grandmother in the song would have been, give or take, my dad’s generation—someone who was a child during the Nazi era, maybe didn’t talk about it much, but when they did, had this to say: Never, ever, ever again. ', 'Right now, even as we mourn the last of those who remember the Third Reich and the Holocaust, Germany and other countries are electing parties that are, at the very most generous, fascist-adjacent. Twenty percent of Germans voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Sunday’s election, twice as many as did so four years ago. That’s the gut punch part.', 'But tears are not going to get us out of here. So what will? From my perch here in the US—where I arrived decades ago, thinking that having grown up in a country that experienced fascism was never going to be relevant again—here are a couple of thoughts on what we might learn from the German election. ', '1: Multiparty democracy is a mess, but it has one big plus: It creates options for people who are mad at the status quo. The German campaign echoed a lot of Trump v. Harris 2024: Immigration and inflation were the drivers, and underneath that was the discontent with “those in charge” that has been a theme in virtually every recent election in the West. But unlike Americans, Germans who wanted to send a message to a government they didn’t like had options.', '2: One of those options—but only one—was the AfD. Call them the Make Germany Great Again movement, but unlike MAGA they were not able to take over one of the dominant parties. They had to create their own. The AfD is where you’ll find traditional conservatives who’ve been radicalized, people who were always radical but couldn’t say so in polite society, and people who are simply mad as hell. It’s not a Nazi party: That would be illegal in Germany, and politically nonviable too, at least for now. But the AfD absolutely has created a space for fascist-adjacent politics and ideas, from forced “remigration” of immigrants including those with German citizenship, to rehabbing Third Reich slogans and questioning whether SS members were criminals. ', '3: Twenty percent for the AfD is about exactly what the polls predicted; they’d hoped for 25 percent, which would have been seismic. I can’t help thinking of my dad, who used to say that in any country, 20 percent of voters will vote for the nutbags, if nutbags are on offer. The big problem is when they sweep in a bunch of other folks.', '4: But again, those other folks had options. The left-wing party (which has pretty thoroughly repudiated its roots in East Germany’s Communist Party) looks to be landing at close to 9 percent, up from just over 5. The libertarian party was punished for having been part of the unpopular governing coalition, but the new left-populist party BSW—anti-immigration, anti-aid to Ukraine, anti-pronoun, but pro-labor, pro-welfare state, and decidedly anti-Nazi—looks close to making it past the 5-percent threshold that would get it seats in Parliament. Think of BSW as if the Obama-Trump voters had made their own party. It’s a fascinating development and one we might see replicated elsewhere at some point.', '5: More parties means more options for forming a non-fascist government. The “firewall” that Germany’s democratic parties have erected against the far right, pledging never to let them govern, has eroded, but it will hold. For now. ', 'So what’s next? To be sure, being the strongest opposition party is the ideal scenario for the far right: They get to demagogue everything the government does and everything it can be blamed for, such as the soaring energy prices caused by AfD pal Putin and his war in Ukraine. That posture is where the far right is most comfortable (other than complete control). But in a country that is divided not along a single line, but along a spectrum, others, especially the emboldened left party, will compete with the AfD as the voices of protest. ', 'And here’s who else turned out to be less popular than feared: Putin and Elon Musk. Musk, as my colleague Julianne McShane reported, campaigned hard for the AfD, and Putin’s courtship of them may have extended to paying one of their officials. But being the puppet of either an American billionaire or a Russian dictator is not a great look anywhere in Europe.', 'What should we take away from this for US politics? For one, that people vote in protest for lots of different reasons. It’s a mistake to assume (as Trump and Musk seem to believe, and some in the media too) that a MAGA victory means a MAGA country. America’s two-party system does a lot to mask the differences between voters, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there.', 'And just as importantly, small-d democrats were an overwhelming majority in Germany—and they might be here, too. Eighty percent voted for parties that vowed not to make common cause with the far right. That can’t happen in the US in quite the same way because of the far right’s takeover of the GOP. But America’s small-d democratic coalition still exists, and capital-D Democrats might capitalize on that by showing that their tent is big enough. Disagreement is healthy, if you can agree on the most important part—that democracy is about agreeing to disagree. ', 'The next few years will be hard on small-d democrats everywhere. Bad things will continue to happen—maybe another pandemic, almost certainly an economic slowdown, quite possibly more armed conflicts. Demagogues and authoritarians will exploit those things as hard as they can. But 20 percent might be about their ceiling, unless they get extraordinarily lucky or democratic forces cave.', 'So let’s dust ourselves off and get to work. Because never again is now.', '', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently. We stand for justice and democracy. We reject false equivalence. We go after stories others don’t.

Merz warns Europe should seek ‘independence’ from US after conservatives win German election - and far-right support surges,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/23/europe/german-election-results-cdu-afd-intl/index.html,"['', 'Europe must seek to “achieve independence” from the United States, Germany’s likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz said after his opposition conservatives won elections on Sunday, in a vote that also saw surging support for the far-right.', 'Merz, an old-school conservative who has never held a government role previously, is set to lead Europe’s biggest economy and most populous state, after his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party won 28.6% of the vote, according to preliminary official results.', '“Let’s get the party started,” Merz, 69, told supporters as he declared victory at the CDU’s party headquarters in central Berlin, an apparent nod to wanting to get coalition negotiations underway quickly as the region grapples with Trump’s upending of Europe and US relations.', 'The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the second-largest party, with an unprecedented 20.8%, preliminary official results showed, meaning the party – once on the fringes as officially suspected of extremism – is now a major political force. However, it faces exclusion from government by other parties, due to what is known as a “firewall” arrangement.', 'Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) took just 16.4% of the vote following the collapse of its “traffic light coalition” government – a dramatic turnaround in the party’s fortunes since the 2021 election, when it won 25.7%.', 'Merz, 69, now faces an enormous task following Sunday’s snap election that was dominated by concerns over immigration, the economy and the return of US President Donald Trump.', '“My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” he said at a roundtable event later on Sunday.', '“I would never have believed that I would have to say something like that on television. But at the very least, after Donald Trump’s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans - at least this part of the Americans in this administration - are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” he added.', 'Sunday’s preliminary results cap off an eventful election period that drew extraordinary involvement from White House officials and has once again seen debate rage around Germany’s immigration policies.', 'Trump sent shockwaves across Europe after he pushed ahead with peace talks on Ukraine with Russia, excluding both Kyiv and European leaders – prompting European leaders to hold emergency talks to discuss its unified response on the crisis.', 'Merz also referenced Elon Musk’s “intervention in the German election campaign” in recent days. “The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow,” he said at the televised event.', '“We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my top priority is to create unity in Europe.”', 'The CDU’s party headquarters were filled with cheers and applause on Sunday evening as the exit polls were revealed and it became clear that the opposition party was set to become the largest group. Outside the building, a small group of protesters had gathered to demonstrate against what they perceive as party leader Friedrich Merz’s hard line on immigration.', 'The mood at the AfD election party, meanwhile, was ecstatic as it emerged that the party had almost doubled its support, with people cheering and waving Germany flags. Party co-leader Alice Weidel took to the stage to tell cheering crowds that the AfD had “never been stronger.”', 'Germany’s rebuilding after the Nazi era came under the US-led NATO security alliance and its later prosperity was powered by cheap Russian energy and trade with China.', 'What was once certain has unraveled and if Merz – who has pledged to tack right and promised to provide leadership in Europe - does become chancellor he has an enormous task ahead.', 'Two recent deadly attacks, one in Magdeburg before Christmas and another in Munich last week – both carried out by migrants with differing motives – fanned the flames of division in the run up to Sunday’s vote.', 'The AfD, which has been accused of using immigrants has a scapegoat, capitalized on these attacks for its own political gain, and has even called for “remigration” – the mass expulsion of immigrants, regardless of their citizenship status in Germany.', 'Both the CDU and the SPD also ramped up pledges around irregular migration and protecting internal security in the wake of recent attacks, meaning that even if the AfD do not take office they have already shaped the debate.', 'With all votes counted, world leaders began congratulating Merz on his election win.', 'British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a post on X that he looked forward “to working with the new government to deepen our already strong relationship, enhance our joint security and deliver growth for both our countries.”', 'French President Emmanuel Macron said he wanted to work together for a “strong and sovereign Europe.”', '“In this period of uncertainty, we are united to face the great challenges of the world and of our continent,” he posted on X.', 'Nearly 60 million Germans were eligible to vote on Sunday, according to data from the country’s Federal Statistics Office.', 'Under Germany’s system it is difficult for any party to gain enough votes to govern alone and it remains to be seen what form coalition-building talks will take.', 'Some aspects, however, are already clear-cut; other main parties made clear that the AfD will not be part of any negotiations, meaning it is shut out of power for now.', 'It seems likely that Merz will call on Scholz’s Social Democrats – the other major centrist party in Germany – to build a government. Another potential coalition partner is the environmental Greens, which served in Scholz’s coalition government.', 'The “traffic light” coalition brought together an uneasy alliance of three ideologically different parties and its collapse triggered Sunday’s snap vote, a relative rarity in a country which has long had one of the most stable political systems in Europe.', 'Also notable in the exit polls was a successful outcome for the socialist Die Linke party, which won 8.8% – comfortably pushing it over the 5% threshold needed to enter parliament.', 'It remains unclear at this stage whether Merz will need one or two partners to form a majority. Three-way coalition governments in Germany are rare.', 'Overall, it could take weeks of haggling to form a new government, meaning more political paralysis for Berlin at a time of wider uncertainty.', 'CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen, Nadine Schmidt and Benjamin Brown contributed reporting.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.
