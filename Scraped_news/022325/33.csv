I ran with the OnePlus Watch 3 and Apple Watch. The results shocked me,https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-vs-apple-watch-running-comparison-3527070/,"['Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.', '21 hours ago', 'The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been my smartwatch of choice for the last several months. The hardware looks fantastic, watchOS is top-tier software, and I have years of data in the Apple Health and Fitness apps. But I’m always looking for something new, and most recently, my eyes have fallen on the OnePlus Watch 3.', 'I’ve been wearing the OnePlus Watch 3 for the last few days, and compared to the OnePlus Watch 2, I’m impressed. The hardware isn’t drastically different from its predecessor, but there are a few key upgrades — such as longer battery life, new health features, and a rotating crown that interacts with the software.', 'As a fairly avid runner, I was particularly interested in seeing how the OnePlus Watch 3 kept up with activity tracking. I found the OnePlus Watch 2 rather disappointing in this regard, delivering inaccurate activity stats in a barebones health app. To see if the OnePlus Watch 3 really is better, I ran with it and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and compared the results. Let’s just say I’m pretty amazed at how it turned out.', 'I live in Michigan, and in February, that means two things: cold temperatures and lots of snow — neither conducive to outdoor running. So, for this test, I visited the lovely treadmill in my apartment complex’s gym.', 'I wore the OnePlus Watch 3 on my left wrist and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 on my right. I started a 30-minute indoor running workout on both simultaneously and ended each once their respective timers hit the 30-minute mark. I set the treadmill incline to 0.5 for the entire duration and occasionally adjusted my speed between 5, 5.5, and 6 mph.', 'Both smartwatches have all the usual health/fitness features you’d expect. The OnePlus Watch 3 has a new PPG module and LED design, which OnePlus claims allows for better heart rate accuracy. I wasn’t impressed with the OnePlus Watch 2’s heart rate monitoring, and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has always been very accurate in my testing, so the OnePlus Watch 3 had its work cut out for it.', 'How did both watches fare? I’ll dig into my thoughts below, but first, I’ll let you look at the results for yourself:', 'What impressed me the most was how similar the heart rate readings were on both smartwatches. I frequently glanced at each watch during my run, and they were either showing the exact heart rate measurement or were within one to two beats per minute of each other. That’s reflected in the average heart rate in the table above, where the OnePlus Watch 3 recorded 162 bpm and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 recorded 164 bpm.', 'I’ve been continually impressed with the heart rate accuracy of modern Apple Watches, so to see the OnePlus Watch 3 line up so closely is pretty shocking — especially considering this was a weak point of the OnePlus Watch 2. It’s safe to say OnePlus’s new heart rate sensors are doing their job.', 'Despite the similarity in heart rate tracking, the OnePlus Watch 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 show discrepancies in other metrics. The OnePlus Watch 3 recorded 2.58 miles during my 30-minute run, while the Apple Watch Ultra 2 reached 2.92 miles. The treadmill itself counted 2.77 miles — 0.19 miles more than the OnePlus Watch 2 and 0.15 miles less than the Apple Watch Ultra 2.', 'Distance tracking is always tricky for treadmill running, and considering both watches are roughly within the same margin of error compared to the treadmill’s distance, I’m OK with both results. That said, I am excited to compare the watches’ GPS capabilities during an outdoor run once the weather improves.', 'The difference in calories burned is interesting, too, though this likely comes down to differences in OnePlus and Apple’s algorithms rather than a legitimate tracking issue one way or the other. Two smartwatches seldom have identical calorie counting, so this isn’t too surprising.', 'Elsewhere, the OnePlus Watch 3 continues to impress. Its cadence measurement is very similar to that of the Apple Watch, and more importantly,  it recorded a few extra details that the Apple Watch did not.', 'On the watch display during your run and in the OHealth app afterward, the OnePlus Watch 3 recorded significantly more running data than the Apple Watch Ultra 2, such as my stride length and ground contact time (GCT). A dedicated “Running form” section houses this data and rates your GCT and vertical oscillation on a scale from Very Poor to Excellent. You can even see your GCT balance, indicating if you’re biased to your left or right foot during your run.', 'The Apple Watch shows similar data for outdoor runs but not indoor ones. As someone who almost exclusively runs indoors for four to five months out of the year, having this extra data on the OnePlus Watch 3 is fantastic. Not only that, it’s presented much better than on the Apple Watch.', 'Even when the Apple Watch shows my GCT and vertical oscillation after an outdoor run, it tells me nothing meaningful about the numbers. I can see what each one is, but I have no idea if they’re good or bad. The OnePlus Watch 3, meanwhile, very clearly indicates this. I wish it went another step by giving me tips on how to improve, but it’s still significantly better than Apple’s approach.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 also surprised me with its “Advanced assessments” page. Here, you see a breakdown of your total calories burned and how much was burned fat vs. burned sugar. You also get a rating of your aerobic effectiveness of that particular workout, your cardio fitness (aka VO2 max levels), and your needed recovery time after the workout.', 'It’s a really impressive amount of data, a significant improvement over the OnePlus Watch 2, and a better user experience than what you get on the Apple Watch.', 'Does this mean the OnePlus Watch 3 will be my new running watch for 2025? It’s certainly become a very strong contender. The heart rate accuracy is top-notch, the more advanced running stats are presented nicely, and I appreciate extra insights like GCT balance and aerobic effectiveness that I don’t get from my Apple Watch.', 'That said, the Apple Watch still has undeniable benefits for my personal use. As an Apple Music subscriber, it’s far and away the easiest way to access my music while out running. I also like having LTE connectivity (something the OnePlus Watch 3 lacks) and the ability to receive texts from friends/family who are on iMessage.', 'I’ll keep wearing the OnePlus Watch 3 to see how I get along with it. While I may eventually end up back with my Apple Watch, I’m still impressed with its performance in this test. If you’re in the market for a new fitness/running watch this year, the OnePlus Watch 3 should absolutely be on your radar. If this test is any indication, it’s a strong contender for one of the best smartwatches of the year.', '']"

The bezel is now made of titanium, giving it a premium look, while the stainless steel chassis from its predecessor is still around. A notable addition is the rotating crown, which allows users to scroll through menus, addressing a key complaint from Watch 2 users. The watch retains its 47mm size, which might feel bulky for those with smaller wrists, but it’s designed to be rugged with an IP68 rating and MIL-STD-810H certification, ensuring resistance to dust, water, and extreme conditions.', 'Under the hood, the OnePlus Watch 3 is powered by the Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, paired with a new BES2800 coprocessor for handling low-power tasks. This dual-OS setup, combining Wear OS 5 for apps and features with a custom RTOS for basic functions, ensures smooth performance and extended battery life.

I know it quit making Android tablets after the Nexus 9. But we did get the Pixel C and Pixel Slate. After the Pixel Slate, Google announced it would not be making more tablets, instead it would concentrate on laptops. But we eventually got the Pixel Tablet, which launched overpriced with an unnecessary dock. And now that the Pixel Tablet hasn't sold well (surprise, surprise), Google is supposedly canceling the follow-up. Despite many years of making tablets over the last two decades, Google apparently can't find any success with them, and tends to exist the market swiftly when sales tank. At this point, it will be very hard for me to take Google seriously if it ever plans to release a tablet again, be it ChromeOS or Android. But what about you? Are you sick of Google repeatedly giving up on tablets, or are you somehow willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt the next time it decides tablets are t"", ""I know I personally miss having small phones. I'm on team small phone all the way, which is why I loved the Zenfone 10 and why I was sad to see Asus move to something much bigger for the 11. Even before smartphones, I was into the smaller stuff, like what Sony Ericson was putting out for its candy bar designs. But that was a long time ago, and things progress, but sadly it would seem everything progressed to being gigantic with huge screens, and I'm just not feeling it. Perhaps I'm simply being nostalgic, which is why I wanted to bring this question to the masses. Which do you prefer, large or small phones?

Sure, I've used iOS (on iPads), but ever since Android was released, I've only owned and used Android phones, and I don't see this changing anytime soon. Apple just never felt like the hardware for me, and I've certainly dabbled with Macs, but the walled gardens and higher prices for everything just leave a bad taste in my mouth. Android is still more open, and Android is still cheaper for comparable hardware. Most importantly, I'm used to the interface and the actions I can perform within, be it running emulators, sideloading apps, or simply adding icons to my screen wherever I want (yes, I know Apple has started supporting all of these), Android simply feels like the right place to be accomplishing these tasks.

This then afforded Google room to polish Android 15 before it launched, which landed without too many hiccups. Still, over the years, it's likely there are a few people around here who have had issues with their Pixels, and now that news broke there's an issue with the camera bar separating from the back panel, it feels like we're starting this rollercoaster again when I just wish it would end.

Now, OnePlus has announced a third model aptly named the OnePlus Watch 3, and it builds upon the success of its predecessor."", 'The OnePlus Watch 3 has gotten some design changes, a mix of both function and aesthetics. The watch now has a titanium alloy bezel that adds more durability along with the stainless steel case. The bezel, which is also narrower, also features minute markings.', 'Another design change is the tapered digital crown which OnePlus says is to ensure precise and ergonomic control. This makes sense since the crown is no longer just a button but a functional rotating one that can be used to scroll in apps and menus. The display is still protected by sapphire glass, the 22mm straps are made of rubber, and the weight has changed by roughly a gram.', ""The OnePlus Watch 3 now flaunts a bigger and brighter 1.5'' LTPO AMOLED display with a peak brightness of 2200 nits.

OnePlus Watch 3 review: this wonderful wearable just keeps going,https://www.stuff.tv/review/oneplus-watch-3-review/,"['', 'Stuff', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works', 'Home / Reviews / Wearables / Smartwatches / OnePlus Watch 3 review: this wonderful wearable just keeps going', 'Wear OS battery champ also looks the part and is fab for fitness', 'A more refined take on what was already a fantastic Wear OS watch. The OnePlus Watch 3 lasts longer, looks slicker, and is even more fitness-focused.', 'Pros', 'Cons', 'We don’t talk about the original OnePlus Watch very much. At least, not kindly. But instead of slinking back into the smartwatch shadows, the firm’s defiant second attempt met critical acclaim. The styling was striking and the functionality much improved, but it was the seriously impressive battery life that made it stand out from the Wear OS competition. The new OnePlus Watch 3 is looking to capture that magic again, with more of a focus on fitness.', 'It keeps the same two-chip approach as last year, only now they’re paired with the silicon-carbon battery tech found in the OnePlus 13 smartphone for an even longer lifespan. Other highlights include a tougher titanium build, a new suite of health sensors, and a reimagined app to make all that data easier to digest.', 'It’s a flagship wearable in every sense, with a price hike over the previous generation – yet at $330 / £319 / €349 it undercuts the Google Pixel Watch 3 and matches the larger of Samsung’s two Galaxy Watch7 models. Does that make this the best Wear OS watch to date?', 'Every smartwatch and fitness tracker reviewed on Stuff is worn 24/7 throughout the testing process. We use our own years of experience to judge general performance, battery life, display, and health monitoring. Manufacturers have no visibility on reviews before they appear online, and we never accept payment to feature products.', 'Find out more about how we test and rate products.', 'It’s amazing what a difference relatively small design tweaks can make. They might share the same stainless steel case, but the newer OnePlus Watch 3 proudly wears a a titanium outer bezel, complete with minute markers; it makes the outgoing Watch 2 look almost naked in comparison.', 'This is a suave-looking smartwatch, which gets closer to a traditional timepiece than anything in the Apple, Samsung or Google stables. I don’t mind that there’s only one size – 47mm – but it might look out of place on particularly small or skinny wrists. It filled mine far more elegantly than the chunky, squircular Galaxy Watch Ultra, with a weigh that feels substantial.', 'My Emerald Titanium review unit is the flashier of the two colour options, with a polished silver titanium bezel, lighter steel case and green fluororubber strap. The Obsidian Titanium model has a black strap to match its darker bezel and case. Both have quick release lugs and take widely used 22mm straps if you want to mix things up, though there’s nothing remotely low-rent about the included band. The traditional watch buckle makes it easy to get on and off.', 'I’m stoked that OnePlus made the Watch 3’s rotating crown functional. You could spin the crown on the old model until the cows came home, but it wouldn’t have any impact on the interface; now you can scroll through menus and check new notifications without swiping the screen. The flatter button beneath it takes you straight to the various workout modes, and has sensors built into it for health tracking.', 'OnePlus hasn’t skimped on sturdiness, with IP68, 5ATM and MIL-STD-810H ratings. That basically means the Watch 3 can withstand anything you can, from desert or arctic temperatures to 50 meter submersion and high humidity. The firm still recommends you don’t take it seawater swimming or deep diving on the regular – and to give it a thorough clean after each swim – but that’s true of most rival smartwatches too.', 'By swapping to a flexible OLED panel, OnePlus has managed to shrink the Watch 3’s bezels dramatically. It’s rocking a 1.5in face, up from 1.43in on the outgoing model, which I think gives the watch a lot more wrist presence. The screen doesn’t creep right up to the edge of the case like the Galaxy Watch Ultra, but there’s very little in it – and only a few full-screen apps make it obvious.', 'It only sits a hair beneath the titanium outer bezel, so seemingly isn’t as well protected against knocks as some rivals with chunkier cases – but sapphire crystal glass is as scratch-resistant as smartwatches get. In my few weeks of testing, it stayed as unblemished as when I first took it out of the box.', 'The 466×466 resolution ensures the numerous watch faces look crisp and detailed at arms’ length, viewing angles are outstanding, and colours are wonderfully vibrant. The automatic brightness being so quick to kick up the intensity helps give it even more visual impact.', 'With a peak 2200 nits, it shines more than twice as brightly as the OnePlus Watch 2. That puts it behind the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra 2, sure – and you’ll only hit that figure in the dedicated Workout mode, with the watch using a lower setting everywhere else. Still, I was able to read the screen perfectly well while outdoors on the sunniest of days.', 'Always-on display fans will appreciate the LTPO tech, which lets the screen dip as low as 1Hz for maximum battery savings. You’re still looking at a 40% dip in lifespan by enabling it, but it’s a trade-off many are happy to make. It would’ve been nice if OnePlus had also added a night mode like the Apple and Samsung watches have, though.', 'The Watch 3 arrives running a blend of Wear OS 5 and OnePlus’ home-grown RTOS software, which mostly kicks in when the power saving mode is switched on. For the most part you’re using Google’s UI, which is as slick as ever and has all the apps you’d expect, including the Play Store for downloading more.', 'NFC lets you use Google Wallet for on-device contactless payments, Google Maps and Calendar put directions and appointment reminders on your wrist, and Google Assistant can be woken with a tap-and-hold of the digital crown. OnePlus’ additions are mostly fitness-focused, apart from the camera remote shutter and video playback controller. Being able to scroll through YouTube Shorts or your TikTok feed without reaching for your phone is pretty neat.', 'The general interface hasn’t changed all that much between generations. I really like OnePlus’ app drawer, which lets you pinch in to reveal names beneath app in case you can’t find something specific by its icon alone. The various timles and widgets make the most of the top-tier display, and there’s a decent selection of watch faces too. Being able to use video clips as backgrounds is a nice touch.', 'Everything feels slick and responsive, with smooth animations and stutter-free swipes. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5 chipset is once again doing the heavy lifting, and remains about as good as it gets for Wear OS performance.', 'Setup and syncing is through the OHealth smartphone app, which is still Android-only. It has all the usual goodies, like a library of watch faces and tiles to set on the watch, workout history, and an overview of all your health stats. There are more granular insights, too – which is handy, given the Watch 3’s overhauled set of sensors.', 'On top of the usual accelerometer and heart rate sensor (which has been upgraded with a new LED and rear cover glass), the OnePlus Watch 3 has a pulse oximeter and new wrist temperature sensor. There’s enough tech here to track blood oxygen levels, measure your vascular health, and perform an ECG scan – as long as you’re in a country that has granted medical approval.', 'For most of Europe that’ll mean Summer 2025, while the UK will have to wait until the Autumn. I was given access to a beta version for this review. After resting a finger on the lower button, an ECG reading takes about 30 seconds and can highlight early signs of heart arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation. While it didn’t flag anything I’d want to book a doctor’s appointment for, it’s a reassuring feature that brings OnePlus up to par with flagship smartwatch rivals.', 'The 60 second health check-in goes further, collecting heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature and vascular age in one go. It also rolls in your most recent sleep data, which includes body movement, snoring patterns, breathing rate and heart rate variability. It’ll land in March as an over-the-air update, and massively simplifies monitoring all those health metrics.', 'It sounds good on paper, but the OnePlus Watch 2 didn’t have the greatest reputation for tracking accuracy. Based on my testing, and compared to a range of rivals, the Watch 3 is an all-round better performer. Step count and heart rate were consistent, and while it didn’t always detect I’d woken up in the night, it could tell the difference between a sofa session in front of Netflix and a mid-afternoon nap.', 'The new Broadcom dual-frequency GPS chip was quick to get a signal lock, and coped well with a mix of sports and activities. The Watch 3 can track more than 100, and will automatically detect running, walking, swimming, cycling, rowing and elliptical machine workouts. Some are a lot more comprehensive than others: when running it can track things like cadence, stride length and ground contact time, while the swimming mode records your 100-meter pace, number of strokes and number of laps, as well as distance covered. These are the sorts of metric you’d expect from a serious sports watch, so it’s great to have them in an all-rounder like this.', 'I’d still give the edge to a top-tier Garmin for fine-grain tracking, so pro athletes aren’t likely to be swayed, but the figures were otherwise very faithful to how much work I was putting in. It was pinpoint accurate on a walk through central London, too, which bodes well for GPS tracking in other built-up areas.', 'The outgoing OnePlus Watch 2 basically flipped the script on Wear OS battery life. That second, low-power CPU helped it best all comers, including the Mobvoi TicWatch 5 Pro and its clever two-layer display. For 2025, the firm has borrowed silicon-carbon cell technology from its smartphone division, boosting capacity by almost 30% to a generous 631mAh.', 'Add in the more efficient BES 2800 chip for behind-the-scenes tasks, and you’re looking at the new Wear OS longevity champ. For regular use, with a mix of exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, Bluetooth calling, incoming message alerts and onscreen swiping, I comfortably made it into a fifth day of wear before I needed to plug in.', 'Admittedly that was with the always-on display mode disabled – but even when I turned it on, I was still lasting three days per charge. That’s a day longer than I managed from a Galaxy Watch Ultra with its always-on screen in action, and puts Google’s Pixel Watch 3 firmly in the shade.', 'Power Saver mode takes things up another notch, promising a colossal 16 days – up from twelve on the last-gen model – by stripping functionality back to notifications and health tracking, via RTOS. At the time of writing I’d not actually had the watch long enough to test that longevity claim, so will have to report back later.', 'The charging cradle can fully refuel the watch in about an hour, or add enough juice for another day of wear in about ten minutes.', 'If the Watch 2 was OnePlus hitting its stride, then Watch 3 must be a victory lap. This is a simply superb wearable, with the best battery life of any Wear OS watch I’ve tried. The larger screen is a treat for the eyes, the styling is subtly yet meaningfully improved, and the functional crown has been a long time coming.', 'Health tracking has generally taken a big step forward, although when some of the more exciting features actually land will vary depending on where you live. Some might bemoan the lack of size options or LTE connectivity, but those will be minor quibbles for most.', 'With price also largely on its side, this should be top of any Android smartwatch shopper’s list.', 'Score: 5/5', 'A more refined take on what was already a fantastic Wear OS watch. The OnePlus Watch 3 lasts longer, looks slicker, and is even more fitness-focused.', 'Pros', 'Outstanding battery life for a Wear OS watch', 'Slick styling inspired by traditional timepieces', 'More health tracking tech, with greater accuracy', 'Cons', 'Some health features country-dependent', 'Still just one size option and no LTE model', ""A tech addict from about the age of three (seriously, he's got the VHS tapes to prove it), Tom's been writing about gadgets, games and everything in between for the past decade, with a slight diversion into the world of automotive in between.

Review: OnePlus Watch 3,https://www.wired.com/review/oneplus-watch-3/,"['', '9/10', ""A DEAD SMARTWATCH is useless—a black screen, staring blankly back after you raise your wrist to check the time for the umpteenth time. Battery life remains the number one problem with these wearables. Apple has made the same 18-hour battery life claim on the Apple Watch since the original, and although it can extend past that these days, you're still not going to get a two- or three-day battery life without limiting some functions severely."", ""Lo and behold, OnePlus has delivered what the top dogs haven't with its new OnePlus Watch 3: a thumping five-day battery life. While it's slightly bigger than its predecessor, this smartwatch doesn't rely on size alone to stretch run time, but on new battery technology. I have charged it once in the week I've been testing it—at the end of the fifth day—without having to turn off any features."", ""Yes, fitness trackers and some watches from brands like Garmin can last several weeks, but none of those have access to the wealth of apps and smart functions as an Apple Watch or Wear OS watch. That's what makes this $330 OnePlus smartwatch exciting."", ""The impact of a five-day battery life is huge. Too often have I gotten into bed and looked at my watch, only to realize it's going to die in the middle of my slumber, so I begrudgingly trudge to the charger on my desk and leave it there. Too often have I gone a day or two with a dead watch on my wrist because I kept forgetting to put it back on the charger. There has been none of this with the OnePlus Watch 3."", ""This is possible thanks to the new silicon-carbon battery technology inside the watch—OnePlus first used it in the OnePlus 13 phone, but companies like Honor have been employing it for some time. These batteries are denser, allowing them to carry a higher capacity without requiring a thicker battery. That's why the OnePlus 13 can fit a big 6,000-mAh cell despite being thinner than the OnePlus 12, which has a 5,400-mAh cell. OnePlus calls this its Silicon NanoStack Battery, and so the OnePlus Watch 3 has a 631-mAh battery compared to its predecessor's 500-mAh cell."", ""That's not all, OnePlus continues the dual-engine architecture that it debuted last year. The OnePlus Watch 3 has two operating systems and two chipsets. The Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 chip powers Google's Wear OS 5, which handles all the graphics-intensive tasks, whereas an upgraded BES2800 chip runs the Real-Time Operating System, which manages many of the background tasks."", 'Splitting this workload, in conjunction with the beefier battery, nets you five days of juice. Mind you, this is with the default mode. If you turn on power-saving mode, OnePlus claims 16 days of battery life. For context, Apple claims its Low Power Mode can make the Apple Watch Series 10 last 72 hours.', 'OnePlus Watch 3', 'RATING: 9/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED', ""Almost like clockwork, I lost roughly 25 percent power per day until I was left with 10 percent by 8 pm on the fifth day. That includes roughly one auto-tracked activity per day. The caveat? This five-day battery life isn't possible if you turn on features such as continuous heart-rate monitoring, SpO2 tracking, and the “assess breathing problems” function during sleep. The always-on display was also turned off. None are enabled by default, but if you toggle them on, you can probably cut a day or two from the longevity, though I haven't tried it with the full gamut to say for sure."", ""When the watch finally did need to be charged, I popped it on the magnetic proprietary charger and it juiced back up quickly. I love that the charging cradle has a USB-C port, so you can just bring the tiny dock around and use the same cable you'd use to charge your phone or laptop."", ""The Watch 3 has a slightly sportier look this go around. It's a smidge bigger with a 1.5-inch AMOLED display, but I find it quite comfortable to wear—even to bed. OnePlus says it has improved the strap design to sit closer to the wrist for comfort and better accuracy with the sensors. The size may inevitably be too large for some folks, so I'd love to see OnePlus introduce a smaller option in the future à la Google's Pixel Watch. It'd cut the battery life, but I'm sure smaller wrists would still appreciate two or three days on a single charge."", ""There's one programmable button on the bottom right edge, and above it is the digital crown, which also doubles as a configurable button. Last year, you couldn't scroll the interface by rotating the crown, but that's now remedied, and there's some nice haptic feedback as you scroll through. I truly don't have any qualms about the hardware—it's IP68-rated and can handle being submersed to about 50 meters (in freshwater). A sapphire crystal protects the bright screen with a new titanium bezel, along with the same stainless steel case. The 22-millimeter strap is easy to swap."", 'OnePlus Watch 3', 'RATING: 9/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.

And all the usual functions work well. I've taken calls on the watch, checked notifications, scrolled through my upcoming calendar events, responded to Slack messages, and followed along with navigation while walking."", ""The biggest improvements, however, are in health and fitness. One of my complaints in my OnePlus Watch 2 review was that the device was “missing health features,” and there were some accuracy issues. It seems as though OnePlus took that to heart. In comparison with the Pixel Watch 3, my heart-rate data was very similar, though I found the OnePlus took longer to show my data than Google's watch. New features also include an electrocardiogram (ECG), wrist skin temperature sensing, irregular heart-rate notifications, and fall detection."", ""Unfortunately, bad news for US and Canadian customers: OnePlus says it did not “receive official certification” from the US Food and Drug Administration for the ECG, so that function will not be available in these regions. The company did not explain why the ECG wasn't cleared in the US, but globally it's a different story."", ""Sleep tracking is more accurate now, even picking up the occasional moments when I fall asleep on the couch. I've noticed richer data analysis in the OnePlus OHealth app. It extrapolated, for example, that my awake time was somewhat long one night, and that could be impacted by my sleep environment."", ""I didn't get much out of the wrist temperature, though this may help women predict periods as my colleague has found using other smart wearables with skin-temperature sensors. I did give the new Vascular Health app a try—it measures arterial stiffness and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease. Thankfully, my result was “Normal.” You can also get “Low Risk” and “High Risk.” It's hard to measure the accuracy of this, though I can say for sure that my physician has yet to mention any cardiovascular issues when I visit. Of course, OnePlus is quick to mention that these results are not intended for use in diagnosis or treatment."", 'OnePlus Watch 3', 'RATING: 9/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

OnePlus set an interesting standard with Watch 3 and Wear OS 5,https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3,"[""We now know what's different about the OnePlus Watch 3's version of Wear OS, when the OnePlus Watch 2 gets Wear OS 5, and how many updates to expect."", 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'Every Wear OS brand besides Samsung and Google has had such a fraught, confusing history with updates that we had no idea what to expect from OnePlus. Would the OnePlus Watch 3 launch with Wear OS 5, or an older version like some TicWatches? And how quickly would the two promised version updates arrive on the OnePlus Watch 2?', '', 'My weekly column focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight.', 'Thanks to the OnePlus Watch 3 and clarification from the OnePlus PR team, we have our answers. And I think it\'s set a precedent for what to expect from any Wear OS watch that doesn\'t have ""Galaxy"" or ""Pixel"" in the name.', ""My colleague Nick Sutrich got hands-on time with the OnePlus Watch 3 this past week, and he's highly positive about it so far. It's a major hardware upgrade over the OnePlus Watch 2 thanks to the active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity."", ""OnePlus promises a five-day battery life, and Nick's Watch 3 has surpassed this estimate so far. Some credit must go to the silicon-carbon battery, but we can also consider its switch to Wear OS 5: Google added some battery-saving background changes last year that'll pay off in subtle ways for OnePlus Watch 3 buyers."", ""We're still diving into the OnePlus Watch 3's software to try and flesh out what's new and different. But when we asked OnePlus, their answer was very illuminating:"", ""Gmail supporting email sync, reply functionality, and folder management; Google Wallet supporting boarding passes, concert tickets, and membership cards; and Google Maps syncing and navigating more seamlessly. Google's website should also have a run-down of the upgrades between Wear OS 4 and 5 if you are interested in additional specifics."", 'Google app minutiae aside, that last portion is illuminating because OnePlus\'s rep was essentially saying to go to the ""Explore Wear OS 5 features"" page on Android Developers. Unlike Samsung\'s unique version of One UI 6 Watch or Mobvoi\'s specific update list for Wear OS 4, OnePlus largely put its software update in Google\'s hands.', ""This isn't to say that the OnePlus Watch 3 software is a Pixel Watch 3 clone. OnePlus has its UI quirks, video watch faces, and health features specific to the OHealth app, such as the 60-second health checkup tool."", 'Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android', '', 'I did note one unique feature: You can prop up your OnePlus 13 and then swipe through TikTok or YouTube Shorts videos using your watch display. I have no idea how many people would want to navigate their feeds with their phones propped up, but at least OnePlus tried something new!', 'But by and large, OnePlus is offering a ""stock"" Wear OS experience, and some of its ""new"" Wear OS 5 features are things that were missing from its version of Wear OS 4, like emergency SOS, camera controls, and the ability to transfer your watch to a new phone.', 'I\'m perfectly fine with OnePlus focusing on hardware and health upgrades with the Watch 3. It seems to have paid off, and compared to other Wear OS watches that work best within their ecosystem, I think you can wear this with just about any Android phone brand without missing any features because of the ""stock"" Wear OS approach.', '', ""Now for the downsides: OnePlus says the Watch 3 will receive two OS updates — like the OnePlus Watch 2 — and two years of bi-monthly security updates through early 2027. OnePlus committed to three years of security updates for the Watch 2, so we're not sure why OnePlus has apparently decided to cut back one year of support."", 'As for the OnePlus Watch 2, the OnePlus rep said that ""Watch 2 users are expected to receive their OS 5 updates in Q3 of this year."" That July–September stretch is when we\'d expect the Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch 4 to launch with Wear OS 6, meaning OnePlus will be a year behind them.', ""Up until this point, Wear OS brands like Xiaomi and Mobvoi have fallen a year behind Google and Samsung, only launching Wear OS 4 around Q3 2024. OnePlus obviously has a leg up by launching Wear OS 5 only half a year behind Samsung, but I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 2 — which has the same Snapdragon processor — would need another half a year or so."", 'At this point, I can only assume the year-long update gap between the Wear OS co-creators and third-party partners will never close. Samsung and Google had some trouble updating their watches to Wear OS 5, but nothing like what their partners have experienced.', ""General Wear OS trends aside, I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 3 will (presumably) stop receiving security updates well before it gets Wear OS 7 in late 2027. That seems a bit odd, and I'd like to think OnePlus will still provide some sporadic security support afterward, not just drop major changes and then ignore the Watch 3 entirely."", ""As it is, with Samsung and Google promising four and three years of support, respectively, OnePlus's two-year promise feels like the one potential blemish to an otherwise exciting OnePlus Watch 3 launch."", '', '', 'Long-lived where it counts', ""Wear OS updates aside, the OnePlus Watch 3 is an incredibly strong option out of the box thanks to its five-day battery life and blazingly fast charging speed, not to mention a bright, smooth 1.5-inch AMOLED display and a stylish titanium bezel. As long as you don't mind that it's on the large side, there's plenty to love with this Android smartwatch."", ""Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

Channeling his love of running, he established himself as an expert on fitness watches, testing and reviewing models from Garmin, Fitbit, Samsung, Apple, COROS, Polar, Amazfit, Suunto, and more."", ""OnePlus is 'working on' fixing two key Watch 3 downsides this year"", ""Reminder: Android watches don't need sideloading gimmicks for gaming"", 'The OPPO Find N5 gets me excited for what could come next', 'Android Central is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

OnePlus Watch 3,https://www.techspot.com/products/wearables/oneplus-watch-3.304435/,"[""OnePlus has bumped the specs of its smartwatch across the board to make an already impressive wearable one of the greatest. It doesn't mind what phone you use (as long as it's not from Apple), or if you need to spend days away from a charger while still tracking dozens of health metrics — the OnePlus Watch 3 can handle it. As long as you can handle missing out a few features found on Apple, Pixel and Galaxy Watches, and the large, single size option."", ""It's too bad that OnePlus is only committing to two years of software updates. Samsung and Apple support their smartwatches for longer, and this would pair well with the OnePlus battery longevity story. Still, this is a sacrifice I'm willing to let slide because, guess what? I don't have to charge my damn watch every day."", 'The OnePlus Watch 3 not only fixes the few complaints we had about last year’s Watch 2, but adds a swathe of new features and functionality, including a more durable design, improved tracking, multiband GPS and a boosted 120-hour battery life that perfects the Wear OS 5 experience on offer.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the very best smartwatches on the market, and the new WearOS battery life champion.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 catches up to Wear OS competitors with features like AI-powered health assessments and fall detection while offering class-leading battery life.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 is a solid upgrade, offering outstanding battery life and smooth software. Yet, it fails to address the key shortcomings of its predecessor. The design remains bulky, LTE is absent, and health tracking—while much improved—is still largely behind Samsung and Google. At this price, it’s hard to justify over the Pixel Watch 3 or Galaxy Watch 7, which both offer better features for the same or lower cost. If battery life is your top priority, the Watch 3 is worth considering—otherwise, better options exist.', 'A more refined take on what was already a fantastic WearOS watch.

I love everything about the OnePlus Watch 3 despite its one major flaw,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/2017752/oneplus-watch-3-review,"['', 'If you want a WearOS smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3 is a top choice thanks to its industry-best battery life, great performance and feature compatibility with all modern Android phones.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 is available directly from OnePlus with an RRP of £319.', ""It works excellently with any modern Android phone, so you don't need a OnePlus phone to take advantage of its features."", 'Although there are many different options when it comes to upgrading your Android phone, there are far fewer top choices of Android smartwatch. For the past few years, the Google Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch range have been the go-to wearables for those who don’t have an iPhone, but I’m happy to find that the new OnePlus Watch 3 could be the very best of the Android bunch.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts five day battery life, an unheard of figure in a world where you have to charge most other smartwatches every day. In testing, I found the OnePlus Watch 3 can achieve this feat if you leave all the default settings alone. This doesn’t take away any key functionality, and you don’t have to use any power saving modes to get this battery life, though the longevity drops once you enable some other features such as blood oxygen monitoring or the always-on display.', 'Although I prefer the design of the minimalist Pixel Watch 3, the OnePlus Watch 3 looks great on the wrist thanks to its classic look with a new titanium bezel with minute markers that adds a bit of class compared to the OnePlus Watch 2. The crown on that watch rotated but didn’t do anything, a major bummer that OnePlus has fixed this time - the crown scrolls menus like it does on the Pixel Watch and Apple Watch with delightful haptic feedback.', 'It’s a shame OnePlus only offers one size, though. The 47mm stainless steel casing is large and although I don’t mind it on my big wrists, both Google and Samsung offer their smartwatches in two sizes. A smaller option would be nice, as would the option to buy a cellular model for eSIM connectivity. The OnePlus Watch 3 is a flat £319 in either Emerald Titanium (silver with green strap) or Obsidian Titanium (black with black strap) and Bluetooth connectivity only, so you always need to be connected to your smartphone to receive notifications or use data services for calls, texts and apps.', '', 'The circular 1.5-inchAMOLED screen is protected with sapphire crystal glass for scratch resistance and there’s an IP68 dust and water resistance so you can go swimming with it on or dive to 50 metres. The 22mm strap is also easy to remove, and OnePlus sells spares and other options.', 'The real cleverness on the Watch 3 is in OnePlus’s use of two processors. You get both the Snapdragon W5 for running Google’s WearOS 5 as well as a BES2800 that runs what is known as a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). This means the former chip is used when you are using apps or doing intensive tasks such as a GPS tracked run, but then the latter chip ticks away handling background tasks. This is a very efficient set up that allows for the five day battery life, with a 631mAh battery inside using Silicon NanoStack tech that’s also more efficient than traditional lithium-ion cells.', 'I found the watch lasted five days long on all the default settings. If you want to use the always-on display, for example, a pop up warns you this will knock two days off the battery life. That still makes this a three day watch, but other warnings surface if you turn on snore or breathing detection for sleep tracking and other advanced health features.', ""There’s also a power saver mode that OnePlus says kills all but the workout and health functions to eke out up to 16 days of battery life. This is a sensible option to provide and is great if you forget your charger or want to go on a long run and are low on juice. Topping up takes 80 minutes from empty depending on your charger, with official OnePlus chargers working fastest (there's no charger in the box). I love the tiny charging puck with a USB-C port that you can carry around easily and snap onto the back of the watch to charge with any USB-C charger."", 'The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts five day battery life, an unheard of figure in a world where you have to charge most other smartwatches every day.', 'The electrocardiogram (ECG) functionality is also sure to dent battery life, but I couldn’t test this as it’s not live in the UK yet. OnePlus told me the ECG, which tracks heart health, will be switched on “from Q3 2025”, so you might want to wait to see if that happens. US buyers will never get it, according to OnePlus. All models get NFC for mobile payments via the Google Wallet app.', 'The WearOS software is zippy, but looks nothing like the Google-ified look of the Pixel Watch 3. OnePlus’s skin is not ugly, but it is a little more colourful and, to a degree, toy-like, but it has more personality than some wearables. The plethora of watch faces with many customisable complications is also great to see.', 'Swiping left or right from the home screen shows you different tiles for things like weather, sleep tracking, activity, heart rate and wellness. The latter is a vague summary of how you are doing throughout the day. “Learn to unwind. Stress is only temporary”, one notification told me on a particularly stressful day. To be fair, the watch could somehow tell I was a little tense, but the wellness tracking in general is a little vague.', '', 'Because the watch uses WearOS you can download several third party apps including Spotify, Strava, All Trails and Nike Run Club. Many are fitness related. They work well, and you can download Spotify albums and playlists for offline listening if you want to go on a run without your phone by pairing Bluetooth headphones directly to the watch.', 'I found doing this while tracking an outdoor run via GPS worked well, and the route tracking was pleasingly accurate, along with the heart rate data. You have to install OnePlus’s OHealth to pair the watch to your phone and view fitness data as well as do things such as change watch face or tweak notifications. I easily linked the app to Strava so my runs uploaded automatically, but you can actually do most other things on the watch itself and leave the app alone.', 'I tested the watch with the OnePlus 13 and Samsung Galaxy S25 and was pleased to find I didn’t lose any major functionality on a non-OnePlus phone. Samsung restricts some features on its Galaxy Watch models to only work with Galaxy phones, something I applaud OnePlus for avoiding, making the Watch 3 a great choice for Android owners across the board.', 'The big downside to the OnePlus Watch 3 is that it’s only guaranteed two years of software updates and two years of security patches. Phones are generally better updated, with at least five to seven years now for most major Android devices, while watches generally aren’t promised as long, but two years is particularly stingy. Samsung says it will update the latest Galaxy Watch 7 for at least four years, while the Pixel Watch 3 is getting three.', 'The big downside to the OnePlus Watch 3 is that it’s only guaranteed two years of software updates and two years of security patches.', 'All three firms could do better, but it means the OnePlus Watch 3 will be stuck with whatever software it gets in 2027, which is at odds with its excellent battery life that will decline over time but likely make it actually usable day to day for longer than its rivals. You’ll have to be OK with a watch that will end up not being updated, even if it’s still ticking for several days between charges in a couple of years.', 'Overall, the OnePlus Watch 3 excels on all fronts, making it a formidable rival to the Google and Samsung equivalents. It has the best battery life of any Android smartwatch, full WearOS app support, good looks, and smooth performance that will please most buyers. The fact its features work across all Android phones is a boon, too.', 'It’s just a shame it only comes in one large size and will only get software updates for two years. But if these things don’t bother you, the OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the best smartwatches going.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 is available to buy now from OnePlus.', 'SEARCH', 'CONNECT WITH US', ""TODAY'S PAPER"", ""See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive."", 'EXPRESS.CO.UK', 'Would you like to receive news notifications from Daily Express?', '', 'At Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

Users, like myself, have been very happy with the Watch 2 but did provide feedback to OnePlus, and the company clearly listened as the newest OnePlus Watch 3 improves in some key areas. There are still reasons to consider other Google Wear OS watches, but battery life shouldn't be one of them."", 'Also: The best Android smartwatches you can buy', 'That\'s because OnePlus advertises up to five days of battery life in typical ""smart"" mode, and I can confirm that is accurate. A five-day battery life for a smartwatch is unheard of when the Apple Watch, Google Pixel Watch, and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra are still trailing in the two-day range. The OnePlus Watch 3 now competes with GPS sports watches that have AMOLED displays, so if battery life is your primary factor for a smartwatch, then you can\'t go wrong with a OnePlus Watch 3.', 'If you want a smartwatch with a battery life of nearly a week, the OnePlus Watch 3 is for you.

The crown also rotates in the app launcher to provide a slick experience where the watch face zooms in and out of the apps to help you read the app label or zoom out to see everything you have installed.', 'Another criticism of the Watch 2 was the lack of compelling watch faces. That is no longer the case with some fantastic options from OnePlus, including one of my favorites, Metric Matrix, which provides eight functional complications and a host of color options. One of the coolest options available on the Watch 3 is the Moments in Motion watch face, which plays a video when you tap on it and can even loop the video, although that will significantly decrease the battery life.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and the Watch 2 (right).', 'Select a video or GIF, and then the editing tool in the OHealth app will help you customize the video watch face. I have one with the Hover drone circling me as I test an e-bike, and it is slick.

', 'Well, I had the exclusive chance to discuss all things OnePlus Watch 3 with Dr Leo Zhang, Head of Research & Development at the OnePlus Health Lab, whose team has been leading many of the wearables’ innovations – and the answer is surprisingly simple.', '', '', '', 'You see, it relies mainly on the OnePlus Watch 3’s combination of a CPU and an MPU (microprocessor unit) and how OnePlus utilises the two sensors for different purposes.', '“Below the CPU, we have a very powerful MCU” Zhang explained. “As far as fitness [and] health tracking sensors, those are all on the MCU level” while the CPU focuses solely on running the OS itself. ', 'The competition, including high-end alternatives like the Galaxy Watch Ultra, runs both the OS and sensors on the CPU. “So this means every time the sensor is collecting data, it’s processing everything on the CPU” which has a knock-on effect on battery life. ', 'Zhang explained that it’s much like the design of a hybrid car, with a large petrol motor for longer trips and a battery for shorter trips, providing better overall efficiency.  ', 'It helps that users don’t always hammer the CPU with OnePlus’s configuration. “Usually when people wear these [watches], they’re not playing games”. Instead, “most of the time it’s the sensors working in the background” with the occasional trigger of the screen to run apps, check notifications or listen to music. ', 'Importantly, Zhang explained, “those are very short [instances]” that effectively allow the low-powered MCU to bear most of the daily grunt.', 'Of course, it’s not just the optimised chipset design that aids in this endeavour. The OnePlus Watch 3 also sports an LTPO-enabled display that lets it drop down to 1Hz when not in active use, ideal for the AOD mode, and there’s a bigger battery, up from 500mAh to 631mAh.

The OnePlus Watch 3 is available for pre-order. Continuing the momentum it established from the OnePlus Watch 2, this iteration aims to take on the latest Apple Watches, Pixel Watches, and Galaxy Watches. However, if you’re in the U.S., you’ll be missing out on the useful ECG feature coming with the OnePlus Watch 3.', 'The OnePlus Watch 2 made waves when it launched last year because of its design, battery life, and Wear OS integration among other things. This time around, it looks like OnePlus didn’t want to rock the boat. It comes with a design similar to last year’s watch with the side protrusion that houses the main button. The main difference is the metallic bezel with five-minute intervals marked. This gives the watch a more traditional look.', 'OnePlus prioritizes the battery performance of its smartwatches, as it can deliver up to five days of normal usage. This is with all of the smartwatch features available. This is thanks to a dual-operating system that lives within the watch. The smart functions are handled by Wear OS.', 'However, when the watch is idle or when it’s not using the smart features, it jumps over to a much more power-efficient operating system dedicated to fitness tracker functions. Switching to the other operating system exclusively can get this watch through 16 days on a single charge. Your mileage will vary, of course.', 'If you’re interested in picking up the OnePlus Watch 3, you can pre-order it today. It costs $329, which undercuts much of the competition in the premium smartwatch space.', 'One of the more notable features to come with their watch is the addition of an ECG (Electrocardiogram) measurement tool. It’s a tool that measures the electrical activity of your heart. The OnePlus Watch 3 has a feature called 60-Second Health Check-In. To activate that feature, you’ll place your finger on the designated spot for a minute. The watch will then do a quick check-in to give you a general picture of your health.', 'The thing is that the feature requires the ECG to function. As such, if you can’t access the ECG, you won’t be able to use the 60-Second Health Check-In.

The OnePlus Watch 3 finally adds a proper rotating crown,https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/612965/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on-smartwatch-wearables,"['', 'Plus five-day battery life, Wear OS 5, a new GPS antenna, and a host of new health features.', 'by Victoria Song', 'If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.', 'I’ve had the $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3 for a few days, and so far, this isn’t an Android watch that flips the script. Instead, it’s a story about refinement (and playing a bit of catch-up), rather than pushing boundaries. And you know what? If it means a strong Google / Samsung alternative with a rotating crown that finally scrolls, I’m totally fine with that.', 'On the design front, the Watch 3 is quite similar to the OnePlus Watch 2, with a few key changes. The OLED display is a smidge larger and brighter at 2,200 nits, and the bezels are notably smaller, though that’s partially because of a slight design tweak. The screen is spiffy to look at, especially with the new video watchface where you can upload your own clips. (I, of course, have uploaded one of my cat asking for belly rubs.) The casing is still stainless steel, but there’s a new titanium physical bezel, too. It gives it a more classic analog look, but otherwise, this isn’t a dramatic change. My big design gripe is that the Watch 3 still only comes in a single 47mm size. It’s not horrible, but I have smaller wrists, and the lug gaps are notable. Offering just one size excludes folks with smaller wrists from comfortably using the Watch 3, and that feels like a missed opportunity.', 'I’ll forgive OnePlus this oversight now that there’s a proper rotating crown. This time, you can actually use it to scroll through screens — a baffling omission from the last watch. There are delightful haptics that go along with it, and while this isn’t a groundbreaking addition, it soothes my inner curmudgeon that OnePlus has seen the errors of its ways and now upholds the nerdy wearable covenant that a rotating crown must also scroll.', 'Battery life has also been improved from 100 hours to 120 hours — or five days with regular use and the always-on display turned off. Turning on the AOD shortens that to roughly three days. That’s fairly typical for all flagship smartwatches these days. In a power-saving mode, you can get up to 16 days. OnePlus says it’s managed to stuff a larger 631mAh battery in the Watch 3 using the same silicon nanostack battery as the OnePlus 13. Since it runs Wear OS 5, that should add some extra battery mileage. I haven’t been testing the watch long enough to definitively comment on battery life just yet, but I always appreciate faster charging. You can get a full day’s worth in about 10 minutes.', 'OnePlus says it changed the sensor layout and made tweaks to the materials to improve tracking accuracy. Speaking of sensors, the Watch 3 adds one for wrist temperature, an eight-channel optical heart rate sensor, and a 16-channel blood oxygen sensor. It’s also revamped the GPS with a “circular polarized antenna,” which it claims will help improve GPS maps in areas with tall buildings. I’m getting over a cold, so I haven’t had the chance to test this on a run yet, but I’ll see whether it makes a dramatic difference. Technically, the Watch 3 can also take EKGs, but that functionality won’t be available for users in the US or Canada. In a briefing, OnePlus spokesperson Spenser Blank said that’s because OnePlus hasn’t received FDA clearance but that, for “business reasons,” the company doesn’t plan on pursuing FDA clearance.', 'That’s disappointing given some of the new health features. The big one is OnePlus’ 60S Health Check-In, where you touch the side button and get a quick scan of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age. European users will get EKGs included in Q2 2025. Also new is a vascular health test, which measures your arterial stiffness. It’s similar to a feature Oura introduced last year, and it’s meant to gauge your circulatory system’s overall state. (Mine is “normal.”)', 'With the Watch 3, OnePlus is refocusing a bit on sleep tracking and wellness. The company says sleep tracking has been overhauled, and you’ll now be able to use the watch to track snoring patterns to assess your breathing disruptions. Stress tracking has also been rebranded as “360 Mind and Body,” and it uses heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and activity intensity to approximate how you’re doing… with emoji. Depending on how it evaluates your stress, you might get recommendations for guided breathing. I’ve been running a beta version of the OHealth app with these updates, and so far, I have received more insights into sleep tracking — though I’m not entirely sold on the emoji. So far, all I’ve been is roasted for my “moderate” wellness.', 'A lot of these updates are things other competitors already have. They just have a OnePlus twist to them, and it’ll take me some more time to really put subtler software tweaks through the testing gauntlet. So far, though, wearing the Watch 3 is a pleasant reminder of how OnePlus has surprisingly emerged as a competitive alternative to Samsung and Google. But one change I know I don’t love is the Watch 3 is $30 more expensive than its predecessor — though Blank told me that the price increase has nothing to do with tariffs.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 is available for preorder starting today and will begin shipping on February 25th.', '', '', 'A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

OnePlus makes the best Android phone and watch combo you can get right now,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/oneplus-makes-best-android-phone-170025965.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Something unexpected has happened. There’s a fantastic smartphone and smartwatch combination available to buy right now that I think you’d be mad to pass by, and it’s not an Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max and Apple Watch Series 10. It’s not a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and a Galaxy Watch 7 either. It’s the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus Watch 3, and I think it’s the best Android phone and watch pairing I’ve come across in ages.', 'I should explain why this was unexpected, at least to me. The OnePlus Watch 3 is the first OnePlus smartwatch I’ve used, and what I’d heard about previous models from colleagues didn’t really make me feel as if I was missing out. From poor quality health tracking results to a crown that rotated by didn’t actually do anything, I was always confident in recommending Samsung’s trusty Galaxy Watch or a Mobvoi TicWatch as the smartwatch to get if you owned an Android phone.', 'I went into the OnePlus Watch 3 not really expecting anything more than averageness, and to look forward to wearing one of my favorite watches again once the review was finished. I was surprised, almost shocked by what happened once I started using it. The OnePlus Watch 3 is brilliant, and I gave it both a 9/10 score in my glowing review, and slapped an Editor’s Choice award on it for good measure.', 'You can get all the details about why I loved it by reading the full review, but in summary it’s really good-looking, comfortable enough to wear all day and all night for sleep tracking, the performance is probably the best on any recent smartwatch I’ve used, and the battery lasted for more than four days on a single charge, even with all the functions other brands prefer you to switch off to save battery activated.', 'I scratched around to find problems with it, and those that made it on the Cons list are fairly inconsequential. It was as I finished the review I realized I’d done exactly the same with the last OnePlus product I’d used, the fantastic OnePlus 13. I spent almost a month with the phone ahead of finishing my review, and never once felt the need to swap to another phone out of boredom or because the OnePlus 13 was lacking in some way.', 'I struggled to find downsides with it, and even when my review had been published I didn’t want to change to another phone. The OnePlus 13 did everything I wanted. It looks brilliant in the navy shade of my review device, the battery lasts for more than two days with my fairly modest use, it has more performance than I’ll likely ever use, and the camera takes fantastic photos. I even fell for a OnePlus/Hasselblad camera feature I’d disliked in the past.', 'Sound familiar? It’s essentially the same response I had to the OnePlus Watch 3. Neither are flawless, but they both represent the pinnacle of OnePlus hardware and software — which is also excellent on both watch and phone — and I don’t think the brand has ever made devices as well-rounded and polished as these two. I know it’s high praise, but in the same way I didn’t really want to stop using the OnePlus 13, I haven’t taken the OnePlus Watch 3 off yet, despite my review already being published.', 'Recommendations like this often come with a caveat around price. Sometimes the things I like most cost a lot more, and I have to qualify the recommendation with a phrase like, “if you aren’t worried about the cost,” or something like that. It’s not the case with the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus Watch 3, as neither are the most expensive in their class.', 'The OnePlus 13 is superb value. It starts at $900, and while this price puts it against phones like the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Google Pixel 9 Pro, I’d say it’s probably a shrewder buy than the over-priced Galaxy S25 Ultra, which under-delivers in desirability for it’s $1,300 price. The OnePlus Watch 3 costs $330, which is around the same price as the 44mm Galaxy Watch 7, but much cheaper than the expensive (and shockingly dull-looking) Google Pixel Watch 3.', 'You can buy both the phone and the smartwatch for less than the price of a base model Galaxy S25 Ultra, and not only is this great value, but you’re genuinely getting class-leading, highly desirable, long-lasting products. I recall writing about the Tecno Phantom V Fold and V Flip folding phones, and how the pair together cost less than a Galaxy Z Fold 5, but you’d be compromising on quite a lot if you bought them. There’s no such compromise if you buy the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus Watch 3.', 'Keen-eyed readers will notice I’ve side-stepped around the Apple Watch Series 10 and iPhone so far. The OnePlus Watch 3 only works with Android phones, so it’s not competing with Apple’s smartwatch, but anyone shopping for a new phone and smartwatch would be foolish not to consider going for the Apple combo. So which is better?', 'I love the Apple Watch Series 10, especially the titanium version, and its incredible integration with the iPhone and iOS puts it ahead of any Android-based pairing. The Apple Watch is so versatile, so effortlessly cool, and in its current guise so perfectly refined no other brand can get close. Given the choice between an iPhone and Apple Watch, or the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus Watch 3, I’d still go for a pair of Apples. However, the OnePlus devices are a close second, and the top of the tree in Android world.', 'It’s often hard to put into words why we recommend certain products, especially when not discussing features or technical prowess. Saying I haven’t felt the need to stop using the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus Watch 3 during and after the review period is perhaps more important, and useful buying advice, than any numbered score or benchmark test. If you want a new Android phone and fancy a smartwatch to go with it, my wholehearted recommendation is to buy the OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus Watch 3.']"

On the backplate, permanently engraved in stainless steel, is a typo. Instead of reading “Made in China,” it reads “Meda in China.”', 'To be fair, this is a minuscule error. I didn’t even notice it on my review unit until I spied an Android Police article in my feed pointing it out. But, in the history of OnePlus’ many smartwatch sins, this unfixable typo both makes complete sense — and is a major relief.', 'To understand why, you have to remember that the original OnePlus Watch was an unmitigated disaster. An abomination of a smartwatch, riddled with software errors and personally, the worst product I have ever tested in my career. In my review, I wrote that it’s health and fitness tracking was so inaccurate, it deserved the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The only smartwatch that could be conceivably worse is will.i.am’s Puls smartwatch, but I was fortunate enough to dodge that bullet. So traumatized was I by the OnePlus Watch, I was wary of the OnePlus Watch 2 when it launched last year.', 'That fear was compounded when OnePlus mistakenly sent me eleven review units of the OnePlus Watch 2 — a watch that also broke the sacred, nerdy covenant that a rotating crown on a smartwatch must scroll.', 'But aside from that one cardinal sin and a sike of a delivery snafu, the OnePlus Watch 2 ended up being a redemption story. Not only was it a smartwatch that worked, it ended up becoming an excellent alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches for Android users. I’m still testing the OnePlus Watch 3, but so far I have little to complain about, especially since the company finally introduced a proper rotating crown. And, if anything, I’m heartened to see that OnePlus’ signature oops this time around is a minor typo that most users will never really see. One could also argue that the misprint makes this first edition batch a collector’s item. That’s progress.', 'Besides, as far as typos go, it could’ve been far worse. At least OnePlus didn’t do a Mattel and accidentally misprint a link to a porn site on the product packaging.

And the extra capacity is noticeable, with the official numbers saying that the OnePlus Watch 3 can last for up to 5 days in its standard ""smart"" power mode, almost a full day longer than the rated battery life for the OnePlus Watch 2. That goes up to 16 days for power saver mode.', 'For my own testing, which involved wearing the Watch 3 almost 24 hours a day (only taking it off for showers), including every night for sleep and a few walking workouts, the battery lasted me four days and 6 hours. And that was with me making sure the watch was always in smart mode, even after the watch automatically switched at 10% battery.', 'Bear in mind though that all of these numbers are based on keeping the always-on display (AOD) that displays the basic watchface at all times — disabled by default — switched off.

But that perhaps doesn't matter, since the charging base doesn't have an attached cable, unlike a lot of other smartwatches, which means you can easily plug it into any free USB-C cable you have, giving you a lot of flexibility."", 'If you want a smartwatch to pair with your Android phone, one with a bold and stylish look, plenty of health tracking features and stunning battery life, all for an attractive price, the OnePlus Watch 3 provides a great option.', ""Even for phone brands who also make smartwatches, OnePlus' wearable could still pull you in with that lower than average price and the freedom to charge it only once or twice a week. That said, you will have to accept the specs of the single variant of the OnePlus Watch 3, rather than pick a size or connectivity type as you can with other smartwatches."", ""Also, while there are plenty of ways to track your health with the Watch 3, it would have been nice for OnePlus to round off the features with a few more that other brands offer for safety and sleep; it'll never take stand head-to-head with the best Garmin watches when it comes to fitness tracking."", ""But in terms of what you do get, and what you don't get, it's hard to find fault with the OnePlus Watch 3."", ""Richard is based in London, covering news, reviews and how-tos for phones, tablets, gaming, and whatever else people need advice on.

I Tested the OnePlus Watch 3 and Its Battery Life Won Me Over,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/i-tested-the-oneplus-watch-3-and-its-battery-life-won-me-over/,"['With a promised five-day battery life, this underdog OnePlus wearable could be a standout in the Android smartwatch market.', '', ""I've been testing the $330 OnePlus Watch 3 for 48 hours and have found it to be, so far, a powerhouse smartwatch wrapped in a sleek, understated design. OnePlus aims to compete with its Android rivals by offering a robust set of health and fitness features, and the promise to blow them all away with a five-day battery life under normal use."", 'Having heard similar promises about smartwatch batteries before, I was skeptical. Companies often hype up battery life, only to bury in the fine print that it requires power-saving mode -- stripping away ""smart"" features and turning the watch into nothing more than a glorified digital clock. I was pleasantly surprised that the default settings on the Watch 3 include full use of all its features, minus the always-on display, which I would normally activate.', 'The only change I made was swapping the analogue-style watch face for one that displayed battery life at a glance, along with workout shortcuts, weather and fitness tracking. Big mistake. Turns out, I had unknowingly picked one of the worst offenders -- a level three out of three on the Wear OS battery drain scale.', ""During my first two days with the Watch 3, I used it to receive text and email notifications, track an hour-long outdoor run with GPS, log an indoor strength workout and track two nights of sleep. As a result, the Watch 3's battery dropped to 50% within the first 48 hours. "", ""While it doesn't quite hit the promised five days, I should still get four full days of battery life from the Watch 3 on a single charge -- impressive, considering most Android smartwatches struggle to last three. For my full review, I'll switch to a lower-power watch face to see if I can push it to OnePlus' five-day claim."", ""There's a lot more to unpack with the Watch 3, and so far, I'm pleasantly surprised. "", ""The Watch 3's best feature, after two days of testing, is its battery life."", ""OnePlus' claim to fame initially was delivering quality devices at more affordable prices than high-end competitors like Samsung and Google. And the Watch 3, the fourth from the Chinese company, aims to shake up some of that tradition."", ""Unlike the original $160 OnePlus Watch and last year's $180 Watch 2R, whose low prices were the main appeal, the Watch 3 prioritizes its more premium appeal over a low price. OnePlus wants the Watch 3 to be a premium flagship device, putting it in direct competition with other Watch OS devices like the Google Pixel Watch 3 and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. What could set it apart, if it delivers, is its battery life."", ""OnePlus claims the Watch 3 can last five days on its default settings. That's thanks to a large 631mAh battery and a dual-chipset system that uses its Snapdragon W5 processor to focus on powering app usage, while its BES2800 MCU Efficiency chip handles low-powered background tasks. "", ""In my first two days, I was impressed with the Watch 3's battery life, despite my choice of using a battery thirsty watch face. It's worth noting that the Watch 3 has an ultra power-saving mode, which OnePlus claims can last up to 16 days on a full charge."", 'This is what the OnePlus Watch 3 looks like right out of the box.', 'The OnePlus Watch 3 keeps the sleek stainless steel design of its predecessor, with some notable upgrades. It has a rotating crown with an easy-to-grip texture and a titanium bezel surrounding the screen -- reminiscent of the rotating bezels on the early Samsung watches that I loved. This one is thinner and stays in place, but I like how it elevates the design, making it look less like a giant circular 1.5-inch AMOLED display strapped to my wrist. The screen is bright and easy to see even in direct sunlight. The watch comes in silver or black, with rubber straps that are comfortable to wear all day and night.', ""The Watch 3 runs on Wear OS 5, with additional OnePlus design and features, like the OHealth app that you'll need to download on your phone to access the watch's full range of health tracking features. "", ""The interface of Watch 3 feels a bit sluggish, with a slight lag in response time. It's hard to tell whether this is a Wear OS issue or if it's the actual watch but navigation isn't entirely seamless -- though it did improve as I got more familiar with the buttons and gestures.The interface isn't particularly intuitive either -- some settings, like workout views, require digging through menus (a known Wear OS issue). I also had trouble setting up my account in the OHealth app and syncing it with my Google health data. This may be due to using a developer version of the app, but it's cumbersome nonetheless. "", ""Accessing all my health data through the OHealth app hasn't been too bad, thanks to its visual, user-friendly interface."", ""Here's the OnePlus Watch 3 next to a OnePlus 13 with the OHealth app open."", ""OnePlus' investment in health and wellness is evident in this watch. In addition to basics like heart rate and calories, it measures more nuanced health metrics, like cardiovascular health, SPO2, wrist temperature and general well-being (which includes emotional and stress levels), though not without some caveats. None of these features are FDA-approved, meaning they aren't meant to be used as medical-grade data. Additionally, the ECG feature isn't available in the US or Canada. The Watch 3 also lacks menstrual health tracking -- an oversight, in my opinion -- especially since wrist temperature monitoring, now standard on its main rivals, could be extremely useful for ovulation tracking."", 'The Watch 3 also debuts a 60-second health check-in, a feature that checks all your vitals in one spot by pressing your finger on the watch\'s bottom button. My first health check-in was concerning and displayed a red exclamation mark with the word ""abnormal"" next to it. Upon further inspection, it turns out all my vitals were in range, but it was my sleep score that was skewing the results. I\'ll admit, my sleep habits aren\'t great, partly due to my one-year-old daughter, but I\'d argue that I at least deserve a passing grade. ', 'In terms of fitness, the OnePlus Watch 3 covers all the basics, with more than 100 different sports modes, six of which it detects automatically: running, walking, rowing, elliptical machine, cycling and swimming. It also offers a ""professional"" mode for 11 sports that keeps tabs of more nuanced metrics related to that sport. For runners, it tracks form and foot balance, while for tennis players, it measures swing speed and stroke. While it may be overkill for most, as a runner who recently learned how to leverage heart rate zones to intensify workouts, I\'m excited to nerd out on these additional metrics.', ""Another key feature for outdoor sports enthusiasts is its dual-frequency GPS tracking system, which OnePlus claims can position you accurately even in challenging environments, such as crowded cities surrounded by high rises. I live in an entirely different environment, more sheep than skyscrapers, so I haven't been able to fully test this claim. It did position me perfectly on my usual trail run through oak trees and vineyards."", 'With an IP69 rating, the OnePlus Watch 3 is also water-resistant up to 50 meters.', ""I plan to dive deeper over the next few days and test some of the Watch 3's other features for my full review. But for now, if battery life is at the top of your wishlist for a smartwatch, as it is mine, this is one Android smartwatch that's definitely worth considering.
