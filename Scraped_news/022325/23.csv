The week ahead: Can Nvidia results and CPI calm markets?,https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/the-week-ahead-can-nvidia-results-and-cpi-calm-markets-202502240702,"['', '', '', '', 'Kathleen Brooks\nXTB UK\nFollow', 'As we start a new week, investors are still digesting the extreme price action that we witnessed last week. The S&P 500 made two fresh record highs last week, yet after an ugly session on Friday it closed the week down 1.67%. The S&P 500 starts a new week extremely close to its 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages, a break below these key support levels would be a bearish development for the main US blue chip index.', 'US stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the S&P 500 down 1.7%, and the Nasdaq down by more than 2%. US stocks’ underperformance vs. European stocks has widened, as US indices had their worst day of the month so far. The triggers were varied: 1, a bearish reaction to a Chinese news article about a new virus, 2, weak US PMIs and a rise in inflation expectations in the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey for February, which pushed Citi’s US economic surprise index to its lowest level since September, 3, a $2.7trn options expiry likely added downward pressure to the sell off.', 'There is undoubtedly a bearish tone to markets these days, and this was reflected in the latest CFTC positioning data. US Treasuries saw their largest inflows for 7 years, the FX market saw a further decline in long dollar positioning and a pickup in euro longs, while in the equity space there was broad based selling of S&P 500 futures. Weak sentiment towards US assets is also led by a fear of higher inflation at the same time as the economy is weakening. Stagflation fears tend to be unwelcome news for equities. The risk of a tipping point for US equities is increasing. We will be watching the correlations between S&P 500 stocks closely in the coming days and weeks. The implied volatility in the S&P 500, which measures the volatility of the Vix index and is a good measure of how stocks are moving in relation to each other, spiked last week. Although this is at a relatively low absolute level, the fact that this is moving higher is worth watching as it could signify a broad-based sell off is brewing.', 'There is also a theory that stocks will sell off on a Friday to avoid being blindsided by an unexpected policy announcement from President Trump. The US President was mostly quiet this weekend, so we will have to see if this leads to any let up in the selling pressure on Monday.', 'Bonds were the clear winner last week, as risk aversion took hold. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell below 4.5%, which is considered a key psychological level. While some of this was a rotation out of risky assets and into bonds, there is also a fundamental reason for the decline in bond yields, which could help cheer markets at the start of a new week: the decline in the oil price.', 'WTI and Brent crude fell nearly 3% on Friday, and WTI is hovering just above the crucial $70 per barrel level. WTI made a fresh low for the year on Friday, and Brent crude is not far from its 2025 low. Ample oil supply, the prospect of peace in Ukraine and sanctions being lifted on Russian oil supplies, as well as signs of a slowing US economy did not help, after the composite US PMI reading fell to 50.4 down from 52.7 in January. The spread between the front month WTI contract and the March 2025 contract has fallen sharply and is at its lowest level of the year, as spot oil prices continue to come under downward pressure. The US oil market is currently in contango – future months’ contract prices are higher than the spot price, which is a sign that the market remains bearish on oil in the short term.', 'Looking ahead, whether or not the sell off continues may depend on this week’s key developments. Events in Ukraine, an uneasy ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, the German election results and plethora of central bank speak could all impact financial markets this week. Below we look at two events that we think will be crucial for market sentiment in the coming days.', 'Bonds have been outperforming US and European stocks in recent days, which means that key inflation reports released this week could determine if this trend continues in  the coming days. In Europe, provisional readings of French, German and Spanish CPI for February are all released this week. The overall Eurozone reading for January will be released later on Monday, however the national data for February will be more market-moving, in our view. The market is expecting a decent uptick in monthly prices for February, which is largely down to a sharp increase in electricity and gas prices earlier in the month. This provisional reading will not take account of the sharp decline in gas and oil prices on the back of renewed hopes of an end to the conflict in Ukraine and the potential return of Russian energy supplies to the global markets. However, annual CPI rates are expected to decline. The French annual rate of CPI is expected to moderate to 1.2% from 1.8% in January, the German rate is expected to decline to 2.6% and the Spanish rate is expected to remain steady at 2.9%. We think that the moderation in French and German CPI this month may mean that ECB speakers this week will remain on the dovish side. The bulk of ECB speak in the past month has been dovish. However, there is a note of caution in some recent ECB members speeches. Spain’s ECB President said that the ECB need to be cautious given the extraordinary uncertainty in the global economy. However, the head of the Bank of France said that the ECB’s policy rate could hit 2% in the summer, although he added that it is unclear what would happen to rates beyond this level. This may be perceived as slightly dovish since the interest rate futures market currently expects ECB rates to be just under 2.1% this summer.', 'The main economic event for markets this week will be the US PCE report on Friday. The market expects core PCE for January to rise 0.3% on the month, but for the annual rate to decline to 2.6% from 2.8%. The January CPI report surprised on the upside, and there is a chance that the same could happen to PCE. If we do get a higher-than-expected PCE reading for last month, this could ignite stagflation fears in the US economy, as the PMI report for February showed a rapidly weakening economic backdrop. Although there are initial signs that growth could be slowing in the US, it could be enough to trigger a further decline in US stocks, higher than expected PCE could also weigh on US bonds, but it may boost the dollar, after a weak performance so far this year.', 'Interestingly, US companies with the greatest overseas exposure are reporting stronger earnings than companies with a majority of domestic exposure for Q4, even though the dollar was strong in the final months of 2024. This could be an early sign that US economic growth is faltering. The earnings growth rate for companies that generate more than 50% of their earnings overseas was more than 20% in Q4, above the 16.9% reported for companies that generate more than 50% of their earnings inside the US, according to FactSet. For internationally focused companies, Nvidia was a big contributor to earnings growth, which leads us nicely onto the second event to watch this week.', 'Wednesday night will see Nvidia report its earnings for last quarter. 2025 has seen the once mighty Nvidia fall from its perch. It was one of the best performing stocks in 2024, yet Nvidia is down more than 1% so far in 2025. Also, it is no longer the biggest contributor to the performance of the S&P 500, that accolade now goes to Meta.', 'The biggest change to Nvidia has been the arrival of DeepSeek, the Chinese version of ChatGPT, which claims to use cheaper and less advanced chips to power its AI models. This has threatened Nvidia as the world’s largest maker of the most advanced GPUs. While the period of this earnings report will not include the news about DeepSeek, the world will be watching to hear what Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has to say about DeepSeek and what this means for future demand for Nvidia products. Analysts have reduced their expectations for Nvidia’s EPS and revenue forecasts for the prior quarter in the last 4 weeks, however, revenues are expected to rise to $38.26bn, higher than the $35.08bn recorded in the prior quarter. The market expects Nvidia to meet revenue estimates, and for it to raise its guidance for the current quarter. Forward guidance is the most important aspect of these results, and we expect Huang to tell the market that its latest Blackwell chips are selling well now that initial supply chain issues have been overcome. Sales of the Blackwell chip could exceed guidance, which may boost sentiment towards the stock. Although Nvidia’s stock price is down more than 7% in the past month, its worth noting that Nvidia’s main customers including Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have all boosted capital spending for this year, which should be positive for Nvidia. We think that Huang will focus on this during his conference call and will not cite DeepSeek as a threat to Nvidia in the near term. Although margin growth could fall for the last quarter, if sales of Blackwell chips beat expectations, then the company may boost expectations for future margin growth.', 'As mentioned, Nvidia’s share price has been particularly volatile this year, and is lower YTD. The average move in Nvidia’s share price 24 hours after an earnings report is 4.95% over the last 8 quarters. However, with stock markets on edge, and value stocks outperforming  growth stocks, we think that Nvidia will need to give extremely strong forward guidance and an upbeat outlook for future Blackwell chip sales to see an increase in its stock price of this magnitude.

These products may not be suitable for all investors and you should seek independent advice if necessary.', ""EUR/USD stays strongly bid near 1.0500 in the European session on Monday. The pair cheers the German Conservatives Party win in the federal election, which revives hopes for better economic outlook. The further upside could remain elusive due to a cautious market mood. Germany's IFO data eyed. "", 'GBP/USD kicks off the new week on a positive note but remains below 1.2700 in the early European trading on Monday. Broad US Dollar weakness helps the pair regain ground but the upside appears capped as traders turn cautious ahead of speeches from several BoE policymakers. ', ""Gold price extends its sideways consolidative price move at the start of a new week and remains confined in a multi-day-old trading range through the early European session on Monday. However, gold sits near the all-time peak touched last week amid the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade tariffs and their impact on the global economy."", 'Dogecoin extends its decline, trading around $0.23 on Monday after falling 8.55% last week.

Alibaba has published very good quarterly results. Investors have welcomed the 13% growth in cloud revenues.\n\nAirbnb -9.51%: Fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations. Bookings increased by 12% year-on-year, thanks to robust international demand.\n\nGarmin +5.69%: The navigation device manufacturer announced annual results that exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations. Business is particularly buoyant in the outdoor and automotive OEM segments.\n\nStandard Chartered +5.34%: The British bank seems unwilling to put an end to its splendid run of recent weeks. Profits are up 17%. The bank has launched a $1.5 billion share buyback program.\n\nHasbro +11.08%: The children's toy giant jumps on the stock market after successful publications. The narrative around the “Playing to win” strategy was very appealing to investors.\n\nIntel +5.38%: TSMC and Broadcom are each separately studying plans for a partial takeover of Intel. The former would like to take over the entire company, while the latter would only consider an offer if it could find a partner for Intel's manufacturing activities.\n\nLosers:"", ""TFI International -26.14% The combination of the announcement of disappointing results, including a drop in turnover, and the relocation of its headquarters in the United States do not bode well for the Canadian logistics company.\n\nEPAM Systems -21.52% The software company wants to invest in retaining talent and accelerate investments in advanced Gen AI platforms and tools. These future expenses cause the company to exceed estimates for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nCelanese -22.48%:  The chemical products specialist continues its tumble on the stock market. The share price plummeted after announcing a quarterly loss due to destocking, especially in its industrial and automotive markets, and weak demand.\n\nApplovin -18.59%: last week we were at a loss for words to describe Applovin's umpteenth rise.

The prospect of a merger and acquisition and a massive share buyback plan will not allow Glencore to end up in the black.', 'Energy prices: Oil prices gained ground this week, a rebound that is completely unclear given the pressures on supply. On the one hand, the Europeans are toughening their stance against Russia by targeting its ghost fleet, but on the other hand, the United States is considering lifting sanctions against Moscow. The market is also monitoring talks between the major producing powers, notably the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The talks, which focus on the conflict in Ukraine, are also expected to address oil and influence future trade strategies and production levels. While the US is seeking to lower energy prices, OPEC+ and its influential members such as Saudi Arabia and Russia want to maintain higher prices. Still on the supply side, OPEC+ could delay its planned production increase in April, but on the other hand, a major oil pipeline linking the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan to Turkey is set to reopen and resume exports, complicating the task of Iraq, which must respect the quotas set by the expanded cartel. Finally, geopolitical tensions are not abating, with Ukraine once again targeting oil infrastructure in Russian territory.

Copper also rose to USD 9563. As for gold, the barbaric relic remained on a trajectory of gains for an eighth consecutive week, supported by its demand as a safe haven in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. Gold traded at USD 2932 and approached the psychological threshold of USD 3000.', 'Agricultural products: Corn in Chicago climbed to its highest level in 18 months due to forecasts of a reduced supply and is trading at around 512 cents (contract expiring in May 2025). Wheat also rose to 610 cents, supported by winter conditions in the United States and Russia.', 'Atmosphere: Nothing new under the sun, but... At the end of a fairly calm week on the economic indicators front, with the exception of leading indicators which fell more than expected, bond yields moved within a narrow range of variation. The US 10-year bond fluctuated between 4.40/38% and 4.65%, while its German counterpart remained well above 2.32%. The US yield curve continued to steepen, benefiting financial stocks. As for the spread between the United States and Germany, it remained stable at around 200 basis points. In short, so far, nothing new under the sun. Investors are still waiting to see if the Trump administration and the DOGE are capable of drastically reducing the US debt and thus avoiding a bond crisis.

The asset has been gravitating in this price zone for two months, after having recorded a spectacular surge of more than 50% between Trump's election and the end of last year. On the Bitcoin Spot ETF side, however, there is no joy. The total assets of these exchange-traded products in the United States fell by more than $500 million this week. Among the other cryptos, Solana (SOL) continues to plummet. The cryptocurrency has fallen by almost 30% in a month, from $252 to $178, mainly due to the loss of momentum of memecoins on Solana, considered the preferred blockchain for these ultra-speculative assets, since the collapse of $TRUMP and more recently $LIBRA cryptos.

He also said Realty Income is one of his favorite real estate investment trusts, but added that he\'s worried about Cleveland-Cliffs which may face difficulties due to cheap steel exports from abroad. He called online healthcare provider Hims & Hers a ""true battleground,"" as investors wonder if the company can continue to offer less expensive GLP-1 weight loss drugs with compounded ingredients now that the Food and Drug Administration has deemed the shortage of the semaglutide injection products over.', ""Home Depot is set to report Tuesday, and while Cramer said he expects a weaker quarter from the retailer, it should benefit from the need to rebuild after major storms in the southeast and fires in Los Angeles.

The S&P 500 ($SPX) (SPY) pulled back from recent all-time highs as traders reassessed valuations in high-growth sectors.', 'Here are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.', 'NVIDIA Earnings', ""Wednesday's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings report could be the most significant market event this week. Given the company's central role in the AI boom and its massive influence on market sentiment, this report will be closely watched. Beyond the numbers themselves, guidance and commentary about AI chip demand could impact the entire tech sector. With the stock up over 95% in the past twelve months, expectations are high and the reaction could be volatile in either direction."", 'Key Economic Growth Data', 'Thursday brings the second reading of Q4 GDP at 8:30 am. While this is a revision of the advance number, any significant changes could impact market sentiment about economic strength. This report takes on additional importance as traders try to gauge whether the economy is maintaining its resilience or showing signs of slowing. The data could influence expectations about Fed policy and the timing of potential rate cuts.', 'Core PCE Price Index', ""Friday's Core PCE Price Index at 8:30 am is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. After recent hotter-than-expected CPI and PPI readings, this report will be crucial for rate cut expectations. Any upside surprise in inflation could further push back rate cut timing and pressure stocks, while a cooler reading might reignite hopes for earlier monetary easing."", 'Housing and Consumer Data', ""Several important consumer and housing indicators are due this week. Tuesday's Consumer Confidence report at 10 am will show if recent market gains and cooling inflation are boosting sentiment. Wednesday's New Home Sales data will provide fresh insights into housing market strength amid still-elevated interest rates. These readings could impact consumer discretionary stocks like Home Depot (HD), which reports earnings Tuesday."", 'Growth Stock Fallout', ""Following Friday's sharp declines in growth stocks like Palantir (PLTR), AppLovin (APP), and Hims & Hers Health (HIMS), traders will watch for potential continued volatility in these names. The selloff could signal a broader reassessment of valuations in high-growth sectors. Other notable earnings this week from Salesforce (CRM) and Snowflake (SNOW) could either calm or amplify these concerns."", ""Best of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article."", 'Stocks: 15 minute delay (Cboe BZX is real-time), ET.
