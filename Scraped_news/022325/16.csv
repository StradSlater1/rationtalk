"Trump's Ukraine peace ""plan"": A massive betrayal of America's friends — like me",https://www.salon.com/2025/02/23/ukraine-peace-plan-is-a-massive-betrayal-of-americas-friends--like-me/,"[""So what did Donald Trump actually do this past week? Something that may well be remembered until the planet gets smashed by an asteroid or goes up in a nuclear fireball. Maybe that's the whole point — making sure his name stays in the history books, no matter how? Scandal, absurdity, outright disaster — especially on the world stage — those are the fastest ways to etch yourself into memory. Trump knows that better than anyone."", 'Blaming Ukraine for the last three years of war, while crediting Russia\'s ""nobility"" for not wiping the Ukrainian nation off the map in response, and parroting the Kremlin’s line about ousting Volodymyr Zelenskyy so Russia can finish what it failed to do on the battlefield — this is all three at once: scandalous, absurd and an outright disaster.', 'Trump is turning the world upside down, stomping on common sense and sowing pure chaos — admittedly, his standard modus operandi. More specifically, this torpedoes what Trump has tried to pass off as a ""peace initiative."" How do you talk peace and confront aggression while blaming the victim? How do you negotiate the victim into making major concessions while all but telling them to pack up and leave? (This echoes Trump’s demand that the entire Palestinian population of Gaza should be evicted so the U.S. can ""own"" it, although the situations are not identical.) That’s not diplomacy — it’s a guaranteed dead end. Ukraine can’t accept negotiations under those terms, which means they’re doomed before they even start.', 'Related', 'Did any of this bring America closer to being ""great again""? Not in the slightest. It’s a joke, one that makes the U.S. look like the Joker on a global scale — but without the demonic charm.', 'Let me tell you straight up what made America great in the first place. It wasn’t just power or wealth — it was the sheer number of America’s friends and allies. Perhaps even more important, it was the countless people around the world who admired America, believed in it and pinned their hopes on it. At the peak of its global influence, the U.S. had an enormous army of friends. A giant extended family. A vast support base. A legion of voluntary promoters of American culture and the American worldview. ', 'Here’s where we need to stress the difference between two concepts: the American world and the Russian world.', 'The Russian world is a fiction, a patchwork of ""dead souls."" People who speak Russian, who are Orthodox Christians, who were born in the Soviet Union or its successor states — Moscow slaps the label ""Russian"" on them and claims them as its own. There is no genuine love, no admiration, no choice, no longing — just an imposed identity, a bureaucratic annexation of human lives.', ""People choose to be part of America, to learn its language, adopt its culture, dream its dreams. It's not dictated by geography, religion or bureaucratic decree — it's fueled by the idea that America stands for something bigger than itself."", 'The American world, however, is (or at least was) entirely different. It’s built on admiration, aspiration and voluntary belonging. People choose to be part of it. They choose to learn its language, adopt its culture, dream its dreams. It’s not dictated by geography, religion or bureaucratic decree — it’s fueled by belief, by the idea that America stands for something bigger than itself. That’s what made America powerful. That is, in fact, what made America great.', 'Now all of that is in rapid decline, and about to shrink even more dramatically. And why? Because of a guy with a cameo role in ""Home Alone"" who thinks being ""great"" means screwing the world over.', 'At this point you may well ask: Who the hell am I to tell you this? Fair enough.', 'OK then: I was once one of your ultimate enemies. I was one of the millions raised to hate America, to want it gone. I was trained to shoot within walls that still echoed with anti-American slogans, beneath posters that painted America as the global villain.', 'The city of my birth, Minsk — the capital of Belarus, then a Soviet republic and now a Russian client state — was the place where Lee Harvey Oswald got so bored that he packed up and headed back to the U.S., and into into the history books. According to some theories, Oswald was trained for his deadly mission there. Who knows?', 'Either way, the city still looks and feels as if the Soviet Union never collapsed. It just got a modern upgrade, as in the classic Soviet sci-fi movies of my youth. It was designed to feel that way. Although the city’s history goes back to the Middle Ages, it was rebuilt under Joseph Stalin after World War II as a kind of triumphal arch and a gateway to Moscow, 700 kilometers away. One Belarusian artist called it the “Sun City of Dreams,” a showcase of Communist utopia, frozen in time.', 'Oddly enough, the man who served as Oswald’s KGB handler in Minsk would later go on to sign the Belavezha Accords — the very document that dissolved the Soviet Union in 1991. That was the  moment briefly celebrated as “the end of history,” which supposedly signaled America’s victory in the Cold War. ', 'In Minsk, that victorious moment didn’t last long. A leader emerged who was eager to turn back the clock and make the Soviet empire great again. That man, Alexander Lukashenko — the first and only president of supposedly independent Belarus — reinstated Soviet colonial symbols as early as 1995. In that same year, Lukashenko’s air force, acting more like enforcers of a bygone era than a modern military, literally shot down a hot air balloon carrying two Americans. That so-called accident felt more like a grim political statement.', 'Thirty years later, Lukashenko still rules Belarus with an iron grip, while his minions keep the anti-Western propaganda machine running nonstop.', 'We need your help to stay independent', 'So I was trained and groomed to become another America-hater — at least until we got full access to the internet. Before that, with Russian TV shaping the narrative, I was fed propaganda and I bought into it. There were moments when I was ready to go fight Americans in the former Yugoslavia. After the 9/11 attacks, I caught myself thinking, they had it coming.', 'Now, even as I see Donald Trump wrecking everything I loved most about America, I deeply regret ever thinking that way. And I still wonder: How the hell could I have been that blind?', 'Those episodes of propaganda-induced lunacy are far behind me. I grew up into an adult fully steeped in America. I soaked in America. I inhaled America. Not just the surface-level pop culture that seeps through every crack of the world, but the real, deep, unfiltered America. I didn’t just learn about America. I lived it. ', 'I know America’s fabric — its geography, history, culture and politics — better than I know any other country in the world, including my own.', 'Despite not having that little blue ticket to the land of the free — I have never set foot on American soil — I still feel like a part of it. I’ve poured too much time, too much emotion, too much of myself into understanding this country to feel like an outsider.', 'I love America. Not blindly, not naively. I love it in all its complexity, its contradictions, with all its mistakes and stains. I love it because I see it clearly — its highs, its lows, its reckless ambition and its messy, infuriating brilliance.', 'But that orange glitch in the Matrix, that reality-TV Frankenstein — he is too big of a stain, too much of a mistake to bear.', 'I love America. Not blindly, not naively. I love it in all its complexity, its contradictions, with all its mistakes and stains. But that orange glitch in the Matrix, that reality-TV Frankenstein — he is too big of a stain.', 'Somehow, we have to acknowledge that those who voted Trump into office had their reasons. Legitimate concerns and real frustrations — I get it. I’m not here to judge anyone for caring more about the price of eggs in Pennsylvania (or whatever else was rattling, disturbing or downright pissing them off at the time) than by events unfolding an ocean away. That’s human.', 'But here’s the thing: The chaos Trump is unleashing won’t do America a damn bit of good. What’s the point of winning if it means losing the people who once admired you, who chose to stand with you around the world? Alienating voluntary friends, burning bridges that took decades to build — how does that make America great?', 'If you think those lost friends can be easily replaced with new ones, forget it. They can’t.', 'Trump’s new friends are not America’s friends. They may be his friends, at least for the moment: political opportunists, power-hungry strongmen and regimes that don’t care about the ideals America once stood for. They don’t admire its history, its culture, its principles. They barely know anything about it.', 'They’re celebrating one thing: the fact that the America that once stood in their way is crumbling. They don’t respect a strong America. They relish the idea of a weak America, , an America too distracted, too divided, too consumed by its own chaos to stop them. And don’t fool yourself into thinking they’re satisfied with just a piece of the pie.', 'They want the whole damn bakery.', 'When I talk about myself as a genuine friend of America, you might get the impression that I was some kind of anomaly, a rare exception in these parts of the world.', 'Not at all.', 'In Belarus, there were plenty of people who could have ensured that the place remained friendly to America — if they had a voice. If they weren’t brutally silenced, persecuted, shoved into prisons, driven into exiled or simply made too afraid to speak. If only they had the freedom to shape the country’s politics.', 'Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.', 'In other words, if we had democracy.', ""One of the main reasons we didn't, and don't, is Russia’s grip on my country. I myself was forced into exile, fleeing from relentless persecution. That was how I lost my home and the life I had built for myself — for the first time. Where did I go? I moved to Mariupol, on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine, well before that city made headline news all over the world. "", 'Mariupol is close to the Russian border. It had been teetering on the edge of war since 2014. But despite all that I felt safe there, much safer than in polished, orderly Minsk, where it felt like I was being crushed under a giant concrete slab of pro-Russian dictatorship.', 'You may know the rest of the story. Not my story, but the story of Mariupol. It was bombed into dust after the Russian invasion. Very little of the city is left now. I lost my home, for the second time.', 'Please understand that Ukraine was on its way to becoming a faithful American ally. It’s the largest country in Europe by land area (not counting Russia, which frankly doesn’t deserve to be counted) and, I would argue, the bravest one.', 'Ukraine did what almost no one expected — it stood up against Russia. After the invasion, the rest of the world assumed the same thing Vladimir Putin assumed: Kyiv would fall almost immediately, and Ukraine would surrender within days. Instead, Ukraine fought. It’s still fighting, three years on.', 'If you ask me, that remarkable country is a friend worth keeping.', 'What’s the point of betraying and alienating Ukraine? Trading it in for a “bigger friend” in the geopolitical playground?', 'That’s not how this works. ', 'Abandoning Ukraine isn’t just about losing a friend. It’s about something much larger — demonstrating to the world that America’s word means nothing. The cost of breaking that trust will be unbelievably high.', 'Ukraine isn’t just some disposable pawn, in a game where you ditch one piece to grab a shinier one. The “bigger friends” Trump is flirting with — Russia for sure; possibly China too — will never be allies in the way Ukraine is. They don’t admire America. They don’t want a strong America. They don’t stand by its values or interests. They see it as an obstacle, a rival, a force to be undermined and outplayed.', 'Ukraine, on the other hand, chose to be America’s friend. Not out of cynical calculation, but because it genuinely wanted to be part of the Western world, to align with democracy, with freedom, with the ideals the U.S. claimed to uphold.', 'Abandoning Ukraine isn’t just about losing a friend. It’s about something much larger — demonstrating to the world that America’s word means nothing. That loyalty, commitment and standing up for allies are not principles, but endlessly negotiable bargaining chips. The cost of breaking that trust will be unbelievably high: Good luck convincing anyone else, big or small, ever to believe in America’s promises again.', 'Before I finished writing this article, Trump opened his mouth again. This time it was even more shocking. He called Zelenskyy a ""dictator"" and advised him to ""move fast"" — whatever that’s supposed to mean — or he might lose his whole country.', 'I would say that was crazy and unbelievable, but at this point it’s almost expected: The man who tried to overturn his own country’s election is calling Zelenskyy a dictator for postponing elections during a full-scale war. (As Winston Churchill did, for example, during World War II.) The audacity is staggering.', ""The U.S. president is effectively telling Ukraine not to resist, not to fight, but to throw in its cards and surrender, as the only acceptable option. Who is Trump speaking for here? It doesn't sound like America."", 'What kind of election can you possibly hold in a country torn apart by war, with millions of refugees scattered across the world, a significant chunk of its territory under occupation, and many of its cities facing constant bombardment? No functioning democracy on Earth would stage a nationwide vote under these conditions.', 'And what exactly does ""move fast or there’s going to be no Ukraine anymore"" mean? The sitting U.S. president is effectively telling Ukraine not to resist, not to fight, but to throw in its cards and surrender, as the only acceptable option. Who is Trump speaking for here? It doesn’t sound like America. It sounds like another Putin mouthpiece, spewing the Kremlin’s approved talking points.', 'But let’s set aside the Ukrainians — ""these Slav-squatting, track-suited snow-apes,"" as Curtis Yarvin, one of Trump’s ideological whisperers, has so charmingly called them — and ask what else is at stake here', 'Alienating all of Europe? Pushing many European nations further into Russia’s sphere of influence, making the entire continent vulnerable to the same kind of dark forces that have already corroded its weaker states from within? Sure, that might be what Yarvin and his ilk want; they think an isolated, weakened Europe is a good thing. ', 'But exactly how does that make America great (again)?', ""What’s the grand strategy here? Gutting alliances, throwing away decades of trust and leaving the field wide open for America's biggest rivals? If this is supposed to be some 4-D chess move, it looks an awful lot like checkmate — for the wrong side."", 'My dear fellow Americans — for the moment, allow me to address you this way — can you see where this is heading?

That’s what Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signals when he argues it is “unrealistic” to believe that a Ukraine-Russia peace settlement would involve a return to Ukraine’s prewar borders, that Ukraine should not be admitted to NATO as a condition of a settlement, and that U.S. troops would not help enforce any settlement (“Trump administration upends U.S. policy on Ukraine,” Feb. 13).', 'So, Ukraine should surrender by rewarding Russia with its two main invasion goals - seizing Ukrainian territory and preventing Ukraine’s admission to NATO - a complete victory for Russia!', 'President Donald Trump also has said as much.

It analyses how the current U.S. Administration, characterised by reduced overseas commitments, fiscal conservatism, and scepticism towards allied burden-sharing, could reshape transatlantic security.', 'The report emphasises how reduced U.S. backing for Ukraine strategically affects NATO unity, Europe’s independent defence, and Ukraine’s war effort against Russia. The analysis also covers Trump’s recent statements criticising Biden’s handling of the war, questioning Ukraine’s leadership, and portraying himself as the only leader who could broker peace.', 'With shifting global politics, the report highlights the need for Europe to prepare for reduced U.S. involvement, requiring greater defence spending, diplomatic collaboration, and independent action to ensure regional stability.', 'The election of Donald J. Trump as President of the United States marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine and in its approach to NATO alliances. This change profoundly affected relations between Washington and Kyiv, altering the course of geopolitical events.', 'Under President Joe Biden’s administration, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine in 2022, occupying vast territories of the Eastern European nation, beginning with the Donbas region. This escalation followed the collapse of the Minsk Agreements and occurred amidst an identity crisis within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).', 'During Trump’s first term (2016–2020), transatlantic relations faced considerable strain. President Trump repeatedly criticised NATO allies for insufficient defence spending, while French President Emmanuel Macron notably described the alliance as “brain-dead”, reflecting widespread concerns about NATO’s relevance and cohesion at the time.', 'Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, however, has reinvigorated NATO, providing the alliance with renewed purpose and strategic direction. The United States, under the Biden administration, has leveraged this conflict as a tool of foreign policy. In coordination with NATO members and Western-aligned nations such as Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, Washington has spearheaded the imposition of stringent sanctions against Russia, aiming to undermine Moscow’s military and economic capabilities.', 'President Donald Trump’s recent statement regarding the conflict in Ukraine presents a sharp critique of the Biden administration’s handling of the war and Ukraine’s leadership, while positioning himself as the key figure capable of achieving peace.', 'Trump’s stance aligns with his America First doctrine, which prioritises fiscal restraint, a reduced commitment to foreign engagements, and a critical approach to allied burden-sharing. His statements highlight a perceived imbalance in financial contributions to the Ukraine conflict, arguing that the United States has provided significantly more aid than European nations. This view supports his long-held belief that European allies must take on more responsibility for regional security and lessen their reliance on the United States.', 'He criticises Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him unqualified and accusing him of needlessly involving the U.S. in a costly war. Concerns over financial transparency are also raised, with claims that a substantial portion of U.S. aid to Ukraine remains unaccounted for. Furthermore, he raises concerns about Ukraine’s internal political procedures, arguing that suspending elections is undemocratic and undermining Zelenskyy’s legitimacy. These claims fit into a larger effort to examine how the U.S. supports ineffective or poorly run foreign governments.', 'A central theme of Trump’s position is his self-proclaimed ability to broker peace, contrasting his approach with what he describes as inaction by the Biden administration and European governments. By positioning himself as the only leader capable of negotiating an end to the conflict, he seeks to reinforce his diplomatic credentials as a key electoral asset.', 'While acknowledging the humanitarian toll of the war in Ukraine, Trump’s remarks largely focus on attributing responsibility for the crisis to its current leadership. His foreign policy statements signal a strategic move toward less involvement in lengthy conflicts, decreased foreign aid, and a refocusing of international commitments to better serve U.S. interests. His critique of both Zelensky and Biden reflects a political strategy aimed at appealing to an electorate increasingly wary of foreign interventions and prioritising domestic concerns.', 'Trump’s position signals a recalibration of U.S. engagement in Ukraine, focusing on limiting financial aid, encouraging direct negotiations with Russia, and reducing Washington’s leadership role in European security affairs.', 'For NATO, this approach revives concerns about alliance cohesion and long-term stability. U.S. President’s insistence on burden-sharing and scepticism about NATO’s effectiveness challenges the alliance’s foundational principle of collective defence. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has temporarily revitalised NATO’s strategic unity, the prospect of diminished U.S. involvement could expose underlying fractures.', 'European members may need to accelerate defence spending to prevent weakening deterrence capabilities. Without strong U.S. backing, NATO could face strategic uncertainty, particularly on its eastern flank, where member states rely heavily on the United States’ military presence.', 'Ukraine’s position becomes increasingly precarious under this developing policy landscape. A reduction in U.S. support—financial, military, or diplomatic—would force Kyiv to reassess its defence strategies and seek deeper partnerships with European allies. While Europe has stepped up aid, matching the scale and speed of Washington’s assistance remains challenging.', 'Should the Republican White House effectively adopt a harsher approach, Ukraine’s ability to sustain its defence efforts against the Russian presence could be compromised, especially if international attention diminishes or a direct agreement between Russia and the United States that sidelines Kyiv and Brussels is finalised.', 'Europe, in turn, must prepare for greater self-reliance in ensuring regional security. Trump’s push for European nations to shoulder a larger share of the burden underscores a longstanding transatlantic debate. With the potential retraction of U.S. leadership, the European Union and NATO members may need to intensify defence initiatives and enhance diplomatic coordination.', 'Beyond military considerations, Europe faces significant economic and political repercussions from prolonged instability in Ukraine, including energy security concerns and the management of refugee flows. In this shifting geopolitical context, maintaining unity within NATO and securing continued support for Ukraine will require decisive European leadership. The developing U.S. stance underscores the importance of Europe not only as a partner but as an independent actor capable of safeguarding its own strategic interests amid changing global dynamics.', '*Cover Picture: Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump (Credits: President.gov.ua, CC BY 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons)', 'Do not miss our special reports for the third anniversary of the Ukraine conflict and contact us at info@specialeurasia.com and request information about our tailored reports and consulting services.', 'Don’t Miss Our Next Course in OSINT for the Russian-Speaking World', 'This is the SpecialEurasia online course designed for professionals, researchers, analysts, and investigators aiming to enhance their ability to work with Russian-language sources.', 'Testata giornalistica registrata presso\nil Tribunale di Cagliari n. 54/2025 del 09/01/2025\n©2024 All rights reserved.', '']"

Because that order survived, barely, his first term, there was some reasonable hope that it would do so again. But by siding so publicly with Russian President—and strongman—Vladimir Putin in his desire to dismember Ukraine—to the point of blaming Kyiv for being invaded and deliberately leaving Ukraine out of the ""negotiations""—he has quickly brought the worst-case scenario to pass.', 'America can no longer be trusted to side with its democratic allies against authoritarian aggression, a realization that is slowly dawning on leaders around the world and which will have far-reaching implications in the years to come.', ""Between 2016 and 2020, European leaders could make a case that Trumpism was an aberration and that the United States could repair relations and shore up the NATO alliance by bringing either a Democrat or some kind of pre-Trump Republican back into the White House. That was the promise of Joe Biden's presidency, and he largely delivered on it."", ""But the outcome of the 2024 election has forced a reckoning with a harsh, inescapable reality: in November, the American people willingly turned their country over to the same malevolent authoritarians who tried to overturn their constitutional order live on national television in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The voters went in with their eyes open and they picked the autocrat. Among many other things, it means that both the rank-and-file and the elites in one of America's two major political parties are implacably hostile to the core obligations of the NATO alliance."", ""Now, even a best-case scenario of the next four years which results in the election of another Democrat to clean up whatever political superfund site is bequeathed to them by Trump and Elon Musk's goon squad cannot easily undo the damage. The reason is that even if Democrats succeed in rescuing the country from this madness, the GOP will remain in the grip of it. If voters are willing to turn over power to people like this every time they are mildly dissatisfied, they are likely to do it again at some point. If you're, say, tiny, democratic Latvia, facing a radicalized, revanchist Russia on your eastern border, and your continued existence depends on the security guarantees of the United States, can you really put your faith in Washington's willingness to go to war for you?"", 'The answer is that you cannot and should not and will not. The unraveling of the NATO alliance may not happen all at once, but it is coming, and Europeans will have to put something in its place. Countries that have long felt comfortable under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, like Germany and Canada, will need to ramp up military spending and seriously consider nuclearization. Nearly every country in Europe is a so-called nuclear threshold state that possesses the technological know-how, resources and wealth to build nuclear weapons quickly. If their hands are forced, it will undermine one of the greatest and most improbable achievements of the post-WWII liberal architecture—keeping the nuclear club in the near-single digits despite the enormous security benefits that such weapons seem to confer on those who possess them. If nothing else, having even a small stockpile of nukes makes a country functionally impossible to invade.', ""That temptation will almost certainly be too much for many countries menaced by Putin's Russia to resist. But it's not just that Trump has thrown the alliance into chaos by siding with its principal adversary against the victim of brutal aggression—it's that Trump himself is now threatening to turn America and its military might into a revisionist power."", ""Trump has mused about turning Canada into the 51st state and seizing Greenland and the Panama Canal, three actions that would require unprovoked military aggression against peaceful democracies and longstanding allies. These countries don't have the luxury of trying to figure out whether to take him literally or seriously. If the United States of America—arguably the most militarily dominant power in world history—is now an expansionist state led by ethnonationalist autocrats, it will trigger an unparalleled emergency in democratic capitals around the world."", ""That's because to Trump and his allies, the world should be restored to its pre-WWII condition of pure anarchy, and countries should have no obligations to one another—economically, morally or geostrategically—beyond what can be extracted via the application of blunt force and power."", ""Every transaction is zero sum. Institutions designed to reduce conflict should be dismantled if they impose even modest restraints on America. The idea that deepening economic and security cooperation with a society of fellow democracies, even if not every single arrangement directly benefits the United States in a measurably material way, is anathema to this crew. To them, it's all a simple ledger, and we're in the red. They believe we can do better by joining forces with Russia, bullying small, peaceful democracies, withdrawing from painstakingly constructed international institutions and shedding any obligations to the rest of the world."", 'As impossible as this would have been to imagine 15 years ago, America has joined the axis of tyranny and turned its back on both its principles and its democratic allies.

All three regions will be lead by the three axis of evil pillars through dictatorships with the oligarch class controlling the masses stripping ordinary citizens of their rights to healthcare, good paying jobs, job security, fair wages, etc, etc. This will all take time BUT with Frump controlling everything in the US and stripping all power from the House and Senate, he will ensure he is able to run for another (third) term until his son Baron can take over from him.

No Room for Cowards or for Fools: Resisting the Surrender of Ukraine,https://www.laprogressive.com/war-and-peace/surrender-of-ukraine,"['Surrender of Ukraine', 'Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s recent remarks in Brussels—statements so jarring they sent shockwaves through diplomatic circles—sounded the death knell of American statecraft. Gone was the steady hand of leadership that once anchored the free world. In its place, a hollow shell of rhetoric, stripped of conviction, bending under the weight of appeasement.', 'Rather than reaffirming NATO’s unity, Hegseth wavered. Rather than condemning Russian aggression with the clarity history demands, he offered ambiguity—a lifeline to Moscow disguised as diplomacy. This was not a misstep; it was a signal. A retreat from principle. A slow-motion abandonment of allies who have staked their survival on American resolve.', 'In the halls of the Kremlin, there was no confusion. Only satisfaction. The great unraveling had begun.', 'With the full weight of American leadership behind him, Hegseth had the opportunity to reaffirm solidarity with NATO, to condemn Russian aggression with the moral clarity history demands.', 'But he did not.', 'Instead, his words wavered, his message muddled—a dangerous equivocation in a moment that called for resolve. He did not stand as a bulwark against tyranny but as an echo of uncertainty, undercutting alliances that have, for generations, held the line against authoritarian conquest. This was not strategy; it was surrender dressed as ambiguity. Not strength, but retreat. A gift to the Kremlin, wrapped in the language of doubt.', 'In Moscow, they must have listened closely. And they must have smiled.', 'For U.S. allies, the message was chilling: America, once the bedrock of the transatlantic alliance, now stands on unsteady ground. And as Zachary Basu’s reporting makes clear, the world is left to wonder—was this a blunder, or a warning of what’s to come?', 'Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered a blunt message to NATO allies Wednesday: U.S. troops will not be part of any future peace-keeping mission in Ukraine.', 'This is the tragic prelude to a full-scale retreat from American leadership, a surrender not just of Ukraine, but of the ideals that once defined the free world. And in that retreat lurks catastrophe. Because history has seen this before—the moment when democracies flinch, when appeasement is dressed as pragmatism, when cowardice masquerades as restraint. It never ends in peace. It ends in ruin.', 'But Hegseth wades through his rhetoric like a man lost in a fog of his own making. His words twist and turn, often contradicting themselves, leaving behind not clarity, but chaos. One moment, he strikes a tone of certainty; the next, he veers into contradiction, unraveling his own argument before it can take hold. The result is not conviction but confusion—a muddled narrative that serves no purpose except to obscure, distract, and leave the audience grasping at shadows.', 'Nick Paton Walsh writes:', 'The White House’s contradictory positions will be partly to blame here. We have seen a startling week in which the US Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth said Ukraine could not join NATO or get its pre-2014 borders back. He either broadcast a key plank of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s secret peace deal inadvertently or gave away a key part of Ukraine’s diplomatic negotiating hand to the shock of Europe.', 'Ukraine’s allies may have all known that, in reality, it would not join NATO soon, or get its borders back to when the east and Crimea were in its hands, but had kept that as a concession to make to Russia during, not before, negotiations.', 'But then, in a whiplash reversal, Hegseth told The Wall Street Journal the exact opposite. His words, already tangled in contradiction, collapsed entirely under the weight of their own inconsistency. One message for one audience, another for the next—leaving behind not a coherent argument, but a smokescreen of opportunism. Whether out of carelessness or calculated deceit, the effect remains the same: confusion, distortion, and a deliberate muddying of the truth:', 'US Vice President JD Vance told the Wall Street Journal, apparently, the US might send troops to Ukraine, in extremis – that it would use “tools of leverage” both military and economic. Did he really unveil the polar opposite of Hegseth’s comments in Brussels that no American soldiers would go to Ukraine? Why did he not mention Russia at all, when addressing European allies in Munich about largely fictional totalitarianism in western democracies? Also, did Trump misspeak when he said there would be “high-level people” from Russia, Ukraine, and the US in Munich for a key security conference – or did he mean Saudi Arabia?', 'If Pete Hegseth delivered a calamitous message to America’s steadfast allies, J.D. Vance provided precisely what the cynics expected—a full-throated echo of Trump’s erratic, and at times, inscrutable stance on Ukraine.', 'If Pete Hegseth delivered a calamitous message to America’s steadfast allies, J.D. Vance provided precisely what the cynics expected—a full-throated echo of Trump’s erratic, and at times, inscrutable stance on Ukraine. In his Munich address, Vance did not stand as a statesman but as a mariner lost at sea, his compass shattered, his bearings gone. Adrift in the tides of history, he seemed disconnected from the warnings of the past and ignorant of the realities of the present, drawn ever closer to the siren call of authoritarian appeasement.', 'Rather than anchor himself in the unshakable principles of democracy and resistance to tyranny, Vance charted a course straight into the storm, undermining the very alliances that have safeguarded the West for generations. His speech was not a beacon of leadership but a distress signal—one that, if ignored, could mark the beginning of a catastrophic unraveling.', 'He spoke not as a statesman, not even as a man burdened by the weight of history, but as an opportunist peddling a gospel of surrender, his words honeyed with the rot of political expediency. In a city that once bore witness to the cost of complacency, he dared to whisper the old, deceitful refrain: that we must turn away, that the defense of Ukraine is a burden too great, that America’s obligations to its allies are mere relics of a past he seeks to unmake. But America is not without its truth-tellers—critics who refuse to bow to power, who brave the storm of Trump’s wrath to speak plainly, without hesitation or artifice. One such voice is Steve Schmidt.', 'Schmidt, a seasoned political strategist and co-founder of the Lincoln Project, has spent years exposing the authoritarian rot at the heart of Trumpism. His analysis cuts through the noise, dissecting the dangers of a government hijacked by sycophants and strongmen. Whether warning of the existential threat posed by a second Trump term, the erosion of democratic institutions, or the cynical betrayal of Ukraine, Schmidt does not mince words. He understands that history does not forgive the complicit—or the complacent.', 'In an era when silence equals surrender, voices like his are more than necessary. They are a last line of defense.', 'Steve Schmidt’s The Warning is not just a podcast—it is a fire alarm in the night, ringing out over a nation teetering on the edge. It does not whisper. It does not soothe. It roars across the digital ether with the urgency of a prophet staring into the abyss. Schmidt wields language like a hammer, striking at the heart of the crisis with precision, never missing his mark. His voice is a scalpel, cutting through the fog of propaganda to expose the raw, unvarnished truth: a Trump, Musk, and Vance presidency is nothing less than a funeral dirge for democracy.', 'He paints Trump as he is—a groveling sycophant in Putin’s shadow, eager to trade American strength for the approval of a tyrant. Schmidt lays bare the treachery: Trump’s willingness to sell out our European allies, to turn Ukraine into a sacrificial lamb, to embolden the same Russian menace that history has already warned us about. This is not hyperbole. This is not speculation. It is a reckoning. And as Schmidt reminds us with every searing episode, the only question left is whether America will listen before it’s too late.', 'Steve Schmidt’s The Warning tore through J.D. Vance’s Munich Security Conference speech like a blade through prickly pretense, exposing it for what it was—not a condemnation of Russian aggression, but an abject betrayal of our European allies. Vance did not stand against tyranny; he stood against those resisting it. His words carried no fire for the Kremlin’s brutality, no outrage for the slaughter in Ukraine. Instead, he turned his aim on NATO, on those who have borne the weight of history’s harshest lessons, on the very alliances that have kept the world from descending into another abyss.', 'Schmidt eviscerated the Trump administration’s cowardice with the clarity of a battlefield dispatch, making one thing devastatingly clear: this is no mere rhetoric.', 'Schmidt’s The Warning peals like a cathedral bell in the storm, cutting through the fog of Vance’s revisionism with brutal clarity. Schmidt understands what Vance pretends not to see—that the specter of Trump, Musk, and Vance himself forms an unholy trinity of capitulation, a triumvirate of men who would let the fire of democracy gutter and die for the price of their own ambition. He strips away the mask, revealing Trump as the obsequious courtier to Putin, a man who kneels before the Russian autocrat with the eagerness of one who knows his debts will soon come due.', 'In Schmidt’s telling, Vance is no mere fool; he is something more insidious—a man who once feigned concern for the working class only to turn his back on them, trading in his conscience for a seat at the table of power. His performance in Munich was no different. He played the part of the sober realist while selling the fantasy that America’s strength lies in retreat, that Ukraine’s struggle for survival is not ours to fight, that history’s long arc can be bent backward with enough cynical pragmatism.', 'J.D. Vance stood before the assembled ranks of world leaders, not as a harbinger of wisdom but as a merchant of grievance, his words slithering through the hall like the first tremors of a coming quake.', 'J.D. Vance stood before the assembled ranks of world leaders, not as a harbinger of wisdom but as a merchant of grievance, his words slithering through the hall like the first tremors of a coming quake. He spoke not of unity, not of the burden of defending freedom, but of imagined betrayals, casting Europe as the villain in a fable only he and his cohort of aspiring autocrats could comprehend.', 'There was an irony so thick it choked the air—Vance, the mouthpiece of an administration that has turned censorship into an art form, accusing Europe of betraying free speech. He, who serves under a man who sues networks for telling the truth, who foments bans on books and history itself, who watches with silent approval as his party hunts down educators and journalists, dared to stand in Munich and lament the supposed silencing of dissent. The hypocrisy clung to him like the scent of rot.', 'But there was something deeper, something darker beneath his feigned indignation. He was not there to debate, not there to defend democracy, but to signal—to whisper in the ears of the gathered, as all aspiring strongmen do, that the old order is crumbling and that America, under his master’s hand, will no longer be its keeper. His sermon on migration was no mere policy stance but a hymn to the fears that fuel the fires of nationalism, a hymn that has been sung before—always before a great unraveling.', 'The room did not respond with thunderous applause but with silence—the kind of silence that follows an unexpected and unwanted specter at the feast. European diplomats, veterans of decades of alliances and hard-won peace, sat stunned, watching as the third most powerful man in the United States (next to Musk and Trump) spoke the language of retreat and resentment. ""Gobsmacked,"" they murmured. ""Frightening,"" they whispered. In another age, another time, another gathering in Munich, the world had once heard such rhetoric before.', 'Steve Schmidt sees with piercing clarity what J.D. Vance pretends not to—a nation not merely under external threat, but actively poisoning itself from within. America stands at the precipice, not because of foreign meddling alone, but because it has willingly invited the disease of authoritarian populism into its bloodstream. This is not a slow, creeping sickness; it has metastasized into something far more grotesque, so rancid that it is now projectile vomiting up fascism in broad daylight.', 'The masks have slipped. The quiet part is shouted. The once-veiled ambitions of strongman rule now parade through the streets, daring democracy to resist. Schmidt does not deal in euphemisms. He knows the abyss is near, and he knows history’s verdict on those who look away. The only question left is whether America will choke on its own bile—or rise before the sickness claims it completely.', 'Vance, Trump, Musk—their names will be written in history’s ledger, but not as defenders of free speech, not as guardians of democracy. They will be remembered as men who fanned the flames while pretending to be firefighters.', 'Munich was not a moment of strength for Vance. It was an unveiling, a pronouncement that the last vestiges of America’s moral leadership is being auctioned off to the resignation of the weak, bartered away in a marketplace of cowardice where principle is the first casualty. Once a beacon of resolve, the nation now flirts with appeasement, its commitments hollowed out by those too timid—or too compromised—to stand firm against tyranny.', 'This is not the posture of a superpower. It is the slouch of a nation in retreat, its credibility bleeding out with every equivocation, every waver, every failure to call evil by its name.', 'The world is watching. Moscow is taking notes. And history, as always, will deliver its judgment. The storm is gathering, and those who mistake silence for consent will soon learn that history never kneels.', 'Here is what Vance should have said: Putin’s justifications for his criminal invasion are eminently risible and potently dangerous, and need to be historicized and put under critical examination. We can, and should, support the Ukrainian people in their moment of need. As the reigning hegemon of a unipolar geopolitics, the US pledges its support for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, and the right for Ukraine to be provided with the weapons it needs in order to defend its territory and its people. Russia must pay reparations for the damage that it has inflicted throughout Ukraine – in its cities, its suburbs, and its countryside. Failure to do so will result in US sanctions.', 'This is the final stage of the imperial death spiral—the moment when the propaganda machine, having exhausted its justifications for one genocide, simply broadens its scope to include the world. What began as a campaign to erase Ukraine has now become an indictment of all who refuse to kneel before Russian revanchism.', 'There is no longer pretense, no longer even the hollow echoes of diplomacy. The rhetoric of Russian state media has descended fully into the abyss, an orgy of nihilism where the only response to resistance is annihilation. Their pundits do not argue policy; they fantasize about cities reduced to ash, about entire nations swallowed in nuclear fire. When they are not satisfied with kidnapping Ukrainian children and carting them off to Siberia, they rejoice in the bombing of children’s hospitals, their bloodlust spurred on by the destruction of innocent life. They cheer their success in bombing a nuclear reactor, as though the poisoning of the land and the poisoning of the future could somehow satiate their hunger for conquest. This is not war—it is a doctrine of pure destruction, a monstrous testament to the rage of a wounded empire lashing out at a world that refuses to bend to its will.', 'And what does the United States do in response? It rewards such aggression. It coddles the criminals in the Kremlin by floating the idea that Russia must keep the land it has stolen as a ""realistic condition"" of peace. This is not diplomacy. This is capitulation. This is not justice—it is the betrayal of the principles the West claims to stand for. To surrender to this logic is to give up not just Ukraine’s future, but our own.', 'And yet, history tells us where such rhetoric leads. It is not just the words of propagandists screaming into the void—it is the prelude to horror. The world has seen this before: the fevered rants of dictators, the fanatical dreams of empire, the conviction that if victory is impossible, then ruin must be shared by all.', 'To wave away these threats as mere theater is to whistle past the graveyard of history. This is not the bravado of strength but the howl of a cornered beast, and wounded predators are the most lethal of all. The question is no longer whether danger looms—it does. The only question that remains is whether the world will awaken before the storm clouds break, or whether, as too often before, it will stir only when the deluge is already upon us.', 'There are always those who believe that the tide can be reasoned with, that the rising flood of fascism can be managed through measured words and diplomatic handshakes. They are the ones who whisper of compromise while standing at the edge of the abyss, mistaking the predator’s pause for a moment of reflection rather than the tightening of claws before the kill.', 'This is no moment for comforting delusions. The architects of annihilation have laid bare their designs with the cold precision of a blade to civilization’s throat. They do not come to the table seeking compromise; they come demanding capitulation. They do not hunger for peace; they crave silence—silence from Ukraine, silence from Europe, silence from every soul brave enough to raise a voice in opposition. Theirs is a war not for territory, but for the erasure of dissent itself.', 'To respond with anything less than unyielding resistance is to embrace self-destruction. There is no compromise between the inferno and existence—no delicate negotiation that can douse the flames of a regime now brazenly crafting a future forged in ash. The only choice left is to fight or to perish, for any hesitation will be the final surrender to a world consumed by its own destruction. And so, the choice stands before us, stark and unforgiving: Act now, or wait for the reckoning. Hold the line, or be swept away when the storm breaks. Because fate is merciless to those who thought they could negotiate with the inevitable while lying prostrate on the slaughter bench of history.', 'Trump’s henchmen drape themselves in the language of peace, but their words are hollow, their intentions rotten. Among the ranks of Trump, Vance, and the ultra-right, there is no true pacifism—only a masquerade, a cynical performance designed to disarm resistance while they clear the path for tyranny. They speak of diplomacy as they embrace the actions of dictators like Viktor Orban or Jair Bolsonaro; they speak of restraint as they excuse atrocity.', 'These are not the pacifists they feign to be, nor the neutral observers they claim to be. They are captives of a cult, their minds shackled to a machinery of grievance, their strength drawn not from principle but from the raw, unfiltered rage of their followers. They do not lead—they feed, gnawing hungrily at the decayed carcass of hate, their power sustained by the endless cycle of resentment and fear. Groomed for demagoguery, they have abandoned reason for spectacle, conviction for cruelty. And as they feast on the rot of division, they demand the nation do the same, dragging democracy to the table of its own destruction. They parrot Russian deceit not from conviction, but from fealty to a darker, more insidious cause, chained by the arrogance of a play ground bully. Their hands are drenched in ill-gotten wealth, earned not through merit, but through the betrayal of Ukraine and its European allies.', 'Their egos are fattened on the spoils of allegiance, well-compensated by the mob that fuels them with unwavering obedience. They drape themselves in the hollow pretense of peace, a threadbare disguise meant to mask their servitude. But their silence is not neutrality—it is complicity. With eyes wide open, they choose to look away, willfully blind to the Kremlin’s relentless war machine as it grinds forward, leaving smoldering cities and shattered lives in its wake. They are not peacemakers. They are enablers, their voices raised only to defend their own petulance. They echo Russian lies not out of belief, but out of loyalty to a darker cause, tethered by the arrogance of a school yard bully, their hands stained with unearned riches from those whom they betrayed.', 'And yet, they demand to be taken seriously, these merchants of cowardice. They insist that capitulation is wisdom, that abandoning Ukraine is prudence, that kneeling before Putin is the only path to stability. History knows their kind all too well. They are the collaborators, the appeasers, the isolationists who, in another time, would have watched Europe burn as the SS-Panzergrenadier divisions rolled in, with the Einsatzgruppen following, slaughtering every Jew and gypsy in their wake. These are the ones who, in every age, claim neutrality while turning a blind eye to the bloodshed, complicit in the darkest chapters of history, willing to stand aside as civilization crumbles beneath the weight of tyranny.', 'But they will not have the final word. Because the world has seen this deception before. And this time, there will be no illusions, no polite indulgence of their treachery. The stakes are clear. The battle lines are drawn. And the agents of an ersatz peace will be remembered for what they are: foot soldiers of fascism, betrayers of democracy, and cowards unworthy of the nation they claim to serve.', 'We need to remember what Putin said as he addressed the World Russian People’s Council. Putin proclaimed that Ukrainians and Belarusians are not independent but are, in fact, part of the ‘great Russian nation.’ According to Putin, an admirer of Stalin, these two nations have been artificially divided from Russia by the ‘separatist illusions’ of the 1991 Soviet collapse. Of course, Stalin’s famous predecessor had a very different view of what constitutes a nation as noted by Slavoj Žižek. Lenin stated his principles as follows:', 'The proletariat cannot but fight against the forcible retention of the oppressed nations within the boundaries of a given state, and this is exactly what the struggle for the right of self-determination means. The proletariat must demand the right of political secession for the colonies and for the nations that ‘its own’ nation oppresses. Unless it does this, proletarian internationalism will remain a meaningless phrase; mutual confidence and class solidarity between the workers of the oppressing and oppressed nations will be impossible.', 'In today’s blood-soaked geopolitical theatre, Vladimir Putin’s denial of Ukraine’s right to exist echoes like a discordant symphony, a dissonance carried by the sound of jackboots marching across the international stage, plagued by the gravity of history’s impending judgement on their actions. The denial of Ukraine’s right to exist is a narrative akin to denying a river its right to flow, an attempt to redirect the currents of history that have shaped Ukraine’s identity over centuries. Putin’s words resonate not just as a denial of political sovereignty but as an assault on the very essence of a people’s right to chart their own destiny. Anti-fascists recognize this pattern all too well. So do those whose relatives were victims of the Holodomor.', 'The metaphorical landscape painted by Putin’s denial is of a reality refracted by vainglorious schemes populated by a malice that grows more intense the longer Putin is denied his ignoble victory, where borders become mere illusions, and national identity is relegated to the whims of a taciturn autocrat in cognitive decline. It is akin to denying the sun its right to rise, an attempt to cast Ukraine into the shadows of obscurity.', 'In the face of Putin’s denial of Ukrainian nationhood, Ukraine stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of a people who refuse to be erased from the map of nations. As Tupac Shakur might put it, Ukraine is like a rose breaking through concrete. Its existence defies the authoritarian gusts that seek to extinguish its flame. In the grand theatre of nations, Putin’s denial of Ukrainian sovereignty may echo only temporarily, but the indomitable spirit of Ukraine persists as a powerful counterpoint, a reminder that the right to exist in a sovereign nation is an inalienable birthright, not subject to the capricious winds of geopolitical maneuvering. If a nation seeks to break free from Russia’s suffocating grip, it must not be forced to crawl, shackled in submission, and lick the boots of its oppressor. Freedom is not won through appeasement, nor is sovereignty preserved through servitude.', 'To demand that Ukraine bow before Putin is to demand that the prisoner kiss the chains that bind them, that the battered kneel before the fist that strikes them. This is not diplomacy—it is degradation. And those who advocate for such surrender do not seek peace; they seek subjugation, delivered gift-wrapped to the Kremlin.', 'Tupac Shakur’s poem about the rose breaking through concrete resonates with the indomitable spirit that characterizes Ukraine’s journey. The rose breaking through concrete is a potent metaphor for Ukraine’s ability to endure, adapt, and emerge stronger despite the formidable obstacles in its path. The story of Ukraine becomes a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges.', 'The story is not yet over. Ukraine stands to be tested amid flagging support from its allies.', 'In the ongoing conflict, we find ourselves engaged not only in a battle against Russian imperialist aggression but also in steadfast resistance to the encroachment of Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regime. Presently, those aligned with the left ardently champion Ukrainian democracy, acknowledging its limitations and imperfections.', 'The imperative to stand with Ukraine endures, fueled by a profound recognition that this conflict is emblematic of a larger, global endeavor to foster unity among the disenfranchised and to challenge the hegemony of oppressive systems. It is a call to action resonating with the timeless principles of justice, equality, and the unwavering commitment to safeguarding the rights and aspirations of all those who strive for a more just and equitable world. Just as the left consistently supported earlier struggles for colonial liberation, it should align with the current liberation movement in Ukraine.', 'Here history can be ‘understood as a source of imaginative power’ as remembering invites us to remember in different ways so as to comprehend our social and political situatedness, and in this sense, remembering bears an affinity to Walter Benjamin’s concept of “redemptive history”. His idea echoes the hard-won wisdom of history—that those who fail to remember the past, or willfully ignore its lessons, are condemned to repeat its darkest chapters. But it goes further. It aligns with Paulo Freire’s notion of conscientização—the awakening of critical consciousness, the ability to see through the illusions of power, to recognize oppression not as fate but as a construct, designed and sustained by those who benefit from it.', 'To forget history is to sleepwalk into catastrophe. To awaken—to truly see—is to resist. And in this moment, when the ghosts of past tyrannies stir once more, the choice is clear: reclaim history as a weapon of truth, or become its next cautionary tale.', 'Walter Adamson, following Benjamin, insists that in the present era, remembering must take the form of a radical disruption – a blasting – that is strong enough to break through unconscious repression. This invites remembering to summon forth a hope that can ‘arouse dormant emancipatory energies.’', 'History, then, is not simply a ledger of past events, a repository of dates and deeds to be recalled or forgotten at will. It is a force—unruly, insurgent, and alive. To remember, in this sense, is not a passive act but an intervention, an act of defiance against the forces that seek to erase, distort, or bury the past beneath the weight of convenience and control.', 'Benjamin’s redemptive history rejects the stale adage that warns against repetition, for it recognizes that history does not merely repeat—it is reconstituted, reimagined, and weaponized by those who claim dominion over memory. Against this, remembering must be more than a quiet reflection; it must be a rupture, a disruption that blasts through the fog of repression. It must be an active, unsettling force that unsettles power itself.', 'Freire’s conscientização insists that memory cannot simply linger in the realm of the abstract. It must radicalize. It must unearth the silences imposed by domination. Hannah Arendt reminds us that to remember is to mediate, to bridge the raw force of experience with the discipline of thought. To truly remember, then, is to awaken—to call forth hope not as sentiment but as struggle, to arouse the energies of resistance that lie dormant beneath the surface of the present.', 'This is the memory that terrifies authoritarians. It is the memory that refuses amnesia, that resurrects the unfinished fights of the past and refuses to close the book on justice. It is the memory that does not comfort—it agitates, it demands, it summons us to battle. And in an age where fascists seek to rewrite history in their own image, there is no act more revolutionary than to remember truthfully, radically, and without apology.', 'At this crucial historical juncture, it is imperative that we focus on the power of memory, counter-memory, and redemptive remembrance in the face of imperial violence, historical erasure, and the ongoing brutality of war. We need to understand how historical agency is not simply about recollection but about transformation—about reclaiming the narratives and emancipatory possibilities that have been suppressed, distorted, or co-opted.', 'Here, counter-memory as a force that disrupts hegemonic histories resonates deeply, especially in the context of Ukraine, where the stakes of historical interpretation are not merely academic but existential. The struggle against the war-making machine is also a struggle against the coloniality of knowledge—the epistemic violence that justifies and sustains imperial aggression. Putin’s war is not only an assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty but an assault on memory itself, a violent rewriting of history in service of domination.', 'Henry Giroux calls on us to become critical intellectuals—not passive observers, not neutral arbiters, but engaged thinkers with the courage to name, resist, and dismantle the asymmetrical structures of power and privilege that sustain authoritarian narratives. This is not an abstract task; it is a moral and political necessity. To name is to strip deception of its disguise. To resist is to refuse complicity. To transform is to insist that history is not predetermined but shaped by those who dare to imagine something beyond the suffocating grip of repression.', 'In an era where truth is under siege, where power seeks to render us mute, critical thought is not merely an academic exercise—it is an act of survival, a weapon against the creeping normalcy of authoritarianism.', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Munich not as a supplicant, but as a leader fighting for the survival of his nation. In his meeting with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, he did not seek empty assurances—he demanded security guarantees,a bulwark against the looming threat of abandonment as Washington accelerates its push for a deal with Moscow.', 'For Kyiv, the stakes could not be higher. The war, now in its third year, has already exacted an unbearable toll. But what is unfolding now is not just a battlefield struggle—it is a high-stakes political maneuver where Ukraine risks being sidelined by an administration eager to declare an end to a war that has not yet ended.', 'President Donald Trump’s stunning announcement this week—his intention to meet Vladimir Putin for truce negotiations—sent shockwaves through NATO and beyond It was not merely a policy shift; it was an earthquake, rattling decades of American commitments to European security. For Ukraine, the message was chilling: the rules of engagement are changing, and the fight for sovereignty may soon be waged not just on the frontlines, but in backroom deals where Kyiv’s future could be bartered away.', 'Here, dialogue is not a luxury—it is a matter of life and death. It is not an intellectual exercise but an ethical imperative, a moral line drawn before the shells fall, before the massacres begin. Dialogue, in its truest form, resists the cold detachment of abstraction, the comfortable reduction of suffering to mere statistics of who lost the most tanks or armored personnel vehicles this week, the war rebranded as a geopolitical puzzle rather than a brutal campaign of destruction.', 'To bear witness is to reject this erasure. It is to look into the eyes of those under siege, to hear their voices rise above the deafening roar of propaganda and political expediency. But how can this happen if Ukraine is not even at the bargaining table? How can a just peace be forged when the victim of an unprovoked war is forced to accept terms dictated by its aggressor?', 'It is Ukraine, and Ukraine alone, that must define the terms of peace. The nation that was invaded, bombed, and brutalized cannot be asked to kneel before a man who dreams himself a Czar, whose ambitions are stained with the blood of the innocent. To listen—truly listen—is not an act of passivity. It is an act of solidarity. And to refuse to look away, to refuse to accept the betrayal of a people fighting for their right to exist, is a justified act of defiance.', 'In this sense, our work is not just about dissecting the present; it is about claiming the future—a future that will not be dictated by the master narratives of a former KGB agent who dreams of empire or the mob boss prototype who now occupies the Oval Office.', 'This is not just a struggle over borders, but over truth itself. It is a battle against the slow erosion of democratic will, against the manufactured cynicism that turns war crimes into footnotes and autocracy into inevitability. The world stands at a precipice, and history will not be kind to those who look away, who choose complicity wrapped in the language of diplomacy.', 'The future must belong to those who refuse to bow to tyranny, who refuse to let the ideals of democracy be rewritten by a dictator’s pen or a conman’s deal-making. To surrender to this moment is to surrender everything. To resist is the only path forward.', 'We seek a future that refuses to be shackled to the cynical fatalism of those who profit from war and suffering. A future that insists—against all odds—on the redemptive power of justice, dignity, and liberation.', 'Bring Steve Schmidt to the negotiations. Let him sit across from those who speak in the hollow language of appeasement, those who twist “peace” into a euphemism for surrender. He will not be seduced by the diplomatic theater, by the polite fictions that mask betrayal. He will call it what it is.', 'Schmidt will not suffer the fools who would barter away Ukraine’s sovereignty for the illusion of stability. He will not entertain the craven arguments of those who mistake cowardice for pragmatism. He knows exactly what is at stake—not just Ukraine’s future, but the integrity of every nation that claims to stand for democracy, for self-determination, for the rule of law.', 'If the world is serious about justice, let Schmidt be in the room. Let him confront those who would hand Kyiv a poisoned chalice. Let him speak the truth that too many are too afraid—or too compromised—to say.', ""And while we're at it, bring in Jake Broe. A former U.S. Air Force Nuclear and Missile Operations Officer, he understands the stakes not just as an analyst, but as someone who has spent his life studying the mechanics of power—the kind measured in megatons and strategic deterrence. His podcast has been one of the most important sources of clear-eyed analysis on Ukraine since the first Russian tanks crossed the border. He doesn’t deal in illusions. He doesn’t sanitize war with euphemisms. He speaks the language of hard realities, of logistics, of strategy, of what it truly takes to win—not just on the battlefield, but in the long war against authoritarian aggression."", 'Let him sit at the table, not as a politician eager to cut a deal, but as a voice of unflinching clarity. He knows what happens when deterrence fails. He knows that a handshake with Putin is not a peace deal—it’s an invitation for the next war. Let him say, without hesitation, what too many in Washington and Brussels still struggle to admit: Ukraine does not need lectures on restraint. It needs weapons, support, and the absolute certainty that it will not be abandoned to the whims of a dictator and the indifference of fools.', ""The opinions expressed here are solely the author's and do not reflect the opinions or beliefs of the LA Progressive."", 'Peter McLaren is Emeritus Professor at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California, Los Angeles.

America loses with Trump’s disgraceful betrayal of Ukraine | Editorial,https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/editorials/ukraine-trump-russia-betrayal-national-security-putin-20250223.html,"['Abandoning Ukraine will shatter U.S. standing in the world, and embolden Russia and other adversaries, which could lead to more costly and destabilizing wars.', 'In 1988, President Ronald Reagan offered a simple strategy to defeat the Soviet Union during the Cold War: “We win, they lose.” Reagan’s toughness helped topple the Russian-controlled communist federation, briefly leading to economic and political freedom.', 'Nearly four decades later, President Donald Trump appears poised to sell out Ukraine by negotiating a lopsided peace three years after Russia invaded its neighbor. In doing so, Trump is about to let Moscow win, and Kyiv lose.', 'But the biggest loser will be America.', 'Trump’s appeasement of Russia — and his cozying up to its murderous dictator, Vladimir Putin — stands to upend 80 years of U.S.-led international order that has helped to maintain peace and prosperity in Europe since the end of World War II.', 'Abandoning Ukraine will embolden the Kremlin and other adversaries, including China, which could lead to more costly and destabilizing wars. In the run-up, Trump has betrayed our European allies, leaving America distrusted and alone, and the world less safe.', 'To be sure, former President Joe Biden and many in Congress botched aid efforts by not supplying the arms Kyiv needed to turn back Russia. Those who argue America should not have spent the $175 billion (not $350 billion, as Trump falsely claims) to support Ukraine fail to understand that the strategic and moral cost of that kind of parsimony will be much higher.', 'If anything, the bill for the senseless war should go to Russia — yet Trump is about to let Putin off the hook, even though he is responsible for widespread death and destruction.', 'This is what Putin has wrought: An estimated 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers and 12,000 civilians have been killed, including 2,400 children. Another 370,000 people have been injured. (Russia’s casualties are approaching 300,000.)', 'Roughly 3.6 million Ukrainians have been displaced and face severe hardship from a lack of food, heat, sanitation, and water. Millions more have fled the country as its population has declined by 25%.', 'Cities have been destroyed, including thousands of schools and hospitals. The estimated reconstruction cost stands at almost $500 billion — 2.8 times higher than Ukraine’s nominal gross domestic product in 2023.', 'Yet, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, untested and just a few weeks on the job, met with top Russian and Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. The talks devolved into a discussion of profiteering as the photo of the U.S., Russian, and Saudi leaders around a conference table resembled the meeting of Mafia dons in The Godfather.', 'Trump’s legitimizing Russia with a seat at the peace table after it committed heinous war crimes is disgraceful. That Ukraine was absent from the talks even though Russia invaded its sovereign country is a travesty.', 'As Rubio and Russian officials discussed how to carve up Ukraine, the world was left with a repulsive display of imperial colonialism.', 'Rather than stand up to Putin, Trump’s alignment with Moscow makes him look like a rogue statesman.', 'The president even parroted Putin’s claims that Ukraine is to blame for the war.', '“You should have never started it,” Trump whined.', 'That is an embarrassing and ridiculous lie, like the thousands of other lies Trump told during his previous term in the White House.', 'Trump then took to social media to spread more lies, falsely claiming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was an unpopular dictator who blocked elections.

By comparison, America is stuck with a cowardly, twice-impeached, draft-evading, tax-dodging, sexually abusing, convicted criminal who is trampling the Constitution, the rule of law, and quickly turning the country into a tin-pot dictatorship.', 'Trump’s repeated kowtowing to Putin alarmed allies and weakened the United States. Once again, Trump has made America a laughingstock.', 'Surprisingly, Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.) showed some courage when he described Trump’s friend, Putin, as “a gangster” who “makes Jeffrey Dahmer look like Mother Teresa.”', 'But most Republican officials have remained shamefully silent as Trump undermines American democracy and looks more like a Russian asset.', 'This is not a time for other government, business, and higher education leaders to go wobbly. Those who continue to go along to get along are acting just as the so-called good Germans did during the Nazi regime.', 'Our democracy is in a perilous place, and it is getting more precarious by the day.

International Reaction? They Are Disturbed and Disappointed,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/2/18/2304545/-International-Reaction-They-Are-Disturbed-and-Disappointed,"['International reporting is revealing that our friends abroad are deeply disappointed and disturbed by American apathy towards what they see as dangerous circumstances. They have seen this before. Here’s one poignant take from international news publication…', 'The Democratic World Will Have To Get Along Without America. It may even have to defend itself from it.\n~ Andrew Coyne, The Globe and Mail, February 14, 2025', 'I wonder if we have underestimated the gravity of the situation the democratic world faces.', 'Even now, as the United States hurtles toward autocracy – the petty grotesqueries perhaps tell the story better than anything else: a reporter barred from the White House for not using the name “Gulf of America,” President Donald Trump naming himself chair of the Kennedy Center by a “unanimous” vote of its board – the tendency is still to describe events in relatively conventional terms. For example, the “mistakes” that Mr. Trump is said to have made in his dealings with Vladimir Putin, of the United States as an “unreliable ally” under Mr. Trump, and so forth.', 'But that is not the situation we are now in. The policies on Ukraine announced, or rather confirmed this week by Mr. Trump and his Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth – peace talks without Ukraine; Ukraine locked out of NATO membership indefinitely; Russia keeps all territories gained since its illegal and unprovoked invasion, because, as Mr. Trump said, “they lost a lot of soldiers” taking them – are not, as described, irresponsible concessions to Russia.', 'They are not concessions at all. They are demands, aimed not at Russia but at Ukraine, and presented to it jointly by the United States of Russia and America. They are of a piece with the Trump administration’s very clear signalling that it will not be bound by Article 5 of the NATO treaty – that the United States will not, as promised, come to Europe’s defence should Russia broaden its attacks on it, but will, as Mr. Trump so memorably put it, let them do “whatever the hell they want.”', 'That is not merely an abrogation of its treaty commitments, or an abdication of America’s historic responsibilities, or even a declaration that the way is now open for other hostile powers to launch attacks on democratic states. The United States, under Mr. Trump, cannot be considered an idle bystander in the great twilight struggle between the democracies and the dictatorships, as it was in the 1930s. It is now on the side of the dictatorships.', 'The United States that openly threatens to invade Panama or Denmark – or to annex Canada – has not just stepped outside international law, including the basic Westphalian proscription of attempts to alter borders by force. Neither does a country that launches trade wars on a different country every day, including countries with which it has longstanding free trade treaties, reveal a simple lack of commitment to a rules-based approach to international trade. It is engaged in an all-out assault on both. It has become an outlaw state.', 'And in this regard, too, it is aligning itself with the dictatorships. That is what dictatorships do. It is intrinsic to their nature. Just as they refuse to be bound by law internally – we are counting down the days to when the Trump administration defies its first court order – so they recognize no law in their dealings with other states. (Or rules of any kind: you’ll have noticed they also cheat at sports. As does Mr. Trump.)', 'It is not just that the democratic world can no longer count on America. It is that America, under Mr. Trump, is no longer necessarily part of the democratic world: neither fully democratic in its own affairs, nor committed to the welfare of other democracies, but hostile to both. If the international order is to be preserved, then, it will have to be preserved, in part, from the United States. Certainly it will have to be rebuilt without it.', 'Which means abandoning all attempts to propitiate Mr. Trump on military matters, in hopes of “keeping NATO together,” that is with the United States in it. Not only will that do nothing to strengthen NATO, an organization to which Mr. Trump is viscerally opposed, but our desire to strike a deal only invites him to use it against us, as an instrument of blackmail.', 'We need to face some unpleasant facts. NATO, as a transatlantic democratic alliance, is dead. Henceforth the defence of Europe will be the responsibility of Europe. (And the defence of Canada? Wedged as we are between the United States and Russia, with the North an increasingly tempting prize? We better get some allies, fast.)', 'The same applies to the World Trade Organization, or any of the other instruments of international co-operation developed after the Second World War, in which the United States played such a constructive part: they will have to be reconstituted, de jure or de facto, without it. We will need new defence alignments, different trade arrangements, the works.', 'That is not our choice. That is America’s, or at least the Trump administration’s. The democratic world must therefore regard and treat it as it does the other non-democracies: not as an ally to be consulted but as an adversary to be contained.\n-Andrew Coyne', '', 'Unfortunately...

The reality we live in is one where our neighbors would not only turn us in, but would actively participate in our humiliation and death.

', 'Some of the “regular Republican” co-workers I talk to who don’t admit to voting for Trump (but I suspect they do) seem pretty ok with everything going on. So when the pain gets cranked up and some of us go protest or push back in other ways, I fully expect this crowd to pile on us. This is about to hit the neighbor against neighbor point in the coming months. ', 'As a Brit I am starting to wonder if it is time for a new democratic order in the world.  A replacement/rival to the UN, membership of which is restricted just to countries whose governments meet a minimum standard of democratic validity (probably excluding the US). Associated trade and aid bodies that replace the UNHCR, Unicef and WTO.  Ultimately this could be the framework for trade agreements between those democratic countries, eclipsing current systems (the EU possibly included, given the Trumpian drift of several countries that are members).  If necessary freeze the US out altogether.  100% tariffs across the board.', ""It doesn't feel like the US is just temporarily outside the democratic tent.  It feels like the US can never again be trusted — as currently constituted — not to actively piss into that tent.  There is probably just enough power and wealth in the remainder of the democratic world (certainly if you include India — although that country constantly teeters on the edge) to hold the line against authoritarianism even with the US on the other side."", 'Worldwide, many countries have gone full authoritarian or some form of it. Anything Democratic is immediately at merci of Russia and Musk for disinformation before elections so that their candidates win. Look at Niger, Mali and Burkina , Rwanda, CAR, ... El Salvador is another example. ', 'The USA chosing to meet in Saudi Arabia, which is not a democracy to discuss a topic related to democracy.

Dems can win an election or two, but the same idiot electorate that voted Trump in twice is still around and being idiots. ', 'The point is that the American people are unreliable and no longer committed to democracy. So the government is a reflection of that situation. ', 'Europe, in an economic and security sense, needs to move on. Britain and France are nuclear powers and provide a healthy security umbrella for the rest of the continent. The Scandinavian countries, Poland, the Baltics, Britain and Denmark are serious about the security situation. France and Germany less so, but persuadable. Either way, Europe can defend itself, but EU nations need to adjust their social welfare situation to pay more for defense. That sucks but can be done and probably in ways that preserve the social safety nets that they value. ', 'And to not reward American betrayal, Europe also needs to re-evaluate American access to basing privileges on the continent. Play the bully, confrontation game with Trump some. Push him around and ruffle his feathers. Show him that he isn’t “boss”. In fact, the EU should tell Donald Trump that he’s fired. Let him suck on that for a change. ', 'Sadly, Alex Garland’s “Civil War” movie is starting to look less implausible.', 'What is beginning to creep into my consciousness is not only that the US is an unreliable ally, but that the White House loonies may actually provide the US military might to Putin.  Unthinkable to involve us in the wrong side of the invasion of Ukraine and possibly Lithuania or Poland?  I certainly hope so.  But something about Zelenskyi’s speech in Munich started me thinking.  Getting USA involved in a war during the buffoon’s first term is what kept me up at night and is certainly going to do the same now.', 'To believe Trump’s “Russia, Russia, Russia “ is all a hoax  not only do you have to disregard the alleged PEE PEE tapes , Trump’s undermining the NATO alliance,  talking to the Russian aggressor while leaving Ukraine out to dry , the records -free Helsinki meeting ,a raft of Russia connections including  Manafort, Flynn, Papadopoulos, Pinedo ,Gates ,Kilimnik and Erik Prince’s  chance encounter in the Seychelles with Dmitriev  definitely not to set up a Kremlin backchannel   but also his Uriah Heep subservance to Putin. Well if you can believe that,  then I have a bridge you might like to buy.', 'That’s what he did in Afghanistan as well, negotiated with the Taliban and left the Afghan government out the talks. Abandoned Afghanistan to the Taliban.', 'Even if our country were to survive Trump, our reputation will not. No-one will ever trust us again, even if we restored sane leadership. They would all believe (correctly) it would only be temporary. ', 'We are not even one full month into his term and the damage is immense.  At this rate the country will be an unrecognizable and irreparable cacotopia by the time the midterm elections are supposed to take place in 2026 (iffy that they will even happen).', 'Bless you, Andrew Coyne.  The World Trade Organization and the United Nations should relocate to Europe somewhere.  And Canadians should well be concerned about being the meat in the sandwich between US and Russia, both of whom want us for various reasons.', 'Canada should invite British troops and air assets over to base in Canada on a rotating basis to let Amerika know that Canada has friends in the world. Have some British naval exercises off Canada and do the port call thing for show. Do a joint British, French, Canadian naval exercise with British and French aircraft carriers operating off the coast of Canada and down the coast of Maine and finish up off shore near NYC. Bullies understand strength and moxie. ', 'Excellent suggestions!!', 'The German election is this Sunday.

On Feb. 18, Donald Trump repeated the Putin lie that Ukraine began the war with Russia, akin to blaming a rape victim for the rape. Trump is trying to extort more than $500 billion in minerals from Ukraine, and with no security guarantees from the U.S., Zelenskyy refused.', 'Trump has never criticized Putin. Why?

The United States, long the guarantor of the post-World War II liberal international order, has become an unreliable and even a potentially dangerous partner. For their own survival and prosperity, America's traditional allies must begin the difficult but necessary process of decoupling from U.S. global leadership."", ""The latest demands from Washington to its allies read like a protection racket rather than diplomacy between friends. Denmark continues to face pressure to sell Greenland to the U.S., a sovereign territory whose residents overwhelmingly do not want to be under America's thumb. Mexico and Canada, our only two neighbors, have endured repeated threats of punitive tariffs that they have only delayed thus far by agreeing to what were largely symbolic concessions that will do little to actually stem the supply of illegal immigrants or drugs into our nation. Most egregiously, Ukraine, while fighting for its very existence, was just asked to surrender half its mineral wealth to the U.S. in exchange for continued military support against Russian aggression."", 'These are not the actions of a responsible superpower, but rather the impulsive demands of a declining hegemon that has lost its way. Our allies must recognize this moment for what it is. Namely, they must come to terms with the fact that we are at the end of the American-led global order that was built in the wake of the Second World War. America can no longer be trusted to responsibly manage the international international system it was principally responsible for creating.', ""To be clear, this is about more than just President Donald Trump; it's about who Americans have shown themselves to be as a people. Our nation's electorate has demonstrated a repeated willingness to embrace a leader who views international relationships through the lens of extractive transactions rather than mutual benefit. Hence, our allies cannot simply wait this out in the hope that the next administration will be be a return to normal."", 'The path forward for allies is clear, if uncomfortable. Militarily, European nations must dramatically increase their spending and accelerate their defense integration in order to establish credible deterrence independent of American guarantees. This is precisely why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently called for a European army, as he recognizes that they ""can\'t rule out that America might say \'no\' to Europe on issues that might threaten it."" Similarly, Asian allies like Japan and South Korea must build new security frameworks that don\'t rely on increasingly unreliable U.S. commitments.', 'This necessity for military independence explicitly extends to the need to no longer expect cover from the American nuclear umbrella. Our allies must endeavor on a quest of nuclear proliferation, particularly for the likes of Japan as it faces the reality that it will likely need to contend with China on its own. In Europe, the nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom will need to be expanded, as should their investments in means that ensure a second-strike capability.', ""So too must the economic partnerships of our allies be diversified. Doing so will reduce their vulnerability to America's ability to exert economic coercion. Moreover, with its commitment to fiscal profligacy not looking to abate any time soon, the world would do well to abandon ship now before an inevitable reckoning comes due. The most critical step for our allies here is the abandonment of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. To effectuate this, their central banks must begin to dramatically reduce their dollar holdings, shifting reserves to a basket of alternative currencies, while developing new multilateral payment systems that don't depend on American-controlled financial infrastructure."", ""The sooner our allies accept that America can no longer be trusted with global leadership, the better prepared they'll be for the turbulent times ahead. While decoupling from U.S. leadership will be painful in the short-term, remaining tethered to an increasingly unstable and predatory superpower poses far greater dangers.

It is almost as if each U.S. presidency needs to practice betrayal as a form of statecraft. The examples of men and women who counted on our support are many. George H.W. Bush with the Kurds. Barack Obama with the Syrians. Donald Trump and Joe Biden with the Afghans. And now, Trump with the Ukrainians. America, the dependable ally, we are not.', 'I served as a U.S. intelligence officer in the field, often in dangerous conflict zones from Iraq to Syria to Afghanistan. I retired before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but as the Trump administration abandons this former American ally, PTSD is setting in for many of my ilk: the actual operational practitioners of U.S. foreign policy. We were “on the ground,” far from Congress and the Situation Room, far from think tanks and academic institutions. We were the first ones in, parachuted into conflicts with the implication that the proverbial cavalry would be on the way shortly.', 'This clear policy shift is nevertheless subtle enough that many Americans may not understand it.', 'My U.S. government colleagues and I were upfront and personal with our allies, whoever they were. At times, we were even in harm’s way, just like our allies. We lived side by side with them, broke bread with them, rejoiced in their successes and mourned their deaths. We made grand promises, offered platitudes and provided assistance — at least initially. Yet so often there is no fairy-tale ending, as time and time again politicians decided that the going had gotten too tough or that political expediency outweighed morality.', 'I once told a four-star U.S. Army general that I was lucky to work with the finest fighting force in eastern Afghanistan. He looked around puzzled, seeing no U.S. troops at the small front-line paramilitary base where we were standing. But I was singing the praises of the group of Afghan Indigenous fighters whom we were on the way to inspect. The general was not amused, yet no truer comment could ever have been said about the bravery of the Afghans. But years after the hasty U.S. withdrawal from their country, many of those who helped fight the Taliban are still on the run. Tens of thousands of interpreters, engineers and other noncombatant allies have been left behind to face starvation, poverty and retribution.', 'Many of us, however, thought Ukraine would really be different. This was a classic story of right versus wrong, of “David vs. Goliath,” and the U.S. did come to Ukraine’s aid once Russian forces were on the move. Since then, Ukraine has exacted hundreds of thousands of casualties on the Russian invaders. Behind the scenes, the U.S. has reportedly provided critical military and intelligence assistance — without a drop of U.S. blood shed.', 'Did the U.S. do enough? No. Biden’s fear of possible escalation with Russia squandered too many opportunities, to the immense frustration of Ukraine, its soldiers and its supporters. But $60 billion in aid is not small potatoes. The Ukrainians fight valiantly and bravely, proving time and again that they would never be defeated. With the backing of the world’s greatest superpower, anything was possible.', 'Yet now, the Trump administration appears eager to walk away from Ukraine. Details of exactly how remain murky. The president and those around him are not talking with one voice. Trump says one thing one day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth another, Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Keith Kellogg something else the next. Yet one thing appears abundantly clear: The U.S. is not an ally of Ukraine any longer. At best, America is now a neutral party, and at worst complicit in its demise.', 'Our adversaries even now must be celebrating; there are surely open vodka bottles in the Kremlin.', 'This clear policy shift is nevertheless subtle enough that many Americans may not understand it. But for Ukrainians, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in particular, there is no doubt about the United States’ intentions. At the Munich Security Conference last week, Zelenskyy repeatedly pleaded that Ukraine needs the U.S. to support it against Russia, not to mediate between the two. Not only was Trump unpersuaded, he blamed Ukraine for starting the war — an allegation that is of course patently false.', 'Trust is so hard to gain, and yet so easily lost. And though some of the Trump team’s errors — such as Hegseth’s statement that Ukraine would never join NATO — were walked back, the damage is already done. Each concession to Russia gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a victory even before negotiations begin. One former U.S. senior intelligence officer told me that Ukraine, even in the best-case scenario, will look now at the U.S. from the vantage of a spouse scorned by infidelity.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'I have spoken with numerous retired U.S. national security practitioners who have worked globally countering Russian aggression, including those who spent the last decade in and out of Ukraine, asking them what the recent U.S. policy change personally meant to them. Often there is a long silence. Then a sigh. A former intelligence officer said his thoughts immediately went to the scores of Ukrainians with whom he worked — their incredible sense of resolve and will to fight. Some have recently visited Ukraine to make contact with old friends. It was difficult for them to look old Ukrainian partners in the eye as the U.S. shifts from ally to neutral player, or maybe worse.', 'My former colleagues’ thoughts shifted to the future as well. Many stated that this betrayal was the big one: epic in its scope, with far-reaching consequences for the next fight, likely with China. The fallout will be even worse than the Afghans left to fend for themselves. It will now be impossible for anyone to trust the U.S. as an ally. Our adversaries even now must be celebrating; there are surely open vodka bottles in the Kremlin.', 'Is this what Trump wants as his legacy? Does “America First” really mean “America the Betrayer”? Or will this White House come to its senses, stop pushing for an unjust peace deal and actually allow Ukrainians agency in their future?', 'Marc Polymeropoulos is a national security and intelligence contributor for MSNBC and a former CIA senior intelligence service officer who served 26 years in a variety of operational and management positions focusing on the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and counterterrorism.

Zelensky is not a dictator. No country fighting an all-out invasion could hold elections in the middle of it. Zelensky did not start the war. Putin did.', 'Trump must know this, so one’s disgust deepens. By speaking as he did, he was not merely insulting Zelensky personally; he was disrespecting the suffering of a whole people to whom America pledged support. He was in a rage because the Ukrainian president had complained that Trump was “surrounded by disinformation”. But Zelensky was right: the Trump lines are Putin lines, as whispered by people like Tucker Carlson.', 'The Putin lines have one purpose – the Russian defeat of Ukraine. So naturally one asks, is that what Trump wants? We do not know for certain, but so far, he has made concessions to Putin – keeping Ukraine out of Nato, out of the preliminary talks, and without hope of regaining the borders that Russia and the West conferred on it 30 years ago – and has demanded nothing in return.', 'This is defeatism, or worse. In an intemperate tweet (“moralistic garbage”) on Thursday attacking the historian Sir Niall Ferguson, vice-president Vance spoke of “the reality on the ground”, as if Russia were all-conquering and nothing could be done about it.', 'Actually, despite vastly outnumbering Ukrainians, the Russians have won astonishingly little since they invaded three years ago. They have lost perhaps 150,000 dead, roughly 10 times more than in any other conflict since 1945, for no definite gain.', 'Vance underrates what can be done with allies. The United States and Western Europe can outmatch Russia, if they want to. He and Trump are right about the weakness of Europe and of America under Joe Biden. What is it about Putin that makes Trump want to weaken the West still further?', 'Trump speaks in clear English, but he is followed around by sympathetic “translators” who explain he must not be taken “literally” and that what he “really” meant was something else.', 'One should not discount this. It is certainly a Trump characteristic – possibly a tactic – to ignore his previous words when convenient. Since Trump has risen to power chiefly because of his unique communicative gifts, we all need to understand what it is he is, underneath, communicating.', 'Something in there is good, in a very American way. It is an intrinsic optimism about what the American people can do. In the Obama era – returning, much worse, under Biden/Harris – a great gloom set in. Government was super-sized, over-mighty yet ineffective.', 'In academia, Hollywood and much of the media, the rewards went to people who denigrated American history and culture.', 'Extreme ethnic and LGBT groups were lionised, and institutionalised by DEI. Their critics were persecuted. Partly because of uncontrolled migration, crime rose and whole cities decayed. Industry and wealth creation were attacked by net zero doctrines. ', 'The resurgent Trump proudly declared that Americans, less governed, would be better than that. Most Americans voting agreed. Hence the burst of energy since he won and the global internet-based ripple effect which is emboldening people to confront cultural self-hatred, wealth-destroying ecomania, vast immigration and semi-Islamisation.', 'When vice-president Vance used the Munich security conference to tell European countries they were not doing enough as military allies and that some of their domestic policies – such as migration and censorship – “offend the sensibilities of most Americans”, he was right. But his tone missed something. The wind is blowing his way, and European electorates are responding. How much more effective it would have been to infect our continent’s people with American optimism than just to lecture its elites, richly though they deserve it.', 'Somewhere in what Trump communicates, clashing with his optimism, is a sourness – the expression of accumulated resentments, especially among white, male, not very rich people, that the world is against them, and therefore they want out of it. ', 'It is an understandable feeling, but weirdly pessimistic. It misses the global opportunity. You do not have to be American to want to share the Trumpian energy.', 'Nato would become a vital force if the European member states spent the sort of money the Trump administration keeps advocating. But in his approach to Ukraine, he is offering a flat contradiction – claiming the sole right to make peace, but then to get out, leaving others to look after the result. How could any European country want to follow him down that path? Trump is making life more difficult for his European sympathisers than his European foes. It won’t be long before the latter raise a clamour to get Britain back into the EU. After Trump’s criticism of Sir Keir Starmer yesterday, expect our prime minister to lead the charge.', 'President Trump seems to have a post-imperial mindset and is thinking of Europe, as the British thought of India in the 1940s, as one big headache for which the only cure is to scuttle, even if it causes partition. If so, he underrates his unique chance to effect change.', 'Take, for example, these semi-secret negotiations between the United States and Ukraine about the sharing of the latter’s mineral resources. Zelensky was bound to reject what was first proposed because it was expressed in such grasping, hostile form. How different would it be if the US, with the rest of Nato, were to step up its security guarantees for Ukraine. Then US business ambitions would be welcomed with open arms and America would have first pick of all Ukrainian mining, energy and military tech manufacture opportunities.', 'Remember that the Marshall Plan, which did so much for the recovery of Europe after the war, achieved even more for America. Remember that America led the successful economic and democratic recovery of Germany and Japan after 1945, to its great advantage. And remember that Nato itself, often derided, prevented a third world war, and created an environment of nuclear balance, free trade and broadly shared political values which dominated the global order.', 'Trumpians rail against globalisation. They are right that it has become an objectionable, antidemocratic, legalistic ideology, run for the benefit of those who take its salaries. But it does not follow that there should be no global order. One can be confident that it will be a better one if reconstructed by America and European Nato allies rather than infiltrated by China and Russia in the name of the “global majority”, as is happening now. Ronald Reagan, the greatest Republican president since the Second World War and the most American of Americans, could see this so clearly. If only Donald Trump would do the same for our even more insecure world today.', 'Some say an American retreat from Europe would free up the US to deal with areas that matter more to it, such as the Far East. I wonder.', 'If President Trump sees the continent of Europe as an incumbrance that can be safely dominated by the aggressive autocracy of Russia, why would he make better efforts in relation to China? His temptation would be to cut a deal with the world’s second biggest economy, giving up on the Pacific defence of Japan, South Korea and, once he has set up enough semi-conductor labs in Arizona, to leave Taiwan to the mercies of Beijing.', 'Nothing is yet settled, but Trump has said something very big and bad. He has approved Russia’s redrawing of the boundaries of Europe by force. That ricochets beyond one continent. He was born in 1946, Nato in 1949. He says he wants peace, and I believe him, but he risks outliving the organisation that has kept the peace for all of us.', '', '', '', '', '']"

Trashing America’s Good Name,https://www.aei.org/social-cultural-and-constitutional-studies/trashing-americas-good-name/,"['By Gary J. Schmitt', 'AEIdeas', 'February 20, 2025', 'Since taking office, President Trump and his team have conducted a frontal assault on existing policies and governance at home. But overturning America’s long-standing commitment to support our democratic allies and partners against dangerous and ambitious dictators is an even greater assault on the good name of the United States. It’s not making America great again; it’s making America small, petty, and amoral.', 'One can certainly make the case that, as a nation, we’ve not always stayed true to our principles in the conduct of our foreign policy and that, on more than one occasion, we’ve bungled how we’ve carried out those policies and fought our wars. But, all that said, ever since we’ve become a power to be reckoned with on the world stage, the major conflicts we have engaged in were done for the right reasons: ending the cruelty of Spanish rule in Cuba; stopping German aggression in World War I; ending the Nazi reign of terror in World War II; turning back a communist North Korea invasion during the Korean War; fighting a communist insurgency in allied South Vietnam; ejecting Saddam Hussein from Kuwait during the Gulf War; and taking down the Taliban, an al Qaeda-allied regime in Afghanistan. Even the Iraq War, while horrendously fought in its first three years, was nevertheless justified when Saddam Hussein refused to abide by UN resolutions and come clean on his WMD programs.', 'When democratic Israel has been attacked, the U.S. has provided arms and intelligence to help it defeat those attacks. We assisted the Brits in 1982 in retaking the Falklands after an invasion by Argentina’s military-led junta. We kept West Berlin free from Soviet control through a massive airlift of American supplies in 1948-49. We provided the funds to help build Europe after World War II and then created the security structure that allowed the democratic West to fend off the Soviet Union during the Cold War. And, until now, we’ve been the key to helping democratic Ukraine stave off an invasion from Putin’s Russia—an invasion aimed at nothing less than the elimination of Ukraine as a sovereign state. ', 'In short, the U.S. has a well-earned reputation for being the good guy on the world stage, who has used its power and prestige in support of basic norms and rights. Indeed, no other world power in history has behaved so magnanimously. ', 'But Trump seems to care not one whit about that legacy. He’s arbitrarily overturned existing trade agreements with democratic neighbors Mexico and Canada, the latter of which is a NATO ally. Who else but Trump could so rile Canadians—who famously are not prone to being agitated—to boo our national anthem at a recent U.S.-Canada hockey game? (The last time I heard about booing of a national anthem at a sporting event, it was by Hong Kongers before a soccer match, when the Chinese anthem was played in the wake of Beijing moving to kill the city’s political autonomy.) ', 'Trump has also threatened on bogus grounds to retake the Panama Canal from an openly friendly Panama, again, ignoring a treaty formally approved by the U.S. Senate. And he’s threatened to occupy Greenland, a territory of Denmark, one of America’s traditionally staunchest European allies. And he’s proposed imposing strangling tariffs on democratic and American-friendly Taiwan just because Taiwan dominates the manufacturing of semiconductors and appears to be an obstacle, he believes, to better ties with the communist-led People’s Republic of China.', 'Quite the record—but it could get much worse. Spouting lies about Ukraine (it started the war) and its president (Zelensky is a dictator, having only a 4% approval rating) that one would only expect to hear coming from the Kremlin’s mouthpieces, Trump may well be setting the stage for a betrayal of that country.  Ignoring the atrocities conducted by Putin’s troops and intelligence services and Putin’s own indictment as a war criminal, and beguiled by Putin’s offer for new trade ties, Trump’s possible reset of relations with the Kremlin could well go down as the blackest mark on American statecraft ever.', 'If Biden’s disastrous pull-out of Afghanistan in 2021 can be said to have given an inadvertent green light for Putin to invade Ukraine in 2022, just imagine what leaving Ukraine high and dry might produce.', 'America’s leadership in the world has always been a combination of its power and its credibility. And while in recent decades our power was far beyond what our adversaries could bring to the table, that is no longer the case. More than ever, we need to be seen as dependable and a reliable partner. Letting our good name go is not in our national interest.', '']"

A tiny minority of cultists have their warped worldview confronted by reality. How do they deal with it? They rationalise the unreasonable. They cherry-pick information to suit themselves. They deny the evidence of the data, and their senses.', 'In the second Trump era, the cultists are running the show, and it is the majority of people in Europe, including Ukraine, who are in denial. Perhaps doomsday hasn’t actually arrived. But if it hasn’t, it is for us, the supposedly rational ones, to prove it. At the moment, the signs point the other way. Maybe America is not now ruled by arrogant, vengeful, petty, patriarchal, racist imperialists. But where’s the evidence?', 'Like the United Nations and the World Health and Trade Organisations, Nato may continue to exist on paper, but if it still has any meaning, the onus is on the believers to prove it. Perhaps the United States would take action to defend Estonia or Poland if Russia attacked; but as things stand, there’s no reason to suppose it would, and multiple indications that it wouldn’t.', 'It may be that, generally, on any given day, the US government – if such a concept can be said to be real in any sense that its own people, let alone the rest of the world, can rely on – regards Russia as a threat, an adversary. But there is no proof that this is the case, and abundant evidence that the leader of the United States regards his Russian counterpart as a friend, a hero and a wronged man.', 'Perhaps Donald Trump has some sympathy for Ukraine’s suffering at Russia’s hands, but there’s no evidence that he does. Everything Trump has said and done since before he was re-elected, right up to his comments this week after the first round of talks between Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia, suggests he believes that the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, leader of a poor, insignificant, obscure country, started a war with Russia – a rich, glamorous, important country – that Russia was forced to fight with all its strength. Many soldiers have been killed and much property has sadly been damaged. Trump must help poor Vladimir Putin out of this tragic situation, overthrow the tyrant Zelensky, and enable their two great countries to grow rich together. Details to follow.', 'In other words, Trump’s America adopts, wholesale, Putin’s explanation for his actions, right down to his mocking accusations against the man who, against enormous odds, led his country’s defence.', 'None of this is to say it’s wrong for the US and Russia to be talking. In ending Russia’s war on Ukraine, there was always going to be a moment when the ‘West’, in some form, had to approach Putin, with or without Ukraine’s consent, to get him to spell out his preferred terms for ending the war. Putin began it, and Putin continues it; apart from a tiny and desperate incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, Ukraine is on the defensive, and continues to lose ground to Russia’s merciless expenditure of troops. It is not lack of arms so much as lack of sons that has killed Ukraine’s hopes of forcing Russia to give back the land it seized.', 'In a wiser and more competent – to say nothing of a better – world, the initial approach to Putin would have been followed by a consultation between the US, Ukraine and other European countries on their counter-proposals, and the pressure they could put on Putin if he refused to budge. Perhaps this will still happen. For the time being, Ukraine and the rest of Europe will be consulted in the way the residents of a village are consulted before it gets demolished to make way for a new airport.', 'Although the terms for an initial ceasefire that Putin is offering the Americans in private is unknown, we have a pretty good idea what he wants, which is not so much peace as its evil twin, victory. The degree to which the US pushes back or endorses Putin’s demands could be the first test of how far Trump speaks for America. There are still Atlanticists in positions of power in the US; on the other hand, plenty of others in Trump’s coterie share his awe of Putin and contempt for Zelensky and Ukraine.', 'For now, there is still all to negotiate for. The two supposed shocks of the opening of talks – the US declarations that Ukraine would never be allowed to join Nato, and would have to give up territory – were not, in reality, so remarkable. Of course it would have been smarter not to give in to these demands of Putin’s even before talks began, but ever since the bloody failures of Ukraine’s counter-offensive and its defence of Bakhmut in 2023, it has been apparent to everyone, including, perhaps, most Ukrainians, that Ukraine lacks the manpower and, for now, the administrative capacity to take back land by force from Russia, which is, while enfeebled, resilient in defence.', 'As for Nato, it is both an organising principle and a myth; its much fretted over ‘expansion’ was never a very serious proposition, when even with so many extra countries it had a much smaller collective military at the end than at the beginning. It was insurance from America for something Europe thought was never going to happen, which is why Europe was so parsimonious with its premiums. What Ukraine wants and needs is not Nato membership but the physical reassurance that Nato promises and doesn’t provide: hard security guarantees manifest in Western arms, Western troops and Western air cover.', 'Putin and those around him have often spoken of Russia’s war aims. Central to Putin’s version of events is the myth Ukraine was ready to sign a Russian-drafted peace deal in Istanbul in 2022 and was talked out of it by Western warmongers, Boris Johnson chief among them. In fact, Ukraine was never close to signing the draft treaty, which was, in essence, a document of surrender. But Putin still harks back to it as his preferred closure state, and the text has emerged, giving us, with other events and statements, ways to question how ready America is to give him what he wants.', 'Russia has already said that any Western peacekeeping force in Ukraine after a ceasefire is out of the question, but the Istanbul draft goes much further. It demands that Ukraine renounce any defence treaties with other countries, forbid any foreign troops on its soil, give up any missiles or drones with a range of more than 155 miles and reduce its military to one-sixth of its pre-invasion size, with a skeleton force of only 1500 officers. The draft proposed that all Ukrainian units would return to barracks, with their disarmament supervised by Russia. Will America push back on this? And will it undertake to go on providing ammunition and spare parts for the weapons it has given Ukraine in the past?', 'What will America’s response be to Russia’s demand for more territory than it already has? Since the Istanbul talks in 2022, Russia has declared five Ukrainian regions to be part of Russia: Donetsk and Luhansk in the east and Crimea, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. Of these regions, it has complete control only of Crimea. Will America back Russia in trying to force Ukraine to hand over these huge, heavily populated areas of free Ukraine, including the large cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, to Putin, without a fight?', 'Will America help Putin to try to depose Zelensky? He would have been up for election this year, but he remains in power legally while the country is under martial law, and it is hard to imagine that in anything remotely resembling a fair election in a free Ukraine he would be beaten by anyone more Russia-friendly than him. And yet ousting Zelensky and putting a pliable puppet in place in Kyiv has always been, and continues to be, one of Putin’s war aims. Even under present circumstances the idea that Putin and Trump might conspire to insert a Putin nominee as Zelensky’s replacement, under the delusion that Ukrainians would accept the switch, is far-fetched, but we kick in vain for a firm ground of the possible on which to stand.', 'Many of these questions, of course, can’t be settled between America and Russia. The obvious drawback to Trump and Putin performing a truth-free, morality-free cosplay of Reagan and Gorbachev is that unless the US president plans to intervene militarily on Russia’s behalf, and perhaps even then, any deal requires the consent of Ukraine. It is a lot to ask of Ukraine not only to give up hopes of getting its lost territories back, but to give up land it still holds. And what is the incentive for Ukraine to demilitarise and leave itself undefended under the supervision of the country that has just killed tens of thousands of its people and smashed its cities to smithereens?', 'The same bullheaded charge to peace may also damage Russian demands that might, from the outside, seem acceptable: its insistence on a constitutionally enshrined special status for the Russian language in Ukraine, and on banning small Ukrainian far-right organisations involved in violence against Jews and Soviet power in the mid-20th century. Again, what is the incentive for Ukraine to yield on these, when all Trump is offering in exchange is to plunder its mineral resources, when it was Putin who made the Russian language unpopular, and radical nationalists popular?', 'Europe, too, frozen out of the Saudi talks and attacked in Munich by Trump’s vice-president for resisting the march of populism, has more power than it seems to realise to obstruct a bad deal with Putin, and will have to be reckoned with eventually. Nobody but Europe will lead the rebuilding of Ukraine; Europe, too, has a say in lifting sanctions against and returning assets to Russia. It can’t replace America’s defence industries, but it can sustain Ukraine’s war effort with arms for now. Much has been said of the indecisiveness of Europe’s bickering leaders, and the ambivalence of its people towards Ukraine, but perhaps the hardest thing of all is overcoming the cognitive dissonance that comes with accepting quite how much of an enemy to its friends America has suddenly become.', 'The proposal to remove Native Americans from lands east of the Mississippi came after decades of war and illegal settlement. Settlers pushed farther ...', 'There is a troubling disconnect between the deterrent rationale and the mechanism that will be used to deny citizenship: the home secretary’s ...']"

Donald Trump’s betrayal of Ukraine has emboldened Vladimir Putin and pulled the rug from under Nato allies,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/15/donald-trumps-betrayal-of-ukraine-has-emboldened-vladimir-putin-and-pulled-the-rug-from-under-nato-allies,"['The ramifications of the president’s appeasement of Russia will be felt widely, not least in the alliance he recklessly undermined', 'I\nn Graham Greene’s 1955 novel, The Quiet American, Alden Pyle, a CIA agent, reckons he has all the answers to conflict in colonial era Vietnam. Pyle’s ignorance, arrogance and dangerous scheming, intended to bring peace, result instead in the deaths of many innocents and ultimately his own. In today’s too-real, nonfiction world, Donald Trump is Pyle. Except he’s The Noisy American.', 'He thinks he’s a great deal-maker. He never stops trumpeting his brilliance. Yet his North Korea “deal of the century” was a fiasco. He handed Afghanistan to the Taliban on a plate. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu runs rings around him. Now Trump-Pyle proposes another rubbish deal – selling out Ukraine. America’s very own surrender monkey is Vladimir Putin’s useful idiot. No matter how officials spin it, Trump’s concessions, made before ceasefire talks with Russia even begin, are calamitous, primarily for Ukraine but also for Europe’s security, the transatlantic alliance, and other vulnerable targets, such as Taiwan. As stated, Trump’s giveaways – accepting the loss of sovereign Ukrainian territory to Russian aggression, denying Nato membership to Kyiv, withholding US security guarantees and troops – are shameful appeasement, amounting to betrayal.', 'It was Putin, remember, who launched an unprovoked, murderous full-scale invasion three years ago. But Trump suggests that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s brave, battered people are somehow to blame. He even regurgitates Kremlin calls for fresh elections in Kyiv. Such hypocritical cant from a regime that routinely subverts other countries’ polls is beyond sickening. But Trump the duplicitous dupe willingly buys it. Putin surely cannot believe his luck. By chatting chummily on the phone for 90 minutes, praising Russia’s “genius” tyrant for his “common sense”, and inviting him to a Saudi summit, Trump rehabilitated a pariah and pulled the rug from under Nato allies. Putin gave nothing back. He thinks he’s winning, on the battlefield, politically and diplomatically. He’s right. Worse, Moscow continues to demand that any lasting deal address “structural issues”. These include Ukraine’s disarmament, non-aligned status, the “denazification” of its leadership, and even its existence as an independent state, which Putin abhors. Russia wants to re-order Europe’s security architecture, shorthand for weakening, dividing and pushing back Nato.', 'Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary and Pyle clone, gave Putin a big assist last week, insisting that European security was no longer Washington’s “primary focus”. Europe (including Britain) must pay more for its defence – he proposes 5% of GDP – and “provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine”. US troops in Europe could be cut, he suggested. All this raises a wider question about the transatlantic alliance under Trump’s malign reign. The Americans have shattered Nato’s united front on Ukraine. They have broken their word. They have undermined Zelenskyy and leading supporters – Britain, Germany’s Olaf Scholz, Poland’s Donald Tusk and Kyiv’s allies in the Baltic republics and Scandinavia, all of whom put their trust, wrongly, it transpires, in US leadership.', 'What, then, is Nato for? By prioritising China and the Indo-Pacific over the North Atlantic area – while threatening to emulate Putin and invade sovereign countries such as Canada, Panama and Danish Greenland – Trump undercuts Nato’s raison d’être and shreds the global rulebook it was created to uphold. He previously threatened to quit the alliance. Maybe he should. It could force Europe to take charge of its own destiny.', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", '', 'Europeans had plenty of warning that these kind of shifts on Ukraine and defence were coming. Trump has long viewed European governments, hard-right politicians such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán excepted, as spongers. He harbours irrational animosity towards the EU and has so far refused to speak to Brussels. His steel tariffs reflect this visceral disdain. So cries of shock and pain from the likes of Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, and Britain’s defence secretary, John Healey, who insist they must have a central role in any US-Russia negotiation, come a bit late. They should have taken a tougher public and private stance with Trump from the start, to prevent him going off on a unilateralist tangent. Instead, Europe was, and still is, divided on how best to deal with both Trump and Ukraine, with some leaders, such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, currying favour, and others, like Keir Starmer, biting their lip. This is vindication for France’s Emmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly called, largely in vain, for the EU to develop and fund its own collective, non-Nato defence force, arms procurement and manufacturing. That effort must be ramped up immediately.', 'The global ramifications of last week’s watershed American capitulation will be widely felt. China will be emboldened by this spectacular, self-harming rupture inside the western alliance. It’s probably fair to say an invasion of Taiwan, threatened by President Xi Jinping, has moved appreciably closer. Russia’s rogue allies, Iran and North Korea, will also relish western disarray. Is it too late to turn this around? Europe’s claims to be a global player have been torpedoed. America’s reputation as guarantor of peace, security and the UN-charter-based rule of law is shot. It’s a red letter day for the axis of autocrats and authoritarians everywhere. The Trump doctrine has been unveiled: might makes right, the weak go to the wall.', 'All options must remain open. Ukraine and Europe must be directly included in any ceasefire talks. Rowing back rapidly, Hegseth and the US vice-president, JD Vance, now seem to concede these points. But concerted pressure on Washington by all the western democracies must be maintained to ensure Kyiv survives flaky Trump’s patsy deals and a catastrophic precedent is avoided.', 'If the US-UK so-called special relationship is still worth anything, it is time to cash in. Britain must quietly work behind the scenes until this noisome, noisy American grasps a hard-earned truth: peace at any price is no peace at all.', 'Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs Commentator']"
