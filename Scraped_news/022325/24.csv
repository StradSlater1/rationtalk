What pilots say could have caused a Delta plane to go belly-up,https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-crash-toronto-plane-upside-down-airline-pilots-experts-2025-2,"['Three airline pilots suspect some combination of faulty landing gear, wintry weather, or debris may have caused a Delta Air Lines plane to crash and flip upside down on Monday.', 'Mark Stephens, a former Delta captain who flew for the carrier for 30 years, told Business Insider that video footage of the event showed the right main landing gear collapsing within seconds of touching down.', 'He said it appeared the right wing then struck the ground, detached from the jet, and caught fire. The plane then rolled and came to a rest belly-up.', '""There was just no stopping this once whatever forces caused the gear to fail,"" Stephens said. ""The plane didn\'t fully engulf in flames likely because when the wing fell off, it left the fuel behind and reduced the risk of a major spark. Snow and ice may have also helped to control the fire.""', ""Two other active airline pilots who asked not to be named because of the ongoing investigation and their employers' policies regarding speaking to the media agreed that the video most likely showed the right gear failing during touchdown."", 'Investigators have not yet given any details on what may have caused the crash.', ""A strong crosswind and possible wind shear, a sudden change in wind direction that can affect a plane's altitude, could have put high lateral force onto the right gear as the plane landed. The airport was reporting relatively high 33-knot gusts at the time."", 'Wind shear is a particular hazard during takeoff and landing that has caused plane crashes in the past.', '""I\'ve had some really hard landings,"" Stephens said. ""But I don\'t think the gear would fail from a hard landing unless it had too many cycles.""', 'Airlines closely monitor landing gear cycles, or how many times the wheels have gone up and down, as part of their maintenance strategies. Plane manufacturers design commercial aircraft equipment to withstand heavy landings, but even these have limits, Stephens said.', 'Stephens, who has a background in engineering, said metal fatigue or cracking could cause a critical component of the gear to break if the fault is missed during a maintenance check.', 'In 2018, a Southwest Airlines plane experienced an engine failure in which one of the fan blades broke because of metal fatigue, causing fragments of the engine to escape and hit a passenger window. One person was killed.', 'The Delta Bombardier CRJ900 jet involved was about 16 years old but could have flown for many more years with proper maintenance and upkeep.', 'Stephens said debris on the runway could have been another culprit.', '""If it hit an ice block, I think that could cause the gear to fail because you\'re landing at 150 miles an hour,"" Stephens said. ""It could also be something as little as just a small piece of metal that made the tire fail.""', 'In 2000, an Air France Concorde jet hit a small piece of debris during takeoff, causing the tire to explode and sending fragments flying into the underside of the plane. Damage to flight control systems and a fuel tank explosion caused the plane to crash, killing 113 people.', 'Stephens said the plane landing in Toronto probably would have been flying in at an angle to handle the strong crosswinds. ""Crabbing,"" as the common technique is known, involves pointing the plane\'s nose slightly into the wind to stay on course and straightening out just before landing.', 'Given the direction of the winds in this case, the procedure would have involved landing on the right landing gear first and keeping the right wing down into the crosswind before settling on the left main gear followed by the nose gear for a full touchdown.', '""The pilots are looking straight down the runway, and they\'re trained not to pull that wing out, so to me, they\'re doing what they\'re supposed to do,"" Stephens said.', ""Between the landing gear failing and the wing hitting the ground, Stephens estimates the pilots wouldn't have had time to thrust the engines to full power for a second landing attempt."", 'Greater Toronto Airports Authority CEO Deborah Flint said in a Tuesday press conference that the airport experienced ""extreme"" winter conditions over the weekend.', 'Monday was considered ""clear,"" though reports say snow was blowing at the time of the crash.', 'Stephens said the Delta CRJ900, which was operated by the wholly owned subsidiary Endeavor Air, is very strong and its robust airframe probably contributed to the survivability despite the damaging fire and roll.', '""This is why you always wear a seatbelt and pay attention to the safety instructions,"" he said.', 'For aircraft to be certified, US regulators require manufacturers to show everyone can evacuate in 90 seconds or less. This includes listening to crew instructions and leaving bags behind.', 'A Japan Airlines plane collided with another jet during landing and caught fire in January 2024. Aviation experts said a detailed in-flight safety video paired with the passengers following crew instructions to leave bags contributed to all 379 people surviving.', 'Ignoring crew commands can be deadly.', ""In 2019, a Russian jet three times smaller than the JAL one caught fire upon landing, but people were seen evacuating with their carry-on luggage. It's believed the slowed escape caused some of the 41 people's deaths."", ""Delta said on Tuesday that 19 of 21 people injured in the crash had been released from the hospital.

The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has repeatedly said it is too early to determine the cause of the crash, however, several aviation experts have offered their theories to CTV News about what may have gone wrong during the final moments of descent.', 'The crash occurred at around 2:15 p.m. as the flight arrived from Minneapolis/St. Paul, carrying 80 people in what was supposed to be a routine landing.', 'To date, plane crashes remain rare and are often described as less likely than winning a lottery jackpot. In fact, the last major crash on Canadian soil was in 2011 when a First Air charter flight from Yellowknife to Resolute, Nvt., crashed into a hill during approach, killing 12 of the 15 people on board.', 'In this circumstance, passengers on Flight 4819 sustained a range of injuries, including back sprains, head injuries, and nausea, according to Peel paramedics.', 'As of Thursday, all 21 passengers injured in the crash have been released from the hospital, and the wreckage has been removed from the runway.', 'In an interview with CP24, former pilot Keith Mackey said the aircraft appeared to descend too rapidly and failed to execute a proper flare, a manoeuvre that allows for a gentler landing.', '“The airplane appears to be descending very rapidly and doesn’t flare as you’d expect it to as it approaches the runway, so I think that was what happened with the hard landing,” Mackey later told CTV News Channel. “I think it was just beyond the structural capability of the airplane.”', 'He also noted the weather conditions at the time were less than ideal, with snow and limited visibility.', '“The weather that I observed in these clips, it certainly was snowing and the visibility was limited so it certainly wasn’t a perfect weather day,” he said.', 'Eugene Abramovici, president of Falconmet Engineering and Laboratories, also pointed to the lack of flare in the widely circulated video of the crash.', '“They went straight parallel to the ground; there was no flaring,” Abramovici said. “Flare landing is lifting the nose up in order to reduce the vertical acceleration of the aircraft.”', 'Aviation expert John Gradek, a lecturer at McGill University’s School of Aviation Management, said the way the aircraft flipped suggested something unusual happened in the last seconds before impact.', '“It’s an absolute miracle that everybody got out of that airplane without any fatalities,” Gradek told CTV’s Your Morning.', 'Gradek also noted the aircraft’s right wing, which houses the fuel tanks, ripped off on impact.', '“When you have that type of situation, the fuel running down the windows of the airplane on landing — the wing got ripped off the airplane,” he said. “That’s where the fuel tanks are.”', 'Experts say crosswinds and precipitation are potential factors in the crash, though the TSB has yet to confirm their role.', '“Each aircraft has certification limits as to what they can handle as far as crosswinds,” Mackey said.', 'Aviation expert Phyl Durdey cautioned that determining the cause could take time, but acknowledged that wind and precipitation are often contributors to similar incidents.', '“We’d just have to see what the black boxes say,” Durdey said, calling the CRJ-900 “very reliable.”', 'Aviation safety analyst John Cox told CP24 that despite being launched in 2001 by Bombardier, the CRJ-900 is a well-built aircraft.', '“It was certified to high standards both in its structural strength and ability to get people out in a hurry,” Cox said. “So, this was a well-built airplane experiencing a very traumatic event, and the emergency evacuation design and certification worked exactly as it should have.”', 'Although Toronto had been dealing with harsh winter conditions for a week before the crash, Cox said he does not believe that will be a major factor in the investigation.', '“I think the fact that the airplane is missing its right wing is going to be something investigators look at very seriously and early,” he said. “There is going to be a lot of information that investigators will have to look at”', 'The TSB continues to investigate, with a focus on the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, which are expected to provide crucial details, Mackey said.', '“I don’t think this is going to be very difficult to solve because a lot of the information will be from the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.”', 'Until then, experts say it remains unclear whether mechanical failure, weather conditions, or pilot error played a role in the crash.', 'With files from CTV News Toronto’s Alex Arsenych, Aarjavee Raaj, CTV’s Dorcas Marfo, and CP24’s Codi Wilson and Bryann Aguilar', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

Goodwill or good PR?

""The only obvious parallel here is the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" crash from 2009. In that case, American Airlines gave passengers $5,000.""', ""Because this crash involved a flight outside of the United States, international treaties - such as the Montreal Convention - do require the airline to make advance payments to customers to meet immediate economic needs of passengers, but Potter says Delta's offer still stands out."", 'If all 76 customers aboard, took the airline up on the $30,000 payment, it would total nearly $2.3 million. According to NBC News, Delta Care Representatives are telling customers it also comes with a promise of no strings attached, meaning it would not require giving up any legal rights.', '""Keep in mind, this is just the first chapter of the aftermath of this story,"" Potter said. ""There\'s going to be lawsuits. There is going to be additional forms of direct compensation for injuries and hospital bills and all of those things. I have no doubt about that."" ', 'Minneapolis attorney, Mike Bryant, managing partner at Bradshaw and Bryant Law Firm, said he still has some questions about the fine print.', '""When I first saw it I saw the possibility that it might be really good customer service,"" Bryant said. ""But it\'s still important to look at, \'What does the check say? Do they want you to sign anything? Do they want you to give a statement? What else is involved with this?""', ""If Delta's proactive payment really is as simple as it sounds, Bryant said history shows it could be both good for customers and business."", '""There was a past situation where Toro had a lot of litigation going because a number of things were going on with their different products,"" Bryant said. ""They dropped their litigation costs and they dropped their overall number of complaints by taking care of people and making people happy with their product, and they were able to sell that product to these people again in the future.""', '""I think several things can be true at once,"" Potter said. ""First and foremost, Delta does pride itself on taking care of its customers. And so in their minds, this is just doing the right thing. At the same time, the entire nation, if not the world, is watching this right now. So this is a savvy move.""', 'KARE11 reached a few of the customers who survived the crash. They confirmed the offer from Delta, but said that it came with a lengthy ""Terms and Conditions"" section. At least one of them said they are speaking with an attorney about their options before taking the airline up on the offer.']"

They have also credited the plane's safety features with saving lives."", 'The incident took place shortly after 14:00 local time on Monday (19:00 GMT).', 'It involved a model CRJ-900 plane, operating as Delta Air Lines flight DL4819.', 'The aircraft arrived at Toronto from the US city of Minneapolis and was carrying 76 passengers and four crew members.', 'As it landed, the plane appears to have struck the runway, slid for some distance and then flipped over, observed Dan Ronan, a journalist and pilot licensed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), who spoke to BBC News.', 'In a video statement released on Tuesday, Transportation Safety Board senior investigator Ken Webster said that after the initial impact parts of the aircraft separated.', 'The fuselage came to rest slightly off the right side of the runway, upside down and facing the other direction, he said.', 'Footage obtained by TMZ showed part of the aircraft bursting into flames as the landing happened. Firefighters rushed to put these out.', 'Passenger Pete Carlson told broadcaster CBC it was ""a very forceful event"", recalling the sound of ""concrete and metal"" at the moment of impact.', 'He and others on board were suspended upside down in their seats, and had to release themselves on to the cabin ceiling before leaving the inverted aircraft.', 'All 80 people on board survived. On Tuesday morning, Delta said 21 injured passengers were initially transported to local hospitals - with 19 later released.', 'Delta has promised to give more updates.', 'Mr Webster said investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the wreckage as part of their investigation.', 'BBC Verify has analysed recordings of communications between the plane and air traffic control.', 'At no point in discussions was there anything to suggest trouble was anticipated with the landing.', 'This was confirmed by Marco Chan, a former pilot and a senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University in the UK, and plane crash investigator Ismo Aaltonen, who also listened to the audio recording.', 'Mr Chan also said the plane appeared to have made a hard landing - involving an unusually high rate of descent.', 'It seems to have touched down with one wheel first, Mr Chan told the BBC, which might have caused the landing gear to collapse on impact. This could have led to the right wing hitting the runway and in turn causing the plane to roll.', 'The weather may also have been significant. The airport fire chief stated that the runway was dry at the time of the incident.', 'Airport authorities had said earlier that although recent heavy snow had stopped, ""frigid temperatures and high winds [were] moving in"".', 'As the plane came in to land, air traffic controllers told the pilots of 38mph (61km/h) gusts and the possibility of a ""slight bump in the glide path"", CNN reported.', 'The pilots appear to have attempted what is known as a crab manoeuvre, Mr Ronan said. This involves turning a plane into the wind, and then directly on to the runway at the last moment.', '""The sheer survivability of this is really amazing,"" Mr Ronan told the BBC, pointing out that the aeroplane\'s fuselage (body) had stayed intact.', ""Other commentators hailed the craft's safety features. CNN analyst and former FAA inspector David Soucie said the plane had broken apart as it had meant to, with the detachment of the wings stopping the fuselage ripping apart."", ""Graham Braithwaite, professor of safety and accident investigation at the UK's Cranfield University, said planes were also designed so that passengers involved in an accident did not hit things likely to cause injury."", '""Even the design of the seat back or the tray table is all part of how we consider making that survivable space,"" he told the BBC. ""And the seatbelt that people have is so important - that is the ultimate thing that stops people being thrown around the cabin like this,"" he added.', 'The flight attendants have also been praised for getting everyone off the flipped aeroplane quickly. Emergency crews on the ground were labelled ""heroic"" by the airport chief after reaching the crash site in a matter of minutes.', 'Mr Carlson said the passengers themselves had worked together very effectively. ""What I saw was everyone on that plane suddenly became very close in terms of how to help one another, how to console one another,"" he said.', 'Mr Ronan highlighted the importance of the plane\'s high-impact 16g seats, which he said were ""designed to absorb a great deal of punishment"".', 'The seats can withstand deceleration of 16 times the force of gravity, and must pass rigorous testing using human dummies to model crash dynamics.', 'The seat legs, attached to a track on the floor, must be able to pitch down 10 degrees on one side and roll 10 degrees on the other side so that they do not break, said Kevin Campbell, founder of Aviation Consulting & Engineering Solutions, who is FAA-authorised to approve seats that are required to comply with the regulations.', 'In previous accidents, the FAA had seen seats piled up in the fronts of aircrafts, with bodies still attached in many cases, Mr Campbell said.', 'Mr Ronan said the regulations keep ""the seat in place and bolted to the floor, so you have a higher degree of survivability in your seat itself and you have less likelihood that the seat is going to become detached, where you\'re now strapped into a moving object that\'s being bounced around the cabin"".', 'The regulations also require a passenger to be able to withstand hitting their head and legs on the seat in front of them, and seats help absorb weight in their spine so that they do not break their back. Seatbelts are also less stretchy than they used to be so the restraint is more secure.', '""As a result of that aircrafts are much, much safer,"" Mr Campbell said, and those factors were ""absolutely"" at play in improving safety in this crash.', '""It really is remarkable that the seats did exactly what they were supposed to do, they stayed intact... the seatbelts worked just as they were supposed to, and the seats did not become detached from the floor,"" Mr Ronan said.', '""Think of how many head injuries we would have had, spinal injuries we would have had, if the seat became detached.""', 'This marks the fourth major air crash in North America in less than a month, and other recent incidents remain under investigation.', 'Those incidents followed another high-profile crash in South Korea in December, in which 179 people were killed.', 'Despite these, experts say air travel remains overwhelmingly safe - and increasingly so.', 'Additional reporting by Mallory Moench, Tom Joyner and Josh Cheetham', 'The largest producer of maple syrup now wants you to drink the sap, which it calls maple water.', 'Daytime ferry sailings and several flights are cancelled as the Isle of Man is hit by severe gales.', 'A recent flurry of air disasters have made some people worried about flying - but are crashes on the rise?', 'Some Isle of Man flights and ferry services are delayed, cancelled or rescheduled due to gales.', ""The plans will improve the sites' arrivals and parking areas, Ports of Jersey says."", 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

There was a giant firewall down the side. I could actually feel the heat through the glass,” Nelson said. “Then we were going sideways. I'm not even sure how many times we tumbled, but we ended upside down.”"", 'The plane was mostly silent once it came to a stop as everyone on board tried to “make a sense of what just had happened,” Nelson explained', '“We released the seat belts. I kind of fell to the floor, which is now the ceiling, and helped the lady next to me get out of her seat belt,” he added.', 'Peter Koukov, who was also on board the plane, told ABC News passengers were left hanging from their seatbelts “like bats.”', '“We hit the ground and we were sideways, and then we were hanging upside down like bats,” he said. “It all happened pretty, pretty fast.

Their identities have yet to be released.', ""On Monday evening, the city's SickKids hospital said that the child it had received was in good condition but could not provide further information."", 'Joshua Schirard, a commercial airline pilot, told CNN that the flight attendants are to be commended for ensuring everyone on board was evacuated.', ""“The flight attendants, and how well trained they are, to be able to get everyone out,” Schirard told CNN. “Everyone thinks that they're there to just serve drinks and snacks when that is absolutely not the case. I guarantee you that it was their efforts to get those people out and to act as first responders on the scene, to make sure that everyone survives.”"", 'Experts also say the plane’s “crashworthiness” — that is, design features that make aircraft as “survivable” as possible during a wreck — helped ensure all 80 people lived, The Washington Post reports.', '“Crashworthiness is what would have made sure the seats didn’t detach from the floors and that the lap belts kept the passengers secure,” Graham Braithwaite, director of aerospace and aviation at Cranfield University, told the Post.', 'Braithwaite echoed Schirard’s point, noting the flight attendants played a key role in everyone’s safe passage off the plane.', '“These people put their lives on the line — they’re the last people off the airplane, and I think sometimes we forget that,” Braithwaite said.', 'Flint praised the “textbook response” from crew and responders to ensure the passengers were safe.', 'The exact cause of the crash is unclear, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada is set to lead the investigation.', ""“The NTSB is leading a team of U.S. investigators to assist the Transportation Safety Board of Canada with their investigation of today’s accident of a Delta Air Lines Bombardier CRJ900 at Toronto Pearson International Airport,” the FAA said in a statement. “Per international protocols under the International Civil Aviation Organization's Annex 13, any information about the investigation will be released by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.”"", 'However, experts say the weather — and especially the wind speeds — may have played a role.

The crosswinds that hit the plane at a 45-degree angle were only around 23 or 24 knots, he said.', 'Schirard said these winds, despite being within the plane’s limit, may have still played a role when coupled with the snow and ice on the runway.', ""“[The crosswind] is within those demonstrated components. And the pilots knew that coming in,” he told CNN. “Now...that doesn't make it easy landing.”"", ""“When they're coming in and they're trying to land in that crosswind, and then we couple that with the snow and the ice...If they hit a solid patch of compressed snow, ice on that runway, coupled with a strong dressing crosswind, it could absolutely load them off the side of the runway,” he continued."", 'Mary Schiavo, former inspector general at the U.S. Department of Transportation, agreed that the winds may have played a role.', ""“There is a decision point at which you have to land no matter what…and if that's where they were when they got these bad crosswinds, they had no choice,” she told CNN."", 'The FAA issued a ground stop after the crash.
