I’m not sure if it’s one man’s decision. Based on the spirit of the blockchain maybe it should be a voting process to see what the community wants,” Zhou stated in an X Spaces discussion yesterday.', 'He added that his team was already in talks with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation for any recommendations that might help mitigate the fallout.', 'The debate quickly spilled over into social media. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes took to Twitter, posing a question to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin: “Will you advocate to roll back the chain to help Bybit?”', 'In what appears to be a tongue-in-cheek remark, Hayes added: “ETH stopped being money in 2016 after the DAO hack hardfork. If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016 why not do it again?”', 'Amid the exchanges, Laura Shin of the Unchained podcast added some context and clarification regarding “rollback” proposals, saying “I’m sure they wouldn’t.”', 'Shin clarified that the term “rollback” originates from Bitcoin’s design, where every transaction is linked in a continuous chain of custody.', 'In Bitcoin, reversing one transaction would require undoing all subsequent transactions to maintain the chain’s integrity.', 'However, Ethereum uses a model where balances are updated directly through smart contracts and transactions, meaning there isn’t a single, traceable chain that can be reversed in the same manner.', 'Instead of a true rollback, what occurred during the DAO incident was an “irregular state change” that reallocated funds from compromised contracts without rewinding the entire blockchain.', 'Kyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor.

North Korea’s Lazarus Group Tied to Bybit Hack and Solana Memecoin Scandals,https://www.tronweekly.com/lazarus-group-tied-to-solana-memecoin-scandals/,"['TRONWEEKLY', 'CRYPTO WORLD NEWS', 'FEBRUARY 24, 2025 BY SHEILA', 'Lazarus Group Linked to Bybit Hack and Solana Memecoin Scams, Investigation Reveals. On February 23, 2025, on-chain investigator ZachXBT published findings connecting North Korea’s Lazarus Group to the massive $1.4 billion Bybit hack on February 21, 2025. The report also ties the group to recent memecoin scams on Solana’s Pump.fun platform. ZachXBT’s analysis highlights a complex laundering operation involving stolen funds from the Bybit exploit.', 'The investigation shows that on February 22, 2025, the attacker received $1.08 million from the Bybit hack. This amount moved to a wallet address, 0x363908df2b0890e7e5c1e403935133094287d7d1, which bridged the funds as USDC to Solana. ', 'After splitting between numerous wallets, several of the addresses had previously been associated with memecoin scams. Through its analysis, ZachXBT identified more than 920 cryptocurrency addresses involved in the hack, with Lazarus Group identifying involvement with Pump.fun memecoin launches.', 'The analysis from ZachXBT shows Lazarus Group used the stolen Bybit funds through multiple laundering transactions. The $1.08 million USDC bridged from Solana to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) divided across more than 30 addresses through a programmed mechanism. The address 0x0beb8b5f899a15ed5e6be5c597f88b2c7d5b3a collected funds before it returned the assets to Solana. The funds were distributed by a few wallets that sent $106,000 USDC to ten Solana addresses which belonged to coin scammers.', 'The investigator noted that Lazarus Group launched meme coins through Pump.fun only 15 hours before public disclosure. The observed activities show that the cybercriminals utilized the platform to cover up the source of their stolen money. The exchanged funds were moved to different exchanges, which complicated tracking and detection efforts. ZachXBT retained undisclosed to prevent interference, however, ZachXBT validated the release of wallets from analytics tools.', 'ZachXBT’s findings extend beyond the Bybit hack. The same Lazarus Group wallets linked to this exploit also connect to the $29 million Phemex hack in January 2025. This pattern indicates a consistent strategy of targeting cryptocurrency platforms and laundering funds across blockchains like Solana and BSC.', 'The report underscores the group’s role in Solana’s recent memecoin scams, including rug pulls on Pump.fun. These scams have damaged investor trust in Solana, with high-profile cases like the Libra token rug pull, where insiders allegedly drained over $107 million. Such incidents have contributed to a decline in Solana’s user activity, with active addresses dropping to 9.5 million in February 2025, down from 15.6 million in November 2024.', 'The investigation highlights the challenges blockchain networks face in combating sophisticated cyber threats. Lazarus Group’s actions reveal a growing trend of exploiting decentralized platforms for money laundering, impacting the broader crypto industry’s security and stability.', 'FILED UNDER: NEWS, CRYPTO SCAM\nTAGGED WITH: BYBIT HACK, NORTH KOREA, SOLANA MEMECOINS', 'Copyright © 2025 · Tron Weekly.

Within two hours of the security breach, the exchange was facing requests to move over $100,000 off its platform, Zhou revealed.', 'Responding to the situation, Zhou told his security team to engage Safe to “find a better way to get this money out.” The team ended up developing new software with code “based on Etherscan” to verify the signatures “on a very manual level” to move the stablecoins back to their wallet and cover the withdrawal surge.', 'The exchange’s team had to remain up all night to be able to fulfill withdrawals, according to Zhou. As the exchange managed to move the $3 billion in stablecoin reserves, it was facing a bank run of “about 50%” of all the funds within the exchange.', 'Zhou said that since the incident, the exchange has moved a significant amount of funds off of Safe cold wallets and is now determining what system it will use to replace Safe.', 'Since the security breach, Bybit has engaged authorities. During the session, Zhou said that the Singaporean authorities took the issue “very seriously” and that he believes it has already been escalated with Interpol.', 'Blockchain analysis firms, including Chainalysis, were engaged. Zhou said, “As long as Bybit is there and continues to track [the stolen ether], I hope we can get these funds back.”', 'Notably, he revealed that pushing to ""roll back"" the Ethereum blockchain, which was suggested by some industry players on social media, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, had been on the table for some time if the community agreed with it.', '“I had my team talking to Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation to see if there’s any recommendations they can offer to help. I do really thank all these guys on Twitter asking if there is a possibility to roll back the chain. I’m not sure what was the response on their side, but anything that would help we would try,” Zhou said.', 'When asked if ""rolling back"" the chain is even possible, Zhou responded he doesn’t know. “I’m not sure it’s a one-man decision based on the spirit of blockchain. It should be a work in process to see what the community wants,” he said.', 'It\'s worth noting that a blockchain ""rollback"" refers to a state change that would allow for the funds to be recovered. While rolling back the Bitcoin blockchain is technically possible, such a state change on Ethereum would be more complex, given its smart contract interactions and state-based architecture.', 'Nevertheless, any state change would require consensus and likely lead to a contentious hard fork, drawing criticism from the community. This would likely split the Ethereum blockchain into two networks, each with its own supporters.', 'As for what exactly caused the hack to occur, is still unclear. Per Zhou, Bybit’s laptops have not been compromised. He said the movements of the transaction’s signers have been scrutinized but appear to have been routine.', '“We know the cause is definitely around the Safe cold wallet. Whether it’s a problem with our laptops or on Safe’s side, we don’t know.,” Zhou added.', ""Francisco is a reporter for CoinDesk with a passion for cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

This has already directly led to the seizure of some of the funds stolen from Bybit.', ""Lazarus Group's laundering process typically follows a characteristic pattern.

This layering process can take many forms, including:', 'Lazarus are currently engaged in this second stage of laundering.

However, one service has emerged as a major and willing facilitator of this laundering. eXch is a cryptocurrency exchange, notable for allowing its users to swap cryptoassets anonymously.

The hackers made off with a sum that totals to $1.4 billion, according to an estimate by cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic—the largest crypto theft of all time by some measures.', 'ByBit CEO Ben Zhou wrote on X that the hackers had used a “musked transaction”—likely a misspelling of “masked transaction”—to trick the exchange into cryptographically signing a change in the code of the smart contract controlling a wallet holding its stockpile of Ethereum. “Please rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure,” Zhou wrote, suggesting that the exchange remained solvent. “All withdraws are NORMAL.” Zhou later added in another note on X that the exchange would be able to cover the loss, which if true suggests that no users will lose their funds.', 'The theft dwarfs other historic hacks of crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox and FTX, each of which lost sums of cryptocurrency that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the time the thefts were discovered. Even the stolen loot from the 2016 Bitfinex heist, which was worth close to $4.5 billion at the time the thieves were identified and the majority of the funds recovered in 2022, was only worth $72 million at the time of the theft. ByBit’s $1.4 billion is by that measure a far bigger loss and, considering that all crypto thefts in 2024 totaled to $2.2 billion, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a stunning new benchmark in crypto crime.', 'The British government earlier this month raised privacy alarms worldwide when it demanded that Apple give it access to users’ end-to-end encrypted iCloud data. That data had been protected with Apple’s Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts stored user information such that no one other than the user can decrypt it—not even Apple. Now Apple has caved to the UK’s pressure, disabling that end-to-end encryption feature for iCloud across the country. Even as it turned off that protection, Apple expressed its reluctance in a statement: ""Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,"" the company said. ""Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK."" Privacy advocates worldwide have argued that the move—and the UK’s push for it—will weaken the security and privacy of British citizens and leave tech companies vulnerable to similar surveillance demands from other governments around the world.', 'The only thing worse than the scourge of stalkerware apps—malware installed on phones by snooping spouses or other hands-on spies to surveil virtually all of the victim’s movements and communications—is when those apps are so badly secured that they also leak victims’ information onto the internet. Stalkerware apps Cocospy and Spyic, which appear to have been developed by someone in China and largely share the same source code, left data stolen from millions of victims exposed, thanks to a security vulnerability in both apps, according to a security researcher who discovered the flaw and shared information about it with TechCrunch. The exposed data included messages, call logs, and photos, TechCrunch found. In a karmic twist, it also included millions of email addresses of the stalkerware’s registered users, who had themselves installed the apps to spy on victims.', 'In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear', 'Musk takeover: DOGE’s race to the bottom', 'Big Story: The bust that took down Durov and upended Telegram', 'WIRED’s favorite ‘buy it for life’ gear', 'Event: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London', 'MORE FROM WIRED', 'REVIEWS AND GUIDES', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

"Bybit CEO says exchange has closed shortfall in ETH reserves, plans to release audited POR report",https://www.theblock.co/post/342896/bybit-ceo-says-exchange-has-closed-shortfall-in-eth-reserves-plans-to-release-audited-por-report,"['The Block launches Campus, a crypto learning platform for teams and individuals – Learn More', 'Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou said the exchange had filled the gap in the ETH reserves following a $1.4 billion exploit last week and plans to publish an audited proof of reserves report to demonstrate this.', '“Bybit has already fully closed the ETH gap; a new audited POR report will be published very soon to show that Bybit is back to 100% 1:1 on client assets through a Merkle tree. Stay tuned,” Zhou said. Bybit appears to have closed the gap with loans, whale deposits and ETH purchases, according to on-chain data from Lookonchain.', 'On Feb. 21, Bybit faced a significant challenge when it suffered a massive exploit, resulting in the theft of over 400,000 ETH. The attackers turned a standard multi-signature approval process into a $1.4 billion heist by presenting a fake UI to mask a malicious smart contract.', 'This incident marked the largest crypto hack in history, draining a substantial portion of Bybit’s ETH reserves and sparking concerns about the exchange’s liquidity and ability to meet user withdrawal demands.', 'To address the shortfall in its ETH reserves and maintain operational stability, Bybit quickly secured emergency liquidity through what CEO Ben Zhou described as a “bridge loan” from partners in the crypto industry. These were short-term loans to aid an entity through its transition period. ', 'These loans are intended to cover the stolen ETH, providing Bybit with the necessary funds to manage a surge in withdrawal requests and prevent a collapse akin to a bank run. The exchange also appears to have purchased large amounts of ETH via OTC transactions to replenish its reserves.', 'Zhou had previously reassured users that the exchange remained solvent, claiming Bybit’s treasury and retained earnings were sufficient to cover the loss from the exploit, even if the stolen funds were not recovered, and that client assets were backed.', 'With the replenished ETH reserves, the exchange is expected to process all withdrawal requests normally.', 'The $1.4 billion attack on Bybit centered on the exchange’s multi-signature (multisig) cold wallet, which required multiple transaction approvals. In this case, the wallet was executing a routine transfer to a warm wallet (an online wallet used for operational liquidity). During this process, attackers believed to be the North Korean Lazarus Group manipulated the transaction to deceive the system and its human operators.', ""The attackers employed a technique described by Bybit's Zhou as a “masked” transaction. This involved altering the user interface (UI) with which the wallet signers — the individuals or systems responsible for approving transactions — interacted. The UI displayed a legitimate destination address. However, the transaction's underlying smart contract logic was maliciously altered beneath this facade."", ""In this case, the attackers injected fraudulent code into the transaction that the signers unknowingly approved. Instead of simply transferring funds to the warm wallet as intended, the altered smart contract redirected control of the cold wallet's assets — about 401,347 ETH, along with related tokens like liquid-staked ETH (stETH) and Mantle Staked ETH (mETH) — to an address controlled by the hackers."", 'Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
