Although I have covered the topic a couple of times, I think it is appropriate to provide an update on where we stand today, and what the future may hold.', 'As a reminder, avian influenza is in the same virus family as the seasonal flu we experience. Poultry has proven to be very sensitive to the virus, which will result in high levels of bird mortality. Influenza in general, and avian influenza specifically, can infect other species. Although, it may not impact their health with the same severity.', 'Avian influenza infections have been occurring in commercial poultry flocks for almost two decades. Historically, it was a seasonal concern that coincided with wild bird migration. There would be a peak of diagnosed illness in spring, and those numbers would reduce until the fall/winter migration that would start another round. The most recent outbreak, that began in 2022, hasn’t taken much of a pause.', 'Cases may decline from an individual state, only to appear somewhere else in the country. Over the last 30 days, the USDA has reported 151 infected commercial and backyard flocks with about 23.33 million birds affected (USDA APHIS). Ohio is the current hotbed of infection with 51 confirmed flocks, accounting for 8.9 million birds, many of which have been commercial egg laying facilities.

In poultry, the policy has been that if the virus is detected in a flock, the entire flock is destroyed. While this is an economic hardship for producers raising meat birds, it is more so for those that have layer flocks.', 'The flock owner will be asked to euthanize the flock and to properly dispose of the birds. Their facility must then be sanitized and inspected before new birds can be introduced to the house. It only takes about 30 days for a baby chicken to be raised to a size where it is harvested for the retail market. Layers on the other hand take about 22 weeks to begin laying eggs. So it takes much longer for commercial egg producers to return to normal production than it does those raising broilers.', 'In the last four months, over 20 million layers have been culled. The US commercial egg industry saw a 3.7% reduction in the number of birds in January alone, and over the last three years the national flock has been reduced by 8%. This has resulted in a decline of total production from 9.4 billion eggs to 9.1 billion. The reduction in availability has driven the 15% average increase in egg price that consumers see in the grocery store. So, due to the time required to bring new birds into production, it is not an issue that can be solved overnight.', 'The new administration is proposing changes in policy that would no longer require infected flocks, that do not show clinical signs of illness, to be euthanized. It also is pushing for the development of a vaccine to help combat the virus. There has been a vaccine available since 2021, but it wasn’t developed in a form that was feasible for the treatment of large numbers of birds.', 'I imagine you can understand the effort that would be needed to inject a vaccine into 100,000 birds in a single poultry building. There is current work to design a form that could be administered topically or via drinking water for poultry establishments.', 'I hope this overview is helpful for you to understand why you are seeing the current prices for eggs in the grocery store. I would like to reinforce that our food system is still safe. The virus is destroyed by continuing to obey basic food preparation principles. Pasteurization of milk destroys the virus in dairy cattle that may have been infected. Cooking meat and eggs to a minimum of 160 degrees also inactivates the virus.', 'Regardless of the presence of the virus, or its absence, extreme caution should always be used when consuming raw milk, meat and egg products. There are still significant human health concerns with our historic pathogens such as E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria.', 'Those that raise poultry on a commercial level are encouraged to implement advanced biosecurity practices to reduce the risk of introducing the virus to their flock.

For retailers, wholesale egg prices also reached an all-time high in February at $7.86, according to economic data platform Trading Economics.', 'As a result, refrigerated shelves normally housing eggs are sometimes barren and large grocery stores such as Lidl and Trader Joe’s limit customer purchases while supplies are low.

There have been no confirmed human cases in Maryland and a majority of those who are infected are meat and poultry workers, CDC guidance said.', 'Meghan Davis, an associate professor in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said while there isn’t an immediate threat to humans, bird flu concerns would grow if the virus acquires more traits of human-to-human transmission or mutations that make it deadlier or resistant to antiviral countermeasures.', '“We say that this virus has pandemic potential,” Davis said. “Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been around for a long time. … What’s different about H5N1 is that it’s had remarkable staying power.”', 'While the first description of bird flu dates back to the late 1800s, the current outbreak has had widespread impacts in the U.S. since early 2022.', 'The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors.

Shoppers are scaling back on egg consumption or looking for egg alternatives amid safety concerns about bird flu and the subsequent all-time-high prices. Consumers are paying nearly double for a carton of eggs in recent weeks. We\'re dealing with the rising costs in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen, too. One recipe tester had to shell out $12 for a dozen, while another cook exclaimed, ""I\'ve been out of eggs for over a week! I\'m never out of eggs!""', 'Even if you’re determined to continue buying eggs, you may find stores have bare shelves or limits on how many cartons each customer can purchase. Why? People are stockpiling eggs, similar to toilet paper during COVID, for fear that prices will continue to skyrocket.', ""If you're not among those panic-buying eggs, you can easily find suitable egg substitutes for baking, whether due to allergy concerns, scarcity or you’re simply priced out. Another silver lining: Most of the replacements are ingredients you probably already have on hand, and are likely more affordable than eggs."", 'First, do you actually need to replace egg in a recipe?', ""Baking is a delicate web of ingredients — removing one would be like recklessly pulling out the lynchpin in a Jenga tower — and eggs are incredibly important for a number of reasons. An egg, in particular, has several roles that are crucial to a recipe’s success. It adds richness and moisture, like in a brioche. It can serve to thicken and emulsify, as in a cheesecake. The oven heats up the egg’s protein, creating structure for cakes, muffins and bars. When beaten, eggs provide leavening fluff — case in point: a soufflé. If you’ve ever forgotten to add eggs to a cake batter, then you know all too well the end result is a dense, structureless puck that crumbles faster than a house of cards. So if you don't or can't use egg, you definitely need a substitute."", 'We wanted to compare the different types of egg substitutes side-by-side, so we fired up the ovens in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen. To eliminate variables, we used the same boxed brownie mix to test each egg alternative. We also baked one batch with a real egg as the control to compare with the other versions. We kept all other conditions the same, including the type of baking pan, oven temperature and cooling time. We did adjust the baking time per the package directions, which cued to remove the brownies from the oven “when the center is set and edges have begun to pull away from sides of pan.” The bake time for our control brownies was 40 minutes.', 'We judged the results of each bake based on the following criteria:', 'Appearance', 'Texture', 'Taste', 'Baking time', 'For all tests, we started with a box of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Brownie Mix, which called for one egg and yielded chewy, fudgy brownies when baked according to the package directions. Noticeable right away was the appearance of all the egg substitute brownies. They were much darker and shinier than the control, which had a matte finish and a more reddish chestnut brown color. Some versions were crustier or had deep crags or serious caving — things to keep in mind for your own baking trials.', 'While we tried this for brownies specially, our experts say these substitutes should work for cakes, cookies, muffins and pancakes too!', 'Appearance: Pleasingly crinkled top and deep mahogany color', 'Texture: Crustier edges with fudgy interior', 'Taste: Similar to the control, the chocolate flavor shined through', 'Baking time: 35 minutes', 'By far, the closest to the control brownies in terms of color, flavor and texture.

It was also the least expensive, considering it’s an upcycled ingredient that most people would toss after draining a can of chickpeas. However, it did not rise as high as the control and was among the shallowest of the brownies.', '1/4 cup applesauce', 'Appearance: lightly crackled on top and coffee brown color', 'Texture: wetter, less crumbly interior', 'Taste: a little sweeter', 'Baking time: 35 minutes', ""Applesauce was our middle of the road substitute for egg. Tasters noted that this version didn’t crumble the way the other brownies did and resulted in brownies that were wetter. “It's a little claggy and getting stuck to the roof of my mouth in not a great way,” commented one, while another said, “It’s almost like you don’t have to chew it.” Since applesauce lacks the protein found in the other replacements, it likely wasn’t able to provide adequate structure for the brownies. It also yielded sweeter brownies, which makes sense, since applesauce has more sugar than an egg."", 'Appearance: serious cratering with a color similar to the Greek yogurt brownies', 'Texture: edges were not as crisp and interior lacked chewiness', 'Taste: less sweet', 'Baking time: 38 minutes', ""Ranking number four on our list, silken tofu resulted in brownies that were claggy (though not as much as the ones made with applesauce). “It just falls apart, like mush,” noted one taste tester. Another said, “This one's not my favorite, it tastes less sweet and lacks crisp edges.”"", 'Appearance: Drastic caving and cracking; did not rise as high as the control; similar in color to the applesauce brownies', 'Texture: Oily and left a greasy coating in the mouth', 'Taste: Bitter aftertaste', 'Baking time: 35 minutes', 'These flax egg brownies were the least successful in every criteria. Taste testers were aghast at the appearance, noting how shallow the brownies were. “It looks the worst,” said one commenter, about how sunken and caved the results were. Another tester remarked, “When I was breaking it open, it was very greasy and oozing all over my hands.”', 'All the replacements technically “worked” in that there was an edible baked good at the end. How much you’d want to eat the brownies is another story. The Greek yogurt substitution was so successful, you may want to use it even when eggs are plentiful. If cost is a concern, aquafaba is your best bet. The flax egg replacement, on the other hand, was the most disappointing in all aspects for our boxed brownie test.', 'You Might Also Like', ""67 Best Gifts for Women That'll Make Her Smile"", 'The Best Pillows for Every Type of Sleeper']"

As eggs see their biggest monthly price spike in a decade, some safety net organizations — like CommUnity Crisis Services, where Kabela works — are struggling to keep their shelves stocked. This comes as millions of low-income Americans rely on food banks as a free supplement to traditional grocery stores.', 'Kabela said her organization serves about 1,000 households per week in-house, and at least another 100 households through its mobile pantry service. The number of egg donations has dwindled in the past couple of years, she said. Now, the 450 dozen eggs it can stock each week barely last a few days.', '""Everybody wants them,"" she said.', 'Eggs are one of the most accessible and affordable forms of protein, especially for low-income Americans. However, the recent spread of avian influenza has diminished egg availability. A high demand for eggs, especially for seasonal baking, also means prices are unlikely to go down anytime soon.', 'US egg prices rose by 15.2% from December to January, the biggest month-over-month increase since June 2015, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average price of a dozen Grade A large eggs hit an all-time high last month, at $4.95 a dozen. And, egg prices contributed to overall inflation rising to 3% year over year in January — contributing to steeper grocery bills for shoppers.', 'This is having a major impact on food banks, which about 50 million Americans relied on in 2023 for at least some of their meals, per the nonprofit food bank network Feeding America.', 'The food banks that BI spoke with said that they stock their shelves with a combination of food they purchase via grants or financial donations and items directly given by community members or suppliers. Eggs are rarely donated and almost always need to be purchased, the organizations said.', 'City Harvest, which provides food to New York City soup kitchens and food banks, told BI that it recently paused all egg purchasing due to rising costs. Director of Procurement and Inventory Controls Max Hoffman said that City Harvest has pivoted to stocking less costly protein sources like peanut butter and ground beef.', ""Similarly, Kate MacDonald — the director of communications at Rhode Island Community Food Bank — told BI in a statement that her organization hasn't been able to purchase eggs since December. The food bank is a central distribution hub for a network of 147 smaller pantries and meal sites across the state, she said."", 'In June 2024, MacDonald said a case of several dozen eggs was $16.50 for the food bank to purchase. In October, it was up to $48. And, in December, she said the cost per case had spiked to $61.50.', '""We will likely not have eggs on the shopping list for our agencies until the cost goes down some,"" MacDonald said.', 'Although Kabela said her Iowa food bank still stocks eggs every week, it is becoming more difficult to meet demand. She said the farm that the bank relied on to provide eggs has largely stopped donating because the bird flu is shrinking its supply.', 'Kabela added that a lack of eggs is especially challenging for food bank patrons because they are so versatile. Protein is vital for muscle and brain function. While a single egg has six grams of protein — compared to about 30 grams for four ounces of chicken — they are among the only protein sources that double as a healthy meat alternative and baking ingredient.', '""We always have shelf-stable protein, whether it be canned tuna or chicken or salmon or peanut butter,"" she said. ""But I don\'t know that anything really takes the place of eggs.""', ""The egg affordability problem sweeping America underscores an ongoing issue for food banks: grocery costs are rising, and national hunger levels aren't getting better."", 'About one in seven US households — or 47 million people — lived in a food insecure household in 2023, the latest data available, Feeding America found. The national food insecurity rate that year was up 38% over 2021.', ""Food banks also play a specific role in combating food insecurity. Social safety programs like SNAP are typically restricted to households that live at or below the federal poverty line, which is $32,150 annually for a family of four. Local food banks and pantries are often the only source of food assistance for low-income Americans who don't qualify for SNAP."", 'Not every food bank is experiencing the same impact of rising food prices. The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts told BI that it has not yet experienced an interruption in stock or a price increase from its egg supplier.', 'Still, Kabela said she continues to see a significant — and growing — reliance on food banks in her community.

Dietary protein plays a key role in cell repair, muscle-building, and immune function.3', '“If you still can afford to include some eggs but just want to stretch them further, try adding cottage cheese and plenty of veggies like steamed broccoli or sauteed zucchini to quiches, omelets, or scrambled eggs to provide bigger portions and extra nutrition,” Debbie Petitpain, MBA, RD, a South Carolina-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Verywell in an email.', 'Greek yogurt, tofu, and peanut butter all contain good amounts of protein.', '“You don’t need eggs in your diet as a protein source if you’re eating a broad base of other things,” said Sherry Gray, MPH, RD, a registered dietitian and a nutrition educator at the University of Connecticut.', 'You may also consider these four high-protein alternatives to eggs.', 'Some high-protein foods, such as canned tuna, have more protein than eggs. A 100 g serving of canned tuna has 19 g of protein, while 100 g of eggs—about two whole eggs—has just 12 g of protein.14 Swap tuna for eggs the next time you want to make an egg salad sandwich.', 'In addition to protein, tuna also provides heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids that help lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.5', 'Tofu is a versatile plant-based food that can replace eggs in scrambles, egg sandwiches, and many other breakfast dishes. Typically, a quarter block of tofu (about 100 g or 3.5 oz) contains between 8 g and 17 g of protein.67', '“A savory tofu scramble with vegetables, seasoning, and cheese can serve as a nice alternative to a traditional egg omelet,” Brianna Poole, MS, RD, LD, a sports dietitian at Memorial Hermann | Rockets Sports Medicine Institute, told Verywell in an email.', 'Tofu contains other nutrients like calcium and magnesium and it’s a safe protein option for most people, except those with soy allergies. While animal studies have raised some concerns about possible health risks related to soy, the evidence does not prove that soy-based foods increase cancer risk in humans. In fact, soy foods may lower the risk of certain cancers, support heart health, and help reduce cholesterol.89', '“Depending on dietary needs, tofu can serve as an excellent plant-based alternative to eggs while still offering high-quality protein,” Poole added.', 'If you want to make a breakfast burrito with fewer eggs, you can use a mixture of black beans and eggs. A half-cup of black beans has about 7 g of protein.10 Combine that with a large egg and you’ll have a protein-rich start to the day.', 'Black beans and other legumes like chickpeas and pinto beans have plenty of fiber to keep you feeling full.11', 'While you may have to get creative with your breakfast menu, try swapping egg dishes for dairy products like Greek yogurt, milk, or cottage cheese.3', 'High-protein dairy sources offer the essential amino acids along with key nutrients like probiotics, vitamin D, calcium, and iodine, according to Renee Korczak, PhD, RDN, CSSD, LD, an assistant professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.', '“[U]sing dairy products in smoothies or pairing Greek yogurt with whole grain toast and fruit, provides balance to a breakfast meal,” Korczak told Verywell in an email.', 'A half-cup of low-fat cottage cheese has 12 g of protein, and a single-serving container of non-fat Greek yogurt has about 16 g of protein.1213', 'Egg shortages and rising prices may make it harder to rely on eggs for protein, but plenty of alternatives can help meet your daily needs.

"The 9 Best Egg Substitutes for Baking, Breakfast Scrambles, and Beyond",https://www.self.com/story/egg-substitutes,"['All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.', 'As the price of a carton continues to soar, interest in egg substitutes has also never been higher as folks everywhere continue to grapple with a grocery tug-of-war: to shell out (sorry) a whole bunch of cash for your regular food order or to find something else to fill that eggy void.', 'Even if you don’t eat them straight up as a plate of scrambled or whipped into a hearty omelet, chances are pretty good you use them in other ways. They play important roles in countless recipes—from providing structure to baked goods to binding your favorite meatballs together. Odds are you’re using them somewhere, and, if you’re watching your grocery budget, you are now left wondering what to do instead.', 'The good news is, there are a lot of options at your disposal. The catch? They’re not all created equally. For instance, the best egg substitute for baking might be totally different from the right alternative for a mock-omelet. So what should you use and when should you use it? We consulted the eggs-perts to find out.', 'The spread of bird flu is the culprit behind both the sudden spike in egg prices and their disappearance from supermarket shelves, as SELF reported previously. Outbreaks of the disease over the last three years have decimated nearly a quarter of the table egg-laying chicken population and brought the affordability and availability of eggs across the country down with it. Producers have less to sell—resulting in shortages—and they’re increasing what they charge for the product they do have to cover the difference.', 'The one silver lining? Cage-free, free-range, and pasture-raised chickens haven’t been hit as hard, so prices for higher-end egg options have remained relatively stable (and now often lower than their regular counterparts!). It’s not that these chickens are less vulnerable to bird flu—in fact, their risk of contracting it is higher because they’re outside where contact with disease-carrying birds is more likely—but rather that they’re raised on a much smaller scale.', 'Even though they’re cheaper, there’s a good chance you still won’t be able to find them in stock as shortages continue to ravage supermarket shelves. That’s where these eggy alternatives come in clutch.', 'When eggs are missing from your fridge, it’s hard not to feel their absence. From providing quick protein to breakfast, lunch, and dinner to being a must-have for great baked goods, it’s easier to think of things eggs can do than what they can’t do.', 'But why exactly is it so hard to find a substitute for eggs that accomplishes all the same feats as the OG? Like many foods, eggs are made up of protein, fat, and water. But it’s the combo of these that make them so special, providing structure, moisture, and richness to baked goods, Ann Ziata, chef at the Institute of Culinary Education’s New York City campus, tells SELF. When combined with flour and sugar and baked, the gooey combo of protein and water found in egg whites prevents the final product from falling apart, and the fat from their yolks add tenderness, flavor, and color. “You’ll often see an extra yolk added to make cakes and brownies richer,” she adds.', 'But they don’t only add structure to sweet foods. In things like meatballs and meatloaf (or vegetarian versions), these same elements bind the ingredients together so they don’t disintegrate when cooked, Cara Harbstreet, MS, RD, of Street Smart Nutrition, tells SELF. What’s more, they keep things moist, which is essential to avoid a dry, dense final product, she says.', 'And eggs do a whole lot more too. Their fat is also used to emulsify sauces like mayonnaise and hollandaise, their proteins can be whipped up to create volume and be used as a leavener in recipes like meringues and sponge cakes, and they cook up into luscious meals like omelets and scrambles without any extra ingredients at all. It’s no wonder we struggle without them.', 'There are a lot of potential egg alternatives, but the rub is that they can’t all be used in the same way or recipes. In order to pick the best one for what you’re working on, you’ll need to evaluate what eggs would normally bring to the dish and opt for a substitution that accomplishes the same feat.', 'For instance, flax seed gel is one of the most recommended egg replacements in baking because it has the protein, fat, and liquid needed to provide structure in a similar way. On the flipside, silken tofu is a better alternative for making something like homemade mayo because it’ll better imitate that creamy texture.', 'It’s also important to note that, while you can get pretty close to authentic with a lot of the egg alternatives out there, there are some instances where you’re going to have to settle for less than perfect. An “egg” scramble made from tofu and seasoned correctly will taste similar to what you know, but don’t expect it to be an exact replica.', 'So what swaps should you keep in your back pocket? Here are all the egg substitutes our experts swear by, plus where and when to use them and common pitfalls to watch out for.', 'Best for: baked goods; binding meatballs', 'Why it works: In baking, Harbstreet says she’ll reach for this vegan egg substitute before any others because it performs almost identically to the real deal and is low-cost and easy to employ. That’s thanks to its equivalent mix of protein, fat, and liquid, which provides the supportive network things like cookies and cakes need to stand on their own. This same aspect also makes it a boon for creating sturdy meatballs and loaves, she says.', 'What’s more, flaxseeds have a subtly nutty flavor that might not make it a great fit for all kinds of savory dishes, but actually pairs well with most sweet treats, Rhyan Geiger, RDN, owner of Phoenix Vegan Dietitian, tells SELF. Don’t have flaxseeds on hand? Making a gel from ground chia seeds will provide a similar effect, but might provide less stability, she says.', 'How to use it: Combine one and one-fourth teaspoon of ground flaxseeds with two to three tablespoons of water. Let soak for a few minutes until a thick gel forms—this will create the equivalent of one egg.', 'Best for: brownies', 'Why it works: Harbstreet recommends these two fruit-based egg substitutions with a caveat: They’ll add moisture and a bit of structure, but not as much as other alternatives, so only use them in baked goods that are intended to be soft and crumbly. That means they work great in brownies—she notes that their sweet flavor complements the chocolate and creates a dense, fudge-like texture as it bakes—but not as well in traditional bread or layer cakes. In those cases, a strong form is absolutely essential, and these subs are missing both the protein and fat that help structure that.', 'How to use it: Open a container of store-bought applesauce, or mash one ripe banana completely. Two to three tablespoons will cover the difference of one egg, so you may need to use between four and six tablespoons in brownies and soft baked cookie recipes where two or more are usually required.', 'Best for: imitation scrambles', 'Why it works: Harbstreet loves this swap for scrambled eggs because firm tofu can be broken apart into crumbles that resemble the size and texture of scrambled eggs. Plus, since tofu is stored in water, you can choose to drain it or not depending on how you normally take your scramble. Prefer a tender soft scramble? Don’t drain the tofu first. Like it on the crispier side? Make sure to press out all the water in advance to get that effect.', 'How to use it: Heat a skillet with a neutral oil, crumble tofu, add when the skillet is hot, and cook with desired seasonings. Ziata notes that you can use spices like turmeric and cumin for flavor and a familiar eggy color.', 'Best for: protein oats, egg-based sauces', 'Why it works: Pairing egg whites with oats is one of our favorite ways to boost the protein in oatmeal without drastically altering its flavor or texture. With or without eggs, you can still accomplish this feat with a little help from silken tofu, says Geiger. If you normally get an extra four or five grams of protein from one to two egg whites, use about one-third of a block of silken tofu to achieve the same goal. The result will be equally creamy and delicious, without taking the focus away from the most important part: the oats!', 'How to use it: Use a whisk to combine one third-block of silken tofu with cooking liquid (water, nut milk, whole milk) until smooth. Combine with oats and cook over a stovetop until thick and creamy. If you’re using it for sauces like hollandaise or mayonnaise, you can go ahead and use the whole package, and combine it with spices like paprika and turmeric to give it an authentic taste and color.', 'Best for: binding meatballs and meatloaf', 'Why it works: The thick, gloopy nature of mashed potatoes and pumpkin puree make them an ideal egg replacement for recipes that require a binding agent—like meatballs, says Harbstreet. Potentially clashing flavors is the only issue that can arise with using a substitution like this, she notes. While mashed potatoes have a relatively neutral taste, only opt for pumpkin puree where it will meld well with the other ingredients at play—say, a recipe that uses warm, autumnal spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, rather than bright zesty flavors like tomato and garlic.', 'How to use it: Add two or three tablespoons to a meatball or meatloaf mix before forming. Using your hands, work the ingredients until they stick together on their own. If the mixture is still very crumbly, add an additional tablespoon until you reach your desired texture.', 'Best for: mock-omelets and frittatas', 'Why it works: Your choices are limited when it comes to finding substitutions for purely egg-based dishes like omelets and frittatas, but Zaita says this one comes pretty darn close. “Chickpea flour has a warm, toasty flavor on its own, but you can add herbs and spices to jazz it up, and you can cook it on the stove in a nonstick pan for a foldable omelet, or bake it like a frittata with vegetable and cheese fillings,” she explains. The final result falls somewhere between a savory pancake and an omelet or frittata, but will satisfy your craving for either in a plant-based way.', 'How to use it: Use a whisk to combine one and one-half cup of chickpea flour with two cups of water. Add veggies, cheese, or spices as desired. Heat a skillet with neutral or olive oil and add the mixture. Cook until it solidifies, then fold for an omelet or leave flat for a frittata.', 'Best for: meringues', 'Why it works: Nothing compares to aquafaba—the glorious liquid byproduct of canned chickpeas—when it comes to vegan egg substitutes for meringues, says Geiger. They whip up nearly identically to actual egg whites, and their structure is just as sturdy, making it ideal for everywhere you would normally use the latter—whether that be in a buttercream frosting, macarons, or even in the foam of a cocktail (or mocktail!).', 'How to use it: Place a sieve over a bowl and drain a can of chickpeas into it. Using a stand or hand mixer, whip the whites for several minutes until you reach soft or stiff peaks. Add two to three tablespoons of sugar for sweetness if desired.', 'Best for: omelets, scrambles', 'Why it works: Although you may not be able to find whole eggs at the store, pasteurized, packaged egg whites are not as hard to come by—and can be used to stretch however few entire eggs you do happen to have on hand, says Harbstreet.', 'How to use it: Combine one whole egg with two eggs worth of whites, plus a bit of cream to bring back the missing richness. Whisk together until combined then cook however you like, whether in scramble, omelet, or steamed form.', 'Best for: omelets, scrambles', 'Why it works: A favorite of backpackers, powdered eggs are another alternative to whole eggs worth considering. Harbstreet says that they taste as good as fresh provided you’ve properly followed the instructions on the container—like rehydrating the eggs with the right amount of water to restore some of the liquid you’d get from fresh eggs, instead of adding the powder straight into your food—but only in dishes like omelets and scrambles where their structure isn’t integral as it is in baked goods. They’re also way less expensive than fresh—price surges or not, you can get a bag that contains the equivalent to 34 eggs for just under $5. Plus: With a much longer shelf-life, they’ll help you out through shortages in the short and long-term.', 'How to use it: Combine one tablespoon of powdered eggs with two tablespoons of water, and let sit for a couple minutes until fully rehydrated—that’ll give you the equivalent of one actual egg.', 'Related:', 'Get more of SELF’s great food coverage delivered right to your inbox—for free.', 'SELF does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

(John Autey / Pioneer Press)', 'After 36 years in the wedding cake business, David Mess said he’s honored to be the preferred vendor at the Como Park Zoo and Conservatory, the downtown Intercontinental Hotel, the University Club on Summit Avenue and other reception sites around St. Paul. What’s a lot less fun? Cracking the ceiling on the price of eggs.', 'Switching up fixed prices within negotiated contracts isn’t something that happens on the fly, so when the cost of bakery staples like eggs and chocolate goes up, as they both have in recent months, Mess more often than not simply eats the added expense, so to speak. Buffeted by the record high cost of eggs in particular, he finally raised his cake prices on Jan. 1.', '“It’s kind of a bummer when you’re a baker,” said Mess, whose long-standing Buttercream Cakes and Desserts business is based on Transfer Road in St. Paul. “All those prices have been pre-determined, so the reception sites, they’re not going to do a surcharge on it.”', '“We did do a price adjustment right after New Year’s, and that’s the only thing we can do,” he added. “For vendors like me, and restaurants that are heavy in the breakfast business, it’s kind of a tough one. If the client is spending $900 on a wedding cake, we’re not really in the business of raising the price beyond that. It’s not like ordering two eggs over easy and a side of sausage at a cafe.”', 'If there were a word for whiplash related to egg prices, economists, retailers and perhaps most of all consumers would be using it — a lot. Whether or not you’ll find it in the dictionary, egg-flation is real — the national average price of a carton of a dozen large Grade A eggs reached an all-time high in January of $4.95, nearly double what it was a year ago at this time, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.', 'For business-to-business wholesalers, prices rose to $7.74 per dozen for large, white shell eggs as of Feb. 14, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.', 'A whole new era has hatched for grocery shoppers, bakeries, restaurants and others feeling a bit egg-xploited by the rising cost of an American staple. Together with the skyrocketing cost of orange juice, coffee and chocolate — blame a citrus tree disease, hurricanes and other climate impacts — and breakfast is about to get a whole lot more expensive.', 'The problem?', 'At least 9% of the U.S. egg-laying flock has been lost to the H5N1 avian influenza virus since its mid-October surge alone, and a major supply state — California — has lost an estimated 90% of its in-state production. The avian flu recently spread into three states that account for as much as one-third of U.S. egg production — Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania — and spring waterfowl migrations are just around the corner, threatening to spread the virus to even more farms.', 'Some predict that egg shortages are likely to get worse before they get better.', '“We’re going through one of the worst outbreaks in history, if not the worst outbreak in history,” said Brian Moscogiuri, a vice president with Eggs Unlimited in Irvine, Calif., one of the largest suppliers of eggs in the nation. “Since the middle of October, we lost more than 42 million egg-laying hens.”', 'Despite the shortage, there’s been no drop in demand, which has fed into higher pricing. Eggs are what’s known as an “inelastic commodity,” meaning consumers may switch up brands but they’ll continue to buy them when prices surge. If anything, “concerns around shortages have created a little bit of panic buying,” Moscogiuri said.', 'At Key’s Cafe and Bakery, co-owner Amy Hunn has responded by dropping key lime pie from her offerings at all nine Twin Cities locations for the time being, given that a batch of pies requires 60 egg yolks. She’s in the process of printing menus with adjusted food prices, and posting a sign in each site’s doorway explaining that each egg will now carry a 50 cent surcharge.', '“Our food provider foresees this continuing for the next months, if not going into 2026,” Hunn said. “They do free printing for us and they said, ‘Adjust your prices.’ … It’s not something we want to do, but we have to make sure we’re not putting ourselves in the ground.”', 'Egg lovers are getting creative. A private company — RentTheChicken.com — offers to connect consumers across the country to suppliers that rent out laying hens and portable coops, with prices ranging from about $500 to $1,000 for a seven-month rental.', 'Some hoped a shift in the political winds would topple egg-flation, but the avian flu doesn’t care about who you voted for at the ballot. Egg prices have actually spiked rapidly since the November election, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts prices could continue to rise as much as 20% over the course of 2025.', '“Your local independent grocers, they’re in the same spot consumers are,” said Minnesota Grocers Association President Patrick Garofalo. “No one is getting rich off this.”', 'Still, some small grocery co-ops say they’ve been able to maintain fairly steady supply and stable pricing by buying local.', 'Matt Hass, general manager of the Hampden Park Co-op on Raymond Avenue in St. Paul, said the grocery gets its eggs directly from two Midwest sources — Larry Schultz Organic Farm in Owatonna, Minn., and a group called Wisconsin Growers, which is an Amish collective in western Wisconsin.', 'In addition, the store’s primary distributor supplies eggs from two national operations — the Farmers Hen House, which is cage-free, and Vital Farms, which goes a step further and advertises its eggs as certified humanely raised.', '“The supply has impacted the national companies,” Hass said. “It’s a little bit spotty on whether we can get those eggs in on a week-to-week basis. We do get delivery of the local eggs in.”', 'Those local eggs have not been immune to the laws of supply and demand. About a month ago, Wisconsin Growers raised prices by about 30 cents per dozen eggs. As a result, the Hampden Co-op now sells their eggs for $4.99, instead of $4.49. So far, store management has been able to keep all egg prices below $5, even as some major grocers in the Twin Cities advertise packages for $7 or more.', 'The eggs that are purchased from a food service distributor and cooked as part of prepared foods at the deli counter are a different story entirely.', '“We saw the case price of those just jump astronomically,” Hass said. “We’re just not buying them from our food service distributor anymore. We’re supplementing (the deli) with our local eggs. They’re basically wholesaling at $11 a dozen. I won’t name names.”', 'Here are a few more things to know about the egg outlook:', 'Around the country, some grocers have taken to rationing their supply or simply maintaining empty shelves. Others use eggs as a loss leader, drawing in customers with lower-than-average prices so they’ll spend money on other goods. Trader Joe’s recently began advertising a carton of eggs for relatively rock-bottom prices, with a sign limiting sales to one carton per person per day. Bulk sellers like Costco and Sam’s Club have set their own limits. Still other retailers simply pass costs directly on to the consumer.', 'Waffle House, a diner chain with locations in Missouri, Indiana, Ohio and the deep South, has taken to adding a 50 cent-per-egg surcharge to its menu.', 'In downtown St. Paul, the Skyway Grill burger-and-breakfast counter in the Securian Building food court on Robert Street began advertising a 75 cent-per-egg surcharge on Feb. 13.', 'The eggs you see on the store shelves are purchased by retailers through a variety of means, from contracts with particular farms or suppliers, to spot markets, where buyers and traders price for immediate delivery. That means the prices retailers pay for their supply will vary based on market conditions — supply and demand — but not every brand will be impacted the same way at the same time.', 'When it comes to determining what price and costs to pass on to you, the consumer, that’s a whole different animal.', '“Each major retailer has different strategies around eggs,” Moscogiuri said. “Some of them may use them as a loss leader. Some of them have lagging price contracts, where they pass along costs more slowly. … There’s varying ways to price: against the market benchmarks, or against long-term moving averages, cost-plus deals, fixed formulas. A lot of that has been negotiated prior to what’s going on here recently.”', 'After all but decimating California’s laying hens, the avian flu has found its way to some of the largest egg-supplying states in and around the Midwest, including Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.', 'In recent weeks, it’s spread rapidly to commercial layer farms, turkey farms, backyard farms, wild birds, and even in some states to cats and dairy herds, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, or CIDRAP, at the University of Minnesota.', 'Cattle can be quarantined for a couple of months and eventually recover, but avian influenza is quickly fatal to birds.', '“We have a number of flyways that go up and down from the Arctic to the south, to the equator,” said veterinarian and epidemiologist Jeff Bender, director of the Upper Midwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center at the University of Minnesota. “We’ve actually seen it across all the flyways. … Through the work we’ve done, we’ve seen it in wild birds coming through in December in Minnesota. The Mississippi flyway, we had a number of reports of bird die-offs or sick birds, and they tested positive.”', 'In a word: Yes.', '“It absolutely is worse than 2015,” said Abby Schuft, program leader for Agricultural and Natural Resources at University of Minnesota Extension. “In 2015, our outbreak was from March to June, and then it was done in the entire United States. We lost 15.1 million birds. Since February 2022, the outbreak has not stopped in the United States. In total, the USDA reports 121 million domestic birds gone. That’s our chicken and our poultry.”', 'Strict hygiene protocols range from requiring workers to wash their hands and switch their boots more frequently, to isolating birds from areas where they might encounter wild waterfowl.', '“There’s going to be a lot of parallels to what people experienced during COVID,” Schuft said. “It’s really difficult to control where wild birds fly, and where they land, but there are certain things we can do to control their lingering on a farm site.”', 'To scare away unwanted feathered visitors, some farmers have taken to using sound cannons. Minnesota turkey farms have begun experimenting with rotating laser lights.', '“The birds see that as a predator, so then they won’t stay and linger for a long time,” Schuft said.', 'Those and other tactics fall under the general title of “biosecurity,” and commercial poultry represents the first industry to be required by the USDA to maintain biosecurity plans if farmers hope to qualify for indemnity payments.', '“Other species may require a plan from the packing plant, but not from the USDA,” Schuft said. “Obviously, it’s not super successful, but without biosecurity we would have way more cases than we already do.”', 'When a farm is confirmed to have “highly pathogenic avian influenza,” the USDA requires that all of its birds must be disposed of and the premises emptied for a minimum of 120 days while environmental samples are taken from the floor, walls and equipment.', '“Some farms have experienced multiple outbreaks,” Schuft said. “If a premises has a subsequent infection, it’s because there’s been a new introduction source, like waterfowl.”', 'After that, it can take months for a chick to mature into a growing hen and begin laying eggs, so repopulating lost laying stock is no fast endeavor.', 'That’s made the avian influenza an especially emotional and financially draining burden for farmers in particular.', '“Some of our largest egg producers are in Ohio and Iowa, and they got hit pretty bad,” Bender said. “It takes time for those facilities to come back online. Usually, it’s about five months.”', '“The physical, emotional, psychological toll is also quite dramatic, and that’s not just on the individual farmers,” Bender added. “It might be on the whole rural community and the feed industry. We’re talking billions of dollars lost now because of this continued outbreak.”', 'Avian flu is still rare, though not unheard of, in humans who likely contracted the virus through direct contact with animals — barn workers, bird hunters and others who encounter wild waterfowl. Experts say infected birds tend to die before they can lay eggs. For the extra cautious, thoroughly cooking eggs until they’re firm, not runny, would guarantee they’re free of pathogens like salmonella.', '“Poultry products are still very safe to eat, ensuring poultry meat is cooked to 165 degrees, and that eggs are cooked, as well,” Schuft said.', 'Otherwise, “eggs are fine,” said Bender. “Probably the biggest risk for dairy farms impacted by influenza is for the workers.”', 'Start your day with us: Our top stories curated & delivered to your inbox each morning.', 'By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and to receive emails from The Pioneer Press.', '', '', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2025 MediaNews Group', ""Hurry, this deal won't last!""]"

Last week, the bakery raised prices for all of its egg-heavy pastries and dishes, which is about a third of the menu. That includes its signature “messy egg sandwich,” which now costs a dollar more.', 'Egg prices are surging nationwide after the ongoing bird flu outbreak led to the culling of tens of millions of chickens last year. That’s forcing many of America’s bakeries to consider raising prices, if they haven’t already done so, while they attempt to figure out how to manage the country’s egg crisis.', '“We’ve really never had to think about the cost of eggs until now,” Auslander said.', 'The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, or bird flu, infected flocks across the country last year, resulting in the deaths of more than 40 million egg-laying birds, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Over the past few weeks, the company has experienced the polar opposite, he said.', 'To meet the surge in demand, the company has ramped up and expedited its orders of ingredients and packaging materials in addition to scheduling extra days of production. That’s cutting into their profit margins, but for now the company isn’t raising prices, in hopes that it will help them gain more permanent customers even after the avian flu situation resolves, said Tetrick.', 'But the headaches lately for bakeries don’t just revolve around eggs. ”None of this is sustainable because we’re also dealing with sky-high cocoa prices,” Simon said. “There’s not much more we can do at this point.”', 'Auslander of Bread Furst said he trained a new staff member last week to make sure they use the entire egg when baking or cooking, even if it means taking more time to shake out the entire contents of the egg before throwing away the shell.', 'Raising prices is usually a tough decision for businesses because it almost always results in losing customers, said Charles Lindsey, a marketing professor at the University at Buffalo School of Management.', 'But, in some cases, it is necessary for a business to survive, and a business can limit how many customers it loses after raising prices if it communicates effectively the reasoning behind it, Lindsey said.', '“It all boils down to how well a business can explain why and how they’re sharing the pain,” Lindsey said. “The last thing you want to do is raise prices and not be transparent about it.”', 'Kerri Francis Bradley, co-owner of D Light Cafe & Bakery in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, DC, said she and her husband have personally absorbed the rising costs of eggs.

Millions of birds have been killed, straining egg supplies for everyone from backyard producers and large commercial farms.', 'Consumer prices for eggs are now at an all-time high with demand still outweighing supply. Some Texas stores have even limited the amount of eggs customers can purchase.', 'As consumers scramble to get eggs without breaking the bank, some are starting their own backyard chicken flocks. Though it doesn’t always result in savings, about 11 million households in the U.S. have backyard flocks, up from about 5.8 million in 2018.', 'Other shoppers are turning to local farmers. The shortage has been a boon for small producers across the country, including North Texas, as consumers seek out alternatives to sparse offerings at grocery stores. With U.S. wholesale prices for cartoned eggs delivered to retailers about $8.23 per dozen as of Feb. 14, the typical premium to buy locally raised eggs from small farms doesn’t seem that much a stretch.', 'Michael Jimenez, who has a pasture-raised egg operation in Wise County, said in early February he gained about 20 new customers in just one week to his subscription business.', '“It’s like, every day it’s another one, or it’s another three, another five. So right now, I can keep up with the demand, so I love it. It’s amazing,” Jimenez said.', 'Jimenez started JMZ Farms in 2022. Located in Bridgeport, about an hour northwest of Fort Worth, the 22-year-old’s farm is now home to 500 hens.', 'Jimenez’s heritage-breed flock lays about 200 rainbow-hued eggs each day. They spend their days wandering in a large pasture surrounded by an electric fence and guarded by dogs Gunner and Apollo, who fend off coyotes and wild birds.', 'Jimenez originally sold his eggs at farmers markets but has since transitioned to a direct-to-consumer business model. His roughly 111 subscribers across the Metroplex can choose to receive four- or six-dozen eggs a month.', 'A dozen eggs is about $13, which includes delivery.', 'Jimenez said commercial egg farming differs significantly from his operation and creates a stressful environment for birds, which can harm egg production. Chickens on commercial farms may not be exposed to sunlight, and even chickens on commercial “pasture-raised” farms don’t live on traditional pastures, like Jimenez’s flock.', 'In January, Jimenez moved his farm from five acres in Colleyville to the 25-acre property in Bridgeport. He plans to build new coops and purchase an additional 500 hens this year. He and his investors have put over $517,000 into the business. Jimenez, the farm’s sole employee, also works full-time as an accountant for Goosehead Insurance in Westlake. He aims to one day make farming his full-time job.', 'Though his customer base is growing, Jimenez does not plan to increase prices. He said the majority of his customers are health-conscious buyers, many of whom are women with children.', '“Once they try my eggs, it’s like they can taste the difference between that and regular store-bought eggs,” he said. “So it’s like, they want JMZ Farms now, they have to have JMZ Farms or it doesn’t taste right.”', 'He and other chicken farmers are concerned about bird flu, but he’s taking measures like making sure his flock has clean food and water and doesn’t come into contact with wild birds. He uses only organic bird feed.', '“Anything is possible, so you always want to make sure you’re being careful no matter what. Of course, you always have a fear that something’s going to happen, but you can only prep, and you just make sure you take the right biodiversity measures, make sure you’re not going in there with dirty boots. You’re doing everything clean,” Jimenez said.', 'Another Wise County farmer, Sandy Horne of Windview Chicken Ranch, describes the egg shortage as a blessing and a curse.', '“It’s good that a lot of people are wanting to come directly to the farm,” Horne said. “We’re seeing a lot of new customers, and that’s a wonderful thing. I always hate when I’m sold out on something, and then I can’t take care of that customer. So in that aspect, it’s bad, because we just can’t produce as much as what the demand is right now.”', 'Horne sells her eggs at Windview’s farm store, which also offers chicken, beef and locally produced items like bread and salsa. Eggs are one of the most popular products.', '“It’s funny, if I’m sold out of eggs, I have customers that will wait until I have eggs back in stock to come, and then they’ll buy the eggs and they’ll buy the meat,” Horne said.', 'Horne does a few egg subscriptions, but says she’s wary of offering more in case she’s unable to fulfill orders. Unlike commercial farms, she doesn’t put her chickens under lights to prevent their natural molting cycles, during which hens typically lay fewer eggs.', '“We just try to do everything as natural as possible, and give the animals the best life that they can have while they’re here in as natural of a setting as we can provide for them,” Horne said.', 'Her 11-acre farm near Boyd about a 40-minute drive from Fort Worth, is home to between 250 and 300 egg-laying hens and 900 to 1,500 chickens raised for meat. The land adjoins her parents’ 140-acre property — her family has called Boyd home for almost 30 years.', 'Horne’s birds lay about 100 eggs a month, but she expects that number to reach 150 to 175 as the days lengthen.', 'Horne keeps her chickens raised for meat and egg-laying birds separated, but both flocks spend time outdoors every day, which she said helps keep them healthy. To protect against bird flu, she is limiting the number of people who enter her chicken coop, keeping the environment clean and feeding her flock high-quality food.', 'Horne said the threat of bird flu is worrisome, but many farmers who are taking precautions are not living in fear of the virus.', 'Farming costs have gone up significantly since Horne got her first chicken in 2020. A 50-pound bag of feed is about $4 more than was four years ago; Horne uses about 4 tons per month.', 'Horne has raised prices due to higher expenses, most recently in December when her eggs went from $6.50 to $7 per dozen.', 'Customers have remained loyal, and new customers seeking local eggs have boosted business. Windview’s farm store now limits shoppers to four or six dozen eggs after some wanted large orders that would have depleted her stock.', 'Expanding to meet demand is no easy task — chicks take about five to six months to start producing. Horne aims to get another 50 to 100 birds and is building a new coop that will be able to house about 60 chickens. She said her operation would likely reach maximum capacity at 400 to 500 egg-laying hens.', 'The virus, which originated in wild birds, sparked the outbreak when it began spreading to domesticated fowl. Over 1.8 million birds in Texas have been affected since then, almost all of which were at a commercial farm in Parmer County, according to the USDA. The agency reports that no cases have been detected in Texas flocks since Jan. 9. Bird flu was detected in small backyard flocks in Dallas, Denton, Rockwall and Ellis counties in 2022 and 2023.', 'Bird flu began infecting dairy cattle last year; there have been 27 confirmed cases of the virus in dairy cows in Texas since March 2024, USDA data shows.', 'Some humans have also been infected, but experts say those who work on farms or with livestock are primarily at risk. Since March 24, 68 cases have been detected in humans, one of whom was in Texas.', 'Greg Archer, a professor and poultry extension specialist at Texas A&M University, said the bird flu virus doesn’t survive well at temperatures above 90 degrees, which may have stopped some of the spread in Texas.', 'There are no known commercial outbreaks in Texas at the moment, but Archer said experts are concerned that wild migrations this spring could cause the virus to spread. One of the top five egg producing states, Texas produces about 6.6 billion eggs annually.', 'Archer hopes prices will start lowering later this year, but it will take time to return to the level seen before the outbreak of bird flu. Farmers of broilers are also worried about a worsening outbreak, though price increases from culling those birds have not yet hit consumer wallets.', '“We have a lot of chickens here, so if it hits us, it could become pretty bad,” Archer said.', '', 'Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.', 'Part of the McClatchy Media Network']"

Shoppers are scaling back on egg consumption or looking for egg alternatives amid safety concerns about bird flu and the subsequent all-time-high prices. Consumers are paying nearly double for a carton of eggs in recent weeks. We\'re dealing with the rising costs in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen, too. One recipe tester had to shell out $12 for a dozen, while another cook exclaimed, ""I\'ve been out of eggs for over a week! I\'m never out of eggs!""', 'Even if you’re determined to continue buying eggs, you may find stores have bare shelves or limits on how many cartons each customer can purchase. Why? People are stockpiling eggs, similar to toilet paper during COVID, for fear that prices will continue to skyrocket.', ""If you're not among those panic-buying eggs, you can easily find suitable egg substitutes for baking, whether due to allergy concerns, scarcity or you’re simply priced out. Another silver lining: Most of the replacements are ingredients you probably already have on hand, and are likely more affordable than eggs."", 'First, do you actually need to replace egg in a recipe?', ""Baking is a delicate web of ingredients — removing one would be like recklessly pulling out the lynchpin in a Jenga tower — and eggs are incredibly important for a number of reasons. An egg, in particular, has several roles that are crucial to a recipe’s success. It adds richness and moisture, like in a brioche. It can serve to thicken and emulsify, as in a cheesecake. The oven heats up the egg’s protein, creating structure for cakes, muffins and bars. When beaten, eggs provide leavening fluff — case in point: a soufflé. If you’ve ever forgotten to add eggs to a cake batter, then you know all too well the end result is a dense, structureless puck that crumbles faster than a house of cards. So if you don't or can't use egg, you definitely need a substitute."", 'We wanted to compare the different types of egg substitutes side-by-side, so we fired up the ovens in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen. To eliminate variables, we used the same boxed brownie mix to test each egg alternative. We also baked one batch with a real egg as the control to compare with the other versions. We kept all other conditions the same, including the type of baking pan, oven temperature and cooling time. We did adjust the baking time per the package directions, which cued to remove the brownies from the oven “when the center is set and edges have begun to pull away from sides of pan.” The bake time for our control brownies was 40 minutes.', 'We judged the results of each bake based on the following criteria:', 'Appearance', 'Texture', 'Taste', 'Baking time', 'For all tests, we started with a box of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Brownie Mix, which called for one egg and yielded chewy, fudgy brownies when baked according to the package directions. Noticeable right away was the appearance of all the egg substitute brownies. They were much darker and shinier than the control, which had a matte finish and a more reddish chestnut brown color. Some versions were crustier or had deep crags or serious caving — things to keep in mind for your own baking trials.', 'While we tried this for brownies specially, our experts say these substitutes should work for cakes, cookies, muffins and pancakes too!', 'Appearance: Pleasingly crinkled top and deep mahogany color', 'Texture: Crustier edges with fudgy interior', 'Taste: Similar to the control, the chocolate flavor shined through', 'Baking time: 35 minutes', 'By far, the closest to the control brownies in terms of color, flavor and texture. One taste tester even said, “I kind of like these brownies better than the ones made with egg.”', 'Appearance: Espresso color with the shiniest, most crackled top; did not rise as high as the control', 'Texture: A noticeable crunch on top', 'Taste: Muted sweetness but no discernable “bean” flavor', 'Baking time: 42 minutes', 'Aquafaba was our second favorite replacement. It was also the least expensive, considering it’s an upcycled ingredient that most people would toss after draining a can of chickpeas. However, it did not rise as high as the control and was among the shallowest of the brownies.', '1/4 cup applesauce', 'Appearance: lightly crackled on top and coffee brown color', 'Texture: wetter, less crumbly interior', 'Taste: a little sweeter', 'Baking time: 35 minutes', ""Applesauce was our middle of the road substitute for egg.
