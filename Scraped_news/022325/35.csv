Consequently, all RTX 5090s may potentially ship with fewer ROPs than advertised, including Nvidia‚Äôs own Founders Edition design. The China-exclusive RTX 5090D is no exception either, being powered by the GB202 chip at its core.', 'RTX 5090s supplied to independent reviewers had their die stamped with the term ‚ÄúPress Build‚Äù.

Even so, retailers are still putting customers on hold for up to 14 weeks to secure an RTX 5090.', 'So far, GPUs from MSI, Manli, Zotac, Gigabyte, and Nvidia‚Äôs own Founders Edition model have reported instances of reduced ROP counts.

It's also been confirmed with the MSI RTX 5090D for the China market (via HXL). Before you grab your pitchforks, this issue does not affect every RTX 5090, so that's a sigh of relief.

This isn't likely to be a driver bug as the user reportedly reinstalled drivers and even switched BIOS versions, but the problem persisted. Coincidentally, TPU's own sample also exhibited a similar discrepancy, with 168 ROPs instead of the expected 176, a delta of 4.5%, as can be seen in the attached GPU-Z screenshot."", ""ROPs, short for Render Output Unit or Raster Operations Pipelines, is a hardware component on your GPU responsible for blending colors, performing anti-aliasing, and transactions between the framebuffer. Essentially, all pixel data that is to be displayed has to go through the ROPs before it can be written to the GPU's memory. On Blackwell, each top-level GPC contains 16 ROPS. The full-fat GB202 chip is equipped with 12 GPCs or 192 ROPS, however, the binned GB202 variant we find on a typical RTX 5090 comes with 176 ROPs; corroborated by the white paper."", ""To gauge the performance difference, TPU ran several tests, witnessing an up to 11% loss in 3DMark Time Spy Extreme versus the RTX 5090 FE, confirming that this isn't just a typical software reporting error. Not all games are affected equally by the reduced ROP count; however, the issue is still apparent, with an up to 8.5% performance loss in Elden Ring. In titles like Starfield and DOOM Eternal, the FPS loss isn't that noticeable, but this is completely unacceptable for a $2,000 GPU."", ""Zotac has not yet commented on the matter. If the ROPs are hardware-disabled, Nvidia likely fused them off during production and there isn't much that can be done at this point. Around the same time 10 years ago, Nvidia was in hot water for misleading GTX 970 VRAM specs. The fact is, Nvidia's white paper clearly states 176 ROPs for this GPU, and that's the number end-users reasonably expect to receive on their unit."", ""If the issue is not fixable through software, the most viable solution would be a recall or replacement.

The issue itself is rumored to be linked to the ""Blackwell"" GB202 chip, and it results in a reduced number of Render Output Units (ROPs), which leads to very significant performance degradation. The problem first came to light with reports of RTX 5090 cards showing fewer ROPs than expected in the GPU-Z monitoring software.', ""Initially, it was thought that it could be a bug‚Äîafter all, NVIDIA did make some pretty tall promises when it launched the card, so it could have just been that the hardware is falling short of those promises. However, further investigation, including testing with HWINFO, confirmed the ROP reduction, indicating a more serious underlying problem. A reduced number of ROPs can limit a GPU's ability to render final images, impacting performance. The source of the issue, according to reports, points to defects within the GB202 chip itself, the core of the RTX 5090. The problem seems limited to a small number of units at this early stage, but it's also not restricted to a specific manufacturer, so we could have this on cards from basically all third-party manufacturers as well as NVIDIA's own Founders Edition."", ""It is still unknown if the problem extends to other models like the RTX 5080. It's also not clear right now if NVIDIA will be offering RMA replacements or refunds for affected units‚Äîor even worse, if it's too widespread, it might end up having to do a recall. If you managed to spend a lot of money on an RTX 5090, you might want to check whether it's performing as it should or not.
