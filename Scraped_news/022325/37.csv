DSOGaming,https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/oblivion-remake-in-skyrim-skyblivion-gets-new-40-minute-gameplay-video/,"['The team behind the highly anticipated remake of Oblivion in Skyrim, Skyblivion, has shared a new 40-minute gameplay video from it. This video will give you a glimpse at the latest build of this total conversion mod. As such, I highly recommend watching it.', 'Skyblivion aims to bring The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to a new generation of gamers and welcome back longtime fans of the series. This cool mod will work with both Skyrim Legacy Edition and Skyrim Special Edition. It’s one of the most exciting mods out there, showing what modders can do when they put their minds to it. And, even in its WIP state, it looks great.', 'When Skyblivion comes out, you’ll be able to pick and choose what parts you want to install. You can decide to install things like Landscaping, Interiors, City improvements, and Weapons/Armor. In theory, this will allow the team to finish the mod more quickly. It’s like customizing your game the way you want it.', 'Skyblivion has been in the works for some time, and its team is aiming to release it in 2025. Yep, you read that right. We will finally be able to test a version of this mod in 2025.', 'Ironically, it’s been rumored that Bethesda is working on an official remake of Oblivion. So, I’m curious to see which one of them will be better. Will Skyblivion be the definitive version of Oblivion? Or will the official remake manage to overshadow it?', 'When it comes to big mods for Skyrim, there are some cool ones you can grab right now. Wyrmstooth is like an expansion with new quests and dungeons. There’s also a mod that brings stuff from The Witcher games into Skyrim. Dragon Hall Tavern is another big 2GB mod that gives you more quests, places to explore, and even an arena. And don’t forget about Land of Vominhem and Legacy of the Dragonborn. You might also want to try this mod inspired by Castlevania, or the one that adds the cool Nemesis system from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. And last but not least, check out this DLC-sized Mod that adds six awesome new islands to explore.', 'Enjoy and stay tuned for more!', '', 'John is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.

"“It's modding on steroids” Skyblivion project lead talks progress towards a 2025 release, those official Oblivion remake rumours, and if Fallout: London offers any lessons",https://www.vg247.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-remake-mod-lead-interview-c3,"['The massive Skyrim mod that\'ll offer a revamped take on The Elder Scrolls 4 being ""nearly in a releasable state is a miracle"", says its lead dev.', ""We should finally get to play Skyblivion this year. The massive modding project that’s remaking The Elder Scrolls IV in Skyrim’s engine has been in the works since 2012, and now it's seemingly on the home stretch."", ""It's not had a full release date penned in yet, but we'll be getting to see a bit more of it via a showcase from the Skyblivion team at a fan-run Bethesda community event called Community Creations Con - or C3 - this weekend. So, ahead of that, VG247 caught up with the massive mod's project lead, Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel, to ask a few questions about how things are going for the project as it builds to that 2025 release."", '""I am feeling good about our progress, everyone is pulling their weight and focussing on the last pillars we need to overcome [to make a release possible],"" the modder tells me, ""Of course, with this being a volunteer project we can\'t guarantee this level of commitment throughout the year, but for now we are on the right track.""', ""Naturally, as rumours about an official Elder Scrolls 4 remake or remaster - something that was mentioned in an internal Microsoft document leaked during the company's legal battle with the FTC in 2023 - have continued to crop up and circulate, Rebel and the Skyblivion team have receieved plenty of messages from fans wondering what such a thing potentially being real could mean for the modding project."", '""I think whether the rumours are true or not doesn\'t affect us much,"" the project lead says, ""If they are true I hope it will give people even more of a reason to try out our iteration of it. If it\'s not true then this will be the best way to re-experience the game [with] a new coat of paint.', '""At the end of the day, we are not trying to sell a game and make a profit. I dedicated 10+ years to bring this game to the fans and I feel this is a typical case of \'ït\'s about the journey, not the destination\'. The fact Skyblivion is nearly in a releasable state is a miracle, as we all went into this blindly and in some cases failed our way to the finish line. There are at least four major events that could have easily wrecked the project and caused it to be abandoned, but we\'re still here.', '""I am just excited to be able to see everyone’s hard work pay off and as a bonus see others finally playing this. I often think about how I would have been able to release this mod years ago [if I\'d had] all the knowledge we have now, but unfortunately that\'s not the way life works. You achieve your goals through hard work, failure and the rare breakthrough, which we ended up doing.""', 'In terms of whether Skyblivion can learn anything that might help with its own release from massive Fallout 4 mod Fallout: London, which came out last year following delays - some of which its developers could do nothing to prevent - and was plagued by some pretty serious bugs prior to patches arriving, Rebel says the answer is ""yes and no"".', '""FOLON is a very impressive mod, but it\'s apples and oranges in lots of ways,"" he explains, ""Distribution of the mod has always been a big discussion internally and FOLON\'s release definitely made us think of alternative ways to let people access the game when the time comes.""', ""Finally, since I'd recently seen Bethesda Game Studios acknowledge Skyblivion's upcoming C3 stream in a tweet from its official account, I asked the modder if Skyblivion's team has had any communication from the studio, since Fallout: London's leads were pretty open last year about not getting as much as they'd have ideally liked."", '""We have had plenty of contact with Bethesda over the years,"" Rebel says, ""I\'d like to think we are on very good terms with them. Generally speaking, Bethesda has been one of the most supporting communities when it comes to modding, so it only makes sense to support behemoths such as our project that in a lot of ways encapsulate everything Bethesda\'s games stand for.', '""We are a multicultural group of fans from all over the world that came together to make something unreasonably complicated and far fetched. It\'s modding on steroids.""', ""As mentioned earlier, that unreasonably complicated and far fetched thing is currently set to open its Oblivion gates to players before this year's out, so here's hoping Rebel and the Skyblivion folks are able to navigate the tricky roads ahead on their modding adventure through Cyrodiil."", 'Fallout: London', 'Video Game', 'Skyblivion', 'Video Game', '', '', '', '', 'Think you know Fallout?', 'Take our quiz and prove it!', ""VG247 is owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis. © 2025 Gamer Network Limited, 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

Massive Oblivion remake mod Skyblivion shows off the final region its devs have just finished laying the foundations of in new gameplay at C3,https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remake-mod-skyblivion-shows-off-final-region-new-gameplay-c3,"[""The Skyrim modding project's level of growing polish as it marches forward towards release later this year really stuck out here."", 'Skyblivion, the massive modding project that’s remaking The Elder Scrolls IV in Skyrim’s engine, has just shown off some fresh quest gameplay at C3 (Community Creations Con) ahead of its 2025 release.', ""What was intended to be about half an hour of quest gameplay turned into about 40 minutes, but hey, sometimes you just walk into a building and an NPC you're used to being in one place has decided to cheekily sit out of the way."", ""As you'd expect given the Skyblivion team hit the major milestone of finishing up landscaping work on the final region of Cyrodiil they had to finish that key stage for - the Niben Basin and Valley - earlier this week, the gameplay shown off this time mainly focused on the area in and around the city of Cheydinhal."", ""We got quick runthroughs of two quests - the Fighters Guild one that tasks you with resolving Biene Amelion's debt and a true classic in the form of 'A Brush with Death'. If the latter's name doesn't ring a bell, it's the one that sees you walk into dark elf Rythe Lythandas' painted world in order to free the poor artist with the magic brush."", ""In both cases, the thing that really stuck out was just how detailed and polished Skyblivion's worldspaces and the stuff contained within them looks at this point in development. At one point, project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel just did the walk into Cheydinhal I've done a million times in both vanilla and modded Oblivion, and it brought a smile to my face to see how well it seems the team has maintained the nostalgic soul of the thing, while filing away some of its rougher, more 2006 edges."", ""The painted world itself was a great example of this - playing vanilla Oblivion in 2025, it feels like a little room that might not be too special if it wasn't able to lean into the game's already very oil paintingy aesthetic to form something visually special. In Skyblivion, it's a longer, more fully fleshed-out dungeon that packs a similar visual punch despite Skyrim's more realistic art style, and ends in an environment deliberately textured to look just like unpainted canvas."", ""Another detail worth picking out here was the mod's new interaction menu UI, which has been overhauled into something unique that brings a lot more Oblivion vibes to help offset the more Skyrim-style inventory, compass, and map the mod has - as you'd expect, given it's running in TES V. Also, while battling skeleton enemies, you may suddenly realise you've just killed one with a tail. Why? Well, because the modders have put together unique skeletons for elves and best races, which is a step beyond even Skyrim."", 'There\'s still no concrete release date for the mod to narrow down the general 2025 window it\'s had for a little while, but the modders did reiterate in this showcase: ""We are confident we can get it out this year"".', ""What did you think of this latest look at Skyblivion?
