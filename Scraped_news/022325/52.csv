He was also enjoying a six-fight win streak while being an active double-champion, as he also laid claim to UFC’s Flyweight title. But, two weeks later, “Triple C” dropped a bombshell announcement, revealing he had retired from the sport. After returning three years later, he ran into Aljamain Sterling, who defeated him via split decision at UFC 288. Then, at UFC 298 nine months later, he was dominated by Merab Dvalishvili, giving him his second-ever, two-fight losing streak. That’s a drastic fall from a man who was considered one of the best in the business. Now, he will look to avoid a third straight loss against a dangerous contender who sits just one spot behind him in UFC’s rankings.', 'That man is none other than Song Yadong, who is coming off a tough loss to Petr Yan at UFC 299.', 'Song is 5-2 in his last seven fights. His two biggest wins have come against Marlon Vera and Marlon Moraes, but taking out Cejudo will trump those rather easily despite “Triple C’s” recent struggles. Obviously, Yadong will have to be cautious of Cejudo’s world-class wrestling skills. That said, Cejudo has been pretty content with staying on the feet, which will give Yadong opportunities to strike and land ... and possibly pull off a huge win. Still, one can’t help but to feel that this fight isn’t moving the Space Needle because, let’s face it, Cejudo isn’t the same draw he once was.', 'RELATED', 'All the injuries and last-minute changes. Indeed, this fight card started off looking promising, but it took one hit after another ... after another, leaving it looking like a shell of its former self.

A few days later, “The Dominator” decided it was time to call it a career once and for all. Stepping in to take his place is Jean Matsumoto. Also, Edson Barboza was forced out of his 145-pound showdown against Steve Garcia with an undisclosed injury, prompting officials to yank Garcia from the event altogether.', 'If that were not enough, Macy Chiasson was in line to face Ketlen Vieira before she was forced out of the event with an undisclosed injury. Plus, Welterweight promotional newcomer, Islam Dulatov, withdrew from his fight against Adam Fuggit fight due to an undisclosed injury and was replaced by Billy Goff; however, that new fight was axed after Fuggit suffered an injury of his own.', 'RELATED', 'Austin Vanderford got his chance to shine on UFC’s big stage unexpectedly, getting a last-minute call to face Nikolay Veretennikov on short notice. After ending his Bellator run with two straight defeats, Vanderford secured a much-needed win under the Legacy Fighting Alliance (LFA) banner, defeating Victor Romero via first round technical knockout.

That was good enough to earn him a contract in the big leagues, and will now face Mansur Abdul-Malik, another Contender Series alum who made good on his debut by defeating Dusko Todorovic via first round technical knockout in Nov. 2024. That win improved his record to 7-0, 1-0 UFC, six of those coming by way of first round stoppage.', 'RELATED', 'After racking up six straight stoppage wins, five in the first round, Julius Walker got the call up to the big show. In his first challenge, he will face long-time veteran, Alonzo Menifield, in a Light Heavyweight contest in the opening fight of the main card. Menifield is currently on a two-fight skid, so he needs a win pretty badly if he doesn’t want to be the next man to get cut to make way for all of the new talent UFC is acquiring.', 'Six years after making his professional debut, Eric McConico will finally get to show off his skills on the biggest MMA stage of them all. After suffering back-to-back losses in 2019, McConico stormed back to win his last five in a row. He will battle Nursulton Ruziboev, who saw his 10-fight win streak go up in smoke after running into Joaquin Buckley last summer.', 'RELATED', 'Raffael Cerqueira got off to a rough start to his UFC career, losing to Ibo Aslan in just 51 seconds back in Oct. 2024 (see it again here).

As for his opponent, Melquizael Costa, he is coming off a submission win over Nuerdanbieke Shayilan.', 'Ibo Aslan, meanwhile, has got off to a great start to his UFC career, winning his first two fights with the promotion via technical knockout. He also scores a first round technical knockout win on Contender Series, which earned him his contract. All told, he is on a six-fight win streak and will attempt to reach lucky No. 7 against Ion Cutelaba, who is 2-4 in his last six UFC fights, though he is coming off a split decision win over Ivan Erslan.', 'RELATED', 'Ricky Simon started his UFC career with an impressive 8-2 run, defeating the likes of Jack Shore, Raphael Assuncao and even submitted current Bantamweight champion, Merab Dvalishvili, early in his career. But, things have gone pretty badly for him over the last few years, losing three in a row with his last win coming in July 2022. He will attempt to snap his skid when he takes on Javid Basharat, who suffered the first loss of his career at the hands of Aiemann Zahabi in his last fight.

He has a tough out because Anthony Hernandez is scorching hot with six straight wins. Five of those wins have been stoppages, including submitting Roman Kopylov at UFC 298 (highlights), and then knocking out Michel Pereira seven months later rather viciously (see it again here).

Yadong kicked Cejudo low and later flagrantly poked him in the eyes.', 'As Yadong attempted to throw a left hand late in the third, his fingers were open and he poked Cejudo in both eyes. The left eye was the one that absorbed most of the damage, and Cejudo said he was blinded.', 'Cejudo took the full five minutes allotted for recovery.', 'When the action resumed, there was 1:16 left in the third round. Cejudo was desperate because he was unable to see anything coming from Yadong’s right. He basically sprinted around the Octagon to try to get out of the round to buy more time to recover.

He had the ability to do so but chose not to and so Yadong walked away with a technical decision victory that didn’t sit well with anyone.', '“That’s not what I wanted. I’m sorry,” Yadong said. “He’s a legend and we should run it back.”Cejudo said he was down for that and when someone noted he was 38 years old, he showed he hadn’t lost his sense of humor.', '“Thirty-eight years young,” Cejudo corrected.', 'Despite the way it ended, Cejudo didn’t look anything like the guy who  won UFC titles at flyweight and bantamweight and was successful enough to call himself the greatest combat sports athlete of all-time.', 'He wasn’t getting worked over, and against a lesser opponent than a quick and athletic 27-year-old, he might have been in command.', 'He was a step slow and as a result, he wasn’t able to get in on Yadong to use his wrestling. More often than not, Yadong beat Cejudo to the punch.', 'Cejudo’s best round was the third, at least up until the point he was poked.', 'But he was 0 for 3 in takedown attempts and nearly was really close to getting one. Had he been able to get it to the ground, the fight would have taken a different tenor. Cejudo has a massive advantage in grappling.', 'But as in his first two bouts after ending his two-plus-year retirement, Cejudo was a half-step slow. At the highest level, that’s a massive amount.', 'He was ranked seventh in the bantamweight division despite not having won since he finished Dominick Cruz at UFC 249 in a title fight in Jacksonville, Fla., on May 9, 2020.', 'The loss likely drops him out of the Top 10. He has no realistic path to the championship at this point, given that it seems logical he’d need at least three successive wins to position himself for a shot.', 'Some legends in other sports have stayed around far too long and they struggled so much at the end, it was hard not to feel sorry for them.', 'Cejudo is certainly not at that point, but he’s an Olympic gold medalist, a highly decorated amateur wrestler and among the greatest MMA fighter of all-time.', 'It’s sad to think he’d come back to fight young guys trying to build a reputation off of his name.', 'He’s got a huge decision to make and he seemed to be leaning toward taking Yadong up on his offer of a rematch.', 'Time, though, is not on his side. In life, he’s a young man with a lot to look forward to in his future. In fighting, he’s a grizzled veteran desperately trying to remain relevant.', 'It’s never an easy decision to walk away from something you’ve not only done your entire life, but also have done better than just about anyone to ever do it.', 'Father Time hasn’t lost yet and it doesn’t look like he will any time soon.', '', '', '', '', '']"

There's a chance he looks like a moderate favorite if the mat returns come easily."", ""I've still got Basharat 57.2% likely to win this fight with almost no finishing equity, but that means Simon shows value at +190. Similar to last week's close statistical loss with Julia Avila, this is a value dart more than a true pick to win."", 'Melquizael Costa barely squeaks into model-eligible range with 41:56 of octagon time so far.

The former Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling is an outstanding mat player, and his knockdown rate (0.70%) and great striking D (60%) show comfort on the feet."", ""Meanwhile, Yadong's entire case for being a heavy favorite is based on potential at 27. On paper, Yadong is 1-3 inside the bantamweight rankings, and the one victory was a controversial decision over Chito Vera (15-9 UFC)."", ""Analytically, Yadong's striking accuracy (46%) and defense (55%) are lower than Cejudo's with the grappling edge known to be in the underdog's direction."", ""This line is mostly about age and recent records.

All UFC odds are via the DraftKings Sportsbook and are accurate as of the post date of this article. "", 'Ibo Aslan (14-1) vs Ion Cutelaba (18-10-1)', ""Ibo Aslan vs Ion Cutelaba is a fight that likely won't last long, but I like Aslan to get the win and finish Cutelaba early."", 'Aslan is 2-0 in the UFC with two knockout wins, while Cutelaba is 2-3 in his last five and has struggled as of late. Cutelaba has been knocked out in three of his nine losses, and Aslan has legit power.', 'Aslan should be able to swarm Cutelaba early and get the finish. To me, Aslan should be above -200, so this is a good spot to get him at -175.', 'UFC Seattle Bet: Ibo Aslan (-175)', 'Rob Font (21-8) vs Jean Matsumoto (16-0)', 'Rob Font was supposed to face Dominick Cruz but now takes on Jean Matsumoto in a 140-pound catchweight bout due to the fact Matsumoto took it on short notice.', 'Font turned back the clock last time out, as he beat Kyler Phillips and looked good. This is a massive step up in competition for Matsumoto, who did struggle with Brad Katona at times in his last fight.', ""Font should be able to keep this standing, as Matsumoto has good takedown defense and is also a great boxer. Expect Font to outland Matsumoto and piece him up with his jab to get the win. I'd go as far as saying I think Font should be a slight favorite here."", 'UFC Seattle Bet: Rob Font (+136)', 'Alonzo Menifield (15-5-1) vs Julius Walker (6-0)', ""For my prop at UFC Seattle, I'm taking Alonzo Menifield and Julius Walker to go under 1.5 rounds."", ""This fight was made on short notice, so how either of their cardio will hold up is a big question. With that said, both should come out aggressive and look to end it early. Menifield's chin has been a bit questionable as of late, while Walker has gone under 1.5 rounds in all six of his fights."", 'Menifield and Walker should slug it out until one of them gets knocked out, and I expect that to happen in the first round.', 'UFC Seattle Bet: Alonzo Menifield-Julius Walker under 1.5 rounds (-135)', 'Modestas Bukauskas (16-6) vs Raffael Cerqueira (11-1)\nAnthony Hernandez (13-2) vs Brendan Allen (24-6)', ""For my parlay at UFC Seattle, I'm backing Modestas Bukauskas and Anthony Hernandez to get their hands raised."", 'Bukauskas opens up the card and should be able to put away Cerqueira here. Bukauskas is a good striker with some power, while Cerqueira was knocked out in 50 seconds in his UFC debut. I have some concerns about his chin, and I believe Bukauskas should be able to land and KO Cerqueira in within the first round.', ""To close out the parlay, I'm backing Anthony Hernandez to beat Brendan Allen in the co-main event. The two fought back in LFA, and Hernandez won a five-round decision back in 2018. Hernandez is a great grappler and pushes an insane pace. He should be able to pressure Allen and land more strikes, as well as use his wrestling to win a decision."", 'UFC Seattle Bet: Modestas Bukauskas & Anthony Hernandez parlay (-123)', ""Here is a recap of my best UFC picks for this weekend's UFC Seattle card."", 'If you prefer to deposit at a sportsbook via PayPal, RotoWire has an up-to-date list of all the top-rated PayPal betting sites in one place.

UFC Seattle Preview and Predictions: The MMA Mashup,https://www.rotowire.com/mma/article/ufc-seattle-the-mma-mashup-90340,"['UFC Seattle Preview and Predictions: The MMA Mashup', ""While the early portion of this card may resemble a regional event, UFC Seattle features 12 intriguing bouts from which we can potentially profit. We'll break down all fights across three platforms, including an exciting mainstay at light heavyweight, and a knockout prop that is out of this world. Our betting line this week comes from the RotoWire MMA betting page and is accurate to the post date of this article."", 'The husband of Paige VanZant may be a punchline in some circles, but he has built a wrestle-boxing game that works when paired with his aggressiveness and superior cardio. Nikolay Veretennikov is a powerful striker and grappler but can be incredibly wild and inactive. This should present many different avenues for Vanderford to pick up a win in his debut.', 'Ibo Aslan\'s quick and violent finish of Raffael Cerqueira in October didn\'t do much to assuage my fears that his lack of athleticism and agility will hurt him in the UFC. Cutelaba will put the Turkish fighter on the back foot, forcing him into uncomfortable positions. He has also cleaned up his striking in recent bouts, giving ""The Hulk"" another line of attack aside from his power wrestling.', 'Hernandez was my middleweight choice to be champion at the end of the year, so it should be no surprise that he gets the nod from me here. The fight between ""Fluffy"" and Brendan Allen is a rematch of one that took place under the LFA banner in 2018, in which Hernandez outscrambled ""All In"" for the better part of 15 minutes. Though that fight was many years ago, I expect a similar result here, as Allen still gives up position trying to go for submissions and should get outpaced due to the better gas tank of Hernandez.', 'Both Fili and Melquizael Costa can commit to wrestling attacks, but the latter\'s defense rate (52 percent) leaves plenty to be desired. We saw how doggedly Fili tried to get the takedown in the right circumstance during his bout with Cub Swanson, and I don\'t think ""Touchy"" will want to stand at range with an explosive striker like Costa. ', 'Time has been unkind to Henry Cejudo, as the Olympic gold medalist has been taken down nine times in his last two fights. While these opponents were elite grapplers, ""Triple C"" gets noticeably fatigued as fights wear on, which should allow a fighter like Song to bring him to the ground. Cejudo doesn\'t seem to have the same power that marked his resurgence at flyweight, which makes me wonder how he will find victory here.', ""Ricky Simon's effectiveness as a wrestler seems to have waned with time, but this is too large of a total for someone who is going to try to take the fight to the ground as often as possible. Basharat likes to pressure his opponents behind the black line, which means that Simon will never be too far from his opponent's hips."", ""A similar dynamic exists in our next selection, as Julius Walker's career on the regional scene has consisted of wrestling almost exclusively. Menifield will have such a speed advantage here that if this fight doesn't go to the ground, I expect him to knock Walker out. Either outcome should be advantageous for our play."", ""I am not confident that Mansur Abdul-Malik will be the finisher he was on the regional scene, and a quick dusting of the defense-free Dusko Todorovic in his organizational debut doesn't say much for his prospects overall. Klein is good at keeping range when he is not grappling and should be able to prod and poke his way past this total."", ""Bukauskas tends to fight in bursts and lean on his counterpunching, which may explain why his last two finishes have come in the third round or later. This style will likely lull Raffael Cerqueira into a slower-paced fight, and we can't discount the possibility that getting finished so quickly in his UFC debut results in hesitancy here. "", 'Ruziboev and newcomer Eric McConico are similarly lanky, meaning that neither will be able to strike from a safe distance. This likely results in one of these gentlemen going to sleep early, as Ruziboev has finished all but two of his 34 victories, and  McConico has ended two of his last three bouts inside the distance.', 'Something will need to give in this matchup, as Silva has finished 11 of his 14 wins by knockout, and Melsik Baghdasaryan has never been knocked out in 10 professional fights. Baghdasaryan is great at keeping range and is hard to corral due to his footwork, which makes it likely that Silva will see the scorecards for just the fourth time in his career.', ""We are shooting for the stars here, but not without cause. Matsumoto throws so hard at close range that his KO/TKO total (3) surprises me. While Rob Font has never been knocked out, he is now 37 years old and was staggered badly multiple times in fights against Jose Aldo and Marlon Vera. This looks like a case of statistics that don't quite tell the whole story, particularly when Font needs to stay glued into the pocket to work his pressure-boxing style"", '']"

The first seven of those came during the event\'s preliminary portion, which UFC CEO Dana White dubbed a ""curse."" In other words, if the prelims deliver exciting finishes, the main card tends to be a downer – at least so far this year.', 'The Seattle main card was the furthest from that, even with a strange ending to the five-round main event between former two-division champion Henry Cejudo and Top 10 contender Song Yadong.', 'Without further ado, here are three things to remember about UFC Seattle before returning to the APEX next weekend to begin March.', 'Bizarre sequence in Henry Cejudo vs. Song Yadong gives UFC Seattle an awkward ending', 'Even with the way the fight against Cejudo ended, Yadong has proven to be worthy of remaining in the upper-echelon of the UFC bantamweight division.', 'His striking looked on-point, specifically his leg-kicking to take away Cejudo\'s potent wrestling base. Although he didn\'t get a highlight-reel finish or ""retire"" Cejudo as he proclaimed he would before the fight, he deserves some pull after beating the most prominent name he has fought thus far in the UFC, much less his MMA career.', '“So, my goal is to be world champion, so whatever these guys give me, my goal is to fight a guy who is ranked above me, if not Henry, [Sean] O’Malley. Give me O’Malley, I can fight any time,” Yadong told reporters at the post-fight presser.', ""Now, it's up to the UFC to deliver on said request. Yadong (22-8 MMA, 11-3-1 UFC) has won two of his last three fights, extending Cejudo's losing skid to three. Cejudo (16-5 MMA, 10-5 UFC) is interested in a rematch against Yadong, although other plans might be in the works for both."", ""Former UFC Champion teases return to Octagon, ‘Who misses me?'"", 'Climate Pledge Arena was treated to stellar card from top to bottom. White even admitted how much he ""forgot"" what it was like to be in Seattle, much less the West Coast portion of the country not named Las Vegas, Arizona, or California.', 'The more the UFC can go on the road for Fight Night events, the better. The proof is in the pudding, especially when the live gate, plus attendance totals, are factored in.', ""With 42 events per year, seeing cities the UFC usually doesn't tend to flock to (Seattle, Des Moines in May), is only a sign the COVID era is *almost* over despite the UFC APEX's ease of utilization for the majority of Fight Night events."", ""Either way, it's clear the promotion has heard the fans and are going to continue to hit new locations (or older ones with a shorter shelf life) more often."", 'Brendan Allen reacts to back-to-back losses at UFC Seattle, Dricus du Plessis gloats', ""Cejudo's loss to Yadong put a huge damper on his highly-anticipated return to action. The former champion and Olympic freestyle wrestling gold medalist is going to have to sit with the loss for quite a bit."", 'However, Cejudo did admit after the fight he can still compete with the best in the world, regardless of division.', ""Still, though, Cejudo wants to finish the story with Yadong, regardless of White's potential discontent."", '""I will say this. Dana White. I know you said you’re not interested in the rematch; let’s run it back,"" a portion of Cejudo\'s post read.

These markets are usually efficient, with the “price” eventually reflecting the true odds of the event.', 'While this is less true in MMA — where there are far more information asymmetries than in major markets like the NFL or NBA — it’s still broadly (and increasingly) the case. Therefore, to beat the markets over the long term, we need to find the spots where they’re wrong.', 'That’s the point of this piece. Inspired by our NFL “Luck Rankings,” I’ll look into spots where variance has favored one fighter more than another, making the line inefficient.

Cejudo repeatedly stated “I can’t f*cking see” when speaking to his coaches, which led to the ringside physician stopping the fight.', 'Because three rounds were completed, the judges’ scorecards were tallied with Song getting the win by technical decision but Dana White already saw enough that he doesn’t want to see it again, regardless of how it ended.', '“Not at all,” White said about his interest in a rematch during the UFC Seattle post-fight press conference. “Not even a little bit. I just don’t want to see it again.”', 'White didn’t exactly take aim at Cejudo for not being able to continue, although he wasn’t at all surprised that the fight ended after the eye poke compromised his vision in the third round.', 'To that point in the fight, Song was up on the scorecards and seemed to be surging further ahead but the foul brought the action to an unsatisfying conclusion.', '“Yeah [I knew he wasn’t going to be able to continue],” White said about Cejudo. “I have no idea [how he was feeling]. I’ll let him answer all those questions.', '“Song looked good. Only [Cejudo] can answer those questions. I don’t know if he thought ‘if I stop here, is this a [disqualification], no contest?’ I don’t know what he was thinking or maybe he can’t see.”', 'Perhaps the biggest argument about the way the fight ended was referee Jason Herzog choosing not to assess a point deduction for the foul, which is always at the official’s discretion.', 'For his part, White clearly didn’t seem to think a point deduction was necessary because in his estimation, Song didn’t commit the foul on purpose.', '“If you thought he intentionally poked him in the eye, [you take a point],” White said. “Why would he poke him in the eye? He was doing pretty well. If he was getting his ass whooped, and he poked him in the eye, you could probably make the argument.”', 'While the UFC CEO clearly felt great about the overall card in Seattle, White was obviously far less enthusiastic when addressing the way the main event ended, especially given the circumstances surrounding the stoppage.', '“Listen, eye pokes are never good but they happen a lot,” White said. “And fights do continue after eye pokes. I don’t know, I’d have to look and see how many fights are actually stopped due to an eye poke. Not many.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Saturday's UFC Fight Night headliners agree this might be their final chance to make good on their title aspirations."", ""Cejudo (16-4) is one of combat sports' most decorated athletes. The Olympic gold medalist wrestler retired from mixed martial arts one year after winning UFC titles in two divisions. Cejudo's return to competition three years later was complicated. Cejudo lost a split decision to UFC bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling in his comeback before losing a competitive unanimous decision to Merab Dvalishvili in the fight preceding Dvalishvili's ascent to UFC champion. "", ""Cejudo hasn't won in five years, but he's also keeping up with a new era of elite bantamweights. The former champion admits that fighting Song is crucial to learning if he's still world-class."", '""It\'s because of having a couple of losses. I\'m not accustomed to going through that as a fighter, in wrestling or in mixed martial arts..."" Cejudo told CBS Sports. ""Obviously, what I show on Saturday will indicate where I\'m at.', '""It\'s going to be a fight, bro. I\'ll meet him in the middle. I might move a little bit, but we\'re going to fight. We\'ll see how his defense is. It\'s not like I\'m just a wrestler. I knock people the f--- out too!""', 'Check out the full interview with Henry Cejudo below.', 'Song (21-8-1) faces an equally difficult predicament despite never fighting for a title. Song has 10 wins in the UFC but faltered each time he was presented with a truly elite opponent. Song lost to Cory Sandhagen and Petr Yan in fights that could have put him on the cusp of a title shot. Now, Song has another chance to build his case as an elite bantamweight against a former champion 11 years his senior.', '""This time it\'s very important for me,"" Song told CBS Sports. ""I need to catch it because I had two chances to get into the top five, but I lost. This time I will catch the opportunity. I feel 100% ready this time. ', '""I\'m the best because I believe in my skills and strengths. He has more experience, but I think I have a lot of UFC fights. I can handle any situation.""', 'Saturday\'s co-main event was supposed to be former bantamweight champ Dominick Cruz\'s retirement fight. Unfortunately, Cruz suffered a shoulder injury that expedited his retirement. Ranked middleweights Brendan Allen (No. 9) and Anthony Hernandez (No. 12) now assume the co-main event role. Hernandez rides high on a six-fight win streak with five finishes. He can enter the Top 10 at the expense of Allen, who he previously beat for a regional title shortly before both men debuted on the ""Contender Series.""', '""I plan to drown him again and break him,"" Hernandez told CBS Sports. ""I\'ll shut him down and let him know the first time wasn\'t a fluke. If I was able to do that the first time hurt and out of shape, what will it look like when I\'m healthy and a whole new fighter?""', '""I\'m not that same guy, not even close to it,"" Allen told CBS Sports. ""I fought like shit that night. I was young. I don\'t think it was a hard fight because I didn\'t do anything. I was like a moving dummy who barely moved. It was an easy fight for him. But Saturday won\'t be an easy night. It\'ll be much different.""', 'Below is the rest of the fight card for Saturday with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event.', 'Date: Feb. 22 | Start time: 9 p.m. ET (main card)\nLocation: Climate Pledge Arena -- Seattle\nTV channel: ESPN+', ""Henry Cejudo vs. Song Yadong: It's wild to think that Song, 27, is only beginning to hit his athletic prime after 14 UFC fights. He's athletically trending in a positive direction while Cejudo, 38, should naturally begin inclining. It's understandable why oddsmakers favor the younger fighter, but I'm hesitant to side against the former champion. Song is a great prospect but he's consistently fallen short against opponents that are presently half-a-rung below the title level. Cejudo's recent losses came against two of the last three bantamweight champions. "", 'Song is a good wrestler under Urijah Faber\'s tutelage but three of his last four opponents have taken him down. I\'m confident an Olympic gold medalist can ground the young contender. Song has a higher striking output but a lower KO rate than his opponent. Cejudo has a great chin and I don\'t anticipate Song will crack it. I\'m not sure ""Triple C"" will make good on his ongoing title ambitions but he\'s talented and experienced enough to beat a contender who isn\'t quite championship caliber.

"UFC Seattle DFS Breakdown: Model, Preview, Picks for Cejudo vs. Song, More Saturday Fights",https://www.fantasylabs.com/articles/ufc-seattle-dfs-breakdown-model-preview-picks-for-cejudo-vs-song-more-saturday-fights/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The UFC has had to shuffle fights frequently for UFC Seattle, but the final tally seems to be a 12-fight card going down at 6:00 p.m. ET. The headliner is former two-division champion Henry Cejudo taking on fast-rising prospect Song Yadong in a five-round fight.', 'We have built out a full player-projection model using the FantasyLabs Tools and Player Models to help put together some winning DFS lineups in UFC. You can use our optimizer to build optimal lineups using these projections.', 'The model, created by our own Sean Koerner, is based on 10,000 simulations of all the fights. He then pulled the DraftKings score from each bout to create floor, median, and ceiling projections for every fighter. Here is how he defined each projection:', 'These should give us a better sense of which fighters we should target based on the game type – maximizing ceiling in GPPs, for example.', 'You can check out the projections for every fighter on Saturday’s card in our UFC Models.', '', '', '', 'Since returning to the UFC following a few years of “retirement,” Henry Cejudo has gone 0-2. However, he went 0-2 against former champion Aljamain Sterling and current champion Merab Dvalishvili. Not only were those much tougher matchups than he has this week, but they were also both huge stylistic challenges for Cejudo.', 'Both Sterling and Dvalishvili are elite grapplers, while Cejudo is a former Olympic wrestling gold medalist. Song Yadong is a powerful striker who has lost fights in the past due to being outgrappled.', 'Song is also more than a decade younger and still working his way into his prime. He has the power to end this fight at any point, while Cejudo needs to win minutes over a five-round contest.', 'That makes this an excellent DFS fight, as we’re likely to either get a Yadong knockout or plenty of takedowns from Cejudo—if not both. I’ll certainly be stacking this in cash games and including at least one fighter in my GPP lineups. This could be a sneaky GPP stack as well, on a 12-fight card where staying unique is somewhat important.', '', 'We’ve seen massive line movement towards Mansur Abdul-Malik this week for his fight against Nick Klein ($6,500). Abdul-Malik came into the week as around a -500 favorite, but his odds have swelled all the way to -1200.', 'He’s now a slight favorite to pick up a win in the first round—as he’s done in six of his seven professional fights. The lone exception was a second-round knockout in his appearance on the Contender Series that would’ve still scored well for DFS purposes.', 'The only real drawback for Abdul-Malik is his price tag, but it’s fairly easy to find enough value to afford him. I want as much of him as possible in all contest types.', 'The co-main event between Hernandez and Brendan Allen ($7,200) is a fun one. It’s a rematch of an LFA title fight from 2018 that saw Hernandez win a five-round decision.', 'Since then, both men have been on impressive runs in the UFC, with Hernandez winning six straight and Allen having a seven-fight win streak snapped by Nassourdine Imavov in his last fight.', 'Both men are grapplers, but Hernandez stands out for DFS thanks to his impressive cardio and work rate. In his last fight, he attempted 29 takedowns and landed 10—a ridiculous mark for a heavier weight class fighter.', 'That was over five rounds, and he has just three to work with here. Still, that’s plenty of time for Hernandez to pile up takedowns, especially if Allen’s cardio fails him later in the fight. Hernandez’s upside is just as strong as the fighters priced above him, with the highest ceiling projection of any three-round fighter.', 'Simon checks all the boxes this week, particularly for cash games. His fight with Jahvid Basharat ($9,100) has the best odds to go the full three rounds—and the line has moved significantly towards Simon.', 'After opening around +240, Simon’s moneyline has dropped to +180. That means he’s about $500 too cheap based on his odds. The fact that this fight is highly likely to see the judges also gives him a high floor, since even in a loss he likely has 15 minutes to work with.', 'If all that weren’t enough, Simon averages a bit over five takedowns per 15 minutes in his UFC career. While he might have a somewhat hard time landing those against Basharat—who is also a solid grappler—he should still be able to pick up a few along the way.', '', 'It’s hard to find much tape on Julius Walker, who’s making his UFC debut against Alonzo Menifield ($8,700) at UFC Seattle.', 'Walker is 6-0 as a pro, though, with all six wins coming via finish. He’s also fought a UFC veteran (Bevon Lewis) and a former TUF contestant (Myron Dennis) in his last two fights. He finished both of them in the first round.', 'That’s a pretty solid resume for a debutant, even if he’s getting thrown to the wolves a bit against a 14-fight UFC veteran in Menifield. Menifield is 8-5-1 in the promotion overall but is 37 years old and was knocked out in both of his 2024 fights.', 'That’s not a great sign for an aging fighter, and Walker seems to have some solid finishing skills, particularly on the ground. It might not be enough against Menifield, but a quick finish wouldn’t shock me either, so I’ll have some exposure to “Juice Box” in GPPs.', 'Both Sean Zerillo and I talked about our interest in Walker on this week’s UFC Betting Preview Podcast:', 'Be sure to check out all the pick’ems Sleeper has to offer with Sleeper promo code LABS1.', 'This is another light heavyweight pairing between two aggressive finishers, with odds better than -400 that we see a stoppage at some point.', 'That makes it a fairly obvious Swing Fight candidate. Ibo Aslan has picked up knockouts in all 14 of his pro wins, including two in the UFC and one on the Contender Series. Cutelaba has finished four of his seven UFC wins, primarily with ground and pound.', 'If Aslan can stop takedowns, he should pick up a fairly easy finish on the feet. If he can’t, Cutelaba has a massive edge on the ground. I’m not entirely confident in which of those scenarios will play out, but either way, the winner should walk away with a big DFS score.', 'I prefer the favored Aslan slightly, especially considering the line has moved his way this week. Still, I’ll have a decent chunk of Cutelaba in my GPP portfolio as well.', '', '', 'Bet with your head, not over it!\nGambling Problem?

The bout was competitive on the feet, but Yadong turned things up in round three before accidentally poking “Triple C” in the left eye. While Cejudo made it through the round after taking five minutes to recover, he couldn’t start round four and Yadong was awarded the win via technical decision.', 'While Yadong has called for a rematch with Cejudo, he wouldn’t mind throwing down with another popular bantamweight.', 'RELATED: HENRY CEJUDO REACTS TO DANA WHITE’S BLUNT COMMENTS ON UFC SEATTLE ENDING', 'While Song Yadong is open to a rematch with Henry Cejudo, UFC CEO Dana White isn’t interested in that idea. When asked about White’s comments during the UFC Seattle post-fight press conference, Yadong mentioned Sean O’Malley as an enticing name for his next opponent.', '“My goal is to be world champion, so whatever they give me my goal is to fight a guy ranked above me,” Yadong said. “If not Henry, give me O’Malley. I can fight anytime.”', 'It appears White is more keen on booking a UFC bantamweight title rematch between champion Merab Dvalishvili and O’Malley. If he can’t get Cejudo or O’Malley next, “The Kung Fu Kid” hopes to face someone above him in the official 135-pound rankings.', '“Yeah, I think I’m already in the top five, my level.” Yadong said. “Just give me another chance. I will beat these guys.”', 'Yadong’s victory over Cejudo is the biggest win of his pro MMA career regardless of the circumstances. It was also a bounce back win for Yadong, who suffered a unanimous decision loss to Petr Yan back in March 2024. After losses to Yan and Cory Sandhagen, Yadong told media members that he felt pressured to prove he belongs in the elite class in the bantamweight division.', 'Prior to the accidental foul, Yadong looked sharp against Cejudo, but some are left to wonder what would’ve happened in rounds four and five if the eye poke never occurred.

I think Cejudo reminds everyone there are levels to this on Saturday.', 'Before we chuckle at my dart throw, it’s worth noting that Modestas Bukauskas was on wobbly-leg street in his last bout before snatching a submission victory. Cerqueira was 11-0 prior to joining the UFC. He was caught by Aslan in his debut, but in Seattle he should have a more composed outing.
