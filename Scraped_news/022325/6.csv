Science must step away from nationally managed infrastructure,https://www.thetransmitter.org/policy/science-must-step-away-from-nationally-managed-infrastructure/,"['Scientific data and independence are at risk. We need to work with community-driven services and university libraries to create new multi-country organizations that are resilient to political interference.', 'The United States faces a terrifying prospect: the destruction of multiple parts of its national scientific infrastructure. Open datasets are shutting down, including decades of climate tracking at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and health information at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—a loss of particular concern to neuroscience. Federally funded publications that contain certain keywords, such as “women” and “bias,” have been banned. And, according to some observers, Pubmed may soon be flooded with unscientific anti-vaccination “papers.” Even some independent charitable organizations show worrying signs of capitulating to the insane and anti-scientific demands of the new administration, possibly out of fear of losing their tax-exempt status: The Howard Hughes Medical Institute cut funding aimed at making science more inclusive, as did the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.', 'Science internationally has come to depend on this imperiled infrastructure, and the ripple effects of the implosion of scientific institutions in the U.S. could be devastating worldwide.', 'It is tempting in the face of this damage to wish, desperately, to go back to the way things were before. But not only is this ineffectual, as the new U.S. administration will be in power for at least four years (and longer is certainly possible), it is a failure to learn the lesson of this moment: We must stop relying on scientific infrastructure provided by one nation or organization. Any single point of failure makes science fragile. Instead, we need multiple organizations across as many countries as possible, collectively providing access to overlapping data and services, so that the loss of any one or several of these doesn’t stop us from doing science. There are some short-term steps we can take to protect ourselves, but we also need to start the work of building resilience for the long term.', '', 'H', '', 'A dramatic recent example is Twitter. Many scientists put huge efforts into building networks to communicate with colleagues and the general public. But all that work and the value in those networks was lost when many scientists felt compelled to leave following Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform (now X). The process of rebuilding on Bluesky is underway, but it will take years and may never reach the same critical mass. Even if the transition is successful, the same thing may happen to Bluesky in a few years.', 'We need to start building new multi-country organizations, designed from the start to be community-run and resilient.', 'It’s not just social media: We see the same issue happening in some of the core institutions of science. Historically, scientists owned and ran their own journals, but they were persuaded to sell them to publishers in the 1950s to 1960s. These publishers merged into only a few companies and increased the costs of publishing dramatically, giving rise to some of the highest profit margins in the world. More worryingly, the companies took control away from scientists. Even when we are certain that a paper is fraudulent, it often takes years before it is retracted, if ever—because retractions are simply not good for business. Most big science publishers are based in Europe, but a huge percentage of their revenue comes from the U.S. If the Trump administration demanded that these publishers block unapproved publications from the U.S., would they stand and fight?', 'Even preprint servers such as arXiv and bioRxiv may be vulnerable because they are registered in the U.S. If they do stand firm, their hosting providers may be a point of vulnerability. In 2024, arXiv ceased mirroring its data and switched to a San Francisco-based cloud provider. And what of other essential servers? How disruptive would it be if GitHub started deleting repositories, or Google Scholar started hiding certain papers in response to U.S. government demands? After all, Google has already shown itself quite happy to rename entire seas to cater to Trump’s whims.', '', 'S', '', 'We also need to start integrating services that are resistant to interference into our daily workflows. PubPeer is a post-publication peer-review service widely used by science “sleuths” to share evidence of fraud. With wider adoption, and ideally registered outside the U.S., it could make the scientific literature resistant to the sort of influence the U.S. government is attempting. You don’t need to rely on the journal if the commentary of the scientific community is open and visible to all on every paper. eLife offers an intermediate approach, making a publication decision before review and then making the review and revision process fully transparent. On social media, Mastodon is managed and run by the community (e.g., neuromatch.social is a server run by neuroscientists) and is robust by design. It is slightly more difficult to use, understandably putting many people off, but this is rapidly improving.', 'In the longer term, we need to build out robust infrastructure in a more rigorous and systematic way. Some of this can be done by the developers of existing services, adding capabilities to protect against the possibility of themselves being compromised. For example, the platform Research Equals includes a “poison pill” agreement among its shareholders to make it more difficult to be sold off. Other approaches could include facilitating and encouraging openly sharing and licensing your code and data so that new services could be spun up easily in case of compromise. bioRxiv, for example, publishes an easily downloadable feed of all its data.', 'Ultimately, we need to start building new multi-country organizations, designed from the start to be community-run and resilient. A coalition of university libraries could be ideally placed to lead this effort, as they already have vast experience building for and supporting access to scientific data and publications. Just imagine a world in which universities mutually support one another by building scientific infrastructure based on free sharing, giving every country, from the poorest to the richest, secure access to the scientific data that can change the world for the better. This isn’t fanciful. It can happen, but we have to put the effort in, because nobody will do it for us.', 'Catch up on what you may have missed from our recent coverage.', 'Have you recently published new research in neuroscience?', 'Curating neuroscience, connecting community', 'An editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation']"

Why federally funded science matters to Texas,https://www.heraldbanner.com/opinion/columns/why-federally-funded-science-matters-to-texas/article_05216f54-f179-11ef-9783-67d9a76536cd.html,"['', '', '', '', '', '', 'Scientific research doesn’t often make headline news. Unless some exciting new drug trial succeeds spectacularly or fails disappointingly.', 'But research has been in the spotlight lately due to recent actions taken by the Trump administration.', 'Two such actions include the sudden announcement of big cuts to “indirect costs” on grants awarded from the National Institutes of Health and the firing of more than 5,000 probationary workers from Health and Human Services. These actions threaten the USA’s position as a world leader in science and medicine and are likely to have lasting economic and societal consequences, as well.', 'I went to college at Austin College in Sherman where I realized I wanted to be a scientist. I then went to UT-Southwestern in Dallas to pursue a Ph.D. in neuroscience before leaving Texas for my postdoctoral training. After seven years away, I landed my dream job back in my home state as an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine located in the Texas Medical Center in Houston. I am the head of a research lab that studies learning, memory and age-related memory loss. Most of my lab’s research is supported by NIH grant dollars so I am sure it is obvious why I care about government support for science. But why should it matter to everyday people?', 'Let’s start with dollars and cents.', 'Scientific research is one of the best investments that can be made with federal money. Institutes across Texas brought in $1.85 billion from the NIH in fiscal year 2023, which ended up supporting $5.8 billion in economic activity. That’s more than $3 generated for every $1 spent. A significant part of that federal grant money is in the form of “indirect costs,” which I will break down using a football game as an analogy. We should think of a research lab like mine as one of the teams where I am the coach and my lab members are the team. We score points by making discoveries.', 'But to be able to play, there has to be a functioning “stadium” in place in the form of infrastructure. Indirect costs go to keep the stadium (my institution) operating so that my team and hundreds of other teams (labs) can play. This creates additional jobs for many essential people outside of labs. When indirect costs disappear, so does that money to pay essential support staff. We will also lose the infrastructure that allows scientists to carry out our research, which means we can’t generate the incredible return on investment that we have in the past. Which in turn will negatively impact our state and national economy.', 'But beyond the economy and my career, hurting science affects all our lives. My father was recently diagnosed with an aggressive cancer; however, he was a candidate for “immune checkpoint therapy,” which took him from believing he had months to live to being cancer free. The therapies that helped him were discovered by a scientist right here in Texas – Dr. James Allison. In the past few years, my stepfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, my mother an autoimmune disorder and my grandparents the health complications that come with aging. I am sure many of you have similar family stories. We scientists are working every day to better understand these health problems with the hope of finding breakthroughs like we have for cancer.', 'This is where the firing of probationary workers hurts so much. Probationary workers included both new hires – like scientists brought in to do groundbreaking research – and longtime NIH employees who had recently taken a new position, such as a promotion. These individuals were fired for no reason other than their classification. It has resulted in the loss of nearly 10% of the workers at the NIH Center for Alzheimer’s and related dementias and hundreds of people at the National Cancer Institute. Many of the administrative staff who ensure that grant applications for basic research and clinical trials can be reviewed successfully and paid in a timely manner have lost their jobs. The loss of scientific talent and slowed progress is likely to present significant barriers in our path to finding treatments and cures.', 'The benefits of science to society transcend political affiliation. It is important that we let our elected officials know the value that science brings and that an investment in science is an investment in the future of Texas and America.', '--- The views expressed in this column are those of Rachel Arey and not on behalf of her institution.', '', '', '', 'First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.', '']"
Critics say Trump’s executive orders to reshape the NIH ‘will kill’ Americans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/20/nih-trump-executive-orders,"['Executive orders’ impact on premier medical research agency has resulted in delayed projects and frozen funding', 'Academics and scientists who work with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said the Trump administration’s orders have severely disrupted work – delaying projects and casting the future of research funding and jobs into doubt as chaos in the agency reigns.', 'An array of orders seeks to fundamentally reshape the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical and behavioral research, in the Trump administration’s image. The agency’s work is the wellspring of scientific advancement in the US, and helped make the country a dominant force in health and science.', '“They will have drastic effects on all of us – this is not hyperbole, this is fact,” said Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors and an anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey.', 'The orders “will kill”, Wolfson said, as advances in the treatment of diseases as diverse as cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes are delayed.', '“Donald Trump and Elon Musk are taking a sledgehammer to the greatest biomedical infrastructure in the world to extend tax cuts,” Wolfson said.', 'NIH-funded basic or applied research has also contributed to 386 of the 387 drugs the Food and Drug Administration approved between 2000 and 2019, and more than 100 Nobel prizes have been awarded to scientists based on NIH-funded work. NIH grants often fund basic research conducted at universities and colleges across the country, touching every state and nearly every congressional district.', 'Since taking office, the Trump administration has issued a bevy of executive orders and administrative actions that seek to fundamentally alter American health and science agencies – from appointing the nation’s foremost vaccine critic to head the Department of Health and Human Services to scrubbing websites of information the administration finds objectionable.', 'Trump’s executive orders prohibit grant funding containing a long list of words associated with “diversity, equity and inclusion”; attempt to cut scientific research funding by $4bn; fired thousands of employees and stopped recruitment; imposed communications blackouts; and blocked committees from meeting to evaluate new scientific research, effectively freezing funds.', 'Together, those orders have sown a sense of chaos and fear throughout the agency and academia, even as many are tied up in court battles.', 'That has left the most severe proposal, a 15% cap on “indirect costs”, hanging like the sword of Damocles over scientific research – forcing institutions to impose sweeping spending freezes and casting the future of whole labs into doubt.', '“I have to decide as a professor whether to take new students into my lab, and I don’t know if I can afford them,” said Rutgers University biochemist and professor Annika Barber.', 'Barber added that she was supposed to spend her Thursday afternoon reviewing grant proposals for the NIH at a legally mandated review committee. The meeting was canceled with less than 24 hours notice as the Trump administration has put a hold on submissions to the Federal Register, a legal requirement for upcoming meetings.', '“As of today, there are no NIH study sections going forward, which means we are not funding the grants scored last fall and not funding the grants meant to be scored this spring,” she said. “That means there is a six-month funding gap … That is going to close small labs.”', 'Sign up to This Week in Trumpland', 'A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration', '', 'Other researchers compared the administration’s efforts to pause funding, in violation of a court order, as effectively “pouring cement” in the science-funding pipeline.', 'Another tactic the administration has used to shrink the federal workforce includes mass firings of “probationary” employees.

‘Death by ax.’ Fate of millions of research animals at stake in NIH payments lawsuit,https://www.science.org/content/article/death-ax-nih-payments-lawsuit-could-determine-fate-millions-research-animals,"['The stakes are especially high for one group of scientists this morning, as a federal judge in Massachusetts hears arguments on whether she should allow President Donald Trump’s administration to slash the overhead costs the National Institutes of Health (NIH) pays to institutions for medical research.', 'Researchers who use tens of millions of rodents and thousands of nonhuman primates each year are especially dependent on these NIH “indirect cost” payments to support major animal research facilities, where complex housing, staffing, medical care, and regulatory oversight requirements push up costs. It’s not uncommon for large research universities, for example, to have “mouse houses” that support tens of thousands of rodents.', 'Indirect cost rates can be relatively high at universities; at Stanford University, for instance, they are 54%, meaning an NIH grant with direct research costs of $100,000 would come with an additional $54,000 to pay for administration and facility costs. But at animal facilities, the rates can rise above 80%. Although scientists using the animals must pay per diems out of their own grants for the use of the animals and the procedures they undergo, those payments don’t cover the cost of running the centers.', 'That means that the steep rate cut NIH has proposed, to 15%, “could have very, very, very bad consequences … for animals,” says Paul Locke, an attorney with expertise in laboratory animal law at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (He was speaking for himself and not his university.) Major animal facilities, he predicts, will “have to make very, very hard decisions about the animals that they have on site.  … It could be extreme.” Some institutions might have to euthanize thousands of animals, observers say.', 'At facilities that house primates, “This sort of cut would cause a death spiral,” says Deborah Fuller, director of the Washington National Primate Research Center at the University of Washington. The center—one of seven such facilities supported by NIH—would lose $5 million of a $30.5 million budget if NIH cuts its rate to 15%, according to one of two legal challenges to the NIH proposal, filed by 22 state attorneys general. The center’s negotiated indirect cost rate is 83.1%, the lawsuit notes. A cut would force it “to reduce or eliminate the 800 nonhuman primates in its care,” it states.', 'At the Jackson Laboratory (JAX), a major supplier of genetically engineered mice to the research community, the proposed NIH policy could deliver a double blow, both cutting funding to its own large research programs and reducing its revenues by dampening sales of its mice to researchers. The indirect cost rate of the lab’s main facility in Bar Harbor, Maine, is 77%.', 'Gary Friedmann, a member of the Maine House of Representatives whose district includes the Bar Harbor facility, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on 18 February, urging him to reverse the proposed cut. Since then, “I’ve gotten lots of responses from people who are scared about their jobs and, really, about the future of scientific research at the lab,” he says. Friedmann estimates “One-third to almost 40% of the total NIH dollars that are coming to JAX would be at risk. That’s hard to imagine.” JAX declined to answer detailed questions about its indirect costs but said in a statement the proposed cut “threatens the entire biomedical research community.”', 'At the Washington primate center, Fuller says overhead payments not only help feed and house its 800 macaques but also support a biosafety level-2 facility for studying infections in the animals. The center employs 179 staff, and the university has to provide the oversight personnel and processes to make sure the work there complies with U.S. animal welfare requirements. “This is a highly sophisticated operation [with] huge infrastructure,” Fuller says.', 'At least one national primate center director says the cut, if it goes through, won’t be fatal to his center. Buddy Capuano, interim director of the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, which has a significantly lower indirect cost rates of 38.5% and 55%, says the center would flex and adapt. “We make contingency plans all the time.”', ""Scientists who use animals have much to lose in the Trump assault on indirect costs. But opponents of animal research see a major opportunity. Justin Goodman, senior vice president of White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group, argued in a recent congressional hearing that “indirect costs … go into a slush fund that has nothing to do with the research. So, they're willing to let experimenters do whatever they want to animals to keep the money flowing. … You cut off their funding for animal testing, they’re gonna figure out something else to do.”"", 'Locke believes medical research needs to transition away from using animals. But he says an abrupt cut that could leave millions of research animals homeless is a bad idea. Change, he says, needs to come through “aggressive incrementalism and not death by ax.”', 'The plaintiffs attempting to block the indirect payment cuts argue NIH has violated both procedural rules for implementing new policies, and a congressional directive that limits NIH’s ability to change indirect cost rates without the approval of Congress. At today’s hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Angel Kelley will be considering whether to extend an order she issued on 10 February that prevents NIH from implementing the new policy while the case is argued on its merits.', 'Meredith Wadman has been a staff writer in Science’s Washington, D.C., bureau since 2016.', 'Get Science’s award-winning newsletter with the latest news, commentary, and research, free to your inbox daily.', '', '', '© 2025 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

America Will Pay Dearly for the NIH’s Mindless War on Wokeness and DEI,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/trump-nih-indirect-costs-memo-war-wokeness-dei-research-private-businesses-economic-effects/,"['Mother Jones illustration; Anjali Sharif-Paul/MediaNewsGroup/The Press-Enterprise/Getty', '', 'One Sunday in January, biologist Mark Peifer, a professor at the University of North Carolina’s medical school, got a call from campus police. Rising temperatures in a malfunctioning cold room at his lab had tripped an alarm. Materials he needed for his work—which has furthered the understanding and treatment of colorectal cancer—were in danger of being compromised.', 'He was able to get the cold room repaired that same day, and had the funding to do so, so the disruption was minimized. But now Peifer is concerned about the stability of that funding, which comes from the National Institutes of Health. His grants cover equipment and supplies directly related to his research. But the work takes place in shared research buildings and requires other, shared equipment and staff efforts—which is why, for every dollar he gets from the NIH, his institution gets an additional 55 cents in “indirect funding.”', 'That money is what paid to fix the cold room. It also goes toward his building’s HVAC, electricity, and sanitation, and pays for Peifer’s research assistants and the accountants who keep track of his grants.', '“It’s incredible to me that we would give up this thing that has such obvious societal benefits.”', 'At least, it used to. On February 7, the NIH announced a 15 percent cap on indirect costs—an allowance that previously has averaged about 30 percent across the nation. For UNC, it meant a 40 percent research funding cut. The indirect rate, negotiated between the government and a given institution, is based on local and regional costs and various other factors.', 'Peifer and other researchers I interviewed say cuts of this magnitude will be devastating. “If my lab closes down, it will mean 10 people no longer have a job,” he says, and these are people “who live in my community, pay rent, go to the grocery store.” If they stand, the reductions will create roadblocks for fledgling scientists, he says, because in many cases undergraduates will “no longer have an opportunity to engage in research.”', '“It will end biomedical research in the county. That that’s what it really comes down,” Peifer says, noting that even facilities doing private biomedical and pharmaceutical research depend on public funding and the discoveries that result from it.', 'On February 10, almost two dozen Democratic state attorneys general sued the Trump administration over the NIH directive, citing “immediate and devastating” effects. A federal judge quickly granted a temporary restraining order covering the 22 states in question.', '“A lawsuit like this about grant funding is unusual,” says Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “But it’s become increasingly common for state attorneys general to join together to challenge policies.”', 'Kettl argues that the NIH directive, which upends decades of federal science policy, violates federal law: “Assertion of an Executive Branch power to cut or eliminate grants runs right into the teeth of the Impoundment Control Act.”', 'The directive noted that private funders of biomedical research, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Packard Foundation, offer grantee institutions 15 percent or less for indirect costs, and said the federal government should not exceed those rates. But the government is by far the largest funder of such work, and its citizens benefit broadly, economically and in terms of medical innovations, from a thriving, publicly funded research infrastructure.', 'The NIH has existed for more than a century in the form of national labs and institutes, and to characterize the work it funds as “lifesaving” is not hyperbole, Peifer explains. Although cancer now vies with heart disease as America’s leading cause of death, “we have cancer death rates down 30 percent in the last 30 years,” he says, and “we’ve gotten even better at treating heart disease.”', 'The NIH cuts are part of a ham-fisted effort by the Trump administration to gut federal spending while rooting out “wokeness.” Capping indirect costs will save the $4 billion, the administration claims, but it’s easy to read between the lines. The NIH announcement cites a Heritage Foundation report titled, “Indirect Costs: How Taxpayers Subsidize University Nonsense,” which asserts that every 1 percent increase in indirect costs leads to two more “DEI employees.”', '“The economics…would be dramatically different. New facilities would go unbuilt, private industries would suffer, and scientific support staff would be laid off. “', 'Indeed, the impetus for the cap may have come from Heritage staffer Lindsey Burke, who, in her chapter of the Project 2025 manifesto, writes that “these [indirect] reimbursements cross-subsidize leftist agendas and the research of billion-dollar organizations such as Google and the Ford Foundation. Universities also use this influx of cash to pay for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts.”', 'The cost-saving claims don’t hold up, in any case. Every dollar in NIH research grants generates $2.46 in economic activity, research shows—a total of $93 billion in 2023 alone. “It’s incredible to me that we would give up this thing that has such obvious societal benefits,” Peifer says.', 'The research is a key driver of private sector innovation. The $1.7 trillion US biotech industry was built on a century of government-funded discoveries at universities and research institutes. “Those developments that biotech firms and pharma put into practice come from NIH and NSF research,” Peifer says. And NIH-funded academic and private labs fuel the roughly $57 billion US market for sophisticated scientific tools and equipment.', 'Peifer lives in North Carolina’s Research Triangle, which is home to Duke, North Carolina State, and UNC-Chapel Hill. Because the area is a biomedical research hub, biotech, pharma, and equipment firms have a strong presence in the area—an estimated 4,000 tech companies and 600 life science companies. “They will be devastated,” Peifer predicts.', 'Peifer is eager to dispel the myth that slashing NIH funding is merely a matter of concern for academic scientist in their ivory towers. “There are so many working class jobs on the line: millions employed in the support industries,” he says.', 'Peifer himself was raised in working-class family, he told me. His dad often worked two jobs, including driving a forklift for General Motors. He wouldn’t be where he is today, he says, if not for publicly funded science. “We’re giving kids an opportunity to do something that their parents maybe didn’t have an opportunity to do. Do we really want to throw that away?”', 'Peifer and Kettl concede that there’s room for differing views on how research funding should be allocated. “There is a legitimate question about just how indirect costs should be calculated, but the costs are never the same between two institutions,” Kettl says. Notes Peifer: “If you want to build a building in Boston, it’s a whole lot more expensive than if you want to build a building in Birmingham, Alabama.”', 'The problem is that the administration’s blunt-force tactics, Kettle says, amount to “a clumsy effort to cut federal spending” that “is sure to stifle research and undermine the economy, with untold consequences down the line.”', 'On Wednesday, after nearly two weeks of ignoring two court orders instructing federal agencies to unfreeze any funds they were withholding, NIH officials finally relented. The online news outlet Popular Information reported that an internal NIH memo had authorized staff to resume payments, including indirect funds in excess of the 15 percent cap. The memo confirmed that the NIH had been aware of the court orders. One of its authors, Michael Lauer, has since left the NIH.', 'The administration is weakening science in other ways, too. On Friday, senior administrators at the NIH and CDC were informed that more than 5,000 probationary employees, those employed for less than two years, are set to be fired as part of widespread reductions across the government. “It’s an irreversible blow to the one of the most important engines of American science and an indication that this is a war to destroy biomedical research,” Peifer said in an e-mail after the news dropped. “I am not sure how I’ll be able to sleep tonight.”', 'For now, if his cold room breaks, Peifer will follow UNC’s directives and use indirect funds to fix, noting in the work order that he is adhering to previously negotiated agreements. But if the 15 percent cap is allowed to go forward, everything changes.', '“The economics of research would be dramatically different,” Kettl says. “New facilities would go unbuilt, private industries would suffer, and scientific support staff would be laid off. “The inevitable result,” he says, “would be less research.”', 'Already, Peifer’s undergraduates applying to PhD programs can’t be sure those programs will continue to exist in their present state, and post-doctoral researchers may end up with fewer opportunities to hone their skills. More broadly, research and development into surgical techniques and treatments for cancer and other deadly diseases could slow down significantly.', 'It won’t be scientists like him who are hurt the most, Peifer says. Rather it will be “the people who could have had a new treatment for a devastating disease and don’t have it.”', 'Update: This article has been updated to refer to postdoctoral researchers, rather than postdoctoral students.', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

With an annual budget of nearly $48 billion, the NIH is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.', 'All requests for NIH grants go through an intensive review process.

""If the Trump administration continued such a pause on Federal Register notices indefinitely, then there would be a good argument that that was an impoundment that could also be stopped by a court, but a temporary pause on Federal Register notices seems like a more typical chance for review.""', ""Even some of the NIH's biggest supporters believe the agency could benefit from changes, such as making the grant-making process more transparent.

But the move has intensified fears of funding and program cuts at NIH and among thousands of scientists who depend on the agency for funding.', 'The NIH has been hit with cuts to its workforce, losing about 1,200 people so far. At the same time, the Trump administration is trying to cap the rate at which the NIH pays for the indirect costs of doing medical research at 15%, which is far lower than the rate that has been paid at many institutions. Scientists say it could cripple medical research. A federal judge in Boston is deciding whether the cap can go forward.', 'Many scientists fear the moves are just the beginning of what could eventually lead to a restructuring of the NIH. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now leads HHS, which oversees the NIH, has said it needs major reforms.', ""In addition, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the Stanford University researcher President Trump has nominated to be director of the NIH, has also criticized the agency.

Just as we’re making progress in the fight against women’s heart disease, these cuts threaten to slow and halt critical research. It’s a knockout blow to women’s heart health.', 'We simply can’t afford to lose momentum. Despite progress, deaths from heart disease and stroke are still rising, with more than 400,000 women dying every year.', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'There are still gaps in awareness of heart disease, including a widespread misperception that it impacts only men, unhealthy women and older people, when in fact it happens to everyone.', 'What’s more, the signs and symptoms of heart disease in women ‒ which can be very different from those of men ‒ still aren’t broadly recognized by both women and health care providers, leading to missed and delayed diagnoses. And the continuing lack of focus on sex-based differences in heart disease in medical schools means that we’re not training future doctors to adequately understand that a woman’s heart is biologically different from a man’s.', 'As cardiologists, we witness the frustration and resignation our women patients experience when they don’t feel seen or heard, or their symptoms are downplayed or ignored (“Go home, you’re just feeling anxious”). We see, too, what happens when women aren’t equipped with the knowledge or understanding of heart disease symptoms.', 'We see how all this fits into a pervasive narrative that women’s health is less than or somehow not as important as men’s.', ""Opinion:Trump's cuts will end lifesaving medical research – and people will die"", 'A new survey by the Women’s Heart Alliance ‒ an organization led by and made up of women cardiologists ‒ captured what we’re seeing every day in our exam rooms and hospitals. The goal of the survey was to gauge cardiologists’ views and mine them for insights to help better understand their women patients’ knowledge and attitudes.', 'Our observations paint a concerning and grim picture.', 'While the cardiologists surveyed think awareness of heart disease has increased, they estimate that just 1 in 4 of the women they treat know that heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in women. Many can’t identify the signs or symptoms of heart disease beyond chest pain, including pain in the arms, neck, back and/or jaw; shortness of breath; vomiting; fatigue; sweating; and stomach pain.', 'This lack of awareness leads to fewer early interventions, which increases preventable deaths.', 'Tell us:Do you think Elon Musk has too much power in our government? | Opinion', 'Just as alarming, we’re making little headway on simply diagnosing heart disease in women. An astonishing 84% of the female cardiologists surveyed said they had treated patients in the past year who had been misdiagnosed by other providers.', 'Two-thirds said they were seeing a higher share of young women than they did five years ago, which tracks with national data showing a decline in awareness of heart disease among women ages 25-34, with women of color at particular risk.', 'Given this heart health crisis, it’s more important than ever to grow critical research. Women weren’t mandated to be included in NIH-funded research until the 1990s. We started late, but now we’re making headway, and the loss of federal research dollars at institutions and universities will set us back significantly in our efforts.', 'Women’s heart health deserves a level of funding equal to its severity and prevalence.', 'We also need to empower women to recognize the unique signs and symptoms of heart disease. We need to normalize cardiovascular care for women of all ages, and redouble our efforts to reach women of color, who are disproportionately impacted by this disease.', 'Medical school training must also adapt and integrate sex-specific education into curricula to ensure evidence-based care for women. For too long, medical schools have not focused on sex-specific differences in heart disease, leading to a lack of preparedness in the diagnosis, screening and treatment of women with cardiovascular disease.', 'As cardiologists, we walk every day beside women who are navigating a frightening reality.

I can personally attest that this move is the correct one.', 'The Trump administration’s order is simple: Going forward, the NIH will pay a flat 15% of a research grant’s total funding on a university’s “indirect costs.” These costs are supposed to cover overhead − such as how much a school spends on utilities, janitorial services, administration and so on.', 'That 15% rate reflects common practices in philanthropic funding for medical research, though some foundations pay less. This makes sense: The point of grants is to fund actual scientific investigation, not secondary or tertiary concerns.', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'But universities have figured out that they can take advantage of the NIH − and by extension, taxpayers. Indirect payments are calculated based on the cost of performing research at a university, instead of the ancillary support that the specific research project requires.', 'Universities, therefore, have a strong incentive to make their operations unnecessarily expensive, knowing they’ll generate higher indirect payments.', 'The typical NIH grant pays a nearly 30% rate for indirect costs − about $9 billion of the NIH’s $35 billion in research grants in 2023. At Harvard and Yale, however, the rate approaches 70%. More prestigious institutions get more money precisely because they’ve made their operations so expensive.', 'Far from using this money to keep the lights on, universities are spending it on a slew of unrelated items, and the more they spend, the more they claim they need extra funding.', 'It’s a vicious cycle that results in further enriching wealthy institutions at taxpayers’ expense.', ""Opinion:Hate Trump all you want, but federal layoffs may help avert 'debt death spiral'"", 'I say this as someone who oversaw an NIH-funded clinical research center at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. I also received NIH research funding for my own laboratory.', 'Penn receives hundreds of millions of dollars in direct funding of individual grants annually to conduct important research, generally paying for critical equipment, laboratory supplies, technicians and the salary of the principal investigator conducting the research.', 'The indirect funding, by contrast, helps fund virtually everything the university spends money on. That includes the president’s pay, which at Penn hit $23 million in 2021, as well as the school’s vast diversity, equity and inclusion bureaucracy. Even when the money doesn’t go to these things, it frees up other funds that can.', 'The use of indirect funding on DEI might be the most objectionable aspect. A review of NIH’s reporting system shows hundreds of DEI-focused research projects, with millions of dollars going to non-research items.', 'In 2023, a Stanford University researcher got a grant for $3 million to help enroll “sexual and gender minority individuals” in a federal database, under the name of “PRIDEnet.” Nearly a third of the funding −$907,660 − was spent on indirect costs. Should a $3 million grant need $900,000 to administer it?', 'Research by my colleague Jay Greene shows that an extra 15.5 DEI employees are associated with every $100 million a university gets in indirect cost funding.', 'Another view:NIH cuts will end lifesaving medical research – and people will die | Opinion', 'What will happen under the Trump administration’s cap?', 'While the new NIH policy is on hold in 22 states because of a lawsuit, the effects may be salutary. To start, half the money that’s now going to administrative overhead will go directly to medical research, where it belongs.', 'Universities won’t be able to willy-nilly bloat their operations, which could have the additional benefit of limiting tuition hikes. Instead, they’ll have to target limited funding toward its highest use.', 'Penn, where I used to work, could lose up to $250 million. That surely means less money for the soft, opinion-based sciences, DEI offices and other ideological claptrap common on campus. Instead, universities will be more likely to devote more money to the costs that directly support the funded research project.', 'This is how federal medical research grants should have worked from the start. Universities should never have been allowed to get more money simply because they spend more money. To the contrary, they should prioritize making medical research a success.', 'The fact that universities are bemoaning the loss of this slush fund shows how far they’ve fallen from their mission of fostering human progress. They’re not worried about medical research, which will continue to flourish under President Trump’s NIH funding reforms. They’re really worried about their ability to waste seemingly infinite amounts of money on the taxpayer’s dime.', 'Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, a former associate dean of curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, is chairman of Do No Harm.']"

The US took nearly a century to craft its rich scientific ecosystem; if the unraveling that has taken place over the past month continues, Americans will feel the effects for decades to come. ', 'Most of the federal workers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk or for fear of being targeted. Many are completely stunned and terrified by the scope and totality of the actions. While every administration brings its changes, keeping the US a science and technology leader has never been a partisan issue. No one predicted the wholesale assault on these foundations of American prosperity.', '“If you believe that innovation is important to economic development, then throwing a wrench in one of the most sophisticated and productive innovation machines in world history is not a good idea,” says Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University who worked for two decades in the State Department on science issues. “They’re setting us up for economic decline.”', 'The US currently has the most top-quality research institutes in the world. This includes world-class universities like MIT (which publishes MIT Technology Review) and the University of California, Berkeley; national labs like Oak Ridge and Los Alamos; and federal research facilities run by agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Defense. Much of this network was developed by the federal government after World War II to bolster the US position as a global superpower. ', 'Before the Trump administration’s wide-ranging actions, which now threaten to slash federal research funding, the government remained by far the largest supporter of scientific progress. Outside of its own labs and facilities, it funded more than 50% of research and development across higher education, according to data from the National Science Foundation. In 2023, that came to nearly $60 billion out of the $109 billion that universities spent on basic science and engineering. ', 'Past government reports on improper spending are having a moment with Musk’s followers. What do they show?', 'The return on these investments is difficult to measure. It can often take years or decades for this kind of basic science research to have tangible effects on the lives of Americans and people globally, and on the US’s place in the world. But history is littered with examples of the transformative effect that this funding produces over time. The internet and GPS were first developed through research backed by the Department of Defense, as was the quantum dot technology behind high-resolution QLED television screens. Well before they were useful or commercially relevant, the development of neural networks that underpin nearly all modern AI systems was substantially supported by the National Science Foundation. The decades-long drug discovery process that led to Ozempic was incubated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. Microchips. Self-driving cars. MRIs. The flu shot. The list goes on and on. ', 'In her 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State, Mariana Mazzucato, a leading economist studying innovation at University College London, found that every major technological transformation in the US, from electric cars to Google to the iPhone, can trace its roots back to basic science research once funded by the federal government. If the past offers any lesson, that means every major transformation in the future could be shortchanged with the destruction of that support.', 'The Trump administration’s distaste for regulation will arguably be a boon in the short term for some parts of the tech industry, including crypto and AI. But the federal workers said the president’s and Musk’s undermining of basic science research will hurt American innovation in the long run. “Rather than investing in the future, you’re burning through scientific capital,” an employee at the State Department said. “You can build off the things you already know, but you’re not learning anything new. Twenty years later, you fall behind because you stopped making new discoveries.”', 'The government doesn’t just give money, either. It supports American science in numerous other ways, and the US reaps the returns. The Department of State helps attract the best students from around the world to American universities. Amid stagnating growth in the number of homegrown STEM PhD graduates, recruiting foreign students remains one of the strongest pathways for the US to expand its pool of technical talent, especially in strategic areas like batteries and semiconductors. Many of those students stay for years, if not the rest of their lives; even if they leave the country, they’ve already spent some of their most productive years in the US and will retain a wealth of professional connections with whom they’ll collaborate, thereby continuing to contribute to US science.', 'The State Department also establishes agreements between the US and other countries and helps broker partnerships between American and international universities. That helps scientists collaborate across borders on everything from global issues like climate change to research that requires equipment on opposite sides of the world, such as the measurement of gravitational waves.', 'The international development work of USAID in global health, poverty reduction, and conflict alleviation—now virtually shut down in its entirety—was designed to build up goodwill toward the US globally; it improved regional stability for decades. In addition to its inherent benefits, this allowed American scientists to safely access diverse geographies and populations, as well as plant and animal species not found in the US. Such international interchange played just as critical a role as government funding in many crucial inventions.', 'Several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also help collect and aggregate critical data on disease, health trends, air quality, weather, and more from disparate sources that feed into the work of scientists across the country.', 'The National Institutes of Health, for example, has since 2015 been running the Precision Medicine Initiative, the only effort of its kind to collect extensive and granular health data from over 1 million Americans who volunteer their medical records, genetic history, and even Fitbit data to help researchers understand health disparities and develop personalized and more effective treatments for disorders from heart and lung disease to cancer. The data set, which is too expensive for any one university to assemble and maintain, has already been used in hundreds of papers that will lay the foundation for the next generation of life-saving pharmaceuticals.', 'Beyond fueling innovation, a well-supported science and technology ecosystem bolsters US national security and global influence. When people want to study at American universities, attend international conferences hosted on American soil, or move to the US to work or to found their own companies, the US stays the center of global innovation activity. This ensures that the country continues to get access to the best people and ideas, and gives it an outsize role in setting global scientific practices and priorities. US research norms, including academic freedom and a robust peer review system, become global research norms that lift the overall quality of science. International agencies like the World Health Organization take significant cues from American guidance.', 'What’s coming next for technologies like EVs and wind power?', 'US scientific leadership has long been one of the country’s purest tools of soft power and diplomacy as well. Countries keen to learn from the American innovation ecosystem and to have access to American researchers and universities have been more prone to partner with the US and align with its strategic priorities.', 'Just one example: Science diplomacy has long played an important role in maintaining the US’s strong relationship with the Netherlands, which is home to ASML, the only company in the world that can produce the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors. These are critical for both AI development and national security.', 'International science cooperation has also served as a stabilizing force in otherwise difficult relationships. During the Cold War, the US and USSR continued to collaborate on the International Space Station; during the recent heightened economic competition between the US and China, the countries have remained each other’s top scientific partners. “Actively working together to solve problems that we both care about helps maintain the connections and the context but also helps build respect,” Seligsohn says.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'We use cookies to give you a more personalized browsing experience and analyze site traffic.See our cookie policy', '', '', '', '', '']"

And all are crucial elements of the Massachusetts economy and health care structure.', 'That\'s why veteran 2nd District Congressman Jim McGovern, a Democrat, said he has ""chills up the spine"" these days.', '""It means an awful lot for Massachusetts and our economy,"" he told WBZ-TV. ""NIH is more than just a line item. I mean, it is about investing in research to find cures to things like cancer and every other disease and ailment out there, Massachusetts has some of the finest medical schools and universities in the world, and we get a pretty big chunk of those research dollars here, which helps support this research that saves lives but also creates lots and lots of jobs.""', 'McGovern also spoke about the importance of Medicaid.', '""It not only provides health care for people who struggle and are in the lower income brackets, but it also provides benefits to people who are in the middle income,"" McGovern said. ""Oftentimes when people have long-term care it means they transition onto Medicaid. But look, we should be talking about expanding health care benefits, improving our health care system in this country. We shouldn\'t be talking about how we how we can contract it, how we take benefits away from people. That\'s shortsighted, and by the way, it doesn\'t save you any money, it just adds costs in a whole bunch of other areas.""', 'So what do McGovern and his fellow Democrats in Congress intend to do about it?', '""We are fighting like hell,"" he said. ""We\'re fighting in committee. We\'re fighting on the floor. We are offering amendments. We are making demands of this new administration. We are supporting litigation when that is appropriate, and we\'re using every maneuver and every mechanism available to us to try to stop things that we know will do harm to the people of Massachusetts and of this country.""', ""The Massachusetts Democrat said he believes Trump's policies are harmful to working class Americans."", '""As we speak, the overwhelming majority of the American people disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling the economy. He came to office in part because he promised he was going to lower the cost of living for people, and the opposite has happened,"" McGovern said. ""Prices have gone up, but it\'s not just eggs, it\'s gas, it\'s everything, and with the tariffs that he\'s putting in place, you\'re going to see costs rising in construction. And this is not what he promised. And he has been focused on things that are about enriching him and his buddy Elon, and about trying to get a tax cuts passed to help millionaires or billionaires, but he hasn\'t done a damn thing for average working people in this country.""', 'McGovern was asked if Democrats need to change their messaging and priorities in the wake of their losses last fall.', '""I think we have to be in sync with where average working families are...talking about those bread and butter issues,"" McGovern said. ""My old boss, Congressman Joe Moakley, used to say people look at life through their kitchen window. I think he was right, and we have to make sure that we are understanding where so many working families are and what they\'re dealing with. And we have to address those issues.""', ""He said members of his party have to focus on fighting Trump's cuts."", '""We have to fight Trump on the cuts and on the terrible priorities that he was kind of putting forward ... and we have to outline a positive vision that is convincing,"" McGovern said. ""I think one of the mistakes that Kamala Harris made was not conceding that people were struggling. I get it, you know, she was Biden\'s vice president and didn\'t want to criticize him, but the bottom line is, a little more criticism might have been helpful in helping her get over the finish line.""', 'So what happens if the White House chooses to ignore the growing number of court orders to delay or stop the cuts? ', '""Then we have a full-blown constitutional crisis and I think it requires some dramatic action in response,"" McGovern said. ""We can\'t just sit back and let our democracy just fall apart. You can\'t let Donald Trump and Elon Musk basically rob us of our democracy and disrespect the Constitution. What we need to think about are things like maybe a national strike across this country, and there\'s precedent in Europe and Poland, I remember a national strike helped stop the communist government from cracking down on the Solidarity movement. But we\'re going to have to be thinking out of the box, because if we have a constitutional crisis, it\'s not going to be fixed by an amendment. It\'s going to it\'s going to be fixed by the people.

In fiscal year 2024, the agency sent about $26 billion to more than 500 grant recipients connected to colleges. About $7 billion of that went to the indirect expenses—a source of funding that universities argue is crucial but still doesn’t cover the full cost of conducting research.', 'Federal data shows that in fiscal year 2022, universities contributed approximately $25 billion of their own institutional funds to support research, including more than $6.2 billion for the federal government’s share of indirect costs that it did not reimburse.', 'Nonetheless, Elon Musk, the unelected billionaire bureaucrat President Donald Trump has charged with heading the nascent Department of Government Efficiency, characterized NIH reimbursements for universities for indirect research costs as “a rip-off.” Meanwhile, the academic research community warned that such drastic cuts—which Trump failed to get congressional approval for during his first term—would hamper university budgets, local economies and medical breakthroughs.', 'Within days of NIH’s directive, a federal judge put the rate cut on hold after 22 state attorneys general sued the agency, joined by numerous higher education research advocacy organizations, including the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education. Across three separate lawsuits, they argued NIH doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally change the cap and that its guidance was “arbitrary and capricious,” among other points.', 'Although the nationwide injunction gave colleges a brief reprieve from the cuts, which briefly took effect Feb. 10, university administrators have spent the last two weeks sounding the alarm about the estimated losses and other impacts. Some Republicans in Congress have also opposed the plan, saying it violates language in federal legislation that bars NIH from modifying indirect costs.', 'In its motion for the dismissal of the injunction filed on Feb. 14—a day before the NIH fired some 1,000 workers—lawyers for the agency argued that the federal district court “lacks jurisdiction” over the case and only federal claims court should hear the case, because the plaintiffs “are effectively seeking damages for breach of contract—the regulations incorporated into their grant agreements.” They also claimed that the NIH “ran afoul of no statute” and that the plaintiffs “have failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury” without a temporary restraining order.', '“Where declarants assert that reducing funds is likely to harm research or clinical trials,” the motion said, “they generally do not assert that those harms are imminent as opposed to eventual reductions in their capacity that would occur from sustained diminished funding after a ruling on the merits.”', 'The motion went on to claim that the NIH’s capping of indirect cost rates seeks to “further its mission of advancing public health in a manner reflecting wise stewardship of the public money entrusted to it,” claiming that indirect costs are “difficult” for NIH to oversee. “To be clear, the Supplemental Guidance will not change NIH’s total grant spending; rather, it simply reallocates that grant spending away from indirect costs and toward the direct funding of research.”', 'But that’s not how the NIH publicly framed the indirect cost cap in a post on the social media site Musk owns that said the policy change will “save more than $4B a year effective immediately.”', 'And in a response filed earlier this week, the plaintiffs argued that the NIH’s policy change “bears no rational connection to NIH’s stated goal” in its court filings, because nothing in the NIH’s notice to cap indirect costs “directs more money to direct expenses.” The response also argues that the NIH has not provided adequate evidence to support its assertions that indirect costs are “difficult to oversee” and implored the court to reject the NIH’s attempt to “deprive Congress of its power of the purse.”', 'While the temporary injunction has halted the rate cap for about two weeks, it hasn’t stopped Trump and Musk from destabilizing federal science agencies in other ways. Over the past week, thousands of mostly probationary employees—ranging from top-ranking agency officials to grant administrators who help grantees ensure their projects are compliant with federal regulations—across numerous science agencies, including the NIH, the National Science Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lost their jobs.', '“The majority of what people who work for those agencies do is get the grant money out the door,” said Carrie Wolinetz, a science and health policy consultant who worked for the NIH between 2015 and 2023. “Because the layoffs took place across job categories, any of those critical positions could be affected. It’s hard to imagine that’s not going to have some impact on the ability of those agencies to fulfill its mission of getting those grants out the door.”', 'And even before the layoffs and indirect cost cap directive, the NIH had already derailed its operations by temporarily pausing communication and grant reviews last month. Although the courts put those orders on hold, Nature reported Thursday that nearly all NIH grant-review meetings remain suspended.', 'When the reviews finally do resume, the process will likely face even more challenges with fewer agency employees.', '“The fewer people, the greater the bottleneck,” Wolinetz said. “Uncertainty itself causes delays. When people are confused, afraid and worried after watching their colleagues being dismissed, all of that just causes a slowing down of the entire system.”', 'On Wednesday, hundreds of scientists, federal workers and their supporters rallied outside of Department of Health and Human Services headquarters in Washington, D.C., wielding signs with phrases such as “Leash That DOGE,” “Fight for Science” and “America Needs NIH Scientists” and speaking out against cuts to science funding.

Then a new graduate student joined the lab, so I moved these boxes to another shelf, which happened to be near a window. I left the samples there for a few months, until September 2024, when we received funding to run further analyses on them. But when I went to get the box, I noticed something was very wrong. There were there no labels on my samples! The sunlight had destroyed about 80 percent of the labels, so I was left with mostly blank slides.', ""My brain started spinning. I consulted Google to figure out how to make the labels visible again. Since Sharpie is a chemical itself, I thought it might leave some sort of residue, so I searched for residues under the microscope using different lights. But I couldn't find a thing. I had wanted to isolate the plastic particles from the samples and send them for spectrographic analysis to identify what types of polymers were present.

', 'In 1998, Huganir discovered a gene called SYNGAP1. About 1% of all children with intellectual disabilities have a mutation of the gene. He’s working to develop drugs to treat these children, who often have learning differences, seizures and sleep problems. He said his research is almost entirely reliant on NIH grants.', 'The search for a cure for these rare disorders is a race against time, because researchers think treatment will be most effective if administered when patients are children.', '“We’re developing therapeutics for the kids and may have a therapeutic that could be curing these kids in the next several years, but that research is going to be compromised,” Huganir said in an interview, estimating that scientists in his field could start a Phase 1 clinical trial within the next five years. “Any delay or anything that inhibits our research is devastating to the parents.”', 'From cancer researchers to those working in maternal health, Huganir’s predicament is familiar to many scientists across the country right now. Less than a month into his administration, President Donald Trump has embarked on a cost cutting program that threatens to reshape the infrastructure that has made the U.S. the envy of the world in medical innovation. His administration has frozen federal grants, ordered sweeping layoffs across federal agencies, cut funding for biomedical research and issued executive orders that threaten to shutter government programs focused on gender or diversity.', 'The NIH policy is only one piece of a dramatic overhaul of the federal agencies that has included aggressive and at-times untargeted cuts to scientific research. A judge halted the National Institutes of Health policy a little more than a week ago, at least temporarily, after 22 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit. Still, it has left some scientists, like Huganir, in fear they may have to slow or abandon research projects, potentially walking back years of progress and preventing new scientific breakthroughs. NIH did not respond to a request for comment after a request from NBC News on Friday.  ', 'The new administration’s blitz has provoked outcry among researchers, doctors and university leaders, many of whom are organizing for a showdown — in the courts and in public opinion — to save institutions, money and workers who have propelled research for decades.', '“There’s a battle ahead to protect not just the funding, but the social contract that the federal government and institutions have had to enable the scientific research enterprise in America in the last 80 years,” said Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the Science family of scientific journals.', 'In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the Trump administration was focused on better using taxpayer dollars on research, trimming the nation’s “bloated bureaucracy” and streamlining government operations. ', '“The Trump administration is committed to slashing waste, fraud, and abuse while increasing transparency of where limited taxpayer dollars from NIH are going and how exactly they’re advancing scientific research and development,” Desai said. “Contrary to the hysteria, redirecting billions of allocated NIH spending away from opaque administrative expenses means there will be more money and resources available for legitimate scientific research, not less.”', 'We’re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you have more information on DOGE at your agency, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.', 'The flurry of activity in recent weeks stems from Trump’s executive orders that aim to shrink the federal workforce and target programs related to gender identity, environmental justice or diversity, equity and inclusion.', 'In upending the scientific status quo, the Trump administration has focused on three main areas: cutting federal workers, slashing budgets and reversing efforts to expand diversity within science.', 'Its most significant financial move took place on Feb. 7, when NIH announced it would limit indirect funding for laboratories that receive federal research grants to 15%. The policy, if allowed to continue, would slash billions of dollars for overhead costs that support biomedical research. ', 'Though NIH estimated that the move would save $4 billion each year, it would also leave universities and research institutes to foot much of the bill instead, and many have said they simply can’t.', 'Today, when a scientist at Johns Hopkins University receives an NIH grant for a project — say, $1 million a year — the university receives an additional 55%, or $550,000, to cover overhead costs. The rate is negotiated between NIH and Johns Hopkins, and it’s based on an accounting of the university’s research expenses.', '“This is a huge cut. Johns Hopkins Medical School would lose $200 million a year,” Huganir said. “It’s not a viable enterprise to do science.”', 'In a written statement supporting the lawsuit from the 22 attorneys general, Michigan State University said a reduction in funding could force the university to abandon construction of a $330 million research building designed to support the study of cancer, cardiovascular disease and neuroscience.', 'It could also cut funding for the university’s MIRACLE Center, which pilots initiatives to reduce maternal and infant death, such as home medical visits or a support app for expectant mothers.', '“Without the indirect cost recovery, we would have to close it down or lay off many people,” Douglas Gage, the university’s vice president for research and innovation, said of the center.', 'In a separate lawsuit, the Association of American Universities argued that smaller institutions “will not be able to sustain any research at all and could close entirely.”', 'The uncertainty is affecting prospective students as well.', 'William Tate IV, the president of Louisiana State University, said the university had to change language in acceptance letters for graduate students on Thursday.', '“Historically, we say, ‘Welcome to LSU. You have a graduate assistantship. We’ll see you in August,’” Tate said. “Now, we have to have the caveat: ‘assuming we’re funded.’”', 'While many scientists aren’t opposed to reducing costs within federal agencies, they have taken issue with the way the Trump administration has broadly gutted budgets and staff without considering the ripple effects within the agencies.', '“I like the ambition of trying to identify government waste and trying to reduce regulations that are outdated or inefficient,” said Stuart Buck, executive director of the Good Science Project, a nonprofit that aims to improve the funding and practice of science. ', '“But I would worry that when the first thing out of the gate is to slash costs and slash employees, I think you end up possibly in the worst of all worlds, because now you have just as many bureaucratic hoops and regulations to jump through and not as much money or not as many people to handle it,” said Buck, who has critiqued NIH’s funding structure in the past.', 'Even a brief pause in a research project due to a freeze in federal funding or uncertainty about whether a project violates the president’s executive orders could cause damage.', '“The uncertainty creates huge disruptions,” said Arati Prabhakar, former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. “If it’s research that involves clinical trials with patients with diseases that they are desperately hoping to have treated, that’s just unethical to stop clinical trials and not be able to complete that kind of work.”', 'We might lose the lead on an entire field of research.', 'DEBORAH STINE, FOUNDER OF THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY ACADEMY', 'Major reductions in scientific funding will likely have ripple effects for generations to come, according to David Stensrud, a professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University and president of the American Meteorological Society.', '“The science investments that the government makes are just a few percent of the overall budget, but they are incredibly important investments in the next generation of scientists and the next generation of ideas,” Stensrud said.', 'Halting or abandoning research projects could also lead the U.S. to fall behind other countries in terms of scientific advancement, and encourage talent and investments to flow elsewhere.', '“If we don’t keep up, then, believe me, there’s plenty of work happening in Europe and in China,” said Deborah Stine, founder of the Science and Technology Policy Academy, an education services company. “We might lose the lead on an entire field of research.”', 'Huganir, for instance, said he’s trying to recruit 10 new faculty members in neuroscience and he thinks the odds of bringing in strong candidates from England and Germany have decreased because of the uncertainty around funding.', 'Dr. Joshua Barocas, an associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said meetings of the scientific council that reviews grants and makes determinations for funding are still on pause.', '“The entire cycle is disrupted. And when we disrupt the cycle for even a week, a month, that’s thousands of scientists, thousands of experiments and thousands of nonfederal employees who are impacted,” Barocas said at a media briefing hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.', 'In a news release on Friday, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said the Trump administration had halted all grant funding for 10 days, which meant that research institutions had received about 3,600 fewer NIH grants and $1 billion less in total funding in comparison to previous years.', 'As the administration seeks radical changes to research funding, it has also sought to cut employees at federal scientific agencies.', 'Wide-ranging cuts of probationary workers — who are typically in their first year of employment at federal agencies and not yet subject to the same job protections as more tenured staff members — have hit almost every corner of the government.', 'Some employees at the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration received termination notices on Thursday, according to a source with direct knowledge of the layoffs. A spokesperson for the DOE told NBC News that “less than a half of a percent of the total NNSA workforce was dismissed” last week. The administration on Friday sought to reinstate some of these workers, who oversee the nation’s nuclear stockpile, but struggled to get in touch.', 'Hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were let go as well, including a group of fellows responsible for training public health laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts.', 'A CDC employee said researchers within the agency have not been allowed to publish new material except in rare circumstances, and have had to pull their names from papers that are due to be released and include language that violates Trump’s executive orders. CDC employees must also receive approval before they can communicate with outside partners, such as nonprofits, the employee said. The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Similar shake-ups are anticipated at other science agencies, including NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which manages the National Weather Service.', 'Employees at the National Science Foundation (NSF) have been told that up to half of the agency’s staff could be laid off soon. And the U.S. Forest Service on Thursday indicated that it planned to lay off at least 3,400 workers, according to a union representative, which would cut the agency’s staffing by about 10%.', 'Matt Brown, the recording secretary for NIH Fellows United, a union that represents about 5,000 fellows, said NIH staffers were let go on Friday. He did not know how many had been terminated. ', '“From my understanding it’s likely to be in the hundreds to thousands,” Brown said. ', 'The Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month placed about 170 staffers on administrative leave who worked on environmental justice, which refers to the idea that people should have equitable access to clean and healthy environments and that some underserved communities have historically faced disproportionate environmental harms. The agency last month notified another 1,100 probationary employees they could be let go at any moment. Some of those employees received termination notices on Friday, but it was not immediately clear how many employees were affected in total and the agency did not respond to questions. ', 'EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news release that the Biden administration “used DEI and Environmental Justice to advance ideological priorities, distributing billions of dollars to organizations in the name of climate equity.”', '“This ends now,” he added. “We will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed.”', 'One EPA staffer, who was placed on administrative leave last week, said staffers were given only 24 hours’ notice that they might be placed on leave, which left them little time to finish ongoing projects. The notices went out by email. Direct managers seemed to be in the dark about what was happening.', '“They’re not able to provide answers to our questions. They don’t have answers either,” the staffer said on condition of anonymity.', 'The agency also ruffled staff on Wednesday by telling most remote and telework employees — including those who live more than 50 miles from the nearest EPA office — that they could no longer work from home. Union representatives said the EPA never bargained over the change.', '“This is another step in the psychological abuse of federal employees,” said Marie Owens Powell, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a union that represents about 8,500 EPA staffers.', 'Desai, the White House spokesman, said President Trump had been “given a mandate by the American people to streamline our bloated bureaucracy.”  ', '“Cuts to the federal workforce, especially relating to the domains of science and research, were calculated decisions made to make our government more efficient without sacrificing on our ability to advance research and keep Americans safe,” Desai said.', 'Some federal employees who remained were compelled to spend their time looking for newly verboten words or ideas.', 'At the NSF, employees were enlisted to comb through tens of thousands of research grants in search of keywords that violated Trump’s executive orders. Employees also scrubbed the keywords from project proposals and announcements.', 'An NSF media officer said the agency is “working expeditiously to conduct a comprehensive review of our projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders.”', 'Three NSF employees told NBC News that the list of forbidden words was unnecessarily broad, meaning new research projects could potentially exclude a large swath of study participants, including people of color or those with disabilities. They feared that some existing projects wouldn’t be allowed to continue at all under the Trump administration, particularly since the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act instructed the NSF to broaden participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) research and education to underrepresented groups.', 'Two of the employees added that the assignment to scrub keywords distracted from people’s normal workload.', 'Meanwhile, at the EPA, a group of about 40 employees was tasked with reviewing more than 6,000 agency webpages, screening for terms like “EJ” or “Environmental Justice.”', '“There is so much of this useless busywork, the opposite of government efficiency,” one worker wrote in a message to NBC News.', 'CDC scientists were also told to remove terms such as “gender,” “transgender” or “pregnant people” from the agency’s webpages, one employee said. Indeed, references to diversity and gender — including HIV-related content — have been widely purged from the agency’s website.', 'The Trump administration has also shuttered diversity programs that some viewed as important gateways to careers in science, including NIH’s F31 program and NSF Advance, which focused on developing a more diverse bench.', '“Those programs have allowed lots of people to come into science that didn’t realize it was for them, and that’s a lot of talent we’re not going to be getting,” Thorp said. “The irony there is, part of the goal is to get more American-born scientists. If you want to do that, the last thing you’d do is cut off these programs.”', 'Desai, the White House spokesman, said in a statement that the White House sought to restore “the primacy of merit and competence” and that the president had a mandate from voters to scrap diversity, equity and inclusion efforts he said were “choke-holding” institutions. ', '“Finite resources can’t be spent on advancing vague social goals but must be invested in cutting-edge research being undertaken by our best and brightest minds to expand our understanding of the universe and apply scientific breakthroughs to elevate our material well being,” Desai said. ', '“Plenty of government time, money, and resources were wasted on the front end of enforcing DEI policies that did nothing to advance scientific research. Undoing the damage inflicted by the prior administration is a necessary step in the Trump administration’s plan to streamline our government to best advance scientific research and development.”', 'The Trump administration’s actions will be tested in the courts and fought by unions. But scientists and university leaders said they have another fight ahead: They need to convince Americans — and Congress — that science is worth the investment.', 'Three NSF employees said most people within the agency have declined to accept buyout offers from the Trump administration in an effort to protect their research.', 'Last week, Stensrud sent a letter to members of the American Meteorological Society urging them to contact their elected officials in Congress to discuss the importance of scientific research, weather forecasting and climate science to the American public.', 'The idea, Stensrud said, was to “get out ahead” of expected changes at NOAA and other agencies, and to “separate fact from fiction.”', 'The funding cuts at NIH have prompted concern across the political spectrum.', '“It’s not going to only impact blue states, it’s going to impact red states and people who need these cures and therapies,” Huganir said, adding that the court’s restraining order gives scientists time to make a case to stem the funding cut.', '“We’ve put it off for a while and have time to lobby,” he said, speaking for researchers like himself.', 'Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., have all gently pushed back against Trump’s plan to cap indirect costs at NIH, with Collins calling it “poorly conceived.” Universities in red Southern states such as Alabama and Louisiana have also put out statements decrying the funding shortfalls.', '“In the state of Louisiana, we have some of the highest cancer disparities in the United States of America,” said Tate, the president of LSU, adding that the university could lose hundreds of research jobs if the cuts are effected. “This is not a political issue.

"As research universities head to court, WESA analysis finds NIH grants lagging during Trump admin",https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-grants-indirects-trump-pittsburgh,"['Research universities won another short-term victory in federal court Friday over a plan to slash billions in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health. A federal judge extended a temporary block to that plan, the latest court ruling slowing attempts by the Trump administration to quickly reduce or freeze federal grant spending.', 'But despite court orders to maintain the status quo of funding, it appears NIH grants have already slowed down. A WESA analysis of funding data from the NIH found that the agency has slowed down its regular pace of grant awards since President Donald Trump took office in January.', 'Experts in education research funding, former NIH staffers and researchers themselves said it’s hard to narrow down one cause for the delay, but they all agreed that confusion created by a flurry of executive orders dismissing certain research categories is a factor.', 'And with almost all grant review meetings on indefinite hold at NIH, the plunge in funding is likely to continue.', 'Between Inauguration Day and Feb. 15, roughly $781 million have been awarded to projects at research institutions nationwide. That’s a nearly 56% decrease compared to the same period in 2024 when $1.8 billion were awarded.', 'Using the NIH RePORTER database, WESA calculated the amount of money awarded during the first month of Trump’s second term and compared that to awards posted during the same period going back 10 years. So far, 2025 NIH grant amounts are lower than they were during the Biden administration and even during Trump’s first term in office.', 'The NIH office of extramural research acknowledged that the agency makes “data available to the public to conduct their own analysis,” but it declined to comment on the numbers shared by WESA.', 'NIH data show that the Pittsburgh region has seen a decrease comparable to the nationwide slump. In the time since Trump took office, Pittsburgh research institutions have received $11.65 million, a 58% decrease compared to the same period in 2024. In 2020, the final year of Trump’s first term, Pittsburgh received more than double what it has so far this year: $28.08 million between Jan. 20 and Feb.15.', 'The drop could illustrate effects of the sweeping funding cuts proposed by President Trump, even while their formal implementation remains tied up in court.', 'The University of Pittsburgh, the highest recipient of grant funding in Western Pennsylvania, declined to comment on the apparent slowing of funds. Carnegie Mellon University, another Pittsburgh-based NIH grant recipient, also declined to comment on the data. A spokesperson said CMU would not comment on NIH funding during ongoing litigation against the federal government over plans to slash support for research overhead costs.', 'The Trump administration directed the NIH earlier this month to cap funds for indirect costs at 15%, which the agency said would save the government $4 billion annually. But the plan could drive a hole into the budget of major medical research institutions. If the NIH had implemented these cuts for the 2024 fiscal year, the University of Pittsburgh would have seen a $115 million drop in indirect funds, which cover facilities, equipment and support staff.', 'A coalition of states and research universities has filed multiple lawsuits attempting to block the policy, alleging that such changes would grind innovative medical research to a halt, forcing labs to close and lay off workers. But critics argue grants for indirect costs are a waste of taxpayer dollars. Proponents of reducing federal spending, including the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, claim that indirect-costs grants could be used as a slush fund because some institutions channel the money into a shared pool.', 'The funding slowdown during Trump’s first month back in office doesn’t necessarily indicate a cut to funds for existing research. Most of the grants WESA analyzed that have been awarded in the Pittsburgh region this month supported ongoing research.', 'The NIH did not comment on whether its RePORTER website was behind in posting new grant award notices, though such a delay could also have an impact on the numbers analyzed by WESA.', 'But sources tell WESA that the difference likely illustrates the impact of a stoppage of awards for new projects. That theory seems to be supported by dozens of social media posts this week from researchers claiming their projects are languishing in an uncertain state of limbo.', 'Whether the drop is driven by backlogged approvals, federal staffing reductions or pivoting priorities under the Trump administration, the result has been fewer dollars to support scientific research this month.', 'Chaos created by a blitz of executive orders aimed at shrinking the federal workforce and slashing budgets for programs related to gender identity or diversity, equity and inclusion has clogged the federal funding infrastructure, according to two former NIH employees who spoke to WESA on the condition of anonymity because they fear speaking publicly may invite reprisals or jeopardize future employment.', 'Official communications from the NIH reviewed by WESA state that under “current guidance” grants “can be awarded,” but the communication did not state whether that was happening this week.', '“No new projects are being started,” said a former NIH institute director. And meetings required by law to approve grants are also not happening, they said. The NIH has not issued any calls for new grants since January 22, the third day of Trump’s term.', 'An NIH staffer who oversaw certain outgoing grant awards said that in the past month, virtually all new grants have been paused while the agency looks for language that could run afoul of the Trump administration’s block on DEI initiatives.', 'That staffer was laid off last weekend alongside more than 1,000 others at the NIH. And that workforce shrinkage could further slow grant reviews, the staffer said.', '“We were already understaffed and overworked,” they said. “Working overtime, weekends, that was standard.”', 'Though some research institutions will be able to weather the storm, the former NIH staffer said, the clog in funding infrastructure could be catastrophic for young labs and researchers.', '“It’s going to be a shock that will be hard to recover from for many labs,” they said. “And the junior [researchers] that are just getting their career started, this could be a career-ender for all of them.”', 'Since much of the implementation of the executive orders has been left up to interpretation, NIH staffers said research not centered on DEI initiatives is being impacted too, according to NIH staff.', ""“Most of what's not being funded are very basic studies or clinical trials of Alzheimer's and heart disease and animal studies of basic biological processes and they just don't have any political component to them at all,” the former director said."", 'Though funds have been unusually slow during the first weeks of the Trump administration, NIH staff say there is hope that an equally unusual boom in funds later could balance out the damage.', '“If they allow grants to ultimately go out, there should be a big spike coming up in the next couple of months, which is what everybody is hoping for,” said a former staffer.', 'But as approval meetings continue to be canceled without indication of when they could be rescheduled, others who have worked at the NIH are less optimistic.', ""“It's just going to get worse and worse,” said the former director. “There really isn't very much money going out the door now compared to the normal pace. I think the 2025 lines are just going to fall further and further behind.”"", ""Grant awards appear to decline in mid-January before coming to a screeching halt in early February, according to NIH data. That timeline aligns with when Trump's executive orders were announced."", '“There were hiccups when the initial funding freeze was put in place, and that may have stopped some of this,” said Holden Thorp, a professor at George Washington University and editor-in-chief of the Science family of journals. Thorp spoke on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.', 'NIH has scaled back its funding before: The 2008 recession brought budget cuts, and the COVID-19 pandemic required a significant shift in priorities. But Thorp said what we’re seeing now is new.', ""“What’s different here is that there's a philosophical problem in addition to just a financial problem,” he said, pointing to Trump’s statements discouraging scientific research that emphasizes diversity, equity and inclusion. But Thorp stopped short of arguing that Trump’s proposed funding freezes are the sole driver behind the drop in funding."", 'And others stressed that NIH hesitation and evolving strategies by the research institutions themselves could play a role. Sarah Spreitzer, vice president and chief of staff for government relations at the American Council on Education, said it’s difficult to summarize how many moving parts could be backlogging funds. The American Council on Education is a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the proposed indirect funding cap.', 'Spreitzer said during the confusion about how reliable future federal grant funding would be, some research institutions, including the University of Iowa, have taken their own pause.', ""“Some institutions and some researchers are actually kind of slowing down and trying to figure out if they're even going to try to apply for federal funding,” she said."", 'And she said agencies like NIH could be wary of spending on new projects before Congress finishes its budget process.', ""“If they're concerned about funding being provided for new programs or funding cuts coming in fiscal year 2025, the agency may be worried about allocating funds,” she said."", 'Congress is closing in on a March 14 deadline to prevent a government shutdown, and a plan to keep the lights on has not been made clear. Without an agreement, Congress could agree to another continuing resolution to extend the existing funding to avoid a shutdown.', 'But the former NIH institute director downplayed the impact of a budget impasse on whether the NIH continues to award funds that have already been appropriated by Congress.', '“There may be a little bit of that, but I think this is mostly [the result of] ideologically driven decisions about NIH,” they said. “[There is] this wholesale sort of blocking research without regard to what it is and then these not well-defined executive orders to decide what sort of research is OK and not OK.”', 'And another NIH staffer said Congressional budget uncertainty is not a new problem for the agency, which has had to continue funding during fragile budget talks on several occasions.', '“You can look at previous years like last year, there was a continuing resolution at this point in time and money was still flowing,” they said.', 'During the 2019 federal government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, WESA found that $1.57 billion was still awarded to research institutions between January 20 and February 15. The shutdown lasted through January 25 and suspended some federal services during that time.', 'Whether Congress will be able to reach a deal before its next budget deadline is yet to be seen. But moving forward, Thorp argues Pennsylvania and its research institutions could be a major voice for federal grant funding as lawmakers negotiate the 2025 spending plan.', '“You’ve got a lot of NIH activity in the state,” Thorp said. “Pennsylvania should be very influential in the months to come.”', 'But he stressed that any public campaign would likely have to be led by Pennsylvania’s senators and congressional representatives as universities fear speaking out could put a target on their backs.', ""“I think the institutions are worried about saying stuff because they don't want to stick their head out and be recognized by the administration as causing problems,” said Thorp, who for five years was the chancellor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."", ""“Between the indirect cost cuts and this choppy activity at the NIH itself, I think there's plenty of good reasons for people to be anxious,” he said."", ""But Pennsylvania has not signed onto a lawsuit filed by 22 states seeking to block Trump's policy on indirect research funding. A spokesperson for Attorney General Dave Sunday said the office is speaking to Pennsylvania's research institutions, but that it had no update about any plans to join legal challenges."", 'And though the research sector has only begun to understand how a reduced NIH workforce could further impact research funding, Spreitzer said fewer people to process grants would almost certainly result in slowing down the funding infrastructure even further. And that could throw a wrench in what research institutions can afford to do.', '“I think that the partnership between the federal government and our institutions of higher education is really at a turning point right now,” Spreitzer said.', '', 'To conduct our analysis on the impact of NIH reducing indirect research costs to 15%, we leaned on methodology the New York Times used in a similar national report. Using FY2024 data from NIH’s RePORT registry, we limited our analysis to Pennsylvania institutions. We removed any grants that did not break out direct/indirect costs and ones where combined direct and indirect costs were not within 5% of the listed total funding. To calculate the Funding w/Trump Cuts column, we multiplied institutions’ total direct costs by 15% and then combined those two figures. To find the Estimated Change, we subtracted the Funding w/Trump Cuts from the listed 2024 Funding.

Why Cutting Basic Science Funding May Amount to Economic Unilateral Disarmament,https://www.aei.org/economics/why-cutting-basic-science-funding-may-amount-to-economic-unilateral-disarmament/,"['By James Pethokoukis', 'AEIdeas', 'February 20, 2025', 'Earlier this month, Eric Berger of Ars Technica reported that the White Houses’ first budget request of Donald Trump’s second term could be a fiscal reckoning for America’s government scientific enterprise. The National Science Foundation, a cornerstone of the country’s research infrastructure with its annual $9 billion purse, might face particularly savage cuts. According to Berger, Intelligence from within the administration suggested the agency’s budget could be slashed by up to two-thirds, potentially shrinking to a mere $3 billion. ', 'Berger also reported that at fraught staff meeting, Susan Margulies, the NSF’s assistant director for engineering, delivered the grim forecast that between a quarter and half of the workforce may soon be on the chopping block. The appointment of Russ Vought as budget director—who previously advocated reducing the NSF to $3.9 billion while criticising its alleged “woke ideology”—signaled that America’s scientific community may soon experience the administration’s budget-cutting zeal in full force.', 'That was then, and this is now:', 'The National Science Foundation went beyond the staff cuts demanded by the Trump administration in a move that set off a frenzied backlash at the science funding agency.NSF fired about 10 percent of its staff at the end of Tuesday, removing 168 people who included most of the agency’s probationary employees and all of its experts, a class of contract workers who are specialists in niche scientific fields. The agency didn’t have to fire its experts but decided to in the interest of fairness, a top NSF official told staffers in an emotionally charged hybrid meeting Tuesday morning at its Alexandria, Virginia, headquarters. “The removal of experts was completely at the agency’s discretion. Because if we’re asked to remove probationers, then we also need to remove at-will employees,” Micah Cheatham, NSF’s chief management officer, said at the tense and tearful hour-long meeting, according to a transcript obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News. “This is the first of many forthcoming workforce reductions,” he added.', 'As I write in my 2023 book, The Conservative Futurist: How To Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised, America’s research ecosystem suffers from a growing imbalance threatening its technological edge. Private-sector R&D, focused on commercial applications, exceeds 2 percent of GDP. That’s great. Meanwhile, government funding — essential for fundamental scientific inquiry  — has withered from its Space Race peak of nearly 2 percent to just 0.7 percent, with Biden’s initiatives making only modest corrections. While corporations excel at monetizing discoveries, they rarely fund the foundational science that enables transformative innovations.', 'Unfortunately, that lack of obvious real-word uses for basic research is often used as an excuse to diminish its importance. A number of great examples of how strange and impractical science has ofted yielded high-impact breakthroughs can be found in “A Defense of Weird Research” by Deena Mousa and Lauren Gilbert in Asterisk magazine. They write:', '“Projects that seem odd or impractical — on animal behavior, obscure molecules, or fundamental physics — may be easy targets for ridicule, but such studies have repeatedly yielded transformative breakthroughs. While it makes sense to pursue efficiency in government spending, the returns on federal science funding are, on average, extremely high.”', 'A few examples from the piece:', 'Nations seldom create wealth by pinching pennies. America’s scientific pre-eminence, once unassailable, now faces stiff competition from geopolitical rivals. The prescription seems straightforward: a bold return to Apollo-era levels of government research funding. Yes, bureaucratic bloat certainly warrants a scalpel and reforms should be made so that out-of-the-box ideas are taken more seriously.

Trump halts medical research funding in apparent violation of judge’s order,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/23/trump-nih-health-medical-research,"['Health department orders NIH to hold Federal Register submissions – critical step in process for funding studies', 'The Trump administration has blocked a crucial step in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) process for funding medical research, likely in violation of a federal judge’s temporary restraining order on federal funding freezes.', 'The NIH has stopped submitting study sections – meetings in which scientists peer review NIH grant funding proposals – to the Federal Register after the Trump administration paused health agency communications. By law, study sections must appear on the register 15 days in advance of meetings.', '“The idea is that the public has the right to know who’s giving advice to the federal government and when they’re meeting,” said Jeremy Berg, a biochemist who has overseen NIH funding in the past.', 'These meetings are integral in the funding process for scientists at institutions around the country researching virtually all elements of disease and medicine, including drug development, cancer, heart disease and aging.', 'An internal NIH email the Guardian obtained confirmed that the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has instructed the NIH to indefinitely hold Federal Register submissions.', 'Carole LaBonne, a Northwestern University biologist who runs a stem cell lab and has participated in study sections, said by doing this “they effectively shut down the extramural research program”.', 'This is a clear violation of federal judges’ orders, according to Samuel Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan who served as HHS’s general counsel until December 2024.', 'Judge John McConnnell “initially issued a temporary restraining order saying stop the funding pause,” Bagenstos said, “and then after receiving evidence that the Trump administration was trying to evade that order, he issued a further, broader order, saying that, first of all the, the Trump administration must immediately end any federal funding pause. Secondly, and this is the crucial language, including clearing any administrative, operational or technical hurdles to implementation.”', 'So, “this idea that we’re gonna spend the money, but we’re only gonna spend the money after we have study sections, and – oops – we can’t have study sections because we’re not allowing notices of study sections to be filed in the Federal Register” unambiguously ignores that language, Bagenstos added.', 'If the Trump administration continues to evade court orders, Bagenstos says judges have a number of tools at their disposal. They could issue more specific orders directed toward individuals responsible for violations, or even hold them in civil contempt of court, which can include jail time, and which cannot be undone with a presidential pardon.', 'Study sections bring scientists from institutions around the country together to peer review grant proposals, said Berg. Each section brings 20 or more peer reviewers together to review as many as 100 proposals.', '“It’s basically about two weeks of work” for each reviewer, says Berg.', 'A source familiar with the process estimated that for every three days’ worth of delayed study sections, $1bn of NIH funding is put on hold. Even though study sections are required to appear on the Federal Register 15 days in advance, meetings scheduled to begin on 20 February were postponed the day before.', '“This week, without warning, as we were checking in to our flights for DC, my study section was canceled for no reason,” said one scientist who was supposed to have her grant proposal reviewed. The cancellations led the scientist and her colleagues to collectively put together that the problem was related to the Federal Register – a relatively obscure step in the process.', 'Two scientists scheduled to attend 20 February study sections as reviewers said they had never heard about the requirement until this week. One suspected the maneuver is “another clever way to wage war on medical science” because few people, even those who work at the NIH, completely understand how it works. It’s a “logistical thing that someone like me would never have to interact with, or likely would never have heard of”, he said.', 'None of the scientists the Guardian spoke to received an explanation as to why study sections were not cancelled until the last minute, even though they were required to appear on the Federal Register 15 days in advance but never did. LaBonne suspects it’s because NIH staff are still hoping the meetings can go forward somehow.', '“They’re trying to keep it possible till the very last minute in hopes that someone has mercy and allows study sections to continue, and maybe even waives the 15 day requirement,” LaBonne explained.', 'Stuart Buck, a Harvard Law graduate and executive director of the Good Science Project, says these moves make it “very hard to read the tea leaves” about what will happen next.', 'Jay Bhattacharya, who Trump nominated to direct the NIH, has “not even had a confirmation hearing yet”, Buck said. “Why rush out policies that are pretty drastic without the involvement of the people who are supposed to be the experts running the agency?”', 'Buck continued: “All the public rhetoric is about reducing the deficit or reducing regulation. But the things they’re doing so far are mostly not aimed at the deficit or regulation at all. They’re canceling contracts that are trivial compared to the deficit … firing people and canceling things and creating chaos everywhere.”', 'A scientist who was supposed to attend a postponed study section as a reviewer also had trouble making sense of these actions. If the meetings are ever rescheduled, reviewers will either have forgotten details of the proposals they reviewed or have to spend extra time reviewing them again, which will take time away from their own medical research.', '“This whole thing makes so little sense to me. They’re not even saving any money by doing this. And ultimately, what they’re doing is going to cost more money than anything else, by just delaying everything and kind of screwing up people’s lives,” he said.', 'Another reviewer said the time waste was “annoying” but “the real disturbing thing here is that there’s a lot of really great science in those grants that really needs to be funded in a time-sensitive way. And if it’s not, labs are going to close.”', 'The NIH press office did not respond to a request for comment in time to be included in the story.', 'This article was amended on 23 February 2025 to clarify that Jeremy Berg’s job title is biochemist, not genetic scientist as previously stated.']"
