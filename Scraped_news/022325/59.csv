You know how this goes, don't you?"", ""Kumble: Kohli's mind was at ease today"", ""It was never in doubt. Even he himself seemed to say that. This didn't need a professional lip-reader."", '""I told you. Relax,"" Virat Kohli said to the change room as he finished the game against Pakistan off with a four that also brought up his 51st ODI century.', 'He might have been saying that to those who had been concerned if he would get the hundred, or to those who had been concerned about the overall chase, seeing how India got into trouble on a slow pitch after the first wicket against Bangladesh. And three times against Sri Lanka on similar slow tracks last year.', ""Beating Pakistan not enough for Shreyas Iyer - 'We could have won a bit earlier'"", ""Kohli 100* headlines India's comprehensive win over Pakistan"", ""Kohli breaks Tendulkar's record for fastest to 14,000 ODI runs"", 'Kohli breaks record for most outfield catches for India in ODIs', ""A Tendulkar fan's complicated relationship with Kohli"", 'This was a better batting pitch, and Pakistan had only one threatening spinner. In such a scenario, Kohli coming in with more than 200 runs still required and 45 overs to go, neither the win nor the century could be in much doubt. Not even when he was running out of runs to score to get to the landmark. We have seen that in the last ODI World Cup - he can catch up.', ""We say that. But batting is an activity where you fail way more often than you succeed. Let's say success is scoring at least 30 runs in a win. Even a great such as Kohli has done that only 115 times out of 299, and that's a freakish rate."", 'And, at 36, in an era of such little ODI cricket and ball dominating in Tests, success can feel elusive even though he has played just six innings between the great World Cup he had and this hundred. To the extent that Kohli can ""feel a bit down"", and eventually surrender himself to the gods, cricketing or otherwise.', '""I think one of the keynotes there is I kept telling myself in the field - whenever I was feeling a bit down - that I\'m going to put my 100% on every ball that I field,"" Kohli told the official broadcast. ""And at some time, I will get the rewards for the hard work that I\'m putting in on the ground. That\'s why I take a lot of pride in working hard, and running around the field as well. And yeah, when you put your head down and you work hard enough, then I think god rewards you accordingly. So I\'m very grateful and thankful to god.""', 'Once Kohli lets his instinctive game take over, though, these chases can look like cakewalks. Under five an over to get, only one spinner to negate, the ball coming on to the bat, Kohli can make a high-pressure game look mundane. That is a quality that should never be understated. He faced 30 balls from Abrar Ahmed, attempted only one boundary, and took just 16 runs off him. Not to mention he has been out to wristspinners in the last five innings he has faced them in, for just 21 runs.', '""My job was pretty clear: to control the middle overs, to try and go after the seam bowlers, and not take too many risks against the spinners, but keep rotating strike,"" Kohli said. ""And once we strung in a nice partnership, then towards the end, Shreyas [Iyer] accelerated and I got a few boundaries away as well. It was more or less the way I play ODI cricket, so I was happy with the template.""', 'This is something it seems Kohli can do with one arm tied behind his back, but this was an India-Pakistan match and he is a human after all. ""For me, it\'s just about keeping the outside noise and the distractions away,"" Kohli said. ""I try to stay in my space as much as possible, really take care of how my energy levels are, what am I thinking, my thoughts, because it\'s very easy for me to kind of get pulled into the expectations and the frenzy around games like these.""', 'After the game, in which Kohli also knocked off two more records, one in the field and one with the bat, even the opposition acknowledged the hard work that goes into making it look this effortless.', '""I am in awe of his hard work,"" the Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan said. ""What kind of hard work he must have put in? The whole world is saying he is out of form, but he comes to a big match the whole world waits for, and scores runs effortlessly, wins the match, becomes the Man of the Match. I will praise his hard work and his fitness levels. We tried our best to get him out, but he got the better of us. It means he has put in the hard work behind the scenes.""', 'Now Kohli will put his feet up for two days because ""at 36, a week\'s break [between this and India\'s next game] is good"".', 'Sidharth Monga is a senior writer at ESPNcricinfo', '', '', '', '']"

He reverse paddles powerfully for four and then goes back to back with an orthodox sweep for four more. DROP! Shakeel spills Shreyas Iyer at midwicket! It was above his head but he got two hands to it as he leapt and the replay shows it was pretty regulation. Rizwan looks murderous under his zinc smears.', '29th over: India 150-2 (Kohli 64, Iyer 17) Kohli whips Shaheen down the ground with a flamingo flourish of the back leg.

He‚Äôs been at his imperious best so far today.', '28th over: India 140-2 (Kohli 55, Iyer 16) Another tidy over but sans breakthrough from Khushdil. Four singles off it.

Four more singles makes it eight from the over.', '26th over: India 128-2 (Kohli 47, Iyer 12) India have scored just 17 runs off the last five overs as Pakistan try to squeeze a wicket from the toothpaste tube. Khushdil returns to the attack and the left-armer keeps the pressure on with just two singles added.', '25th over: India 126-2 (Kohli 46, Iyer 11) Naseem Shah is impressive on his return, just a single to Kohli who drives wide of point and scampers through to keep strike.', '24th over: India 124-2 (Kohli 45, Iyer 10) Another miserly over from Abrar, just a Kohli single nudged down the ground. Pakistan are bringing back Naseem for another burst. They need wickets, India have 26 overs to get 118 runs.', '23rd over: India 123-2 (Kohli 44, Iyer 10) Shreyas Iyer hangs back and slaps a Haris Rauf short ball for four through square leg.', '22nd over: India 118-2 (Kohli 43, Iyer 6) Abrar Ahmed continues to impress with a warp speed over that costs just three runs. He has 1-18 from his six overs so far.

Things starting to happen for Pakistan, now is the time for them has to be.', '18th over: India 102-2 (Kohli 32, Iyer 1) Shreyas Iyer is the new batter. He clips a watchful single to get off the mark. Abrar‚Äôs golden ball came out of the front of the hand too. The mind boggles.', 'An absolute peach! What a ball from Abrar Ahmed to see the back of Shubman Gill. The batter can only stand rooted to the spot in disbelief as a ball that pitches outside leg stump spins sharply to nudge the off bail out of its groove. Play that!

Kohli has become the first player in the world to first batsman to slam a century against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, World Cup and in the Champions Trophy. ', '', ""Kohli had earlier scored centuries against the Men in Green in the Asia Cup and the World Cup and now has a ton against the team that he loves to play the most in the Champions Trophy too. This was Kohli's first-ever hundred in the Champions Trophy and 51st in ODI. "", ""Kohli's hundred was filled with some drama. When he was nearing his three-digit mark, India didn't had too many runs left as it was touch-and-go. Hardik Pandya came out with a strong intent, however, he was dismissed for 8. With four runs required for Kohli's hundred and two for India's win, the maestro batter punched one towards covers to get to his century and take India home with six wickets in hand and 45 balls to go."", 'Kohli mastered the 242-run chase against Pakistan. He held one end up extremely well to power the chase. He stitched a 69-run stand with Shubman Gill for the second before, before notching up a 114-run stand with Shreyas Iyer for the fourth wicket. India suffered a few blows but reached home comfortably in the end with six wickets in hand.', 'The Men in Green handed a target of 242 runs to India in the high-octane clash in Dubai. The Men in Green are almost in a must-win situation as a loss to India will all but knock them out of the tournament.', 'Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan had put up a 104-run stand for the third wicket to rebuild things for Pakistan after they lost their openers in quick succession. Shakeel was the top run-scorer for the team, having made 62 runs from 76 balls. ', 'Rizwan snailed his way to 46 from 77 deliveries as he looked to play the anchor role. However, his knock has come under scrutiny due to the strike rate. Khushdil Shah played a decent cameo as he made 38 from 39 balls to push the Men in Green closer to 250.', '¬© 2009-2025 Independent News Service. All rights reserved.']"

Ever since a collapse of 3 for 11 in 19 balls, this game turned pear-shaped for them."", 'Manjrekar: Hardik always delivers on the big stage', ""Mohammad Rizwan had banked on the innings going so differently. He came in at 47 for 2 and hit his first ball for four and then decided run-scoring was not for him. He was 24 off 50. He barely hit the ball in anger. He point blank refused to. At the other end, Saud Shakeel was at least making an effort to turn the good balls he was facing into singles. When he got to fifty, he had weathered only 29 dot balls. At the same time, Rizwan at the other end, had racked up 40. India did well by denying him spin to start his innings. But still, this was a better pitch than the opening game in Dubai a few days ago. It wasn't flat, but it had a little more pace in it, and it got better under lights. Rizwan, though, batted like it was cursed. He was worried bad things would happen if he tried to hit the ball hard."", 'And it kinda did. Rizwan fell trying to hit Axar out of the ground and his wicket triggered a collapse. Shakeel fell in the next over and Tayyab Tahir followed soon after. India, having spent 320 deliveries across two matches searching for a wicket in the middle overs, had found three in the space of four. Pakistan were 165 for 5. Soon they would be 200 for 7, having to negotiate the last 7.1 overs of the innings with their tail exposed.', ""India's discipline never let Pakistan off the hook and leading the way was Hardik, banging the ball just short of a length on a pitch that was offering a bit of grip and some tennis-ball bounce. He took out Babar Azam at a time when India's lead fast bowler, Mohammed Shami, was off the field with a shin problem, and he did Shakeel for lack of pace just after the left-hand batter had smacked him for four. He always knew what to do to exploit the conditions and make the batter's life miserable. On the back of his work, Kuldeep and Rana bowled 6.4 death overs for 28 runs and picked up four wickets."", 'Urooj: Pakistan have let themselves down again', ""Gill was the star of India's chase early on, a conscious effort to keep his front foot from moving too far forward and across leaving him excellently placed to take advantage of Afridi and his full-length deliveries when there was no swing on offer. When he rammed the fast bowler down the ground and then one-upped it by coming down the track and lifting the ball into the sightscreen, it looked like it was going to be his day. Abrar intervened with a ball that drifted in, tempting Gill to close the face of his bat, and turned away to rattle middle and off stump. Gill was stunned."", ""Kohli, too, offered a shrug of his shoulders. He looked vulnerable against Abrar too and was almost bowled playing back to him. But against the quicks, he was vintage. He went past 14,000 runs with a crisp cover drive off Haris Rauf. All of Pakistan's best bowlers offer pace on the ball. And that is Kohli's happy place. A batter of his quality needs to be made uncomfortable at the crease when he is new. He had been dismissed five times in his last six ODIs by legspin. Pakistan had one of those and they felt they couldn't go to him."", 'Manjrekar: Shreyas now looks comfortable against the short ball', 'Shreyas Iyer helped himself to a half-century. A little change in his technique where he holds his bat higher and waves it as the bowler approaches, creating momentum into his shots, is helping him deal with an earlier weakness against the short ball. He clubbed Rauf for four in front of square to prove it. But there was no taking the spotlight from his senior partner.', 'Kohli was setting the tempo. Pakistan had allowed him to do so. Though he only hit three of his first 62 balls to the boundary, he already had fifty runs to his name. He knows how to score quickly without looking for big shots. The ball wasn\'t stopping on the surface as much under lights. Things were working in his favour again. He almost knew he was going to get a hundred. He demanded an explanation when Axar turned down a second run off a wide in the 42nd over when it was clear to everybody else that all he was doing was make sure Kohli had the best chance to get to three figures with time running out. When he did, off the last ball of the match, Kohli looked to the dressing room and literally said, ""I told you. Relax."" That was how easy this was.

The holders and the hosts need other results to go their way to stay alive in their own tournament now."", ""India went into the game as favourites. They proved worthy of that seeding by limiting Pakistan to 241, Hardik Pandya putting in the kind of performance that should make him illegal. An allrounder capable of dismissing the opposition's best batter, and then coming back to take down their top-scorer, isn't just a name on the sheet. He is the secret sauce."", ""And Kuldeep Yadav was the spice. His left-arm wristspin is so rare and he made it rarer by finding a way to be quick through the air without compromising on turn or accuracy. So that means unless batters pick him out of the hand, they are always going to be guessing. Three Pakistan batters guessed wrong. All three were death-overs wickets. Pakistan were setting up to explode at the death. Kuldeep just wouldn't let them. The injury hasn't affected his menace."", ""Pakistan were able to produce moments. Shaheen Afridi sending down a 143kph inswinging yorker to shatter Rohit Sharma's stumps. Abrar Ahmed conjuring a carrom ball from hell to get rid of a rampaging Shubman Gill. But when it came to capitalising on them, they just couldn't. The end result was a world champion side that was renowned for pulling games out of the fire now seems to do the first part right - they definitely got into trouble in Dubai - but the other part, the important part is going so very wrong. Pakistan were 151 for 2 before they were bowled out for 241 with the most inexperienced member of the India side dictating terms, Harshit Rana and his slower balls were just impossible to hit."", ""A game in an ICC event, a rivalry with history bursting out of it, eventually became so one-sided that its last few moments were dominated by an individual pursuit. Axar Patel turned down an easy two so that Kohli could pursue his hundred. The crowd in Dubai loved that.

He's got a target in front of him. He's in his happy place. And as a sign of what it means - this game and these runs at this time - he raises his a few times. There's even this one moment where he does the Tendulkar raise of the bat, where he points it out horizontally, the face almost pointed down, to celebrate fifty."", ""Dinesh Karthik on commentary made an excellent observation about Shreyas Iyer's new batting set up. He now waits for fast bowlers with his hands up high and swinging the bat up and down. To me, it's a trick a little like a batter's trigger movement. It sets them in motion. It stops them from being stuck on the crease. It gees them up to play the ball."", ""In the same way, that bat-wavy thing Iyer does as he waits for the quick bowler might just set him up for the pull shot. He's just played one to a 143 kph Haris Rauf delivery and made such sweet connection that it went well in front of square. In front of midwicket too."", ""It's clear he's expecting the short ball and his hands - up high and generating momentum - are putting him in position and attack it. If there's room, he's going for the shot. If there isn't, he's ducking underneath. He's also made sure he isn't caught off guard by the fuller ball. Impressive work, both by him and by his coaches."", ""In the last ball of the 21st over, after completing a quick single, Virat Kohli stops the throw coming in with his hand. Strictly speaking, that's obstructing the field. India took out Inzamam-ul-Haq that way in an ODI once. Nobody appealed. Maybe because he had made his ground. And then apologised for his brainfade."", ""It's another jaffa!"", 'Gill CANNOT believe it.', 'He hears the rattle of his stumps behind him and his mouth opens, stunned.', 'He looks back, as if needing visual confirmation for that tremor that went down his spine.', 'How did that spin so far?', 'How did that spin so fast?', 'A carrom ball from hell.', ""Drifting in to pitch on leg stump, maybe even outside, which is why Gill is closing the face of his bat, looking to flick to midwicket. India are also choosing to play Abrar off the back foot and its usually a pain when batters do that. As a spinner, you feel all your good work goes down the drain because once the ball pitches it loses pace and with the time the batter has, having gone deep in his crease, he can just knock you around. Abrar doesn't let that happen. The turn he gets is sharp. It's quick. It's deadly."", 'Game on. Pakistan bring back their quickest bowler Haris Rauf to do battle with Shreyas Iyer. Good move. Iyer has gotten better facing fast bowling but his strength is dismantling spin bowling. India did the same thing when Rizwan was at the crease and that worked a treat.', 'An on the up cover drive gets him there. His first boundary of the innings and Dubai is rocking.', ""He loves pace on the ball. And that makes him theatre. Lara, Sachin, Inzy, Viv. They all stared down fast bowlers. Their biggest nemesis were fast bowlers. And it was hair-raising watching them take them all down. And even now, with some of his powers waning, Kohli is good enough to never ever be rushed. Rauf is bowling 145 kph. But every moment is precise. Every connection is sweet. He's prowling out there on the outfield."", ""Against Abrar Ahmed's spin though, he is far more reluctant to come forward. Even when the ball is full. The shifting of his body weight is slower. There is more uncertainty in his mind. Spin is asking more questions than pace."", 'Meanwhile, Gill is asking the physio to come out and check his left knee. Uh-oh.', 'Haris Rauf comes on and creates chances straight away. He hits the deck and it comes on slower than Kohli expects, so his attempted back foot punch through cover point almost becomes a catch at deep third. Falls short of Naseem Shah. Next ball, his into the wicket tactics get Gill playing that old favourite short-arm jab. He nails it, but it he forgets to place it. Goes straight to short midwicket, where Khushdil Shah drops the catch. Australia took the catch in the 2023 ODI World Cup final.', ""Kohli came into this game with a question over his ability to deal with legspin. He's been dismissed by it five times in his last six games."", ""Pakistan's biggest threats are their fast bowlers so they've trusted that. It means Kohli gets to face pace right at the start of the innings and he likes pace. You want a batter like that being uncomfortable for the first 10 balls of his innings. That hasn't happened. You wonder if they could've thrown the ball to Abrar Ahmed for an exploratory over or two."", ""Shubman Gill has played some sumptuous shots, none better than a straight drive for four off Shaheen Afridi, and a lot of them seem to be a function of how conscious he is about where his front foot goes. He doesn't let it go too far forward. He especially doesn't let it go too far across."", ""Shaheen's biggest threat is the pitched up ball swinging in. If you set yourself up to bring a straight bat down, like Gill is, there can also be runs on offer when the ball doesn't swing. Good technique, though he does get beat by a corker - a ball that starts out swinging in, so he sets up to play a flick through midwicket, but changes its mind after pitching, going away to take the leading edge."", ""A scorcher. 143 kph inswinging yorker. That's Shaheen Afridi's signature stamped all over this game."", ""It almost felt like he'd decided to ditch the yorker after it didn't quite work in the earlier overs. There wasn't enough swing. So Shaheen shifted his length back. He event went slower ball. But that was smashed over the top for a one-handed four by Rohit, which triggered the fast bowler's temper and this is no ordinary fast bowler either. Shaheen's legs were pumping when he ran in. The stumps were splayed a mini-second after he let go. Nobody was getting bat to that. Least of all Rohit, who was not concentrating on defence."", ""India's captain falls. India's great hope arrives."", 'Virat Kohli 15 short of 14,000', ""Has Pakistan's pace unit lost its bite?"", ""Shaheen's speeds are up in this game. He's bowling 145 kph. And he's going yorker a lot. Three in his first over. Two in his second. But he's not getting enough swing. The last blockhole ball that he tried does not swing at all and ends up clattered through the covers by Gill."", 'Rohit goes past 9,000 runs as an opener in ODIs, the sixth player up on this pantheon, and he gets there with a trademark pick-up shot against fast bowling. Minimal effort. Maximum impact.', ""Gill: 'The way Rohit and I play in powerplay quite different'"", '""Rohit bhai likes to play more aerial shots, and tries to hit those big sixes. And I like to play along the ground, and I like to pierce those gaps. In between, if I see the bowler is under pressure, I like to go over the circle. I think that\'s the hallmark of us as a pair.""', 'Shubman Gill was in a very giving mood at the pre-match press conference.

Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf at their best can dictate terms anywhere in the world. But are they at their best right now? There's a bit of doubt over them."", 'A slow pitch means manipulating the balls into gaps will be harder. And there was swing for the Indian quicks earlier this afternoon with the new ball. Tense passage of play this.', ""Harshit Rana takes the final wicket. It's never easy to bowl at this phase of the innings. His senior partner getting smashed showed that. But Rana's slower balls seem to be harder to pick up. He isn't doing anything funny with them. They're offcutters. But they dip. They dip late and ruin the batter's timing. Rana and Kuldeep in the death: 6.4-0-28-4."", ""Excellent work from Hardik too, who kept banging away short of a length. Pakistan weren't ready to throw him off that length so he just kept at it and at it and got the wickets of Babar Azam and Saud Shakeel. Two-forty-one is a decent but they probably left a few runs out there."", ""Pakistan are getting up towards 250, which will be a very decent total to work with. Slower ball doesn't work first ball.

But they held back. Pakistan's captain barely attempted any attacking shot in his entire innings. It had people wondering - including the likes of Ian Bishop on commentary - about whether this team trusts its middle-order batters."", ""India used to have a similar problem. There was a time when Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan would go into every game knowing they have to put a huge price on their wicket and that would dictate the way they play, the risks they take. They've moved on from that fear now. Pakistan clearly haven't, and their fears came true.

This is the period in which they need to take advantage of the platform they've set and that's what Rizwan was trying to do. He didn't take any risks all through his innings.
