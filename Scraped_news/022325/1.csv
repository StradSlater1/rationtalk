Democrats were not briefed directly, that person said. The fact that the list was sent to lawmakers was first reported by NBC.', 'The list includes Gen. CQ Brown, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the sources said.

Because at least we have another first! The first female member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — hooray,” Hegseth wrote in his 2024 book, “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.”', 'A spokesperson for Franchetti declined to comment.', 'The list circulating on Capitol Hill also notes potential promotions and possible replacements for Brown, including Adm. Samuel Paparo, who currently leads US Indo Pacific command. Gen. Erik Kurilla, who currently leads US Central Command, is also a contender to replace Brown if he is fired, officials said.', 'The potential dismissals, which one of the sources said could also include several one-star and two-star generals, could add to the turmoil currently roiling the Pentagon as President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, seeks to make steep cuts to DoD’s budget and workforce.', 'Hegseth this week ordered the military to come up with ways to reduce the DoD’s budget by 8% each year for the next five years, and tens of thousands of civilian employees could be fired this week as part of a mass layoff of probationary workers.', 'Some defense officials responsible for drafting lists of civilian Pentagon employees to be terminated are raising concerns with their superiors that the summary firings could break the law and potentially harm US military readiness, CNN has reported.', 'A handful of employees from DOGE began meeting with Pentagon officials last week and are in the process of getting set up with office space inside the building, CNN has reported.', 'CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Samuel Paparo’s title.', 'This story has been updated with additional details.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

In fact, the four-star fighter pilot with 40 years of service was at the border tending to one of the president’s highest priorities when he was dismissed.', 'But privately, Trump advisers point to a video that Brown recorded in the furious days after Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, an act that sparked a social justice movement. In the four-minute video, Brown reflected on his experiences as an African American pilot in the Air Force.', 'The killing of Floyd also blew up the relationship between Trump and Brown’s predecessor, Gen. Mark Milley.', 'Days after Floyd’s death, Milley, wearing his Army fatigues, accompanied Trump in a walk across Lafayette Square near the White House for a photo op after an aggressive clearing of a peaceful demonstration. Milley was widely criticized for allowing Trump to drag him into politics.', 'Milley apologized publicly, saying, “I should not have been there.”', 'Trump was furious. “Why’d you do that?” he asked Milley, according to Trump officials at the time.', 'The two were already at odds over Trump’s desire to use the Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops to rein in the protesters, a move that Milley and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper had vehemently opposed.', 'Trump would never trust either man again.', 'The president would later fire Esper (by tweet). As for Milley, Trump would eventually suggest he should be put to death.', 'And after Trump returned to power, their portraits were removed from the walls of the Pentagon.', 'It is unclear whether Brown will get a portrait of his one year and four months as the Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump has not publicly criticized Brown, whom he is seeking to replace with retired three-star Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, another fighter pilot.', 'Pete Hegseth, Trump’s new defense secretary, previously questioned whether Brown was selected as the Joint Chiefs chairman because he was Black and said on a podcast in November that he should be fired over the military’s diversity efforts.', 'In his 2024 book “The War on Warriors,” Hegseth wrote of the general’s promotion, “Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt — which on its face seems unfair to C.Q. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter.”', 'Brown electrified the military rank and file June 4, 2020, when, as Pacific Air Forces commander, he released his four-minute video, which he called, simply, “What I’m thinking about.”', 'On the streets of some cities, Black Lives Matter protests were raging over the killing of Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and lay dying facedown.', 'Brown would later say in an interview that one of his two sons asked him, “What is Pacific Air Forces going to say?” As the commander of Pacific Air Forces, Brown said he knew that was code for “Dad, what are you going to say?”', 'Against a dark background, a solemn Brown, clad in fatigues, stared into the camera, and said this: “As the commander of Pacific Air Forces, and a senior leader in our Air Force, and an African American, many of you may be wondering what I’m thinking about the current events surrounding the tragic death of George Floyd.”', '“Here’s what I’m thinking about,” he continued.', 'For 4 1/2 minutes, Brown would speak, in stark terms, about his life as an African American fighter pilot.', '“I’m thinking about how full I am with, with emotion, not just for George Floyd, but the many African Americans that suffered the same fate as George Floyd,” he said, a slight tremor underlying his voice. “I’m thinking about protests in my country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, the equality expressed in our Declaration of Independence, in the Constitution, that I’ve sworn my adult life to support and defend.”', 'Brown spoke of “living in two worlds, both with their own perspectives and views.” He described what those worlds were like for him. He and his sister were the only Black children at his elementary school, he said, and they tried to fit in. In their high school, half of the students were Black, and they still tried to fit in.', '“I’m thinking about my Air Force career, where I was often the only African American in my squadron, or, as a senior officer, the only African American in the room,” he said.', 'At the time, about 43% of the 1.3 million men and women on active duty were people of color, but nearly all of the people making crucial decisions at the top were white and male. In a photo taken in October of the previous year, Trump was surrounded by his top four-star generals, a sea of white faces, a portrait of the top commanders who led an otherwise diverse institution.', 'In his video, Brown continued: “I’m thinking about wearing the same flight suit, with the same wings on my chest as my peers, and then being questioned by another military member, ‘Are you a pilot?’”', 'He limited his words to his own experience and reflected on the other world in which he lived, the Black one. “I’m thinking about being a captain at the O Club with my squadron, and being told by other African Americans that I wasn’t Black enough, since I was spending more time with my squadron than with them.”', 'He spoke of how most of his mentors could not relate to his experience as a Black man. He spoke of wondering whether airmen who have not had similar experiences “don’t see racism as a problem because it doesn’t happen to them, or whether they’re empathetic.”', 'Brown finished by talking about the weight he felt as the first African American nominated to be chief of the Air Force. Trump had nominated him for that position, on Esper’s recommendation.', 'Brown would go on to become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Joe Biden, in an 83-11 Senate vote. For the first time in its history, the Pentagon was led by two Black men, with Lloyd Austin, Biden’s defense secretary.', 'But in Trump’s eyes, one Trump adviser said Saturday, there was no coming back for Brown after he made his video.', 'After Trump took office Jan. 20, Brown insisted he would carry out the lawful orders of the president, in words similar to his predecessor, Milley.', 'He was fired anyway. So was Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead the Navy, and Gen. James Slife, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, who had urged airmen to think about institutional racism after Floyd’s death.', '“By their own words, the president and secretary of defense have signaled that these leaders served the country well and faithfully carried out the missions assigned to them by their political leaders,” said Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University who has studied the military for decades. “The abruptness of the action leaves so many questions hanging and unanswered.”', '', '', '', '']"

"With Pentagon purge, Trump thrusts military into uncharted territory",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/22/trump-pentagon-purge-charles-q-brown/,"['The abrupt removal of six top officers has deepened concern among the president’s critics, who fear he intends to impose his political will on the nonpartisan institution.', 'President Donald Trump’s Friday night purge of the Pentagon’s top officer and five other senior officials has thrust the institution into uncharted territory, with a retired general plucked from obscurity to serve as the commander in chief’s next senior military adviser and growing alarm among Trump’s critics about the encroachment of political warfare on an organization bound by the Constitution to remain nonpartisan.', 'The firings of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti had been anticipated for months, after Trump and his supporters frequently accused them and other officials of putting “woke” diversity policies over the military’s primal responsibility to fight and win wars.', 'Still, their abrupt ousters — and those of the Air Force’s vice chairman, Gen. James Slife, and the top military lawyers for the Army, Navy and Air Force — angered retired generals, lawmakers and experts on civil-military relations, even as they acknowledged that a president has the right to assemble a team of military leaders of his choosing and in whom he has total confidence.', 'Retired Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, a Joint Chiefs chairman under President Barack Obama, wrote online that such trust “should be based on their leadership, their integrity, their performance, the quality of their advice, and their willingness to faithfully execute the orders they are given.”', '“To relieve a senior officer not for a lack of one of these qualities, but for a real or perceived disagreement in their beliefs, harmfully politicizes the military profession,” Dempsey posted on LinkedIn.', 'Supporters of the president, including Vice President JD Vance, were quick to point out that other presidents have fired generals. In a social media post of his own, Vance responded to pointed criticism from Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Massachusetts) by observing that President Harry S. Truman ousted Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Obama fired Gen. Stanley McChrystal.', 'But such firings of generals are rare and typically follow public disagreements over policy or battlefield performance. In MacArthur’s case, Truman fired him in 1951 after the general repeatedly complained about the administration’s strategy during the Korean War. McChrystal was dismissed in 2010 as the top commander in Afghanistan after Rolling Stone magazine published an article in which the general’s staff members disparaged Obama and then-Vice President Joe Biden.', 'Additional firings are considered possible in coming days. While it was not disclosed Friday with the other dismissals, Hegseth also removed his senior military assistant, Air Force Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, according to one current and two former U.S. officials familiar with the issue. In that role, Short advised the defense secretary and managed relations with other government agencies. Her dismissal was first reported by NBC News, and John Ullyot, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not respond to questions about it.', 'Brown, whom Trump selected during his first term to run the Air Force, had kept a lower profile than many other Joint Chiefs chairman, assiduously seeking to avoid partisan politics. He had demonstrated no desire to upstage the president, and had shown himself willing to follow orders and carry out Trump’s priorities, including with border security.', 'As a four-star officer, Brown spoke infrequently about diversity and sought to emphasize merit and opportunity. In a 2021 Air Force recruiting video, he noted that a pilot’s race and gender are invisible under his or her helmet. “You just know I’m an American airman, kicking your butt,” he said.', 'Brown came to the top job with more than 3,100 cockpit hours and a record that included serving as deputy head of U.S. Central Command and commander of U.S. air forces in the Middle East during major counterinsurgency campaigns.', 'Despite his cautious approach, Brown’s future under Trump may have been marked by the general’s occasional remarks about his experiences as a Black man in America and in the military. In a video the military released in 2020 following the police killing on George Floyd, Brown addressed the challenges he faced as a Black officer in a military dominated by White officers. He later said he chose to do so after a conversation with his son.', 'Critics of the general also cited a 2022 memo, signed by Brown and civilian Air Force leaders appointed by then-President Biden, that laid out “aspirational” goals to ensure the service’s pool reflected the country’s racial and ethnic composition. His detractors called that discriminatory.', 'Franchetti, the first woman to lead the Navy, was targeted by Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, in a book the former Fox News personality published last year. He called her a “DEI hire,” short for diversity, equity and inclusion, though the admiral’s past experience included serving as the Navy’s No. 2 officer, leading thousands of sailors assigned to the Navy’s 6th Fleet in Europe and commanding an aircraft carrier strike group.', 'A defense official, speaking like some others on the condition of anonymity to discuss the situation, said that as speculation had grown in recent weeks that Franchetti could be fired, she was a “class act, prioritizing the institution of the Navy above all else.” She urged others to stay focused on their mission and “in her words: ‘Get s--- done,’” the official said.', 'Before their dismissals, both Brown and Franchetti had been scheduled to speak on Saturday at a defense technology conference in California’s Coachella Valley. They were informed of Trump’s decision in separate phone calls from Hegseth just before the administration announced publicly that they were being removed, said defense officials familiar with the issue.', 'Brown was in Texas at the time, having visited U.S. troops working on the southern border, and returned to Washington early Saturday. Franchetti was in California when she received the news, officials said. Administration officials had not disclosed a short-term plan following their ousters as of Saturday night.', 'Trump’s move to remove the chairman was immediately complicated by his chosen replacement: retired Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine, who departed the military in January after a career that included time as an F-16 fighter pilot in the National Guard, a Special Operations commander in Iraq and a senior military officer at the CIA. Caine did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Caine does not meet the typical qualifications for the position, which according to law says a president may appoint an officer to the chairmanship “only if” they have previously served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the top officer in one of the services or the commander of a major combatant command.', 'While the president can waive those requirements if he determines that such actions are “necessary in the national interest,” U.S. law says, the unorthodox selection of Caine underscores Trump’s proclivity for smashing norms, said several experts who study interactions between the military and the U.S. government’s civilian leaders. Among the officers whose names had been floated as potential contenders to replace Brown were Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and Army Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command.', '“It’s a head-scratcher on purpose,” said Katherine Kuzminski, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “The fact that they went outside the existing system sends a chilling effect to every currently serving four-star who meets the [legal] requirements to be considered for the chairmanship.”', 'Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that while Trump can choose who he wants, his decision to recall an officer to active duty “sends a signal to the senior ranks that you don’t trust them.”', 'Trump’s comments about Caine already have cast the retired general in a partisan light. On several occasions, the president has regaled audiences with a story about meeting Caine during a visit to Iraq in 2018, as U.S. troops were carrying out a military campaign against the Islamic State group. Caine, Trump claimed, donned a “Make America Great Again” hat and pledged he would kill for the president — statements that would have violated the military’s prohibition on political activity while in uniform.', 'Others have questioned whether it’s true. John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser at the time of the president’s meeting with Caine, said in an interview Saturday that he never heard Caine say anything along those lines.', '“That is standard Trump — just making things up,” Bolton said.', 'The Washington Post has been unable to authenticate Trump’s account.', 'Caine, who was a one-star general during Trump’s visit to Iraq, and other military officials provided Trump with a presentation about the mission there and in neighboring Syria and sought to convince him of the importance of allowing the operation to continue, Bolton said. They came across “very professional, very dedicated to their mission, determined to succeed and try to do the best they could to brief a president like Donald Trump.”', 'Bolton said he was with Trump nearly the entire time they were in Iraq and was with Caine and a higher-ranking officer, then-Lt. Gen. Paul LaCamera, during the moments he was not with the president.', '“I never saw Caine or LaCamera or anybody else in uniform there with a MAGA hat on,” Bolton said. “I never heard Caine say the things that Trump said, like ‘I will kill for you, sir.’”', 'Caine has been active on social media for years. A review of his accounts showed nothing overtly partisan, with him instead focusing on leadership lessons and remembering U.S. troops killed in combat.', 'Others who have served with Caine described him as humble and eager to serve the country. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Joseph “Gus” Guastella Jr. said in an interview that he was one of Caine’s instructors at the Air Force’s Weapons School in the late 1990s, describing him as intense, serious and “one of the hardest working students I ever saw.”', 'Later, Guastella commanded U.S. Air Forces Central when Caine was helping to oversee Special Operations missions in Iraq and Syria. Caine’s unusual career trajectory was an asset because, unlike most Air Force fighter pilots, he had spent years in the Special Operations world where he oversaw missions that intertwined ground, air and sea operations. That kind of coordinated power, Guastella said, ultimately helped defeat the ISIS militant group.', '“He was one of those guys who said ‘Send me wherever; send me on any deployment. I’ll take any deployment to fight our nations’ wars,’” Guastella said.', 'As a recently retired officer, Caine had moved into venture capitalism, meaning he will probably have finances to disentangle before becoming chairman that are more typical for a civilian political appointee. Among recent affiliations are work with Shield Capital, a company focused on cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, and Thrive Capital, a group that invests in software companies.', 'In a recent interview, Caine recounted his military experience and encouraged others to serve.', '“While flying airplanes in the military, at least, is epically cool, it’s about something deeper,” Caine said on the Afterburn Podcast. “It’s about serving our country. It’s about being willing to protect and defend this nation and to work alongside incredible professionals who are equally willing to go to the mat in defense of our nation.”', 'Natalie Allison contributed to this report.', '']"

He has long flown under the radar given the highly classified nature of his work — and he preferred it that way, the officials said.', '“There is a little bit of a narrative out there that he was picked because he’s a partisan guy,” a military official who served with Caine and has known him for over a decade told CNN. “In my personal experience and professional experience, I’ve never seen any indication that, and knowing him, he’s never been partial to any political party or mentioned anything about politics in our time together.”', 'Caine, who retired in December as a three-star lieutenant general, was thrust into the center of a political firestorm when Trump abruptly announced Friday that he would replace Gen. Charles Q. Brown, who had served as Joint Chiefs chairman since October 2023.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTrump administration fires top US general and Navy chief in unprecedented purge of military leadership', 'It’s rare for a retired general to be recalled to active service, but it has happened before.

Past chairmen have received their fourth star by first leading a combatant command or serving as a service chief before becoming the US’ top general and principal military adviser to the president.', 'But Caine has been in unexpected positions before. On the morning of 9/11, he was serving at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, DC. Though he wasn’t initially scheduled to fly that day, he ultimately became the mission commander over the capital, armed with air-to-air missiles on alert for threats to the nation, he recalled in an interview with “The Afterburn Podcast” several weeks ago.', '“It’s about being willing to protect and defend this nation and to work alongside incredible professionals who are equally willing to go to the mat in defense of our nation,” Caine said.', 'Trump has raved about Caine for years after the two met in Iraq during the president’s first term. At the time, Caine was serving as the deputy commander of US Central Command’s Special Operations Component and deputy commander of Special Operations Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq.', 'In remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019, the president described Caine as being out of “central casting” and recalled that Caine told him when they met in Iraq that the US could have the campaign against ISIS “totally finished in one week.”', '“I said, ‘Why didn’t my other generals tell me that? Why didn’t they tell me that?’” Trump said in 2019. In a post on Truth Social on Friday night, Trump called Caine a “warfighter” who was “instrumental in the complete annihilation of the ISIS caliphate.”', 'Trump has also claimed Caine said he “loved” Trump and would “kill for you” while donning a “Make America Great Again” hat.', 'But the military official who served with Caine said Saturday that Caine “doesn’t have a MAGA hat; he’s never put one on.”', 'The official added that Caine, prior to accepting the chairmanship, wanted to make sure Brown was “respectfully and personally taken care of.”', '“Everything I’ve known of Gen. Caine over the last decade has been marked by character, integrity and humility,” the military official said. “I’ve never seen him not do the right thing. Always making judgments about the mission. Never been a guy who cowers from difficult conversations or hard calls on the battlefield.”', 'Caine, an F-16 pilot who has flown more than 150 combat hours, commissioned in October 1990 through the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program at the Virginia Military Institute, according to his official biography. His father was also a fighter pilot, and Caine referred to it as “the family business” in his interview with “The Afterburn.”', 'He had an unusual career trajectory, rising from a fighter pilot in the Air National Guard to the senior levels of Joint Special Operations Command. Caine joined a venture capital firm called Shield Capital after he retired in December and was a “serial entrepreneur and investor” from 2009 to 2016 while serving part time in the National Guard, according to his official Air Force biography.', 'Among his military awards and decorations are the Distinguished Flying Cross, which is awarded for heroism while in flight, the Defense Superior Service Medal, and a Bronze Star with bronze oak leaf cluster.', 'Caine acknowledged his unusual career path in the podcast interview, and said he entered the Special Operations Forces community after deploying with them many times over the years.', '“What got me into the SOF community was relationships and deploying together,” he said. “It really is all about relationships.” In the interview, Caine recalled his experience with SOF really began when he helped with the air operations planning to hunt Iraqi Scud missiles during Operation Iraqi Freedom.', 'He said he learned early in his career to be “humble, credible and approachable.”', '“I was unable to, and never really would, drink my own Kool-Aid,” Caine said.', 'In the podcast’s video portion, Caine can be wearing several bracelets in memory of the fallen from past wars and those he’s served with — a black one that is an interagency remembrance bracelet; a blue one to recognize the 121 fallen from Air America, the CIA’s covert airline operated during Vietnam; and a green one in memory of the more than 60 service members he served with or who served under him who were killed in combat, the military official told CNN.', 'While usually self-effacing, Caine was “super aggressive” in the cockpit as a pilot, pushing the aircraft to its limits and generally “a bit of a wild man” while flying, the military official said. That earned him the call sign “Razin” from his squadron commander at the time — a play on his last name and the phrase “raising Cain,” which is used to describe someone who is being rowdy or disruptive.', 'Beginning in 2021, toward the end of Caine’s career, he served as the associate director for military affairs at the Central Intelligence Agency — the agency’s primary liaison to the Defense Department. Prior to that, he helped oversee some of the Defense Department’s most sensitive intelligence and operations at the Pentagon.', 'In stark contrast to Trump, who has long harbored a deep distrust of the intelligence community, Caine has described working at the CIA from 2021 to 2024 as one of the great honors of his career.', '“I have no idea how I got picked, but boy am I grateful that I did,” Caine told “The Afterburn,” calling the agency “a very special place.”', '“Working at CIA is a bit like Fight Club: You don’t talk about Fight Club,” he said. “But there are world-class professionals over there, every single day, getting after it in ways that we can’t even imagine. And the honor and privilege of serving with each of them is very near and dear to me. I woke up every day while working in this job to figure out how I was going to earn the privilege of serving there.”', 'Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former head of US Central Command, told CNN he worked “a number of highly sensitive operations” with Caine when Caine was at the CIA.', '“I found him to be exceptionally talented, very professional and a good officer in every way,” McKenzie said Saturday, adding that Caine is outgoing and gregarious with “a strong moral center.”', 'Caine has not mentioned politics in any of the few public comments he has made over the years. But in the podcast interview, he touted the need to reform the Pentagon’s acquisition process — something Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has also called a priority in recent years.', '“Our ability as a warfighting nation to pivot at speed, to stay ahead of these emerging technologies, is going to be really important in the future,” Caine said. “There’s a whole bunch of things that we need to do better as a joint force and as a Department of Defense along the lines of acquisition reform so that we can make sure that those young (privates first class) and E-1s and E-2s and (noncommissioned officers) have the kit and capability that they need.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

"Who is Dan ‘Razin’ Caine, Trump’s pick to be the next Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman?",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/who-is-dan-razin-caine-trumps-pick-to-be-the-next-joint-chiefs-of-staff-chairman,"['', '', 'Tara Copp, Associated Press', 'Leave your feedback', 'WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s choice to be the top U.S. military officer, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, endeared himself to the commander in chief through his military call sign, “Razin,” during a meeting in Iraq years ago. Officials who have served with Caine described him Saturday as measured and apolitical.', 'Trump said Friday night that Caine was his pick as the next Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, making the announcement in the same social media post in which he fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who had held that job for 16 months after a career as a history-making fighter pilot.', 'Brown’s ouster — followed soon by that of other military leaders — came as Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are pushing out officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The new Republican administration says it is focused on a lethal fighting force.', 'WATCH: Retired military leaders weigh in on Trump ordering Pentagon to cut DEI programs', 'Caine retired in December. It was not immediately clear what it would take to recall him to active-duty service so he could go through Senate confirmation.', 'Caine does not meet the position’s prerequisites, such as being a combatant commander or service chief, as laid out in a 1986 law that does allow a president to waive those requirements.', '“I know he’s nontraditional, but that’s kind of what this administration looks for,” said Chris Miller, who served as Trump’s last acting secretary of defense in his first term.', 'Caine “definitely knows how the Pentagon works,” Miller told The Associated Press. Caine has experience, too, in the National Guard and has worked in the private sector.', '“He’s spent time as a citizen-soldier. The guy’s been out, done other things. He brings a perspective that is not traditional for a chairman, which I think will be a breath of fresh air,” Miller said.', 'Trump’s relationship with Caine dates to his first administration. They met during a trip to Iraq, as Trump recounted during a 2019 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, where he spoke again on Saturday.', 'Trump said he asked Caine why it would take two more years to end the fight against the Islamic State group. Caine told him it could be as little as a week, if he did it his way.', ""“’We’re only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria,'” Trump said Caine told him. ‘”But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over — from the base that you’re right on, right now, sir. They won’t know what the hell hit them.’”"", 'A question after Brown’s firing was whether Trump was seeking a loyalist as chairman of the Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump praised Caine — and condemned the current military leadership — at an unrelated appearance in Miami this past week.', '“General ‘Razin’ Caine was — he’s some general. He’s a real general, not a television general,” Trump said Wednesday, two days before his Truth Social post.', '“We have the greatest military in the world, but we don’t have the greatest top, top leadership. That’s why Afghanistan was such a horrible situation and so embarrassing and so many other things,” Trump added. “But when we want to, with proper leadership, there’s nobody even close to us.”', 'WATCH: The potential consequences of Trump’s unprecedented Pentagon shakeup', 'Trump has previously suggested that Caine is a political supporter. In a CPAC speech last year, Trump recalled meeting Caine in 2018 in Iraq when he was visiting troops.', '“He said, ‘I’ll kill for you sir,” Trump said. “Then he puts on a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.”', 'But Caine has been steadfastly apolitical, a military officer who had served with him and remains close to him said Saturday.', '“Gen. Caine doesn’t have a MAGA hat. He’s never put one on,” said the official, who was not authorized to talk to the media on the record and spoke on condition of anonymity.', 'Miller, the former acting defense secretary, served at the Pentagon when Caine led the military’s Special Access Program Central Office, which oversees what classified information on weapons programs is shared with foreign governments.', 'That position “is one of the most difficult places to work in the whole department because of all of the congressional interest. You have to be really, really adept to handle all of the constituencies,” Miller said.', 'Caine, like Brown, flew F-16 fighter jets. Last month, Caine completed an assignment for the CIA, and during an in-depth Jan. 27 episode of “The Afterburn Podcast” spoke at length about his life and career.', '“I grew up as the son of a fighter pilot. This was our family business,” he said. Both he and his father, who started his military career flying F-4 Phantoms, ultimately flew the F-16.', 'In the podcast, Caine had a message for young people looking to serve, or those already flying: “Cherish it,” Caine said.', '“And remember that while flying airplanes in the military at least is epically cool, it’s about something deeper,” he said. “It’s about serving our country. It’s about being willing to protect and defend this nation.”', 'AP National Political Writer Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report.', 'Left: Former U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen.

The JAGs embody the deep respect that the United States military has had for the rule of law. Although they merely advise and do not command, their role is a crucial one. The decapitation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Navy, and the firing of the second-most-senior Air Force officer was bad enough.', 'The replacement of General C. Q. Brown, a highly decorated and cerebral officer, as chairman by a retired lieutenant general was bizarre and unprecedented. By law the role of chair should be filled, unless the president deems an extraordinary exception necessary, by a four star who has led a service or a combatant command. Lieutenant General Dan Caine was relatively junior, and he spent 2009 to 2016 as a reservist. The skills he acquired as a special operator, moreover, are the antithesis of what the most senior military officer in the country needs. The United States armed forces, composed of millions of men and women on active and reserve duty, operates fleets and divisions and air wings. Its leaders need the ability to handle military movements and the political skills to deal with coalition partners in large-scale operations, skills that are acquired on the conventional side of the house, not in shadow warfare.', 'More Stories', 'Incompetence Leavened With Malignity', 'Listen Closely to What Hegseth Is Saying', '']"
