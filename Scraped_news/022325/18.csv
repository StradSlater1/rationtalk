Canon 412 says a diocese can be declared “impeded” if its bishop — due to “captivity, banishment, exile, or incapacity” — cannot fulfil his pastoral functions. In such cases, the day-to-day running of the diocese shifts to an auxiliary bishop, a vicar general or someone else.', 'Even though Francis is the bishop of Rome, no explicit provision exists for the pope if he similarly becomes “impeded.” Canon 335 declares simply that when the Holy See is “vacant or entirely impeded,” nothing can be altered in the governance of the church. But it doesn’t say what it means for the Holy See to be “entirely impeded” or what provisions might come into play if it ever were.', 'In 2021, a team of canon lawyers set out to propose norms to fill that legislative gap. They created a canonical crowd-sourcing initiative to craft a new church law regulating the office of a retired pope as well as norms to apply when a pope is unable to govern, either temporarily or permanently.', 'The proposed norms explain that, with medical advancements, it’s entirely likely that at some point a pope will be alive but unable to govern. It argues that the church must provide for the declaration of a “totally impeded see” and the transfer of power for the sake of its own unity.', 'Under the proposed norms, the governance of the universal church would pass to the College of Cardinals. In the case of a temporary impediment, they would name a commission to govern, with periodical medical checks every six months to determine the status of the pope.', ""Francis confirmed in 2022 that shortly after he was elected pope he wrote a letter of resignation, to be invoked if he became medically incapacitated.

The letter was never invoked, since Paul lived another 13 years and died on the job.', 'The only time papal power changes hands is when a pope dies or resigns.

He certifies the pope’s death, seals the papal apartments and prepares for the pope’s burial before a conclave to elect a new pope. The position is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the head of the Vatican’s laity office.', 'The camerlengo has no role or duties if the pope is merely sick or otherwise incapacitated.', 'Likewise, the dean of the College of Cardinals, who would preside at a papal funeral and organize the conclave, has no additional role if the pope is merely sick.

Three voting Cardinals died during the process.', 'The ballot itself is secret and was introduced on 1621 by Gregory XV to try and avoid overt politicking but the Conclave is inevitably a hotbed of competing factions who wish to see their man come out on top.

By Saturday, the head of the Church had spent seven nights in hospital being treated for bronchitis and bilateral pneumonia. Although his medical team said he was not at risk of death they admitted that Francis was a “fragile patient” after his “prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis”.', '“I hear the Holy Father has been doing some work so maybe he is getting better. This is good news and I am praying for him,” said the cardinal, who didn’t give his name. On Friday morning the Vatican said the Pope had breakfast sitting in an armchair. The previous day, the Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said that Francis was “alert and responsive” and had “joked around as always”. The senior cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi told the Italian media that the Pope’s situation “remains complex, but not critical”.', 'Whether or not Pope Francis survives this latest bout of ill health, recent events have focused the minds of the curia in the College of Cardinals. The task falls to them to pick the next pontiff should the current one die or retire like his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who in 2013 became the first to resign the papacy in 600 years. This is a possibility Francis is said to be open to. “There is no question that if he was in a situation where his ability to have direct contact [with the public] was compromised, then I think he might decide to resign,” Ravasi said.', 'In last year’s Oscar-nominated film Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes as the mild-mannered Cardinal Lawrence, plots within plots involve several top contenders for the Chair of St Peter being knocked out of the race as political machinations overtake them. Just as depicted on screen, hushed meetings have already begun taking place behind closed doors and in the corridors of Europe’s last absolute monarchy as the most senior power brokers in the Catholic church set about securing a palatable successor to the liberal Pope Francis.', '“Not only do I think the political conversations have begun, I think they’ve been going on for quite some time,” said John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news website Crux and author of Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election. “We know for a fact that in the mid-1990s, a group of cardinals organised and had regular meetings to try to ensure a liberal successor to John Paul II.”', 'Dubbed the St Gallen Mafia, a group of senior figures of the Catholic Church gathered annually from 1996 in St Gallen, Switzerland. They met with the express purpose of picking the next pope. When the opportunity arose in 2005 the cardinals voted for the Argentinian Jorge Mario Bergoglio, but were unsuccessful after Joseph Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI. After Benedict retired in 2013, the remaining members of the group finally got their way and Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, was chosen.', '“I think if you wait for the Pope to get sick to start having these conversations, it’s way too late,” said Allen, who said that this time around it is the traditionalist cardinals who are plotting. “I couldn’t give you names of the conservatives who are meeting this time and having these conversations, but I guarantee you they’re out there and I guarantee you these conversations have been going on for a while. I know of at least one cardinal who was leading some of those conversations, but he has since died.”', 'Although overt campaigning to become the next pope is considered an excommunicable offence, some cardinals have taken to public auditions for the papacy in the absence of a formal lobbying campaign. Edward Pentin, senior contributor for the National Catholic Register and author of The Next Pope, said that Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, a 69-year-old Italian seen as a spiritual successor to Francis, recently gave mass at the Pantheon in Rome. “He said mass at a service for traditional Catholics and people read it as him trying to curry favour with the traditionalists in order to win votes from that side of the church.”', 'One church insider pointed out that the American cardinal Sean O’Malley, a one-time contender for the papacy in 2013, pulled a similar stunt two years ago. “He preached a long homily in beautiful Italian at the Pantheon, which was effectively showing off that he was suitable to be pope,” they said.', 'To understand how the politics of the Vatican works, a former senior official equated it to being in a Renaissance court. “There are a lot of little factions within that court but everybody affects to like what the prince, the Pope, likes and everybody dislikes what the prince dislikes. That means everyone works in a silo and there is an awful lot of empire building going on.”', 'They added that political jockeying can often devolve into underhanded tactics. “Most cardinals have some kind of a sin, whether it’s money, a boyfriend or a love child. Everyone knows which cardinals have works of art that they can’t afford or who visits the gay saunas. If for whatever reason someone needs to be removed from contention then that information is deployed by a rival faction.”', 'In 2023, the Italian cardinal Angelo Becciu was convicted of embezzlement, fraud and abuse of office relating to a London property deal, for which he was sentenced to five and a half years in jail. Becciu denies the charges and has maintained that he is the victim of a conspiracy by rivals within the church. “Of course Becciu forced out his share of rivals as well,” said the former Vatican official.', 'When the time does eventually arise to elect a new pope, they will be chosen in a secret vote bythe College of Cardinals, a club whose members are handpicked by successive popes in return for loyalty, political favours or unquestionable religiosity. However, as part of a modernising agenda in 1976, Pope Paul VI banned any of its number aged 80 and above from voting in the conclave. This means that of the 252 current cardinals, 138 have voting privileges.', 'Angelo Acerbi, from Italy, is the oldest cardinal ever appointed in the history of the church. Born in 1925, he was 99 years and 75 days at the time of his ascension in December last year and as a career Vatican diplomat he was once held hostage for six weeks in Colombia by leftist guerrillas. Although he cannot vote, meaning his practical influence is limited, the weight of his experience will be valuable when the time comes to pick the next pontiff.', 'Whom the College will pick could boil down to a divide between the liberals and traditionalists who disagree on issues including women priests, same sex-marriage and support for the old Latin mass. “The lines between factions are nebulous,” Pentin explained. “But you can get a clearest sense of where a cardinal stands by judging whether they are in continuity with Francis or not.”', 'The College of Cardinals Report is an interactive website developed by Pentin and a team of researchers and journalists. It lists 22 serious contenders for the job, called the papabili. Among them are Pietro Parolin, 70, the current Vatican secretary of state, and Robert Sarah, 79, a Guinean and a favourite of the traditionalist faction of the Church.', 'But while the cliques within the college attempt to puppeteer their preferred successor, the incumbent has one significant advantage. Of the 138 voting cardinals, 110 were created by Francis, or about 80 per cent, many from Latin America and countries previously underrepresented in Rome. “I think he has appointed far more than Benedict had when he left office,” said Pentin.', 'In 2005, in the weeks before the death of John Paul II, crowds gathered in their hundreds outside Gemelli hospital in Rome, lining the roads near his window to get a glimpse of their religious leader. In contrast, outside the hospital on Friday morning the scene was one of barely registered apathy.', '“I was just here to see my father who is in the hospital,” said Lucia Rinaldi, 34, standing next to a statue of John Paul II outside the main entrance. “Of course I hope the pope gets better but I am not sure if people are so obsessed with the church these days.”', 'The cardinal making his way to St Peter’s Basilica on Friday morning also seemed to have no time for the political jockeying of his colleagues. Asked if he would like to become pope himself, he simply smiled and waved his hand dismissively before adding: “God will pick the next pope.”', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.

The 88-year-old needed supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions and was described as having “prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis.” However, he’s not intubated and was described as having a “tranquil” night and was said to still be joking with his fellow Cardinals. So it’s up and down right now. ', 'Now I would never wish ill upon Il Papa, and I don’t want to jump the gun here. But word is the Swiss Guard have already been practicing for his funeral. So if that’s the case I think it’s only fair we start to discuss my favorite international phenomenon - CONCLAVE.', '', 'When roughly 138 cardinals lock themselves in the Vatican and argue and vote until we see that puff of white smoke, you know your boy KFC will be on the scene. I’m a little upset at the thought of this all happening right after the success of the movie, Conclave. Almost like when your favorite band goes pop and all the Johnny come latelies hop on the Conclave bandwagon. But this is real life, not some movie with a VERY stupid ending, I might add. So let’s get down to business and talk shop on who are the odds on favorites to be elected pope of Francis does in fact take his seat next to the Father.', '', 'Pietro Parolin', 'Currently Pietro Parolin, the sec of State at the Vatican, is the odds on favorite to get the necessary 77 votes. He’s Italian. He’s currently the second highest at the Vatican. He is sent all over the world to deal with foreign relations and dictators. In that regard this seems like the chalk pick. HOWEVER, oddly enough there has not been a Vatican Secretary of State elected in Conclave since Pope Pius XII in 1939. So that’s something to consider. ', 'Luis Antonio Tagle', 'Luis Antonio Tagle is a Filipino widely considered an extension of Pope Francis. Very liberal. If people want to keep letting gays run amuck and let dogs into heaven and shit like that, LAT is the choice. The old phrase is “Seguite sempre un papa grasso con sottile” - always follow a fat pope with a skinny one. Meaning the next pope should be a departure from the last one. The pendulum swings back. I don’t think that really holds true because the Papacy has just been getting more progressive. If that holds true, the Filipino is in good shape. If the cardinals are sick of this liberal pussy shit and want to go back to hellfire and brimstone in Latin, he’s fucked. ', '', 'Peter Turkson', '', '', 'I’m obsessed with Peter Turkson because I desperately want to see #BlackPope. He’s a Ghanaian. He was heavily in the mix last Conclave and I so so badly wanted to write a headline like “White Smoke, Black Pope” but alas, it wasn’t in the cards. He’s still of age this go round and would obviously get heavy support from the African delegate.', 'Ambongo Besungu', '', '', '', 'Surprisingly not mentioned here is Ambongo Besungu, from the democratic republic of the Congo. I believe he’s a strong contender too and obviously would fulfill the first #BlackPope. He’s a conservative who openly criticized Pope Francis. ', 'Peter Erdo', '', '', '', 'Speaking of conservatives, Peter Erdo is the most conservative of this betting bunch. He hates all the gay stuff and divorce stuff that Pope Francis lets fly. He’s Hungarian, and he was the President of the conference of the Bishops council of Europe, where he was known for being the bridge between Europe and Africa. If you can land the European vote and the African vote, that’s enough to get the 77 votes for 2/3 majority. So that gives him strong chances. ', 'Angelo Scola', '', '', '', 'Angelo Scola is a “always the bridesmaid, never the bride” type candidate. He was the odds on favorite in last Conclave. When the white smoke appeared last conclave, he received many emails of congratulations from other bishops, only for them to find out he didn’t actually win. The phrase in these situations when a favorite loses is “he walked into Conclave the Pope, and walked out a cardinal.” He lost as a #1 seed, basically.  ', 'Not listed is probably the only shot we have to get an American Pope. Cardinal Leo Burke, the Arch-conservative from St. Louis. Another open critic of Francis who wants to return to stricter doctrine.', 'Timothy Dolan from New York would have been long shot as a viable candidate had this happened earlier. As he turned 75 he had to turn in his resignation to the Holy See. The Canadian Mark Oulette was a contender last Conclave, but now at the age of 80 not only is he not a contender but can’t even participate in the vote.Of course there’s always a chance for some upset, but those are the contenders. This ain’t Hollywood where they are gonna elect some hermaphrodite, ok? This is still the Catholic Church. Maybe they let you use condoms and masturbate without going to Hell these days but it’s still the Catholic Church. My money is on the Italian.

It was reported by the Vatican last week that the 88-year-old had developed pneumonia in both lungs over the weekend and will remain hospitalized while he fights the infection.', 'But should the leader of the Catholic Church pass away, it would mean that the members of the church would be forced to hold an election in order to select who would don the papal tiara. While technically speaking, any man of the Roman Catholic faith could be elected to the top position, the successor will likely be one of the 253 cardinals from around the world.', 'It is a tradition that after a pope either resigns or passes away a conclave is convened in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel where all 253 cardinals take part in several rounds of voting to determine the next head of the Church. However, there are a few rules involved.', 'One such rule is that only 138 of the 253 cardinals will be able to serve as electors in the next conclave. The second rule states that no cardinals over the age of 80 can participate in voting.', 'Reports indicate that Pope Francis raised the number of electors last year from 120. The rule was instituted by Paul VI during his reign from June 1963 to August 1978.', 'With that, here are the several current front runners who might be taking over from the current pope:', ""Currently acting as the Vatican's Secretary of State, Parolin reportedly served in Pope Francis’ Vatican for 11 years and is currently in the lead to take over from his former boss."", 'Politically, the man is reportedly very moderate and has spent his career participating in the diplomatic wing of the Holy See, spending parts of his career in the Nunciature of Nigeria and Mexico.', ""The man was made a Cardinal by Francis in 2014. Should he be voted into office, he would be considered an extension of Francis' dynasty."", 'Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, who currently occupies the position of President of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, reportedly made headlines in the church when he declined a controversial declaration of Pope Francis.', 'The man, who leans toward the more conservative side of the political spectrum, also made waves when he boldly declared that Fiducia supplicans doctrine — which stated priests were allowed to bless unmarried and same-sex couples — was null and void in Africa. It was reported by the Catholic Herald that Besungu allegedly was able to achieve explicit blessing from Pope Francis in an emergency meeting in 2023 shortly after the release of the proclamation.', 'If the man is elected to the top position, a Besungu reign may be seen as a rebuke of the left-leaning principles of Pope Francis, who made Besungu a cardinal in 2019.', 'The Netherlands delegate to the conclave is Cardinal Wim Eijk, who is a former medical doctor and one of the most conservative choices of all the current front-runners. Eijk reportedly helped pen Eleven Cardinals Speak on Marriage and the Family: Essays from a Pastoral Viewpoint in 2015 which slammed Francis’ endorsement of civil remarriages.', 'In the text, Eijk wrote, ""they are “a form of structured and institutionalized adultery.” The man has also been a long-time critic of the current pope\'s inability to combat a German Bishops’ Conference proposal that allowed Protestants to receive the Eucharist in Catholic churches.', 'In an editorial, Eijk, who was made cardinal in 2012, called the pope’s ruling on the matter “completely incomprehensible.”', 'The Hungarian frontrunner Peter Erdo has reportedly been a figure of consequence in the politics of the contemporary church. The former president of the Council of Bishops Conferences of Europe and a devout Marian, have emphatically opposed the practice of divorced or remarried Catholics receiving Holy Communion due to the doctrinal belief in the insolubility of marriage.', 'Erdo, who was appointed Cardinal in 2013 by John Paul II, has also been vocal about his opposition to European countries accepting refugees, claiming that it is tantamount to human trafficking.', 'Serving as the pro-prefect for the Section of First Evangelization of the Dicastery for Evangelization and as president of the Interdicasterial Commission for Consecrated Religious, Luis Antonio Tagle has reportedly been dubbed the “Asian Pope Francis.”', ""It was reported that Tagle and his left-leaning policies have long been critical of the Church's treatment of LGBT people and divorced and remarried Catholics. Tagle stated in a 2015 interview, that the Church’s “severe” stance on gay people, divorcees and single mothers has done harm to its goal of evangelizing."", 'After being made a cardinal in 2012 by Pope Benedict XVI, the man is just the seventh Filipino to be made a cardinal and would be the first pope to come from the Asian continent if elected.', 'Hailing from the US, Raymond Burke is considered the leading arch-conservative in the church and has been a vocal critic of Francis and his liberal leanings. Burke, a proponent of the Latin Mass, hails from Wisconsin and former archbishop of St. Louis has, in the past, challenged Francis’ willingness to allow divorced and remarried couples to receive the Eucharist.', 'Burke has also allegedly challenged the Church’s new stance around artificial contraception, gay people and civil marriages as “objectionable.”', 'The current Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops might also be up for a promotion should the current leader of the church pass away. The politically moderate Mario Grech is also considered to be a front-runner to succeed Pope Francis.', 'Reports indicate the Grech has previously spoken of the necessity to reach out to those who are ostracized from the Church due to their sexuality or marital status. The man delivered a speech in 2014 at the Extraordinary General Assembly where he allegedly highlighted the Church’s need to maintain continuity of teaching while allowing for creativity in the methodology of speaking to the people.', 'Grech was appointed to Cardinalhood by Francis in 2020.', ""Last, but certainly not least is Italy's own Matteo Zuppi who was appointed by Pope Francis in 2019.

And there are no specific norms outlining what happens to the leadership of the Catholic Church if a pope becomes totally incapacitated.', 'As a result, even though Pope Francis remains hospitalized in critical condition with a complex lung infection, he is still pope and very much in charge.', '', ""Still, Francis' hospital stay is raising obvious questions about what happens if he loses consciousness for a prolonged period, or whether he might follow in Pope Benedict XVI's footsteps and resign if he becomes unable to lead. On Monday, Francis' hospital stay will hit the 10-day mark, equaling the length of his 2021 hospital stay for surgery to remove 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon."", ""His age and prolonged illness has revived interest about how papal power is exercised in the Holy See, how it is transferred and under what circumstances. And it points to the legislative loophole that currently exists in what to do if a pope gets so sick that he can't govern."", 'Francis may be in charge, but he already delegates the day-to-day running of the Vatican and church to a team of officials who operate whether he is in the Apostolic Palace or not, and whether he is conscious or not.', ""Chief among them is the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Other Vatican functions are proceeding normally, including the Vatican's 2025 Holy Year celebrations."", 'Canon law does have provisions for when a bishop gets sick and can’t run his diocese, but none for a pope. Canon 412 says a diocese can be declared “impeded” if its bishop — due to “captivity, banishment, exile, or incapacity” — cannot fulfil his pastoral functions. In such cases, the day-to-day running of the diocese shifts to an auxiliary bishop, a vicar general or someone else.', 'Even though Francis is the bishop of Rome, no explicit provision exists for the pope if he similarly becomes “impeded.” Canon 335 declares simply that when the Holy See is “vacant or entirely impeded,” nothing can be altered in the governance of the church. But it doesn’t say what it means for the Holy See to be “entirely impeded” or what provisions might come into play if it ever were.', 'In 2021, a team of canon lawyers set out to propose norms to fill that legislative gap. They created a canonical crowd-sourcing initiative to craft a new church law regulating the office of a retired pope as well as norms to apply when a pope is unable to govern, either temporarily or permanently.', 'The proposed norms explain that, with medical advancements, it’s entirely likely that at some point a pope will be alive but unable to govern. It argues that the church must provide for the declaration of a “totally impeded see” and the transfer of power for the sake of its own unity.', 'Under the proposed norms, the governance of the universal church would pass to the College of Cardinals. In the case of a temporary impediment, they would name a commission to govern, with periodical medical checks every six months to determine the status of the pope.', '“At first, the promoting group was accused of imprudently choosing topics that were too sensitive and controversial,” said one of the coordinators, canon lawyer Geraldina Boni.', 'But then, ""a widespread consensus formed,"" she told The Associated Press. Even Francis\' own canon lawyer, Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda, acknowledged some sort of norms were necessary if the pope “incurably, then irreversibly, lost consciousness or otherwise the ability to perform human acts.”', '“The problem is, who declares that the pope is in a situation where he cannot govern?” he told Italian daily Il Giornale in 2022.', ""Ghirlanda largely backed the crowd-sourcing initiative's idea, proposing a committee of medical experts to determine if the pope's condition is irreversible. If they confirm it is, the Rome-based cardinals would be summoned to declare the pope cannot govern, triggering a conclave."", '', ""Francis confirmed in 2022 that shortly after he was elected pope he wrote a letter of resignation, to be invoked if he became medically incapacitated. He said he gave it to the then-secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, and said he assumed Bertone had delivered it to Parolin's office when he retired."", 'The text is not public, and the conditions Francis contemplated for a resignation are unknown. It is also not known if such a letter would be canonically valid. Canon law requires a papal resignation to be “freely and properly manifested” — as was the case when Benedict announced his resignation in 2013.', 'In 1965, Pope Paul VI wrote letters to the dean of the College of Cardinals hypothesizing that if he were to become seriously ill, the dean and other cardinals should accept his resignation. The letter was never invoked, since Paul lived another 13 years and died on the job.', 'The only time papal power changes hands is when a pope dies or resigns. At that time, a whole series of rites and rituals comes into play governing the “interregnum” — the period between the end of one pontificate and the election of a new pope.', 'During that period, known as the “sede vacante,” or “empty See,” the camerlengo, or chamberlain, runs the administration and finances of the Holy See. He certifies the pope’s death, seals the papal apartments and prepares for the pope’s burial before a conclave to elect a new pope. The position is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the head of the Vatican’s laity office.', 'The camerlengo has no role or duties if the pope is merely sick or otherwise incapacitated.', 'Likewise, the dean of the College of Cardinals, who would preside at a papal funeral and organize the conclave, has no additional role if the pope is merely sick. That position is currently held by Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91.', 'Earlier this month, Francis decided to keep Re on the job even after his five-year term expired, rather than make way for someone new.
