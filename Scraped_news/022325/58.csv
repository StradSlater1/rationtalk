As always, grades are based on expectations for each player. A “B” grade represents the average performance for that player.', '36 minutes, 21 points, 4 assists, 1 steal, 7-12 FG, 4-9 3PT, 3-4 FT, +14', 'Offensively, Rui was fantastic in this game. He was aggressive inside, hit four 3-pointers and scored 21 points. Hachimura also demonstrated his toughness by leaving the floor in the fourth due to some kind of injury but returning to close out the game.', 'However, his rebounding was non-existent. Hachimura shouldn’t be playing 36 minutes and grabbing zero rebounds. He is the only Laker who played and failed to grab a rebound and that includes the players who were only in the game during garbage time.', 'Grade: B+', '33 minutes, 25 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steal, 3 blocks, 11-19 FG, 1-4 3PT, 2-3 FT, +9', 'LeBron didn’t have to be a superhero for the Lakers to win. He just had to be good and he was. There were some nice lob dunks he converted on, some gorgeous outlet passes and when he needed to go in the post and get a bucket, he did.', 'Saturday gave us our first example of what the Luka-LeBron combo can look like when everything is going well and this preview is scary for the rest of the NBA.', 'Grade: A', '25 minutes, 4 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 steal, 1 block, 2-3 FG, +8', 'Hayes has raised his standard of play since the Anthony Davis trade. While this team is still short a big, due to his performances, it’s hurt them less than it should. He has defended at a respectable level and makes very few bad or careless plays. If Hayes can add a couple more points and rebounds that’d be great, but as long as he continues to play like this, he’ll have a relatively good season for Los Angeles.', 'Grade: B+', '33 minutes, 23 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, 1 block, 7-13 FG, 4-7 3PT, 5-6 FT, +13', 'Reaves is adjusting well to Luka being a Laker. He is still on-ball very much and distributing plenty of assists. His scoring continues to increase and he followed up his 32-point performance against the Blazers with 23 in the win.', 'Grade: A-', '31 minutes, 32 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists, 4 steals, 1 block, 10-22 FG, 4-9 3PT, 8-8 FT, +20', 'Don’t call it a comeback; Luka has been here for years. This was the first Luka Magic game and it was everything Lakers fans could’ve hoped for. He was jawing at players, fans and even the refs while getting bucket after bucket.', 'His passing was Magic Johnson-esque and every time Denver went on a run, Luka was part of a sequence that ended it. This is just the beginning of what could be a decade-long run for Luka in a Lakers uniform.', 'Grade: A+', '27 minutes, 3 points, 4 rebounds, 2 steals, 1-5 FG, 1-4 3PT, +21', 'This was another classic DFS game. He was fighting for loose balls, being a defensive irritant and led the team in plus-minus with a +21. Selfishly, some more points from a player who is logging 27 minutes would be ideal, but he is on the floor as an elite defender and the Lakers are better when he is playing, regardless of his offensive numbers.', 'Grade: B+', '20 minutes, 3 points, 2 rebounds, 1 assist, 1 steal, 1-4 FG, 1-4 3PT, +17', 'Vincent struggled in this game. he couldn’t find his shot and his defense was just average. When he’s not making his shots, it’s a struggle to justify him being on the court. The good thing is he’s a smart veteran who rarely makes mistakes, but he needs to hit his open jumpers.', 'Grade: B-', '11 minutes, 5 points, 1 rebound, 1 assist, 2 steals, 2-3 FG, 1-2 3PT, +6', 'As a two-way player, during a marquee matchup, with the Lakers relatively healthy, Goodwin was one of three bench players who played ten-plus minutes. That tells you everything you need to know about how much Lakers head coach JJ Redick trusts him.', 'Goodwin didn’t disappoint, knocking down a 3-pointer in the fourth, applying some good ball pressure and getting a couple of steals. It might be time to make room on the roster and give him a permanent spot.', 'Grade: A', 'Vando and Knecht almost played enough to earn grades but fell short of the ten minutes needed. That is probably good for them, considering how much they struggled in this win. Milton, Len and Jemision only participated during garbage time.', ""Is Redick a Coach of the Year candidate? He made a strong case with this victory. After the win, he discussed how obsessed he was with creating a plan for this game and his team's flawless execution of it."", 'Redick also challenged two calls and won both.

But after watching the Lakers slicing the Nuggets (123-100), we know that smile can also spill disaster on the other person (read team) across. Especially if that is Luka Doncic! Yes, that is THE Luka JJ Redick wanted to see when he said before the tipoff that he just wanted Luka to have a “blackout episode” against the Nuggets where he “screams at no one in particular.” “That’s the Luka I know,” Redick said. “That’s the killer.”\u202c Indeed, he killed right from the beginning- 16 of his 32 points came in the first quarter itself!

Saturday night added more relevance to the narrative. Together they contributed 57 points (Luka 32 and LeBron 25) to the Lakers’ score. Less than two minutes into the game on Saturday, Luka grabbed a rebound, immediately turned his head, and without even dribbling threw a perfect full-court outlet pass that hit LeBron in style for a slam. In the rest of the play, they would connect for three more baskets. One beauty came 55 seconds before the halftime.', 'After grabbing his 5th rebound, Luka staged a perfect alley-oop to LeBron- his first ever to the King!

LeBron knew Luka was in his element against the Nuggets. In Denver, he said, he saw that version of Luka that led the Mavericks to the NBA Finals last year. “Once he started hitting those stepback 3s, he could be yelling or barking, either at fans, or us or himself,” James said. But turns out, Luka still thinks that they have yet to become that “100”-worthy duo.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Article continues below this ad', 'During the post-game interview, ESPN’s Lisa Salters asked, “There’s been so much talk about you fitting in with the Lakers, about you fitting in with LeBron James.

You see today after three games, you saw today that it’s getting better. So, every day it’s gonna get better.” As great as Luka looked tonight, he probably still needs some time to be completely at peace with the new Lakers environment after his sudden 1,435-mile move from Dallas to LA.

Just what has felt better tonight?” Once again, wearing that killer smile, Luka replied, “Finally felt like myself a little bit you know… That’s why I was smiling the whole game.” Yes, he is gradually getting into that old self after struggling to find his footing in his first three games with Los Angeles where he averaged just 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 5.3 assists. The night brought up several instances of that.', 'Just seconds after the alley-oop pass to LeBron, Luka landed his signature stepback-3 that took his point tally to 19. The TV commentary succinctly explained what it meant: “You know Luka, you know he’s on that left wing, that step back going to his left, that’s what he wants.” After hitting a 3-pointer in the final minute of the first half, Luka let out a big scream, just like Redick wanted. The Slovenian’s passion was once again visible moments later when he drew a technical for arguing that the Nuggets got away with hitting him in the head on his missed floater just before the halftime buzzer. Looking at all these, King James has an interesting take on their connection.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Article continues below this ad', 'While Luka was not fully satisfied with his chemistry with LeBron, King James could not stop raving about it, “I’m a natural-born wide receiver and he’s a natural-born quarterback, so it fits perfectly.” With tonight’s win, the Lakers have climbed to the fourth seed in the West.

The Lakers had just nine turnovers to Denver’s 22 and 15 steals to the Nuggets’ six.

Beyond his 16-point first quarter outburst and the familiar stat line of 32 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, and four steals that he put up in the battle of two of the West’s top teams, Doncic was more animated than he has been at any time since being traded.', '“He was super dialed in,” LeBron James said. “He was very locked in on what he wanted to do out here on the floor tonight. Once he started hitting those step-back threes and got to yelling and barking, either at the fans or at us or himself. … He was just dialed in on what he wanted to do and how he wanted to execute his game plan individually.”', 'Coach J.J. Redick told Doncic before the game that he wanted to see “at least one blackout episode” where Doncic screams “at no one in particular.” Along with his unique talents, that fiery competitiveness is what has made Doncic one of the best players in the world. Doncic handled the ball more often on Saturday, Buha notes, repeatedly targeting Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic in the pick-and-roll. Redick added that the plan moving forward will be to keep the ball in Doncic’s hands as much as possible.', '“I think Luka needs to be the guy that controls the offense,” Redick said. “And (James) and (Austin Reaves), because we’re gonna stagger everybody, they’re gonna have their times to be on the ball. But all three of those guys are very intelligent basketball players, and we can create mismatches.

That may not have been one of his most memorable ""blackout episodes,"" but Dončić was certainly the ""killer"" on Saturday that Redick and everyone else has come to know over the years.

"", ""The win, which ended the Nuggets' nine-game winning streak, was perhaps the ideal version of this new Lakers team. They were able to keep at least one of James or Dončić on the floor at all times to run the show, and got great games from both of them.

We saw today that it\'s getting better. So, every day it\'s going to get better. ""', ""Things won't always work this well, but it's clear the Lakers can play with anyone and should only get better in the coming weeks as Dončić gets back into basketball shape after missing nearly two months and acclimates to his new surroundings following the blockbuster trade that ended his time in Dallas.

To me, I\'m happy to be here. Clearly, these guys are really incredible, so I\'m happy for the new journey.""', ""With the win, the Lakers improved to 34-21, good for fourth place in the West standings after the Houston Rockets' loss on Saturday night.

It’s hard.”', 'Redick added: “We have our game plan and we think we can execute a game plan. Doesn’t guarantee victory. He’s seen everything. I’m confident with the group we have.”', 'His pregame words foreshadowed what happened in his team’s 123-100 victory over the Nuggets on Saturday.', 'The Lakers executed their defensive strategy for Jokic – which was similar to their game plan when defending Karl-Anthony Towns in a Feb. 1 victory over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden – at a high level.', 'The result was Jokic having one of his worst performances of the season: 12 points on 2-of-7 shooting – the second-fewest points he’s scored in a game this season – to go with 13 rebounds and 10 assists for a triple-double. Jokic also had six of the Nuggets’ 22 turnovers, which led to 39 Lakers’ points.', '“There was a similarity just in terms of the messaging around what we were willing to live with,” Redick said of the game plan against Jokic, comparing it to the ones against Towns.', 'The success of the Lakers’ defense against the three-time MVP started well before he even had the ball in his hands.', 'The Lakers tasked with guarding Jokic – primarily Rui Hachimura, but also LeBron James, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Dorian Finney-Smith – were physical with him as soon as he crossed midcourt. And Vanderbilt even met him in the backcourt.', 'The goal was to limit Jokic’s touches, which the Lakers accomplished.', 'The box score doesn’t directly show the times the Lakers successfully fronted Jokic, forcing the Nuggets to go in a different direction with their offense. Or when the Lakers disrupted pass attempts to Jokic that led to turnovers or other Denver players catching the ball. But both happened often.', 'The Lakers held Jokic, who entered the weekend leading the NBA in frontcourt touches (56.6 per game), to 43 frontcourt touches on Saturday. He possessed the ball nearly a third less of the time on Saturday (3.1 minutes) than he did entering the matchup (4.5 minutes) and held the ball for shorter periods when he did have it.', '', '“The difference was really just [fronting] Jokic as soon as he crossed halfcourt and then just relying on that secondary defender on the backside to take away the over-the-top pass,” Redick said. “They got some of those cuts off of it. Also created some turnovers off of it and got the ball in other guys’ hands off of that when he did catch the ball.', '“We executed that well.”', 'Once Jokic crossed midcourt, his defender would front Jokic in the post – standing between Jokic and the perimeter player who had the ball – to prevent Jokic from posting up on the block/low post.', '“Just [don’t] give him an easy touch,” Hachimura said of the defensive game plan against Jokic. “Once he gets in halfcourt, I gotta be on him literally the whole time. It was a great game plan and as a team, we did a good job executing.”', 'And once Jokic caught the ball in the low post, the Lakers not only regularly sent help and double-teams, but were consistently intentional in how they sent help toward Jokic in the post.', 'The Lakers consistently doubled Jokic by having the second/help defender coming from the baseline – a tactic called “tilt,” which Redick and James ironically discussed on the second episode of their old “Mind The Game” podcast.', 'It was their most frequent and effective strategy for doubling Jokic. Two of Jokic’s giveaways came after the Lakers sent help/doubled from the baseline and made weak-side help rotations.', '', 'This doesn’t include Jokic’s final turnover of the game, and the Nuggets’ 20th, when he made a bad pass out of a post-up against Hachimura while Jaxson Hayes was coming over on the baseline to help but Jokic made the pass before Hayes’ arrival. The turnover led to a Luka Doncic circus shot that extended the Lakers’ lead to 117-97 with 4:15 remaining – putting the game out of reach for the Lakers’ first win in Denver since April 2022.', 'The timing of when the Lakers sent their double-teams mattered. When they weren’t facing a mismatch with Jokic posting up a guard, the Lakers usually sent a help defender toward Jokic after he dribbled, forcing Jokic to either pick up his dribble, pass or shoot instead of having time to survey the Lakers’ defense.', 'Denver, notably, didn’t post up Jokic as much on the blocks via passes from teammates in the second half. He operated from the perimeter or elbows more often after halftime – a win for the Lakers since this meant Jokic was operating further away from the basket. But this also made it more challenging for the Lakers to send help when Jokic had the ball.', 'The Nuggets occasionally had success against the Lakers’ defense when they doubled Jokic, especially when the Lakers didn’t send the second defender from the baseline or didn’t fully commit to double-teaming. Denver players also created their looks with the space the Lakers conceded to prevent Jokic from catching the ball or getting it in his sweet spots.', 'But the Lakers were mostly willing to live with what they allowed, leading to the Nuggets having their fifth-worst offensive rating (points scored per 100 possessions) in a game this season at 106.7, according to Cleaning The Glass, significantly lower than their season-long mark of 121.3.', '“That was elite,” Vanderbilt said. “We talk about putting it together for 48 minutes, as far as sticking to the game plan and even when the game plan didn’t go our way, like when [Aaron] Gordon and [Russell Westbrook] hit some shots, and we didn’t steer away from the game plan. We stayed with it.”', 'The Lakers were encouraged by their ability to execute at a high level in their quest to being a great team and competing amongst the league’s best.', '“In order for us to be successful, in order for us to win ultimately long term, we have to trust our game plan, we have to trust and be dialed in on attention to detail,” James said. “We have the personnel now that we can really lock in on a game plan and really lock in and be super strategic about how we want to execute offensively and defensively.

Ahead of the highly anticipated matchup, NBA legend Magic Johnson sent an urgent message to the Lakers to keep the momentum going after their big win over Denver.', '""Okay Lakers - one playoff contending team down. Now it’s time to get ready for the Mavs!"" Johnson posted. ', ""While the drama won't be as intense as it will be when Luka Doncic first steps foot in Dallas, the energy surrounding Tuesday’s game will still be high, even with Anthony Davis still sidelined due to an adductor strain."", 'The trade that sent Doncic to the Lakers was a complete shock. Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison made the unexpected move, and Doncic learned of the deal just minutes before it was publicly revealed by ESPN’s Shams Charania. ', 'This trade came roughly nine months after Doncic led the Mavericks to the NBA Finals and earned his fifth consecutive All-NBA first-team selection.', 'This article first appeared on Athlon Sports and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', ""In their first game after the All-Star break, the Brooklyn Nets lost to the league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers by a score of 110-97 on Thursday. Before this loss, the Nets were on a three-game winning streak and had won six of their last seven games. However, they will have a solid opportunity to get back on track as they take on the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday, who are in the midst of a six-game losing streak. The Nets and 76ers are both 20-35 and are tied for the No. 12 seed in the East. Additionally, they are both just 6.5 games behind the No. 7 seed Orlando Magic. It may not seem like it at the moment, but this game could have major playoff implications and is an important one for both teams. Unfortunately for the Nets, they will be without one of their starters as they aim for a victory. According to their official injury report, the Nets have ruled out D'Angelo Russell due to an ankle injury on the eve of his 29th birthday. Russell suffered the injury after 18 minutes in the loss to Cleveland. As it stands, it is unclear exactly when the Ohio State alum might make his return. The Nets traded for Russell from the Los Angeles Lakers back in December. Russell previously played for the Nets from 2017 to 2019 and was an All-Star while with the team. Since his return, he has averaged 13.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.2 steals in 17 games."", ""The Boston Bruins got some unfortunate news on Sunday when it was announced that defenseman Hampus Lindholm is going to miss the remainder of the season. With the regular season back in full swing, teams are getting back to the grind but one team that will have to do so is the Boston Bruins, who are going to be without a very key player for the rest of the 2024-25 season. On Sunday it was revealed by GM Don Sweeney that defenseman Hampus Lindholm would be missing the rest of the regular season due to an injury. It's a huge blow to the Bruins who are only one point out of a wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. Lindholm has been out with a lower-body injury since mid-November, and an update was expected after the 4 Nations; though it's not the one that the Bruins or their fans had hoped for. Lindholm, 31, was supposed to add a shutdown defender with offensive potential but his injury really derailed any momentum he had. This season in 17 games, he has three goals and four assists but has been derailed by injuries in the past. For his career, Lindholm has 73 goals and 240 assists in 762 games since being drafted 6th overall by the Anaheim Ducks in 2012. He was the centrepiece of the trade sending him to Boston for a bunch of draft picks and mid-tier players. It's another huge blow to the Bruins defense as Charlie McAvoy found himself with a serious injury that while he's since been deemed healthy; his status is still unknown about returning. It will be up to players like Nikita Zadorov, Mason Lohrei, and Brandon Carlo to pick up the slack in both Lindholm and McAvoy's absence, and Boston can't afford any more setbacks when it comes to their season. Lindholm is in the third year of his eight-year extension he signed in 2022 and is making $6.5M until 2029-2030. It's going to be tough for the Bruins to keep pace in the Atlantic and wild card without two of their top defensemen, but with other teams like Florida missing some key pieces as well; it seems the field is wide open for the rest of the season."", 'NHL legend Wayne Gretzky was in a celebratory mood after Team Canada’s overtime win over Team USA in Thursday’s 4 Nations final, and he was eager to share in that with the players. The Great One handed out customized hats to all members of the Canadian team that beat the Americans 3-2 in overtime in Boston on Thursday. In addition to the classic Canadian maple leaf emblem, the hats carried a two-word message: “Be Great.” Photos showed that Canadian players wore the hats as they celebrated their victory in the locker room following the game. The players also blasted a fitting song during the locker room party. Canada certainly earned bragging rights with the victory, especially after they had lost 3-1 to the United States in Montreal less than a week earlier. On Thursday night, they rallied from a 2-1 deficit to come back and win on an overtime goal by Connor McDavid, a player who has received countless comparisons to Gretzky. Gretzky was on hand for Thursday’s game, and he was named an honorary captain for Canada and participated in a pregame ceremony. He was not a part of the postgame celebrations, but his hats certainly were.', ""The Vancouver Canucks were in Salt Lake City on Sunday evening to take on Utah Hockey Club for the second game of their road trip and Sportsnet's mics picked up a very heated Marcus Pettersson during the first period. Marcus Pettersson is skating in his sixth game as a member of the Vancouver Canucks since being traded to them by the Pittsburgh Penguins at the end of January to help fill a key role in their top-four defensive corps. Vancouver Canucks' Marcus Pettersson caught yelling at official on hot mic During Sunday's game between Vancouver and Utah, Canucks defenseman Marcus Pettersson was called for a questionable holding penalty with nearly five minutes remaining in the first period. Pettersson was not happy with the call and let the official know how he felt about it, which ended up being caught on a hot mic. 'F**k! That's a f**king bulls**t call!' Pettersson said to the official. Thankfully for Marcus Pettersson's sake, the Vancouver Canucks were able to kill off the power play, but shortly after, the blueliner was called for yet another penalty. Less than a minute after he stepped out of the box, Pettersson blocked a shot from the point with his stick and he continued to play without initially knowing it was broken. The officials on the ice noticed this right away and gave Marcus Pettersson a two-minute minor for playing with a broken stick and once again, the Canucks killed off the power play. 'Marcus Pettersson takes a penalty for playing the puck with a broken stick.' CanucksArmy said. The Skelleftea, Sweden is going to be an important piece in Vancouver for years to come after he signed a six-year contract extension with the club which will see him earn $5.5 million annually. Since coming over from Pittsburgh, Pettersson has yet to record any points (coming into Sunday's game), but he's brought calming presence on the blue line for Rick Tocchet and is someone they'll be relying on heavily down the stretch as they continue their playoff push."", 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.

It was Luka’s best night thus far in a Lakers uniform and LeBron was still LeBron. Nikola Jokic had a triple double and Jamal Murray a good night as well but it wasn’t enough to overcome L.A. Denver turned the ball over too much and Doncic had an answer for every one of their runs. The Nuggets win streak gets snapped in a 123-100 wire to wire loss to the Lakers.', 'Denver was ice cold to start the game. They missed their first six shots which got the Lakers a lead. The Nuggets eventually found their offense and rallied to tie the game at eight all. Both teams were looking to run and that got multiple guys on both teams involved in the offense. The Lakers went on a run led by Doncic and got up by eight to force a Denver timeout. The Nuggets got sloppy and the Lakers got the benefit of the whistle with the quarter winding down. L.A. went on an extended run and grew their lead to double digits. Jokic took control in the final minutes. A solid close to the quarter put Denver down just 38-31 after one.', 'Put a little something extra into that one 💪 pic.twitter.com/4n9qEY08RA', 'Denver struggled to find offense in the non-Jokic minutes to start the second quarter. There were a lot of Russell Westbrook jumpers and not very many that were close to going in. There was too many possessions that didn’t result in an opportunity for either Jamal Murray or Michael Porter Jr. The Laker lead grew back to double digits before Nikola checked back-in. Once he did Denver took control again and went on a mini-run. They got within six before cooling off and letting Austin Reaves hit some shots. The Lakers settled into a defensive strategy of triple teaming Jokic which left Denver a little flustered. They kept turning the ball over and L.A. got back up by a dozen. Murray hit back to back threes but Luka and LeBron immediately responded. At the end of the half the Nuggets trailed 63-54.', 'As the shot clock winds down ⏰ pic.twitter.com/QXMV9OtEzG', 'Denver came out of the locker room hot and scored the first eight points of the third quarter to get within a point. Unfortunately, the Lakers responded with the next ten straight points and pushed their lead up to eleven. Denver was able to stop the bleeding there and used the three point line to cut into the Lakers lead. They got it down to six but started turning the ball over again. The Lakers took advantage and kept Denver from getting any closer while they started knocking down their own threes. The teams traded outside shots for about a minute before Michael Malone got frustrated and called a timeout with Denver trailing by a dozen. The Nuggets went on a mini-run behind Westbrook and Jokic at the close of the quarter. At the end of three they trailed 96-87.', 'Russ beats the buzzer 🚨 pic.twitter.com/FbfHPooJ3R', 'The Nuggets kept themselves within striking distance to open the fourth but couldn’t cut into the Lakers lead with Jokic on the bench. Eventually their offense struggled and the Lakers knocked down three pointers to push the lead to seventeen. Jokic checked back in with the damage looking like it was already done. Nothing was coming easy for Denver. Reaves was hitting shots and the Nuggets were running out of time halfway through the fourth. A couple more turnovers, another Luka bucket, and Malone emptied the bench with four minutes left. The deep bench looked like exactly that in the closing minutes.

Tonight was the first true example of why this trade can be such a big win for the Lakers. LeBron didn’t play poorly by any means but he also didn’t have to be the main focal point of Los Angeles’ offense. That was Luka. If he wasn’t scoring he was finding his teammates, including LeBron, and leading run after run to respond to Denver’s advances. There’s no stopping a player like that when he’s in the zone and the Nuggets were at Luka’s mercy pretty much all night long. It’s a different look in L.A. for sure and any trends that Denver built against the LeBron/Anthony Davis Lakers are now irrelevant.', 'Denver ends the game with 20 turnovers, absolutely ridiculous. Every time the Nuggets tried to make a run tonight they killed their momentum by giving up the ball, many times in a live-ball scenario. It was a consistent issue throughout the game and ultimately spelled doom for them. Jokic, Murray & Westbrook were the chief perpetrators in being careless with the basketball. The Nuggets have to get more from their ball handlers if they are going to win games down the stretch against a much tougher schedule. A team like the Lakers is especially tough to be sloppy against with the basketball. They consistently ran on Denver’s turnovers to turn them into easy points and ultimately a victory.', '']"
