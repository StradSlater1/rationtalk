I wasn’t really aware of what was going on over there [in the West Bank], and it\'s just so objectively awful.""', 'BY ANONYMOUS, AS TOLD TO SCOTT FEINBERG', 'This “Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot,” the first in a series that THR will run ahead of Oscar night, reflects the votes — and candid rationales for them — of a male member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ 202-person short films branch, as communicated to THR in return for anonymity. THR does not necessarily endorse these views or suggest that they are representative of anything other than this voter’s perspective.', 'Best picture', 'I liked Emilia Pérez when I watched it but, even before all the shit that happened [involving lead actress Karla Sofía Gascón], it wasn’t in my top 10. I’d have preferred to see its spot go to Sing Sing, which was underappreciated; or Juror #2, which I really liked; or The Wild Robot or No Other Land, but you know how most of the Academy treats animated and documentary films — no respect. I do like musicals, and Wicked was tight. I’m Still Here was great, and, as we’ll come to, it’s my pick for international feature. I really liked the performances in A Complete Unknown — the fact that Timmy [Chalamet] and Monica [Barbaro] were both really singing and playing the guitar was incredible. Anora was great — the story and the performances were really fun, Sean [Baker] directed the shit out of it — but the others did more for me. The Substance was what I love about cinema at its best. It’s so bold — the story, the sound design, the makeup. They gave the audience an experience. And it’s so rare for the Academy to recognize a horror film, but the fact that this one is kind of about what it’s like to be a woman in Hollywood probably helped more people to connect with it. I loved the first Dune. Dune: Part Two had some weaker story elements — he [Denis Villeneuve] cares so much more about visuals than storytelling, and you can notice that in this one more than the first — and I didn’t think Zendaya was that great in it. But the cinematic spectacle of it was so monumental that I still was blown away. Nickel Boys is so audacious — I’d read the book, and let me tell you, that is not an easy one to adapt, but the way that RaMell Ross did it, with the first-person perspective, was exactly right. But for me, the final two films were incredibly hard to decide between. Going in to The Brutalist, I’d never heard of Brady Corbet and was dreading the [three-and-a-half-hour] runtime, but the way people who had seen it at the festivals were talking about it convinced me to go to a screening really early in the season, and by the end I really appreciated why he did it the way he did it. It’s just an incredible film — beautifully shot, amazing performances, and such a powerful story. But Conclave was so interesting and exciting in a completely different way — and fun, with a little mystery involved. I thought the ending was great — it wasn’t trying to make a point, it was just a perfect reveal. Edward Berger is an incredible director.', '', 'VOTE: (1) Conclave, (2) The Brutalist, (3) Nickel Boys, (4) Dune: Part Two, (5) The Substance, (6) Anora, (7) A Complete Unknown, (8) I’m Still Here, (9) Wicked, (10) Emilia Pérez', '', 'Best director                                                                                           ', 'I judge this category like one judges an Olympic sport: the degree of difficulty, plus the execution — did you stick the landing? I think this category needs to be expanded to at least eight. Edward Berger, RaMell Ross and Denis Villeneuve should’ve been nominated. How many other directors could’ve done what they did? And why is [A Complete Unknown’s] James Mangold in here but they aren’t? He’s a really good director — he told the story well — but there was nothing special about the way he directed that film. You want to tell me that directing Timmy Chalamet in New York was harder than directing an epic in the desert? Come on. I was torn between Brady and [The Substance’s] Coralie Fargeat, and I ended up going with Coralie. If she wasn’t there, I’d have picked Brady, because the fact that he made his movie look that good with only $10 million is unbelievable. But I just thought about historical absence [only three women have ever won this category’s Oscar] and high degree of execution — she nailed it with that film.', '', 'VOTE: Coralie Fargeat, The Substance', 'Best actor', 'I had a hard time with this one. Timmy was probably the easiest one for me to let go. Ralph [Fiennes of Conclave], [The Brutalist’s Adrien] Brody and Colman’s [Domingo of Sing Sing] performances were just so good. I got to hear a lot from the Sing Sing guys, and really liked them, and I think that what Colman did for that movie, on and off screen, was just remarkable.', 'VOTE: Colman Domingo, Sing Sing', 'Best actress', 'I was very strongly considering voting for Karla, but when her tweets started coming out I was flabbergasted — I was like, “I can’t believe this person said these things.” And it kept getting worse every day. It quickly became obvious, “I’m not voting for this person. No way.” After that, it was between Mikey [Madison of Anora] and Demi [Moore of The Substance]. Both of them are at the heart of their films, and I loved both of their films. I’m not opposed to voting for new, younger people, when they are amazing. But Demi has been around for a long time, and she absolutely crushed it.', 'VOTE: Demi Moore, The Substance', 'Best supporting actor', 'I thought it was insane that the one guy from Anora [Yura Borisov] got nominated over the other two [Mark Eydelshteyn and Karren Karagulian]. I seriously considered [The Apprentice’s] Jeremy Strong and [The Brutalist’s] Guy Pearce, but at the end of the day I just loved Kieran [Culkin] in A Real Pain.', 'VOTE: Kieran Culkin, A Real Pain', '', 'Best supporting actress', 'I was never as high on Zoe [Saldaña of Emilia Pérez] as everyone else was.

But I went with Dune: Part Two because Brady was shooting miniatures, but what Denis and Greig [Fraser] did was on a whole different scale and looked absolutely beautiful.', 'VOTE: Dune: Part Two', 'Best costume design', 'It was between Wicked and Conclave for me. I went with Conclave because I’d heard Edward Berger talk about the way they selected the robes and changed certain colors, and it just looked really cool. That said, I wish I’d realized at the time that Paul Tazewell did Wicked, because Paul is a legend.', 'VOTE: Conclave', 'Best film editing', 'There are some really interesting sequences in Anora, like the home invasion in the middle, but I voted for The Brutalist. Some people are like, “A three-and-a-half-hour movie needs more editing,” but I regarded it as two movies split up by the intermission, and I felt that there wasn’t really any fat on the bone.', 'VOTE: The Brutalist', 'Best makeup and hairstyling', 'It wasn’t close for me: The Substance. The way the makeup and prosthetics progress as Demi is aging rapidly, up through the end scene, is just so good.', 'VOTE: The Substance', 'Best original score', 'I write to scores, so I’ve heard all of this year’s nominees many times, and all of them are really good. But [The Wild Robot’s] Kris Bowers deserves it this year. He has deserved it for a number of years.', '', 'VOTE: The Wild Robot', 'Best original song', 'I don’t think the song choices this year were that great. I was lukewarm on the Emilia Pérez songs [“El Mal” and “Mi Camino”] even before the Karla shit; after, I was like, “I don’t really want to award this movie.” So for me it was between [“Like a Bird” from] Sing Sing and Elton [John: Never Too Late’s “Never Too Late”]. I voted for Sing Sing because, within the context of the film, I thought the song worked, and I wanted to show the film some love. The song from The Six Triple Eight [“The Journey”] didn’t really do anything for me, but I’ve since learned that it’s a Diane Warren song [the names of the songwriter(s) of the nominated songs do not appear on the ballot]; if I had known that, it probably would’ve affected my vote, which is probably what they’re trying to avoid.

Oscar voting has officially closed — so here are our burning questions,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/oscar-voting-officially-closed-burning-010036146.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Pencils down, tabs closed. Oscar winner voting officially closed at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT, meaning the end of the most unpredictable awards season in recent memory is nearing the finish line. Before the 2025 Oscars ceremony reveals this year’s winners — and ahead of the several anonymous Oscar voters who will be discussing their preferences with us between now and March 2 — here are the three biggest burning questions about the race.', 'After Anora breakout Mikey Madison won at the BAFTA Awards on Sunday against The Substance star Demi Moore, it confirmed the long-held speculation that the Oscars Best Actress race had not yet been decided. In some ways, regardless of whether she wins at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, it is arguably Madison who now holds the edge against the veteran actress. Madison is guaranteed at least a split of the industry precursors and leads the Best Picture frontrunner. But before Team Anora and Madison’s online stans start popping champagne in anticipation of her potential Best Actress win, consider this: Neither Madison nor Moore has competed against the exact Oscar Best Actress field yet this season. That’s because I’m Still Here star Fernanda Torres, the Golden Globe Award winner for Best Drama Actress, was snubbed by both the BAFTA Awards and SAG Awards (and didn’t land a Critics Choice Award nomination either). On the one hand, Torres’s failure to secure bids from those influential industry groups might give her the appearance of an also-ran. But don’t judge a book by its cover: the passion for Torres is hard to ignore — so much so that it’s possible her support within the Academy actually pushed I’m Still Here into the Best Picture field, where it was a long shot to receive a nomination. Torres is also the “apple in the bag of oranges,” if you’ll excuse the idiom. I’m Still Here is a biographical film about the real-life activist Eunice Paiva, and the drama has anecdotally left several audiences overcome with emotion. The other four nominees for Best Actress, including Madison and Moore? They’re in comedies with dramatic elements, musicals with dramatic elements, or a body-horror satire with dramatic elements. That doesn’t mean Torres should be considered the frontrunner here or that she’ll eventually emerge victoriously to shock the world (but not her Brazilian fan base, which has given her rabid support online for months). However, she’s probably a lot closer to pulling off the unlikely win than many want to think about.', 'More from GoldDerby', ""'Zero Day' reviews: Critics call Robert De Niro thriller 'an astonishing amount of fun' - and also 'deadly dull'"", ""'Wicked' and Timothée Chalamet are predicted to win at the 2025 SAG Awards: Get all the official odds"", ""'Sing Sing,' 'Nickel Boys' win big at the 2025 African American Film Critics Awards"", 'Sean Baker may leave the Oscars on March 2 with his name placed alongside Walt Disney in the Academy Awards record books. With four nominations — as a producer, director, editor, and writer — Baker could tie Disney with four Oscar wins in a single night (and become the first person to win four Oscars for a single project, unlike Disney). It feels like Baker will win two or three of those four nominations: Best Picture and Best Director. (Even though Baker lost at the BAFTAs, it’s hard to bet against a precursor like the Directors Guild Awards, which has matched the Oscars in 18 of the last 20 years and was won this year by the Anora filmmaker.) He could also win Best Original Screenplay, although perhaps Jesse Eisenberg will surprise for A Real Pain and break a 20-year streak at the Oscars. Only the editing race seems out of play: not only did Baker lose in that category at the BAFTA Awards to presumed favorite Conclave, he’d also be only the second director in 35 years to win an Oscar for editing his own movie (Alfonso Cuarón was a co-editor when he won for Gravity).', 'Just after the Oscar nominations and before Karla Sofía Gascón exploded the Emilia Pérez Best Picture campaign, it felt like six movies were in legitimate competition for the top Oscar. Or maybe that was a mirage, especially with Wicked becoming a tech player and A Complete Unknown continually being blanked by the industry. (The Bob Dylan biopic has not won a major award this season.) Heading into Sunday’s SAG Awards, Anora remains the frontrunner — and if any movie other than Conclave were to win Best Ensemble from the Actors Guild, it would stay the overwhelming best bet. And if Conclave were to win? Well, Anora is still the frontrunner, but maybe the race is slightly closer.', 'Best of GoldDerby', 'When are the Oscars? 2025 Academy Awards date, time, nominees', 'Jane Fonda movies: 15 greatest films ranked worst to best', ""'Conclave' takes Best Picture at 2025 BAFTA Awards, thwarting 'The Brutalist' and 'Anora'"", ""Sign up for Gold Derby's Newsletter.

It is a work of art, plain and simple. Beyond its themes about immigration and the American dream, it’s just as much a dissection of the human condition. The story, direction, and performances do justice to every single theme the film tackles, from power struggles to the design process. It’s also the most aesthetically pleasing film among the nominees; the marble sequence brought me to tears. I’m Still Here is a close second, I thought it was absolutely magnificent and it touched me on a very personal level. In third, Nickel Boys. ', '', '', 'BEST DIRECTOR: Brady Corbet (The Brutalist)', 'What Corbet accomplished with The Brutalist is nothing short of mindblowing. With limited resources, he created what felt like a mega-production. Epic in scale, complex, and yet incredibly intimate at the same time. Every element of the production — from the cinematography to the production design — contributes to create a cohesive whole, and that’s down to Brady Corbet’s direction. ', 'BEST ACTRESS: Fernanda Torres (I’m Still Here)', 'Torres delivers such a pure performance, without the need of any prosthetics or special effects (something that is becoming rarer to find these days). The way she can express so much with a performance that is so internal is truly masterful. She moved me deeply. ', 'BEST ACTOR: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist)', 'Brody guides us through the epic journey that is The Brutalist. He’s able to convey László’s dreams, desires and frustrations in the subtlest of ways. I was inspired by the way his character sees art everywhere, in everyday objects, in life. Brody sells it throughout the entire 3 1/2-hour runtime. I wish I could vote for more than one actor, though. Timothée Chalamet’s performance was also very impressive. ', '', '', 'BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Felicity Jones (The Brutalist)', 'This was probably the hardest category to vote for. Isabella Rossellini is amazing in Conclave, but severely underutilized. Zoe Saldaña saves Emilia Pérez for me, but she’s the protagonist of the film; I wouldn’t feel comfortable voting for her as a supporting actress. Which leaves Felicity Jones, who is able to carry out a complete and fully-realized character arc despite only being in only half of the picture. I thought she was phenomenal. ', 'BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Yura Borisov (Anora)', 'Borisov’s performance perfectly complements the vertiginous pace of Anora. He was the costar of that final act, which was my favorite part of the movie. He manages to deliver a comedic performance with a lot of heart. ', 'BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY: Nickel Boys', 'I struggled with this category. Conclave has a strong screenplay, one that elevates the source material, but that final act is the weakest part of the film, and that’s down to the writing. I went with Nickel Boys, a really tough book to adapt but it worked for me on every level. I wish RaMell Ross had been nominated for Best Director, but I’ll gladly give him my vote in this category instead.', 'BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY: Anora', 'I was really close to voting for The Brutalist in this category as well. I thought the dialogues were more profound and thought-provoking than Anora’s, but Anora is a different type of movie. Its structure is really creative, as is the way it tackles its themes. Yes, the dialogues may be a bit superficial, but they work completely within the context of the story Sean Baker is telling.

I think it is notable that even voters who aren’t enamored with Emilia Perez and The Substance overall still seem to single out Moore and Saldana as elements they did like. Kieran is such a lock, they should just give him the Oscar right now and spare us any fake suspense regarding such an inevitable win. Interesting and bizarre how Nickel Boys got their vote for Adapted Screenplay, but Conclave was ranked above it for Picture.', 'Interesting to see how these different voters select their choices. Not interesting is that there aren’t any choices that are far off the Oscar radar. Ultimately it’s going to be Brody and Culkin, Saldana, and Moore. Sean Baker is taking the Director prize, Conclave is taking the top honor.', 'I don’t know how you got to that conclusion from these ballots, when the lead actress category is clearly a three way race, and more people so far have said they voted for Torres than Moore. While the only industry award so far has been won by Mikey Madison.\nAnd more people have so far said they have voted for Barbaro than for Saldana.\nOr how “there aren’t any choices that are far off the Oscar radar” when every single actor in the two male acting categories has gotten at least one vote, and Nickel Boys is currently tied with Conclave for Adapted Screenplay.', 'Demi Moore electrifying performance in Substance.

The Substance is a mess, full of sound and fury, signifying little, with Moore given scant else to do besides “react with horror to her latest mutation.”\nI agree with her 100%', 'The fact that she has the best “narrative” of any Best Actress contender, winning the Oscar is ridiculous 🙄 Oscars are irrelevant', 'I dont think This “secret exposed voters” really say much at all, except that It’s a competitive year, which we alreAdy knew. Culkin, Brody and Saldana Will Sweep, as expected. Culkin might not even show up to get his first oscar, but the guy deserves the throphy for ‘ in my opinión’ the best performance of the year”. With all due respect to “ double time holoucast survivor Adrian Brody.\nThe suspense remains for best leas Actress but i think It’s Demoi Moore.

"Anonymous Oscar Ballot: Director Embraces ‘Anora,’ ‘A Complete Unknown,’ ‘Sing Sing,’ and ‘Wicked’",https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/anonymous-oscar-ballot-director-anora-a-complete-unknown-1235097452/,"['', 'With final Oscar balloting closed on February 18,  we’re continuing with our seventh annual series of interviews with Academy voters from different branches for their unfiltered takes on what got picked, overlooked, and overvalued in the 2025 award season. Voter’s picks are in bold. Interview edited for brevity.', 'Best Picture', '“Anora.” I went with “A Complete Unknown” for such a long time, for two months before I saw “Anora.” Just the balancing act of the humor, the tension, the male gaze sexiness, and [Anora’s] character being so aggressive and tough and not taking shit, this long-lost child inside. When that last scene happened, it broke your heart, and [Mikey Madison] was so good in it. And the boyfriend [Mark Eydelshteyn], from the moment he walked on the screen, I wanted to do violence to him. Every chance she gets, she would go in his lap and snuggle up and there’d be no conversation. He would be playing those games, and they did nothing but stimulate themselves. It says so much about people like that.', '', 'It looks like it’s happening in front of you. And [Sean Baker]’s been doing that style from the beginning — that is hard to achieve. He directed it, but it doesn’t feel like it was directed. It feels like he happened to be in the right place with the camera, and that’s a subtle difference. I look forward to more.', '“A Complete Unknown,” I have zero distance. The second album I ever bought was “The Times They Are A-changin’.” I wore the grooves off it. And I got it for my 18th birthday. And then I went to a concert in Forest Hills two weeks after Newport, and saw the same thing. “Wow, people, he did folk!” People liked it. Then he did rock, and everyone booed. So, I have no distance from it. I can watch it over and over again. I’ve seen it twice, okay? I know so much about Dylan. I don’t mind all the moving around of the pieces of his life to make the story better. Having had experience doing musical biopics, you have to present the music so it carries the story forward. You don’t stop the movie to watch someone sing. Then you end up with that Clint Eastwood movie [“Jersey Boys”] about The Four Seasons and Frankie Valli. So the achievement of the director and the achievement of the movie was that the songs were a major character. And you felt them, and you listened to the words all over again, and Timothée Chalamet sang them with such care and feeling. So I love the movie.', '', '“Emilia Pérez” is so daring. It’s preposterous to believe that this guy [Manitas] could change himself over and no one could figure it out. So I admire: “How can I suspend reality enough to make everyone come along with me on this?” And [Jacques Audiard] did it by making it a musical. Because in a musical, reality is what you create. The movie was seamless. But discussions afterwards with friends have made me step back from from my enthusiasm for it in terms of how awful the drug trade is in Mexico, and how many people have died at the hands of it.', '“The Brutalist” was like the concrete buildings. I couldn’t. I just kept hitting the wall. Everything about it is excellent, but I couldn’t get into it. I admired its artistry and the sheer effort: they made this one for [under $10 million].', '“Wicked,” I saw at the Academy, and it was thrilling, and I haven’t thought about it again until this week’s WTF with Mark Maron and Ariana Grande. She is a thoughtful person. Coming away from “Wicked,” I was dazzled by the production design, but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were just phenomenal. It was an achievement.', '“The Substance” did not go over very well at the Academy, but I loved it. There is so much Riot Girl punk energy in this movie. If we’re looking for a connective theme this year, it’s the emergence in mainstream of these kind of movies. And who knows what the mainstream is anymore, of female rage?', '', '“Nickel Boys” is our hope for the future. That and [documentary feature] “Soundtrack for a Coup d’Etat” are both so brilliantly edited and put together in ways that are expressive. These movies present this information in a way that’s truly exciting and makes it work on several levels.', 'Best Director', '“Anora” director Sean Baker. I did my homework this year. I’ve been going back and looking at everybody’s movies who I didn’t know. I had seen “Tangerine” and “Florida Project.” I went back and I watched “Starlet” on Criterion and “Red Rocket.” The really good filmmakers, you can see it from the beginning. Now I see the connective tissue. And how all these things he was interested in have come together in this film, the tension of it, and the humor and the slapstick for those henchmen, they’re hilarious and incredible. It is so hard to do.', '“A Complete Unknown” director James Mangold knows how to entertain. He’s a good director. I have never shown “Ford v. Ferrari” to anybody who didn’t have a damn good time. He takes a complex subject that may not be for everybody. “A Complete Unknown” was truly entertaining. And the weight of the movie ended up with Pete Seeger [Edward Norton]. And the director found the way to personify something that gave him conflict that we may not care that much about, which is traditional folk versus someone who’s changing the music forever. That’s pretty arcane, but also moving.', '', 'Going back and seeing “Dheepan” and relooking at “Rust and Bone” and “The Prophet” and so forth, Jacques Audiard, the director of “Emelia Pérez,” is a world-class director.', 'I look to the future for the director of “The Substance,” [Coralie Fargeat].', 'Best Actress', '“I’m Still Here” is another family saga: it’s the strength of the mother. I voted for that performance, Fernanda Torres. I’m all for Demi Moore giving us her “My name is Mrs. Norman Maine” speech. We need that on the Oscars, and I hope she wins. But [Fernanda Torres] was the thread that carried you along in “I’m Still Here.”', 'Best Actor', 'Adrien Brody shoulders [“The Brutalist”]. He’s in every frame of it, and he makes a truly unpleasant, artistic man understandable. He’s driven and cannot be pushed down. I would hate to have dinner with him and Bob Dylan at the same time, there could not be two more unpleasant people, plus the amount of smoking would drive you crazy.', 'So the non-smoking performance of the year was Colman Domingo in “Sing Sing.” He should be the MVP every year. He’s in the batting order: “Oh, okay, he’s up at the plate.” I’m going with Domingo over Timothée Chalamet.', 'Best Supporting Actress', 'Zoe Saldaña was: “I know you’ve been here all these years.” Well, finally, we’re noticing it was the performance of the year. She carried “Emilia Pérez.”', '', 'Felicity Jones in a tough situation [arriving in the second half], made an impression [in “The Brutalist”]. After listening to Ariana Grande on Mark Maron and all the SNL stuff, I thought, “We’re going to see her again. She’s just a super talent.”', 'Best Supporting Actor', '[Edward Norton]. One of the best parts of [“A Complete Unknown”] was the anchoring of Pete Seeger. This crucial change that [Mangold] made is the scene where Dylan sings “The Song for Woody,” for Woody Guthrie and [Seeger] at the beginning, which is not when it happened, but it may as well have been. The look on those two men’s faces: “we are witnessing somebody being born.” It’s like in “Amadeus” when Salieri invites [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] to lunch and plays this piece of music, and then Amadeus plays it upside down and backwards after hearing it once: “Okay, this is the real deal.”', 'Best Adapted Screenplay', 'I voted for “Sing Sing.” [Greg Kwedar and Clint Bentley] told the story really well.', 'Best Original Screenplay', 'I voted for, oddly enough, the movie that should have been nominated for editing: “September 5.” The screenplay put together these real events and and juggled them around with what footage they had.', 'Best Cinematography', 'We are now in an age of special effects and cinematography being difficult to judge. The standards are so high, the ability of these artists to pull this stuff off. When you look at cinematography, Ed Lachman is such a serious artist. On “Maria,” he doesn’t just shoot a movie. He builds cameras to capture something.', '', 'In “Emilia Pérez,” the cinematography was so fluid, and the camera movements that go between the director and the DP carry you across those intense transitions to music. You can light scenes [with] LEDs, and you can change the color temperature of each light: they did that. Color temperature is now off the scale in terms of quality for everything we see.', 'I didn’t make it all the way through “Nosferatu.” I’ve seen this movie, having seen the silent versions and so forth. You know them all. It doesn’t mean the cinematography and the production design weren’t thrilling.', 'Best Costume Design', 'The “Wicked” costumes are gorgeous. Beyond that, if we’re talking about how to make a movie, the management skills on that movie, the size of that cast — I have made a few musicals, and I know what happens to costumes between takes, everyone gets sweated up, and you gotta change everything.', 'Best Documentary Feature', 'The documentary features are also worthy. “Black Box Diaries,” wow. But then I saw the chances creatively that they took with the story of Patrice Lumumba in [“Soundtrack for a Coup d’Etat”] and seeing those jazz artists and understanding how insidious contemporary colonialism is. But the disjunctive editing style threw [some people] off: they couldn’t follow it. In all this voting I’m voicing: “we should try new things.”', '', 'Best Editing', 'For the sheer effort, “Wicked.”', '“Anora” is a great study in character editing, helping those mood swings. The humor is how you cut the scenes. It’s there. Can you dig it out and yet still not lose the tension? [Mikey Madison] carries “Anora” without ruining the movie.', 'Best International Feature Film', 'So the international pictures, once again, they’re the best in show. They are the strength of world cinema. I said, “[‘Emilia Pérez’] is the one.” But then I saw “The Seed of the Sacred Fig.” When you think about making that movie in secret, about the commitment, and you live with what those people are going through… that knocked me out. “Flow” is amazing. I was thrilled.', 'Best Makeup and Hairstyling', '“The Substance,” because everyone comes out of the theater grossed out. That’s hard to do these days.', 'Best Production Design', 'I went with “Wicked,” because I saw in the bake-off the building of the train. So much detail, so much effort, so beautiful. The production design was suitably gaudy. The best thing about “Gladiator II” was Arthur Max’s production design.', 'Best Original Score', '“The Brutalist”', 'Best Original Song', '“El Mal” (“Emilia Pérez”)', 'Best Sound', 'They all work. They all are beautifully mixed. But “A Complete Unknown” beautifully integrated the songs. The art of making a musical bio is how you layer in the songs and the drama, and you can’t let the drama stop when the song finishes. That is the gift. The music editing was superb. We know and love these songs and through editing they were seamlessly integrated. Especially the non-Dylan songs for context. Nothing is more fun in the editing room than a needle drop that works!', '', 'Best Visual Effects', 'This was tough, because “Kingdom of the Planet of The Apes” is so convincing, and the eight performances are terrific. And “Alien: Romulus” is as good as those alien movies can get. But I’ve never seen anything like “Wicked,” so I went with that.', 'Best Documentary Short', 'The world is in such terrible shape right now, I could not bear to watch five more shorts about how terrible it is.', 'Best Live Action Short', 'It was really tough between “A Lien” and “The Last Ranger.” The problem with some of these things is you’re voting for the cause. I ended up voting for “The Last Ranger.”', 'Best Animated Feature, Shorts.', 'I didn’t watch them.', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

We promised to keep their identities confidential and their comments unfiltered. Now that voting has concluded, we will share a few of the no-longer-secret ballots with you. Below are the selections of Voter 1. You can also read the summary of secret Oscar Voter 1.', 'This is a more likable and approachable film than several of the choices. I really like Sean Baker‘s work, so I’m glad to see that he’s getting this recognition in both categories now. And then The Brutalist is a film that has a lot of power about the strength of the human spirit. The world that it took us through was also fascinating in the time period. Second place is The Brutalist. Third place is A Complete Unknown.', '', '', 'Another tough category, but one of the things that struck me about it was the craftsmanship. Sean really deserves the recognition for consistently delivering emotional connections in an understated fashion.', 'I know this is an interesting category now, and I was torn between Demi Moore and Mikey Madison. For Mikey, it was a real breakout performance, but I think I just have to be content that she has to be happy with the nomination. Demi has been one of the most visible actresses in the industry for many years with many important films. I think the role was very courageous because it’s saying, look, I’ve been part of this establishment and this movie is really tearing it apart and she goes all in on it and totally makes it work. I really feel comfortable, and, of course, she did make that great speech at the Golden Globes, too.', 'I think a lot of people were surprised by this film as I was that I first didn’t seem that interested in it. And then when I saw it I was blown away and was just totally drawn into the film completely. I have to attribute that to the acting, to Timothée Chalamet‘s performance. The world that they brought to life just felt very authentic to me.', 'I think she totally almost carried the film with her singing and the dancing, and her engagement was just so strong. Oh, she’s amazing. And then of course the other dramatic and and other other stuff that she does that’s in a movie that is very unconventional. I think she helped anchor it. My second choice there was Felicity Jones.', '', '', 'Culkin just takes a very difficult role and, and I think totally pulls the audience into it in terms of his roller coaster emotional ride. It shows the complexity of the character in a really good way. My second choice there was Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice because I think he totally played a monster. A lot of these categories are really hard this year.', 'I think that they were very courageous in translating that to the screen and should be recognized for that. It’s a really exceptional film, and I’d love to see it get some recognition at the Oscars for the creative chances they took with it.', 'That’s kind of a no-brainer. From the first frame, it’s so, so astounding and the epic story and the amount of time that he covers in the film is pretty amazing. Yet it’s still very, very, very powerful over the course of the film. It really sticks to you.', 'SIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions', '“ I think she totally almost carried the film with her singing and the dancing, and her engagement was just so strong.” Seriously, did this voter watch Wicked? I can’t believe so, for them to determine Zoe’s sing-talking was superior to Ariana’s musically comedic masterclass. I respect the recognition for Demi.', 'As I’ve been saying, the race is “I didn’t know Zoe could sing & dance” vs. “I didn’t know Ariana could act”. Both are misconceptions, but I’d say Zoe’s job was harder — especially since it was mostly in Spanish.', 'Zoe’s job wasn’t necessarily more difficult. Especially considering the high notes Ariana had to hit while singing live. And Ariana still outperformed her – putting aside the difficulties of the jobs, Ariana’s performance was undoubtedly more compelling.', 'Zoe’s singing and talking in Spanish shouldn’t be considered so difficult, especially because she’s saying she’s latina and speaks Spanish and even forgot how to speak English', 'Have you ever seen Kristen Chenowith’s version of Glinda? While Ariana Grande delivered an exceptional performance she was 100% copying Kristen Chenowith’s original Glinda. So if anyone delivered a “masterclass” and is truly deserving of the Oscar it’s Kristen Chenowith, not Ariana Grande.', 'Yes Nickel Boys! Demi!\nOne semi sane voice in an ocean of weirdness.', 'Demi Moore es la mejor actriz. Actualmente incontestable', 'Actuación incontestable, de otro nivel, por eso Demi Moore merece el Oscar.', 'Not sure why many voters and critics think The Brutalist is such a great film. It has its moments especially when Guy Pierce is on screen. I have to say Adrian Brody was good, but Ralph Fiennes and Timothy Chalamet are better. As for The Brutalist for Screenplay, this Oscar voter didn’t see the second half after the intermission. That’s when it fell apart and seemed, like it was looking for a way to end. Anora had a better original screenplay.', 'Voting for Demi for narrative rather than best performance is wrong.', 'She is by no means a great actress – not even above-average. Just because she has a compelling ‘narrative’ does not mean she is worthy of an Oscar. The nomination itself is a win.', 'I think Demi was great in The Substance and is deserving purely on that basis. But “she’s been in many important films”? Please. She was the worst part of the most important film she’s been in (A Few Good Men) and the rest have been good popcorn (Ghost, St. Elmos Fire) or middling-bad popcorn (the rest).

Below are the selections of Voter 1.', 'Let me start out here by acknowledging that I totally understand why some people will steer clear of supporting Emilia Pérez because of the offensive social media posts of its star from several years ago. But let me also add the obvious: it has nothing to do with the quality of the film, which to my mind is greater than its nine fellow nominees. You simply cannot watch this movie and not be bowled over by its cleverness and how distinctive and powerfully quirky it is. If the Academy Awards are about honoring originality — and to my mind, they should be — you can’t get much more original than this. There’s never been a movie even remotely like it before. Second place is Anora. Third place is Conclave.', 'More from GoldDerby', 'Who should play the next James Bond (and who could direct)?', ""Secret Oscar Voter 4: Ballot exposed with 'The Brutalist,' Sebastian Stan, Demi Moore"", 'When are the SAG Awards? Everything to know about the 2025 Screen Actors Guild Awards', 'For the longest time, I was going here with Sean Baker for Anora, but I didn’t like the way it ended. So I switched to Jacques. He put in such an amazing job on a film that had to be a bear to direct. There are so many stunning visuals, and presiding over this movie was really like handling two or three different styles in one: mob drama, musical, dark personality study. It’s so complex, and Jacques made it all appear seamless. A stunning job, really.', 'Mikey is such a find. I’d never heard of her before this movie. Had no idea who she was. And I’m sure I’m not alone. She was brilliant and versatile in Anora, totally self-possessed. It all comes across on the screen. I loved the scope of her work. There are so man y scenes I could cite, like the one where they try to take away her ring and she just screams and screams. Screaming like that takes talent. I’m serious.”', 'I was almost going to go with Sebastian Stan here for The Apprentice, who got better and better as that film went along. But I ultimately decided on Colman. because he’s so commanding, who not only gives a dynamic performance but is a classy and exceptional human being who deserves to be recognized. He’s very strong, just riveting, really. I loved Clarence Maclin, too, though he wasn’t nominated. The acting was the best thing about the movie, in my opinion.', 'I mean, come on, Zoe was really the star of this film. I felt that she had much more presence than Karla Sofía Gascón. She’s so fiery and charismatic in this role, and I didn’t see anyone else who’s nominated in this category whose performance approached Zoe’s. I loved her. She’s riveting. The camera loved her. Her performance works on so many levels. If there’s a second place, I’d say Ariana Grande for Wicked.', 'Jeremy may be the strongest contender in all the Oscars. He was just so good playing scary Roy Cohn. I’m just in love with him after seeing him in The Apprentice. You totally believe his performance. He had the mannerisms down, the voice, everything. I mean, it’s such a strong category. Edward Norton was amazing in A Complete Unknown, too. But for my money it’s just got to be Jeremy.', 'So from what I understand, it’s based on a novel, but it feels wildly original. Emilia is just so unique that it deserves points for that boldness, for being so different from every other film that’s come before. You have to applaud that creativity, and I am by voting for it. You can’t let the comments of one stupid actress ruin it for the rest of the nominations.', 'I know it’s a longshot for September 5 to win, but it truly deserves to. It’s a vastly underappreciated movie, with heart-pumping drama and great acting. And that screenplay spells it all out. I loved the machinations of the newsroom and the interaction, and it’s so quaint in a lot of ways because it’s all pre-technology.
