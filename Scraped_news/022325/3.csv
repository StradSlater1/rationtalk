'I survived Trump’s MAGA-con at CPAC and it was the weirdest event I’ve ever seen',https://www.themirror.com/news/politics/i-survived-trumps-maga-con-992038,"['Do you know the Taylor Swift song ""Red""? That is honestly what first comes to mind when I think about the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference, where Republican big shots and the common folk rub shoulders and spread ideas.', ""Like last year, the conference was held at the Gaylord Hotel and Convention Center, which overnight, became one of the safest places to be. My time at the political conference began late Wednesday afternoon as I made my way through the blistering cold ( a common theme whenever I seem to visit the nation's capital ) to secure my media credential."", ""Upon my arrival, I was directed to the lower level where I almost walked smack into My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell who was making a dash from fans all clamoring to get a photo with him. Knowing that I wanted to chat with him once the conference got underway, I attempted to ingratiate myself by letting him take the escalator ahead of me, little did I know, that this would come back to haunt me as I would spend two days chasing him around and trying to interview him before cornering him on the expo hall's floor."", 'It was then that I took a trip down memory lane and waited in what felt like the longest line ever known to man, though thankfully this time I was indoors and it was not 5:30 in the morning. As MAGA fanatics and media pundits mingled or looked on their phones, I struck up a conversation with the boy standing next to me.', 'As it turns out, the boy was none other than Roger Stone\'s ""adoptive"" nephew, Alex Stone. Despite having no relation to the former 2016 Trump campaign advisor, the boy proclaimed that he was very close to the man who would often send him to conservative events in his name.', ""After about an hour and a half, we finally started to move. It was reported to us by someone further up that the organizers had accidentally uploaded all of last year's media people which caused all but one of the computers to crash. After securing my pass, I went back to my hotel to get a good night's sleep before the next day's events."", ""Early the next day, I found myself once again in a long line of Trump supporters all gabbling excitedly about the day's events. After getting through the Secret Service screening, I managed to secure a rather decent spot in the main ballroom's press section. After two hours and recitation of the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance — something I have not done since high school — CPAC organizers Mercedes and her husband Mark Schlapp took the stage to welcome the crowd and vice-president JD Vance who kicked off the event."", ""After Vance's interview, the rest of the day was a blur. Running back and forth, up and down asking various attendees their opinion on Trump's latest stances or how they feel about the latest executive order. As I was running about, something that continuously surprised me was how friendly everyone was and, if engaged in conversation, would address the person by their name."", 'One such occurrence was when I stopped a woman, who was in her mid-60s, to ask her a question and she said ""It\'s nice to meet you, Jack, sadly I would prefer not to speak to any media."" While saddened I wouldn\'t have a quote from her, I was truly impressed about how polite she had been.', 'Day two of the conference was just like day one. Running hither and thither, asking people for comments. At one point, I decided to attend a church service which turned out not to be as interesting as I thought a Republican church service would be. However on this day either due to the sheer amount of people there or due to the placement of the ballroom, the internet seemed to not be working ( a massive headache if your job, like mine needs it).', 'At one point, I was standing in line for the bathroom when Alex Stone approached me and revealed that, in all the years he had been attending the conference, this was the most boring one to date. ""This year is just a lot of really wealthy people,"" he said. The comment opened my eyes to the fact that there were a lot more of the upper-middle class than the people who attended Trump\'s inauguration rally in January.', 'It of course would not be Jack Hobbs attending a political event if I did not get in the way of at least one VIP. That came in the form of former British Prime Minister Liz Truss who was speaking at the conference. Our fleeting encounter came as she was trotting down the halls and I was coming the opposite way. By the time I had registered who she was, her security brushed me aside without any issues.', 'Of course, I couldn\'t limit myself to just one interaction. Later in the day as I was attempting to chase down DOGE head Elon Musk, I spotted Dean Cain doing an interview and halted my brisk walk for a chance to chat with the former superman. Alas, to my greatest disappointment, I was told ""Mr. Cain will not be taking questions at the time,"" by a member of the former Hollywood star\'s security detail who gave me a look which basically said ""Move, or I will do it myself.', 'With the remainder passing without anything or anyone of note, The third and final day of CPAC arrived, and with it, a sense of excitement as it was that Trump himself would take the CPAC stage. When I arrived the next morning I was greeted by a burly Secret Service agent who efficiently directed everyone through the security line.', 'The third and final day of CPAC started off quiet indeed. None of the stalls were manned and none of the merchandise setups down in the expo hall sold merchandise. However as the day went on, more people arrived, clothed in their MAGA best, and the people waited anxiously for their leader.', 'Finally, around 2:30 p.m. and to a rousing chorus of ""Proud to Be an American,"" Trump finally took the stage while doing his little dance to cheers and applause. After several minutes of shouts and cheers, the man began to tout his achievements while occasionally being interrupted by the occasional ""I love you, Donald"" or ""Daddy\'s Home!""', ""After talking for nearly an hour and a half, Trump signed off and the ballroom shook to the opening note of ... you guessed it ... The Villiage People's Y.M.C.A. — a song I never wanted to hear again after my previous D.C. trip."", 'DAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.', '', 'At Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

‘The deification of Trump will be complete’ at CPAC 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-cpac-conference,"['The conservative conference, dismissed as ‘an extremist freak show’, has been revived under the president’s hand', '“I am your retribution.”', 'When Donald Trump made this solemn promise to his supporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) two years ago, millions of Americans felt comfortable looking the other way.', 'After all, opinion polls suggested that Trump was a spent force in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, disappointing midterm elections and a lacklustre start to his US presidential election campaign. He was the closing act of a CPAC that critics dismissed as a fringe freak show with obscure speakers addressing a half-empty ballroom.', 'It won’t feel like that this time. CPAC 2025 kicks off at the National Harbor in Maryland on Wednesday with Trump set to return in triumph after regaining the White House and with Republican allies in control of Congress. The conference will be a vivid demonstration of how his “Make America great again” (Maga) movement has gone from the margins to the mainstream.', '“CPAC always been the the ideological north star for the conservative grassroots movement,” said Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill who used to regularly attend the conference. “Unless you weren’t paying attention, CPAC was the roadmap for what Maga becoming mainstream would look like and what they wanted to accomplish.”', 'The history of CPAC mirrors the recent history of the Republican party. It began in 1974 in the throes of the Watergate scandal and the birth of a new conservative movement. The first CPAC was addressed by Ronald Reagan, then governor of California and destined for the White House. An annual dinner is still held in Reagan’s honour.', 'The event spent years in the wilderness during Barack Obama’s presidency: the further its voices were from power, the louder they shouted. Among the speakers in 2011 was a businessman, TV celebrity and former Democrat from New York named Donald Trump, airing a grievance that America was being ripped off by China.', 'In 2015, CPAC heard from nearly all the major Republican presidential candidates, including Trump and Jeb Bush, but a year later Trump cancelled his planned appearance amid fears that he would be booed by protesters. It did not prevent his hostile takeover of the Republican party by winning both the nomination and the presidency.', 'CPAC impresario Matt Schlapp, a veteran of the George W Bush White House, then made a big bet on Trump as the future. The conference went all-in for Maga, casting Trump as a messianic figure saving America from illegal immigration and woke culture. His 2020 election defeat and the January 6 riot made no difference. A dedicated marketplace inside the event continued to sell Maga merchandise.', 'At last year’s event, as he closed in on the Republican nomination again, Trump described himself as a “proud political dissident” and his myriad legal troubles as “Stalinist show trials” orchestrated by then president Joe Biden. He promised the election would be “liberation day” for his supporters but “judgment day” for perceived enemies who had weaponised the government against him.', 'The old Republican party, meanwhile, was left far behind. Trump has used CPAC to attack its establishment figures as “freaks, neocons, globalists, open border zealots, and fools”. Out are Liz Cheney, Mitch McConnell and Mike Pence; in are far-right nationalists such as Steve Bannon from the US, Viktor Orbán from Hungary and Nigel Farage from Britain.', 'The lineup of speakers announced so far this year includes both Bannon and Farage along with the border czar, Tom Homan; the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, the US ambassador-designate to the United Nations, Elise Stefanik; senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida; the rightwing media personality Megyn Kelly; Mike Lindell, the MyPillow founder; the Argentinian president, Javier Milei; and the British ex-prime minister Liz Truss.', 'CPAC did not respond to an email asking whether this year’s conference will also include Elon Musk, the tech oligarch appointed by Trump to shrink the federal government, or individuals recently pardoned by the president for taking part in the January 6 insurrection.', 'But nothing will top the expected appearance by Trump himself after what has been billed as the greatest political comeback in history. His early efforts to crush illegal immigration, transgender rights and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes are sure to receive ecstatic cheers. His claim that, in surviving an assassination attempt, he was “saved by God to make America great again” will be embraced with religious fervour.', 'Setmayer, who now leads the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, commented: “The deification of Trump will be complete ad nauseam at CPAC this year. We’ve already seen a golden calf-like statue of him. I’m not quite sure what’s next, but they’ll figure it out.”', 'One potential measure of CPAC’s devotion to Trump will be its annual straw poll, which asks attendees to state their preference for the next Republican presidential nominee. Senator Rand Paul topped the poll in 2013, 2014 and 2015 while Ted Cruz prevailed in 2016 with 40% of the vote, ahead of Marco Rubio at 30% and Trump at 15%.', 'Trump has dominated ever since. He is constitutionally barred from running for a third term but has repeatedly hinted that he might try. Congressman Andy Ogles has even introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow Trump to run again. Setmayer believes that next week’s CPAC straw poll will include him – and he will win it again.', '“They absolutely will do it again and Trump will overwhelmingly win at North Korea-style numbers and he will continue to talk about a third term,” she said. “This is not a joke. He has been talking about this since his first term. He talked about it during the election in ‘jest’ and he’s been talking about it already three weeks into his new term. We need to pay attention to what they are doing concerning our elections.”', 'Trump’s resurrection is a boost for CPAC, which has survived scandals of its own. Schlapp was hit by allegations that he groped a Republican operative’s genitals when the two men were alone in a car after a campaign event in Georgia in 2022. Carlton Huffman’s lawsuit was dropped last year after a reported $480,000 settlement.', 'Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, observed: “They never got him. He was so close. Of course in this day and time nothing matters. Trump has made anything possible.”', 'In recent years Schlapp has sought to ride the nationalist-populist wave by staging CPAC events in Hungary and Argentina. Next week’s return to the National Harbor in Maryland will feel like vindication for a movement that just a few years ago seemed to be heading off a cliff to irrelevance. Now CPAC believes it represents the new political orthodoxy.', 'Steve Schmidt, a political strategist and former campaign operative for George W Bush and John McCain, said: “This is an extremist freak show that retains that quality but has taken political power in the United States. By any reasonable definition, what you’re looking at is a gathering of fascists, political extremists coming together, a fusion of the youth arm, the Christian nationalist arm, the Catholic Maga extremist arm.”', 'Schmidt added: “It is an event that portends what’s coming. These people have immense power. This should all be taken literally and seriously. Millions and millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump should appreciate that this is what they purchased and what they purchased is now emboldened. There will be a very pungent nationalism present – and extremism lurking below the surface.”']"

He insisted of Republicans, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe ever.”', '“Nobody\'s ever seen anything like this,"" Trump said, likening his new administration\'s opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf — which he said gives him confidence for the fifth hole.', 'Trump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire suggested Saturday that more might be coming.', '“Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”', 'Later, an “HR” email was sent to federal workers across numerous agencies titled “What did you do last week” and asking that recipients “reply with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.” It cautioned against sending classified information, and gave a deadline of Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET.', ""Trump also said during the speech that he'd carry out harsher immigration policies. But those efforts have so far largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one entity with a workforce that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials."", '“The agency’s name has been removed from its former building,” he said.', ""The president also repeated his previous promises to scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox."", '“Would anybody like to join us?” he asked to cheers from the crowd at the suggestion that administration forces might converge on the complex. “We want to see if the gold is still there.”', ""But Trump also devoted large chunks of his address to reliving last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent — gleefully proclaiming, “I haven’t said that name in a while.”"", 'He went on to use an expletive to describe Biden’s handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language.', 'Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “I happen to like” him, while saying, “we’ve been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.”', 'On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia’s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and another atendee, Argentine President Javier Milei.', 'Trump called Duda “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine” and said “you must be doing something right, hanging out with Trump."" He noted that Milei was “a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.""', 'Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine.', 'Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. Trump is meeting on Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.', 'Trump also has begun a public tiff with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a “dictator” while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday Trump acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor.', 'Trump told the CPAC crowd, “I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy. I’m dealing with President Putin” and added of fighting in Ukraine, ""It affects Europe. It doesn’t really affect us.”', 'Zelenskyy has said Trump is living in a Russian-made “disinformation space.”', ""For much of the time since Russia invaded in February 2022, the United States, under Biden, pledged that Ukraine would play in any major effort to end the fighting, vowing “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” Trump's administration has dispensed with that notion, as the Republican president has accelerated his push to find an endgame to the war."", '“I think we’re pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal,” Trump said Saturday.', 'White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt subsequently told reporters that Trump and his team were focused on negotiations to end the war and “the President is very confident we can get it done this week,” though such a tight timeline seems difficult.', 'Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds.', 'The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose.

Read it now.', 'In this article:', 'NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — On Thursday morning, Steve Bannon hosted his War Room podcast live from the Conservative Political Action Conference, with a special prop. A screen behind him showed live footage from the Senate floor, where Trump loyalist and frequent CPAC star Kash Patel was about to be confirmed to lead the FBI. Much less interesting, for the crowd gathered around Bannon in CPAC’s exhibit hall: Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell taking the floor to announce his retirement.', '“McConnell and his cartel of consultants had a complete monopoly on the funding of Senate races, and they’ve lost more swing races than they’ve won,” said Caroline Wren, a GOP strategist who worked with 2024 Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake. “What’s his legacy? I don’t think anyone gives a shit.”', 'CPAC’s transformation into a pro-Trump convention happened many years ago, changing what had been a messy meeting between Republican factions – libertarians and conservatives, war hawks and isolationists – into a celebration of America First nationalism. McConnell stopped coming to the conference after winning a Senate majority in 2014. His major triumphs, of blocking a 2016 Obama appointment to the Supreme Court and speed-running a 2020 Trump appointment, were very old news.', 'What was new, and exciting for this year’s attendees, was the Trump administration’s rapid deconstruction of the administrative state, a goal older than the 51-year conference. Even more thrilling was the idea of exporting this around the world. Elon Musk, handed a chainsaw by Argentina President Javier Milei, was praised by Republican leaders and foreign politicians for both slashing the government and turning Twitter into a “free speech” hub where liberal media outlets barely mattered.', '“We want a Trump revolution in Britain,” said former British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who lost her seat in the 2024 Labour landslide and has spent her free time meeting MAGA conservatives. “We want Elon and his nerd army of Musk rats examining the British deep state.”', 'There was massive applause for a mention of Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he warned Europeans against mass immigration “commissars” censoring free speech. (“I’ll take a standing ovation for a speech I gave already,” Vance joked.)', 'When McConnell was mentioned at all — or when his priority of support for Ukraine was mentioned — it was as a punchline. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was grateful that McConnell had voted to confirm Patel, and praised Trump for trying to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine on terms that were unpopular in Europe.', '“Remember, he wrote The Art of the Deal,” said Johnson. Asked by his Newsmax interviewer whether there might be another Ukraine funding package, he scoffed.', '“I think there’s no appetite for that!” he said, over a chorus of boos.', '', 'I’ve covered most CPACs since 2006, skipping a few only when the schedule didn’t work at all. The candidates who used to shell out thousands of dollars to win the presidential straw polls are gone; the foreign right-wing politicians who used to walk around as unknowns are now major stars.', 'The mood this year — intentionally so, as CPAC has spent a lot of time and money building conferences around the world — was jubilation at the world turned rightside up.

What began in 1974 with a keynote speech by then-Governor of California Ronald Reagan has transformed into the most prominent gathering of fascists on an international scale.', 'Donald Trump is slated to give the keynote speech on Saturday. Prior to Trump, the world’s richest fascist Elon Musk, Vice President JD Vance and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson took the stage to hail their leader and repeat “Great Replacement Theory” talking points.', 'In his remarks, JD Vance reiterated comments he made at the Munich Security Conference that the “greatest threats” facing the “leaders of the West” was “millions and millions of unvetted foreign migrants ... that is the biggest threat to Europe and frankly remains the biggest threat to the United States, because yes, we have four years of President Trump’s leadership, but I guarantee you, if the Democrats ever get power again, they are going to try and do it again.”', 'In a bizarre performance, Musk appeared on stage with a chainsaw handed to him by Argentinian President Javier Milei. Wielding the chainsaw above his head while wearing all black clothing, large sunglasses and a black hat that featured “Make America Great Again” in a Gothic font, Musk bellowed, “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. Chainsaw!”', 'Musk was interviewed for roughly 30 minutes, in the course of which he praised his “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), new FBI Director Kash Patel and President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele.\n\nHe spent the rest of his time on stage railing against immigrants and repeating neo-Nazi talking points that have animated several mass shootings in recent years. Musk said, “I think it is really important for people to understand that the Biden administration sent any possible money that they could send, if there was money they could send to facilitate and amplify illegal immigration, they sent it.”\n\nAsked if he thought the Democrats were trying to “build a new voter class,” Musk responded, “Yes,” and added:', 'You don’t actually have to assume some grand conspiracy, you just need to look at basic incentives. Fundamentally, the probability that an illegal is going to vote Democrat at some point, whether it’s cheating, but eventually they become citizens—probability, probably, like 80 or 90 percent.', 'Then the incentive is to maximize the number of illegals in the country. That is why the Biden administration was pushing to get in as many illegals as possible and spend every dollar possible... because every one of them is a customer. Every one is a voter. So the whole thing is a giant voter importation scam.', 'Musk said it was “treasonous” and a “real scam to tilt the scale of democracy.”', 'In addition to Musk, this year’s event has featured several high-level Republicans and Trump administration officials, including his National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to Trump.', 'Congressional Republicans in attendance included the aforementioned Johnson, as well as Florida Representative Byron Donalds and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. International attendees at this year’s event included Nigel Farage of Britain’s Reform Party and Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico. Both men hailed Trump and his war on immigrants. In his comments, Fico pledged to enshrine in the Slovakian Constitution the definition of marriage as between “a man and a woman.”\n\nEmboldened by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, two speakers so far at this year’s event have given Sieg Heil Nazi salutes during their speeches.', 'On Friday, after announcing his intention to join Musk and Trump’s fascist movement, Mexican actor Eduardo Verástegui delivered a Nazi salute.', 'After the salute, he railed against “socialism,” which, he said, “makes a majority of the population very poor. These people love poverty and they multiply. ... Socialism is a cancer, it destroys everything it touches. ... If we do not act soon, it will be too late.”', 'Verástegui called for Trump to run for president again in 2028, a violation of the US constitutional two-term presidential limit, and announced that he would be building a new conservative party to “free Mexico from socialism, communism, the radical left, woke ideology and the corrupt globalists,” drawing laughter and applause from those in attendance.', 'On Thursday, former Trump White House adviser and current host of the War Room podcast, Steve Bannon, delivered his own Nazi salute at the conclusion of his speech.', 'Prior to the Sieg Heil, Bannon declared that the 2020 election had been stolen and that the “J6ers”—formerly imprisoned Trump insurrectionists— “are here at CPAC. All of them.”', 'Bannon said, “The reason the J6ers are here and they are patriots is because that was a fedsurrection, totally set up by the FBI, by the Justice Department, all of them.” Bannon referred to Trump’s enemies as “demonic” and called Trump “an instrument of divine providence.”', 'Backing Trump’s dictatorial ambitions, Bannon said, “The future of America is MAGA.

We want Trump in ‘28!”', 'Stoking up the Republican faithful in attendance before delivering his fascist salute, Bannon screamed, “Are you prepared to fight? … Are you prepared to fight for Trump? … Fight! Fight! Fight!”', 'Bannon’s Nazi salute was so obvious that Jordan Bardella, president of the French neo-fascist National Rally, felt compelled to distance himself from this year’s gathering and cancelled his planned speech. In a statement to the French news agency Agence France-Presse, Bardella wrote:', 'In this gallery, when I was not present in the room, one of the speakers allowed himself, by provocation, a gesture referring to the Nazi ideology. Therefore, I took the immediate decision to cancel my scheduled speech this afternoon at the event.', 'Asked Friday to comment on Bardella’s action, Bannon hissed to a French reporter, “I want to be quoted. He’s a little boy, not a man, and only men or women of strength can lead France.”\n\nIn his speech, which was warmly received, Republican operative and neo-Nazi Jack Posobiec declared, “Donald Trump is the living embodiment of the American Constitution.”\n\nLike other speakers, Posobiec praised the confirmation of Kash Patel, saying:', 'We are going to be going after the real criminals, we are going to go after the pedophiles, we are going to go after the traffickers, we are going to go after the illegals, we are going to go after the cartels, we are going to go after the foreign agents in this country, and, yes, that includes the foreign agents that are working and have penetrated the United States government and the United States Congress.', 'Posobiec said that Trump’s election victory, in which he failed to receive a majority of the vote, was a “mandate” that the “American people put on his head. And as President Trump said just a few days ago, ‘A man who saves his nation violates no law.’”', 'In addition to a number of speakers, at least one group at the conference, the “Third Term Project”—which was given media passes by CPAC—was actively lobbying for an unconstitutional third Trump term.\n\nIn an interview with independent journalist Ford Fischer, Shane Trejo of “Third Term Project” said Trump needed another term to fight against the “forces of evil.”', 'Asked about his group portraying Trump in the image of Julius Ceasar, Trejo responded:', 'Well, we believe that Trump is the Caesar figure that America has needed. Trump is the Napoleonic figure that’s emerged to lead our country out of perdition and into greatness.', 'The fascist hysteria that dominated the conference is a reflection of the crisis character of the dictatorial Trump regime, a function of the desperate economic, social, geo-political and political crises of American capitalism. The fascist scum who populate CPAC are petrified over the coming eruption of class conflict in America, the initial signs of which are already emerging in the form of protests by thousands of federal workers against mass layoffs and protests across the country against Trump’s attacks on immigrants.', 'They know they have nothing to fear from the Democratic Party and the trade union bureaucracy, but they sense that to defeat the working class only a fascist dictatorship will suffice.', 'The IWA-RFC calls for mass action to stop the Trump administration’s purge of federal workers by Elon Musk’s DOGE, an unprecedented attack on the working class that, if unchecked, will have catastrophic consequences for all workers.', 'The unprecedented firing of a half-dozen top generals and admirals is aimed at ensuring military obedience to unconstitutional and dictatorial orders.', 'Trump’s federal job cuts threaten Native education and tribal sovereignty, slashing jobs at universities and crippling the administration of essential federal Native-serving programs.', 'These parties have reacted with glee to Donald Trump’s election as US president, recognising that they now have an extremely powerful ally across the Atlantic with whom they can press a reactionary agenda already substantially adopted by European governments.', '']"

Defeat meant ruin, disgrace and prison. Victory meant what Trump’s cheerleaders like to call the greatest comeback in political history. It also meant vengeance against his perceived tormentors in the justice department, Democratic party and media. As the martyr of Mar-a-Lago put it at CPAC two years ago: “I am your retribution.”', 'The message he took from that win over Kamala Harris was that he had broken his opponents, broken the checks and balances and broken reality itself.

When he was out of power, his freewheeling speeches could be dismissed as the ravings – or “weavings” – of a madman. Even during his first term, his extremist rhetoric came with some expectation that the democratic guardrails would hold.', 'But as America and the world have discovered during his first month back in the White House, Trump is unbound, unhinged and looking for blood. He took the stage at CPAC brimming with confidence and basking in chants of: “USA! USA!”', 'The 78-year-old Florida resident describes his presidency as a game of golf in which he can match Arnold Palmer all the way: “If you golf, when you sink that first four-footer at the first hole, it gives you confidence, and then the next hole you sink another and now you go on to that third hole and by the time you get to the fifth hole you feel you can’t miss.”', 'To be here was to live in a world turned upside down.

We took away their confidence … and we took back our country.”', 'Trump should in fact have won by a bigger margin, he claimed without evidence, but Democrats “cheated like hell” only to find his victory was “too big to rig”. Later, he revisited his 2020 loss, too, assuring conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell that “now it’s OK” to say the election was “rigged”.', 'The president bragged about pardoning hundreds convicted of crimes in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, describing them as “political prisoners” and “J6 hostages”. Some of them were in the room, chanting “J6! J6!” and shouting “Thank you!”. They have gone from prison cells to being CPAC’s newest celebrities.', 'Trump also boasted about killing diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, denying the identity of transgender people, yanking the US out of the Paris climate agreement and sending undocumented immigrants (“monsters”) to Guantánamo Bay. He hailed Elon Musk’s evisceration of the federal government, including the international aid agency USAid.', 'Each time, the crowd cheered.', 'Up until then, CPAC had felt toned down this year, with few if any chants of “Lock her up!” or T-shirts portraying Joe Biden as Satan. After all, Republicans won and there is no obvious Democratic leader to target. Still, that did not prevent Trump unleashing the usual insults and lies at his opponents.', '“Kamala,” he said, eliciting boos. “I haven’t heard that name in a while. Nobody ever knows her last name ... But think of it, I was beating Joe badly and they changed him. Think of it, I’m the only one who had to beat two people.”', 'The Biden presidency already feels like a millennium ago but Trump did not want his audience to forget, asking whether they preferred the nickname “Crooked Joe” or “Sleepy Joe”. For the record, “Crooked Joe” won.', 'Trump mocked Biden’s golf handicap and bathing suit and offered a baseless opinion: “He was a sleepy, crooked guy. Terrible, terrible president. He was the worst president in the history of our country ... Every single thing he touched turned to shit.”', 'Such magnanimity!', 'He took aim at the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren over her past claims of Native American ancestry, recycling the “Pocahontas” nickname he once gave her and jibing: “She does not like me. She’s a very angry person. You notice the way she is? She’s always screaming. She’s crazy.”', 'And don’t get Trump started on liberal TV host Rachel Maddow: “I watch this MSNBC – which is a threat to democracy, actually – they’re stone-cold mean. But they’re stuttering. They’re all screwed up. They’re all mentally screwed up. They don’t know what – their ratings have gone down the tubes. I don’t even talk about CNN, CNN’s sort of like, I don’t know, they’re pathetic, actually.', '“This Rachel Maddow, what does she have? She’s got nothing. Nothing.

CPAC 2025: CONSERVATIVE ELITES CELEBRATE TRUMP AS AMERICA SELF-IMMOLATES,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/cpac-2025-trump-conservative-elites-celebrate-1235276778/,"['By ASAWIN SUEBSAENG', 'NATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland — As the Beatles’ lyric goes: “Everybody had a hard year. Everybody had a good time. Everybody had a wet dream. Everybody saw the sunshine.”', 'The 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference held this week just outside of Washington, D.C., was exactly like that, if you’re someone who orgasms whenever they have nightmares filled with sounds of fascist shrieking. ', 'Between Wednesday and Saturday, the American Conservative Union held its annual CPAC at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, a marquee gathering of conservative diehards and voters, Republican activists and operatives, and high-ranking GOP elected officials and appointees. Since 2017, the annual summit has grown thoroughly MAGAfied and run as a multi-day, boozy adulation-fest of Donald Trump and his nativist personality cult. ', 'But CPAC 2025 is the first one held since Trump retook power in the 2024 presidential election — as a twice-impeached, repeatedly indicted, convicted felon, who won on a policy platform that was somehow more openly authoritarian than in his previous campaigns. It’sthe first CPAC since the failed assassination attempts on the 45th and now 47th president of the United States. It is the first one since Trump scored not just a swing-state victory against Vice President Kamala Harris, but beat her in the popular vote, sending the Democratic Party back into the bitter cold as a humiliated opposition.', '', 'When Trump hit the stage, there was willful triumph, and there were also hints of several of the bleakest horrors likely to come.', '“Somethin’s wrong,” the president told the CPAC audience — including the pardoned Jan. 6 Capitol attack defendants who hung out near the press area, cheering on Trump — on Saturday.', 'The president was talking about the rate of babies being diagnosed with autism. He assured the attendees that his Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., would get to the bottom of it. “Bobby’s gonna find it,” Trump said. (Some of RFK Jr.’s policy views — on autism, vaccines, and other health issues — have long been so extreme and dangerous that Trump’s own former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb has publicly warned that if RFK Jr. gets his way, it will get Americans killed.)', '', 'The rest of Trump’s speech was largely garden-variety rambling and boasting. But to offer you a taste: Trump knocked the “stuttering” and “mentally screwed-up” media personalities on MSNBC, which he trollishly labeled a “threat to democracy,” a term that is accurately leveled at him, including by hosts and journalists on the liberal cable news network. “I should go against her in the ratings,” he said of MSNBC star Rachel Maddow. Trump later pivoted to mocking his vanquished predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as a “sleepy, crooked guy,” saying that “every single thing he touched turned to shit.” That naughtier line led to a cascade of whistles, cheers, claps, and some “WE LOVE YOU” shouts from the gathering.', 'The president added that Biden was such a historically lousy president that former President Jimmy Carter died a “happy man” — apparently suggesting that Carter could pass away knowing that Biden was worse than he was. (Carter said last summer he was hoping to survive long enough “to vote for Kamala Harris,” and got his wish.)', 'Trump received perhaps his greatest standing ovation and round of applause of the day when he bragged about pardoning all of those “political prisoners” — meaning, the violent rioters and others he inspired to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington four years ago, when Trump spent months trying to steal an election he had lost.', '', 'Love it or loathe it, the MAGA movement — and Kennedy’s MAHA movement — won. Boy, did they really, really win. Right now, the country is theirs. At this year’s CPAC, they had a lot to brag about, many footballs to spike, and Gulf Of Mexico-sized oceans of liberal tears in which to gleefully doggy-paddle.', 'And yet, the 2025 CPAC possessed a palpable undercurrent of the old saying: “There are only two tragedies in life — one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.”', 'It wasn’t just this “biased” Rolling Stone reporter — who has been going to these increasingly godless, blood-spitting summits since “Steve Stockman’s Awesome Hot Tub Party” was a horrifying thing that was permitted to occur — feeling this way. Numerous Republican perennial attendees, right-wing media figures, longtime conservative operatives, and even some of the CPAC 2025 speakers conceded to Rolling Stone on Friday and Saturday that the conference just wasn’t as much fun as it used to be. The booze still flowed this week, but the nightlife wasn’t as vast or as memorably decadent as it once was, particularly in the glory days when their Great Satan (President Barack Obama) was in office.', 'But life goes on. MAGA celebs and donors still threw on their suits and tuxedos for the annual Ronald Reagan Dinner, and attendees and Trump allies still flooded the Gaylord National lobby bar after-hours, to carouse and network against the background noise of a portable stereo cranking out “Like a Virgin,” “Party in the U.S.A.,” and — mother of Christ — Trump’s theme song since the 2020 campaign, “Y.M.C.A.”', '', 'Yes, several MAGA fans were observed spontaneously doing their own versions of Trump’s hand-jerk shimmy-dance to the famous Village People anthem, mid-bar. This is how we live now.', 'But something to keep in mind about CPAC is that more than anything else, it is an annual mass-assembly of the hysterical stereotype of the upper-middle-class, Fox News and Newsmax TV-binging elderly aunt and uncle, with hundreds of these aunts and uncles all gathered in the same ballroom. In between the main-stage Q&A’s and star speakers — senior Trump aide Stephen Miller was on to rail against “illegal aliens” again! Our nation’s prime minister, Elon Musk, is playing with a chainsaw prop! Trump’s “Border Czar” Tom Homan is here to talk about his immigration crackdown, and doesn’t care if he offends anyone!( President Trump finally showed up! Former Fox News personality Megyn Kelly is up there unloading on Blake Lively for some reason! — the CPAC organizers play an awful lot of filler on the Gaylord hotel ballroom’s big screens.', 'These videos typically feature footage from Fox News and other Trump-friendly media outlets, advertisements for this or that reactionary entity or product, promotions of Christian-right causes, denunciations of Trump’s nemeses, and exuberant celebrations of The Donald himself. (This is, of course, when CPAC staff aren’t pumping intermission music, such as “Hot Stuff” by Donna Summer, into the venue.)', 'To attend or cover CPAC as somebody who isn’t squarely in the tank for Trumpism is akin to spending several days sitting in the collective living room of the most comfortable, frantically aggrieved parts of Trump’s base, trapped watching and listening to them yell and howl in unison at a large television set.', 'The annual ritual straddles the thin line between laughable and perverse, and it only feels harder to laugh off when it is performed during a time when Trump, Musk (the richest person on the planet), and their lieutenants are doing everything they can to birth a new era of constitutional crisis, clampdowns, rampant bigotry, mindless chaos, oligarchic corruption, lawlessness, international embarrassment, and democratic backsliding.', 'There used to be moments of dark humor in events like these. There was nothing funny about watching Trump’s “border czar” whip the room into a giddy frenzy at the thought of loading planes with migrants and flying them to Gitmo — an actual second Trump administration policy that a few years ago would have sounded like a lazy parody or caricature of Trumpist depravity.', 'But running parallel to the weekend’s banal terror was the pulsating, ever-present bonanza of cultural grievance, aimed by an entire political party and movement not just at the poor and vulnerable, but at the lamest targets imaginable.', 'During the entire span of CPAC 2025, Trump’s speech wasn’t even the most accurate summation of the petty, petulant heart of the MAGA elite. ', '', 'It was Megyn Kelly’s.', 'Around 4 p.m. ET on Friday, Kelly embarked on an extended riff on actress Blake Lively.', '“Poor Blake Lively,” Kelly said, in a wah-wah-wah voice of mockery.', 'This part of the speech went on seemingly forever. This was not a tangent or fleeting gripe. The former Fox News marquee-name went long on what amounted to a gratuitously nasty Wikipedia edit of the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni controversy.', 'Kelly characterized Lively as a “brat” and a “bully” who was picking on the “very effeminate”-looking Baldoni. She told the CPACers that she believes the reason some “conservatives are so interested in this” Hollywood saga and legal dispute is because they see her as an “avatar for leftist overreach.” She claimed that the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and Musk have been throttling and terrorizing, is playing the “victim,” which she argued was “just like Blake Lively.”', 'This went on for a while, and it was unclear if most of her audience knew what she was talking about.', 'But in essence, this is exactly what the MAGA political phenomenon is about: Trump and his fellow elites vomiting their own grievances and celebrity obsessions onto a crowd, hoping they lap it up in a highly destructive, apocalyptic form of group-therapy.', 'On Saturday, not even Mr. Trump could top that.', 'We want to hear it.

He also boasted that his administration had terminated temporary protected status for Haitian immigrants and attempted to ban birthright citizenship for children of non-legal permanent residents.', '“We’ve begun the largest deportation operation in American history,” Trump said.', 'In one of several digressions, Trump portrayed his return to office as a victory over what he called a “sinister group of radical informers, war-mongers and corrupt special interests” whom he claimed had previously controlled Washington. The president reserved particular ire for media outlets, labeling MSNBC a “threat to democracy” and mocking Rachel Maddow, whose show is watched by more than 2 million viewers, for what he claimed were her low ratings.', 'He also claimed Democrats had “lost their confidence” and possessed “the worst policy in history” while boasting about his administration’s first month in office.', '“Nobody has seen four weeks like we’ve had,” he said.', 'Some of the other early moves he discussed included sweeping cuts to the federal workforce and regulations, baseless allegations of massive social security fraud, withdrawal from international climate agreements and the imposing of new tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.', 'He also addressed ongoing international conflicts, incorrectly claiming that US aid to Ukraine had exceeded European contributions, and saying the United States had sent $350bn to the war-torn country since the Russian invasion in 2022. That number isn’t close to the amount the US has allocated, with a government oversight office putting that estimate closer to $183bn. European nations have combined to contribute more.', 'He noted the recent return of Israeli hostages while claiming that “Biden got back zero”, apparently forgetting that the US helped broker the return of 105 hostages in November 2023.', 'The annual conference has become a key venue for Republican politicians to connect with conservative grassroots activists, though it’s clear the event has abandoned traditional GOP policies to fully embrace Trump’s Maga-centric approach.', 'Several international conservative politicians attended the speech, including the Argentine president, Javier Milei, who is currently facing a widespread crypto scandal; the Polish president, Andrzej Duda; and the British Reform party leader, Nigel Farage, all praised by Trump during his remarks.']"

He also recognized Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro.', 'Follow Politics', '“Say hello to your father,” Trump said, as the senior Bolsonaro faces charges over his attempt to stay in power after losing the 2022 election.', 'Just before his speech, Trump held a makeshift bilateral meeting backstage with Polish President Andrzej Duda in front of American and Polish flags and convention room-style piped draping. Trump reaffirmed the United States’ “close alliance” with Poland, and he praised Duda for committing to increase the nation’s defense spending amid neighboring Ukraine’s war with Russia. Trump called Duda, who ran on an anti-LGBTQ+ message, “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine” during his speech.', 'After discussing his poll numbers at length and touting his election results, Trump launched into attacks on the pair of Democrats he is no longer running against.', '“Our border czar was Kamala,” Trump said of President Joe Biden’s vice president. “I haven’t said that name in a while.”', 'Trump then bragged about how he had been leading Biden in the polls before “they changed him” out for Kamala Harris, and how he was “the only one who ever had to beat two people.”', 'He surveyed the crowd, as he frequently did at his rallies on the campaign trail, asking whether they preferred the nickname “Crooked Joe” or “Sleepy Joe.” (They still preferred Crooked, he determined, based on the level of cheering.)', 'Trump, who seems to be unable to stop talking about Biden, then railed against him as a “horrible golfer” and disputed the former president’s claim that he had a “6 handicap” in the game, before mocking his physical condition. “He could barely walk in the sand,” Trump said of past footage showing Biden on the beach. “Somebody thought he looked great in a bathing suit.”', '“He was the worst president in the history of our country,” Trump said of Biden, continuing to press his disdain for his former opponent. Trump also claimed that former president Jimmy Carter “passed away a happy man” knowing Biden had been worse at the job.', 'Riding high on the success he has seen with some of his most controversial nominees being confirmed by the Senate, Trump bragged about the people who would be running the country’s government — mentioning Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz, who will make decisions at the country’s top health agencies, for example. (Oz has yet to be confirmed.)', 'He praised his nominee for labor secretary, former congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, despite calling the Republican “a little bit on the slightly left of center.” Trump said he nominated her as a way to throw a bone to union members, with whom he saw gains this election. Chavez-DeRemer faced her Senate hearing this week but has not yet been confirmed.', '“We had tremendous support, so I think it’s nice to give them a person in the center, because that’s what she is,” Trump said, describing the decision as a way to “do something nice for these people that voted for me.”', 'Other top administration officials took the CPAC stage before Trump.', '“I’m glad to be back, and I’m not leaving until we fix this,” border czar Tom Homan said in a rousing, profanity-laced speech about further cracking down on illegal immigration.', 'Other new administration officials who addressed the audience ahead of the president included Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and U.N. Ambassador Elise Stefanik.', '“Together,” Trump said during his speech, “we’ve achieved more in four weeks than most administrations achieve in four years.”', 'As he has done at several other speaking engagements in recent days, Trump celebrated the drastic cuts made to reshape the federal workforce and rattled off lists of purported evidence of fraud and waste that his new administration has identified, claiming that millions of people well over the age of 100 were still collecting Social Security benefits. A Washington Post analysis found that many of his administration’s efforts to cut federal spending that it deemed excessive are overblown.', '“The whole thing is a scam,” Trump said about the operation of the nation’s Social Security program, which he has vowed not to cut.', 'He then praised the work of the U.S. DOGE Service advised by tech billionaire Elon Musk, which has led the charge to cut federal programs and positions it deems wasteful, and again vowed to visit Fort Knox to see if the nation’s gold reserve is “still there.” Musk has pushed an unproven claim that the stockpile of tons of gold may have been “stolen” from the secure location. Trump, in turn, has said he will give Musk access to the facility.', 'Trump also referred to the U.S. Agency for International Development as the “left-wing scam known as USAID” and slammed the “ultraleft CFPB,” referring to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — both agencies that his administration has effectively shuttered.', 'And Trump proudly bragged about the organizations he has withdrawn the United States from: the “corrupt World Health Organization,” the “antisemitic U.N. Human Rights Council” and the “terrorist-supporting U.N. Relief and Works Agency,” to a cheering crowd.', 'Trump took a victory lap for all the other actions he has taken since he was sworn in: the diversity, equity and inclusion programs he ended; the security clearances and details he has revoked from former top officials; the Jan. 6 defendants he had pardoned; the gulf and mountain he had renamed.', 'Many of Trump’s actions clearly fall within his power as president, though some quickly faced legal challenges.', 'Trump revealed little about the latest in the ongoing negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, which he claimed on the campaign trail he could end in “one day.”', '“I don’t like talking about it, because we’re in the middle of negotiations,” Trump said, adding that he thought “we’re pretty close to a deal — we better be close to a deal.”', 'Angry about the billions of dollars the federal government has given to Ukraine’s war efforts, Trump reiterated his position that Ukraine should give the United States “something for all of the money that we put up.”', '“We’re asking for rare earth and oil, anything we can get,” he said. “But we feel so stupid.”', 'Trump also launched into a tirade about Afghanistan officials needing to return American military equipment that they “parade.”', '“They have tanks and trucks and guns and goggles,” Trump said. “They have goggles. They have night goggles better than we have, brand new, right out of the box. It’s unbelievable.”', 'Zakrzewski reported from Washington.', '']"

That launched his trajectory to run for president four years later.', '“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this and nobody ever seen four weeks we’ve had,” he said, comparing it a game of golf, while repeating his lies of rampant voter fraud even though he won.', '“Despite that, they cheated like hell,” he said. “It was just too big to rig. It was just too big to rig.”', 'In one corner of the auditorium, Trump was cheered on by those pardoned for their actions during the January 6 riot. Referring again to those prosecuted as “hostages,” the moment solidified the events that day not as something for which the President was morally responsible, but rather part of his lore which should be celebrated.', 'Trump has plenty of reason to celebrate. After being impeached twice - the latter of which should have ended his career after the January 6 riot - he pulled off a return to the White House many considered unthinkable just a few years ago, winning every swing state in the process. The Republican Party that once felt uneasy about him at the helm has subsumed itself to his embrace.', 'The failed assassination attempt in July turned him into a quasi-religious figure.', 'But beyond Trump’s conquest, the decision by CPAC to fully hitch itself to his movement showed how it lacks a coherent future.', 'In the past, CPAC served as an audition for ambitious young Republicans to see how they would be received by the base of the party. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, J.D. Vance and Ron DeSantis all at one point addressed the conference, as did Trump.', 'Now, much like the GOP itself, Trump has eclipsed the rest of the conservative movement. Few up-and-coming voices descended on the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center. Only a few rising stars like Florida congressman Byron Donalds, whom Trump backed to be governor, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump’s former press secretary who now works as governor of Arkansas, came down. Unlike past conferences, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert were not on hand.', 'Rather, much of the attention focused on talks with Trump’s new administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi, his special presidential envoy Ric Grenell, his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and his deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller served as the main attractions.', 'Take Vance for example. On the first full day of CPAC, he was supposed to be the keynote speaker, a sort of coming out as vice president. Last year’s CPAC straw poll showed him as the conference’s favorite senator.', 'But instead, as has been the case throughout the first month of the Trump presidency, CPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife Mercedes announced that Elon Musk would speak later in the day.', 'Few people remembered Vance’s address, but almost all of the reports of CPAC led with images of Musk, whom as a naturalized citizen cannot run for president, wearing his Dark MAGA hat and shades, swinging around a chainsaw gifted to him by Argentinian President Javier Milei.', 'Vance couldn’t even be his own man on a separate occasion. Before Trump took the stage, his campaign pollster Jim McLaughlin released the results of this year’s straw poll showing 61 percent of attendees want Vance to be the 2028 Republican nominee.', '“And why? Because he’s viewed as the closest thing to Donald Trump,” McLaughlin said.', 'Steve Bannon, who landed in hot water when he delivered what the leader France’s far-right National Rally considered to be a Nazi salute, came in second place. But instead of talking about the next generation, Bannon said he wanted to stay on the Trump train.', ""“The future of MAGA is Donald J Trump,” he said on Thursday to applause. “We want Trump in ‘28. That's what they can't stand. A man like Trump comes along only once or twice in the country’s history. We want Trump!”"", 'Bannon proceeded to lead a chant of people shouting “We want Trump!”', 'In the same token, Schlapp said after 2021, he and Mercedes rejected the idea of letting other people have their turn.', '“We knew in our hearts, we knew in our souls that there was only one man ordained to do this most impossible job,” he said.', 'But hitching an entire political movement to one singular figure has significant perils. In one way or another, Trump will exit the stage. He could choose not to run again, he could lose again should he run for a third term, despite the U.S. Constitution forbidding it. Or he could die in office.', 'Focusing entirely on Trump - especially given the fact his specific politics have never been in line with conservative orthodoxy - risks his movement dying with him.', 'Political parties ostensibly exist to prevent ideological movements investing entirely in one person.', 'For all their mewling and moping after losing to Trump, the Democratic Party is behaving like a proper party, figuring out what went wrong, what to do next and how to win again.', 'It will be messy, but necessary if Democrats want to ever return to the White House or control the House of Representatives or the Senate again.', 'But CPAC shows that while Trumpworld is victorious now, it has yet to create a long-term plan for the future.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

White House press secretary Karoline, who was named in the lawsuit as a defendant, said on stage she learned of the suit as she was en route to the gathering.', 'The straw poll found that 99 percent of attendees said they believed that Trump was doing an even better job during his second administration.', 'Vance, seen by many as a future face of the MAGA movement, received a warm reception at this year’s CPAC.', 'The vice president was the overwhelming favorite to be Trump’s successor in 2028, receiving 61 percent support in the CPAC straw poll.', 'Vance was also the first speaker of this year’s conference, which was bookended with Trump’s speech on Saturday.

Trump evolved CPAC beyond conservatism. Is there still room for Reagan Republicans? | Opinion,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/02/21/cpac-conservative-conference-trump-republican-party/79313361007/,"['Washington, D.C., will host this weekend a pair of events offering a split screen of contradictions about what it means to be a conservative in the time of President Donald Trump, who drives division in all things, including the Republican Party.', ""Principles First is an annual summit launched in 2019 in response to the disillusionment some conservatives felt about Trump's first term – and also as a rebuke to the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering known as CPAC that started in 1974."", 'Consider Principles First, an attempt to return to what CPAC once was – a place where conservatives, independents and libertarians discussed and debated policy, up-and-coming politicians sought support, and young and aspiring political operatives came to learn and network.', 'Compare that with what CPAC has become – a parade of prancing personalities, all trying to one-up each other in toadyism to Trump, where provocation is everything and the actual policy of governing is, at best, an afterthought.', ""Sorry to say, but CPAC's favoring of flash over substance has been more successful at attracting attention, at least for now. Still, Principles First is growing in influence, while CPAC feels like it has reached a controversy-riddled zenith."", 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'That might be wishful thinking. Time will tell.', 'Heath Mayo, a 34-year-old lawyer who first attended CPAC as a sophomore in college, told me he launched the volunteer-driven Principles First six years ago, hoping to create a grassroots community of people interested in ""ideas rather than personalities.""', 'CPAC, Mayo said, deteriorated and is ""just not a serious place"" for that kind of conversation.', 'A year ago, Principles First was hoping to prevent a second Trump presidency. This weekend, its activists will explore ways to contain the convulsion of norm-busting and government enfeeblement that Trump has pushed in his first month back in the White House.', '""It is what we thought it was,"" Mayo said. ""It wasn\'t overstated. The concern was not exaggerated. These guys, through a combination of incompetence and a complete disregard for the fundamental principles that made America great and the institutions that have made us great, are really threatening what we have done over the past century.""', ""Opinion:Musk's math isn't adding up. DOGE lies about federal cuts and focuses on grudges."", ""On the agenda: Trump's tariffs on allies and embrace of geopolitical foes, how to lower costs for health care and housing, and a big focus on urging Republican members of Congress to stand up to Trump when they disagree with him."", '""They have an independent duty on (Trump Cabinet) nominees to advise and consent, not just trust and obey,"" Mayo said. ""They\'re independent as legislators in their own right, not just sort of lemmings or foot soldiers in Trump\'s little MAGA army.""', 'Over at CPAC in Oxon Hill, Maryland, about 10 miles south of Washington, D.C., Trump is expected to speak this weekend after his co-president Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance addressed the crowd Thursday.', "" Then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, speaking at the first CPAC in 1974, used the opening lines of his speech to honor and introduce three men who had recently been released from North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps. One of them was John McCain, who'd become a Republican senator from Arizona and his party's 2008 nominee for president."", 'McCain was cheered at CPAC 51 years ago. Dying of brain cancer in 2018, McCain was jeered when Trump derided him in a noxious CPAC speech.', ""Opinion:Congressional Republicans worry about Trump's cuts at home, but they barely speak up"", 'I\'d bet that the late President Reagan, with his ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech before the fall of the Soviet Union, would be outraged at the MAGA crowd at CPAC cheering Trump\'s flagrant fealty to a Russian president who illegally launched a war against Ukraine and a Republican-controlled Congress chock full of politicians who would really like to stand up to Russia about all that but won\'t dare cross Trump because they fear his wrath.', 'Trump is the perfect speaker for what CPAC has become. Anyone who disagrees with Trump and his CPAC pals is a “global Marxist” who must be hated. It’s simple-minded messaging that taunts the listener to comply or face conflict.', ""Charlie Gerow, a Pennsylvania political consultant, was a college student when he heard Reagan speak at CPAC in 1974. He joined CPAC's board about a decade ago and was vice chair when he resigned last year, while calling for an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the chair, Matt Schlapp."", 'Gerow recalled the early days of CPAC this way: ""It was a training ground for young conservatives. It was a place to see and be seen. All the young guys who thought they were going to rule the world went.""', 'Gerow declined to comment on the current state of CPAC. But his resignation letter, obtained in November by The Daily Beast, expressed strong concerns about the group encouraging ""blind loyalty"" to Schlapp.', 'The CPAC chairman was facing a lawsuit brought in 2023 by a political consultant who accused Schlapp of groping his genitals.', 'Schlapp denied the allegations. The lawsuit was dropped last March, with CNN and The New York Times reporting that the consultant received a $480,000 settlement.', ""Right on cue, Schlapp is now accused of grabbing another man's crotch while creeping on a group of men at a Virginia bar two weeks ago, according to a scoop from independent journalist Yashar Ali. A local paper, the Rappahannock News, obtained the details from a police report."", 'No charges were filed, and Schlapp did not respond to the newspaper or Ali.', 'Make of that what you will. But, putting the salacious controversy aside, think about what it meant to be a conservative five decades ago and how some savvy politicians and opportunistic grifters have completely co-opted what it now means. Would Reagan cheer what he would hear at CPAC this week if he were still alive?', 'I think Reagan would give all that cacophonous chatter his signature shake of the head, a signal he used to send when he wondered what was wrong with the world around him.', 'Follow USA TODAY columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan']"
