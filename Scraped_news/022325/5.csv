"Zelenskyy says he would step down if Ukraine can join NATO, blasts Trump mineral pitch",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/23/zelenskyy-willing-step-down-nato/79813176007/,"['Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would be willing to step down if Ukraine were granted membership in NATO.', '""If (it means) peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready,"" Zelenskyy said at a news conference on Sunday, hours before the third anniversary of the Russian invasion. ""I can exchange this for NATO (membership), if that condition is there, immediately,"" he added.', ""But NATO membership for Ukraine, already unlikely in the short-term, looks even more out of reach since President Donald Trump took a hard turn against U.S. support for Ukraine's defense against its devastating invasion and occupation by Russia. After Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO membership was not realistic for a negotiated settlement to the war, Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and dispatched a team to negotiate with Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia for an end to the war – without any input from Ukraine or its European allies."", ""Zelenskyy also had harsh words for a deal proposed by the Trump administration to gain control of the country's mineral reserves in exchange for continued U.S. support. He said the proposed deal would require Ukraine to pay back aid it was given to defend against Russia's attacks – a term he would never accept. The $500 billion cited by Trump as the total amount of aid given to Ukraine over the course of the war is also grossly out of proportion – the real amount is less than one-fifth of that, Zelenskyy said."", 'The deal would only make sense if the U.S. deployed its own troops to Ukraine as a safety guarantee, he said.', 'More:Team Trump shakes Europe with Ukraine shift and NATO demands', 'Even President Joe Biden, who prioritized Ukraine aid, drew a red line at sending U.S. troops into the conflict and directly engaging in battle with Russia.', ""But even as Zelenskyy starkly criticized the deal, Trump's representatives insisted it would be finalized this week."", 'Although Zelenskyy\'s ""commitment"" to the deal was on shaky ground a week ago, ""The president sent the message to him. He\'s not wavering any more,"" Steve Witkoff, Trump\'s special envoy, told CNN ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""I think you\'ll see it signed this week,"" he added.', 'Witkoff said the war was ""provoked,"" but not ""necessarily"" by the Russians – the invading country.', '""There were all kinds of conversations back then about Ukraine joining NATO. That didn\'t need to happen. It basically became a threat to the Russians,"" he said.', 'Relations between Trump and Zelenskyy took a nose dive last week, with Trump branding Zelenskyy a ""dictator"" and pushing for Ukraine to hold elections – Ukraine has postponed them while at war with Russia. Asked if Putin deserved the same title, Trump deflected the question.']"

One person was killed in the city of Kryvyi Rih, according to the city military administration.', 'The attack came as leaders in Kyiv and across Europe are seeking to navigate rapid changes in US foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who in a matter of days has upended years of firm support for Ukraine, leading to fears that he would join with Moscow to force a settlement to the war without involving Ukraine and its European backers.', 'Trump’s engagement with Russian officials and his agreement to reopen diplomatic ties and economic cooperation with Moscow marked a dramatic about-face in US policy.', 'Zelensky has expressed fears that Trump pushing a quick resolution would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression, though US officials have asserted that the Ukrainian leader would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.', '02:17', 'Trump calls Ukraine’s Zelensky a dictator, tells him to move fast or lose his country', 'Trump, however, prompted alarm and anger in Ukraine when this week he suggested that Kyiv had started the war, and that Zelensky was acting as a “dictator” by not holding elections, despite Ukrainian legislation prohibiting them during martial law.', 'Russia’s deputy foreign minister on Saturday said preparations were under way for a Trump-Putin meeting, a further sign that the Russian leader’s isolation, at least for the Trump administration, was beginning to thaw.', 'Reacting to the latest Russian attacks, however, Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said that the overnight attack “demonstrates that avoiding calling Russia an aggressor does not change the fact that it is one”.', '“No one should trust Putin’s words. Look at his actions instead,” Sybiha said in a statement on social media.', 'Ukrainian officials on Sunday discussed a deal that would allow the US to access Ukrainian rare earth minerals, a proposal Trump’s administration is pushing for but that Zelensky earlier declined to accept because it lacked specific security guarantees.', 'At the forum in Kyiv where Zelensky made the offer to give up his presidency in return for peace and Nato membership, his chief of staff Andrii Yermak said the government was considering investment opportunities both with the US and European countries “which includes minerals, their development and extraction”.', 'Yermak left the forum early along with Economic Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko for what he said were talks with US representatives on a potential deal. He said Ukraine’s mineral resources represent “a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees – military guarantees and others”.', 'Yermak pushed back on the notion that Ukraine had rejected US proposals but said any agreement “must meet the national interests of Ukraine, and undoubtedly, must be interesting to our partners.”', 'Before leaving the forum, Svyrydenko said there were US$350 billion worth of minerals on Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia. This calculation, however, is partly based on geological maps dating back to 1940s and 1960s, she said, adding: “We have to conduct geological exploration and confirm the deposits we have on paper”.', 'Meanwhile, Putin in a special televised message Sunday praised Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine for defending “their native land, the national interests and the future of Russia”.', 'Putin used his speech, on Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland Day, to pledge greater social support for military personnel and new weapons and equipment for Russian forces.', '“Today, as the world is changing impetuously, our strategic course for strengthening and developing the Armed Forces remains unchanged,” he said, adding that Russia would continue to develop its armed forces “as the essential part of Russia’s security that guarantees its sovereign present and future.”', 'The UK on Sunday said it would announce new sanctions on Russia Monday, its biggest package since the early days of the war.

According to ABC News, the agency was seeking additional guidance from the US justice department on next steps.', '“FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,” Patel’s message read. “The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures. When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”', 'Patel’s missive came amid reports on Sunday indicated that he was expected to be named acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a domestic law enforcement agency that – like the FBI – sits within the Department of Justice.', 'Separately, the US attorney John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of New York, also sent a message to his staff to hold off, according to the outlet.', '“Of course, a majority of our work is law enforcement sensitive (in addition to much classified work), so even assuming this is legitimate, we will need to be careful in how we respond to this inquiry.
