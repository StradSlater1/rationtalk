Here is what some of the year's top men's college basketball contenders told us this weekend. Auburn (23-2, 11-1 in SEC): We're the future 2025 NCAA Tournament champions Auburn has overcome its toughest challenges this season, including Saturday's first conference game in SEC history between the top two teams in the Associated Press Top 25. No. 1 Auburn defeated No. 2 Alabama, 94-85, holding the Tide to their worst three-point percentage this season (19.2 percent). Leading Player of the Year contender Johni Broome was one of six Tigers to score in double-digits. It's hard to spot weaknesses in Auburn's game. A month out from Selection Sunday, the Tigers should feel extremely confident. With the NCAA Tournament fast approaching, no team looks more dangerous. Tennessee (21-5, 8-5 in SEC): Don't forget about us Tennessee's second-half rally against Vanderbilt showed why the Vols shouldn't be overlooked in the loaded SEC. With their defense, they're never out of a game. Tennessee is No. 1 in KenPom's defensive efficiency rankings, and it showed during the second half. The Vols held Vanderbilt to 35.7 percent on its field goal attempts after halftime in their 81-76 win after the Commodores shot 54.8 percent in the first half. Tennessee's offense has sometimes disappeared this season, making the Vols more volatile than others. But Tennessee has the defense to lead it to a second SEC Tournament title in four seasons. Duke Blue Devils (22-3, 14-1 in ACC): We can outscore anyone No. 2 Duke scored 106 points in its 106-70 win over Stanford, its most in an ACC game since 2017. The Blue Devils are a national title contender because they're a complete team, but their shooting makes them special. Per KenPom, Duke is No. 1 among ACC teams in three-point field goal percentage (39.3 percent) in conference games. The Blue Devils were 14-of-29 against the Cardinal, with junior guard Tyrese Proctor leading the way with five makes. The Blue Devils run an efficient offense that has become a well-oiled machine against ACC competition. Next Saturday, they'll have a chance against Illinois (17-9, 9-7 in Big Ten) to show what kind of impact the fine-tuning has had on their abilities to win out of conference. Houston Cougars (21-4, 13-1 in Big 12): We can stop anyone Arizona entered Saturday 24th in the country in scoring (82.3 points per game). But the Houston buzzsaw held the Wildcats far below their season average in a 62-58 road comeback win. Arizona shot 37 percent from the field, its second-worst shooting performance this season. Houston's suffocating defense has been the backbone of the team's recent brilliance under head coach Kelvin Sampson. That's still the case this year. And by shutting down one of the country's top offenses, the Cougars should have even more confidence that no one can consistently score on them. Wisconsin Badgers (20-5, 10-4 in Big Ten): We have Final Four potential No. 16 Wisconsin was cast aside after a three-game losing streak in early December, but it has since won 12 of its last 14 games, including 94-84 at No. 7 Purdue on Saturday. There's a lot to like about the Badgers. They have several capable three-point shooters, take smart shots, are sound defensively, and don't beat themselves with miscues. Wisconsin ranks 18th in the country in turnover rate (14.3 percent). The Badgers have the pieces in place for an extended tourney run. Ole Miss Rebels (19-7, 8-5 in SEC): We aren't there yet Ole Miss is well on its path to its first NCAA Tournament bid in six years, but an 81-71 drubbing in the hardwood Egg Bowl doesn't inspire much confidence that the Rebels will do much once dancing. The Bulldogs led by as many as 19, 69-50, while limiting Ole Miss to 38.3 percent shooting. Ole Miss head coach Chris Beard has turned the program around quickly, but Saturday's thrashing is a reminder of how much farther he must go. UConn (17-8, 9-5 in Big East): Winning three consecutive national titles is hard UConn suffered one of the worst losses of the Dan Hurley era on Saturday, falling 69-68 in overtime at Seton Hall. The Huskies entered the season with aspirations of winning a third consecutive NCAA Tournament, but as the regular season winds down, they are trending in the wrong direction. ESPN men's NCAA Tournament bracketologist Joe Lunardi projected UConn as an 8-seed in his most recent update, putting it on track to potentially play a 1-seed in the Round of 32. UConn's title defense might end far sooner than expected."", 'NHL legend Wayne Gretzky was in a celebratory mood after Team Canada’s overtime win over Team USA in Thursday’s 4 Nations final, and he was eager to share in that with the players. The Great One handed out customized hats to all members of the Canadian team that beat the Americans 3-2 in overtime in Boston on Thursday. In addition to the classic Canadian maple leaf emblem, the hats carried a two-word message: “Be Great.” Photos showed that Canadian players wore the hats as they celebrated their victory in the locker room following the game. The players also blasted a fitting song during the locker room party. Canada certainly earned bragging rights with the victory, especially after they had lost 3-1 to the United States in Montreal less than a week earlier. On Thursday night, they rallied from a 2-1 deficit to come back and win on an overtime goal by Connor McDavid, a player who has received countless comparisons to Gretzky. Gretzky was on hand for Thursday’s game, and he was named an honorary captain for Canada and participated in a pregame ceremony. He was not a part of the postgame celebrations, but his hats certainly were.', 'Los Angeles Clippers forward Ben Simmons played in just his third game on Sunday after being bought out by the Brooklyn Nets. LA lost to the Indiana Pacers 129-111. Simmons had a typical all-around stat line that he is accustomed to, providing eight points, four assists, three rebounds, and two steals in just 24 minutes. The former No. 1 overall pick is nowhere near the player he was back in Philadelphia, but he is showing very encouraging signs of positive production for a Clippers team striving to make a playoff push post-All-Star break. Clippers head coach Ty Lue had positive praise for Simmons in the postgame presser, describing his ability to increase the pace of the offense as well as bring a dynamic team defender. ""It was good being able to have him on the floor, being able to switch one through five,"" Lue said of Simmons. ""… That’s the advantage you have of being able to have him on the floor, he can push the basketball and make a play, attack the basket, or get to the free throw line.” While Lue spoke highly of the three-time All-Star, he unfortunately announced he will not play on Monday against the Detroit Pistons. ""No,"" Lue said definitively when asked if Simmons will play Monday. Simmons has yet to be cleared to play back-to-backs due to the lingering back injury he has been dealing with dating back to Philadelphia. Simmons went through two surgeries within three of years of his time as a Net, restricting him to play only 90 of the total 246 regular season games, while also being on a max contract. He has yet to break the 30-minute mark in a game with Los Angeles, as they continue to find his role with the team. The last contest Simmons played 30 minutes was Jan. 12 with the Nets.', ""The Edmonton Oilers have demoted forward Viktor Arvidsson to the fourth line, which will further speculation that he could be traded as a salary cap dump. NHL insider Frank Seravalli has suggested earlier the Oilers could trade Arvidsson to free up cap space, as Jeff Skinner can use his no-move clause to block a trade. Oilers trading Viktor Arvidsson looks like possibility after demotion to the fourth line At practice, Oilers coach Knoblauch demoted Arvidsson to the fourth line in place of top prospect Matthew Savoie, playing on the second line with Draisaitl. Nuge - McDavid - Hyman Savoie - Draisaitl - Podkolzin Skinner - Janmark - Perry Arvidsson - Henrique - Brown Ekholm - Bouchard Nurse - Klingberg Kulak - Emberson Skinner Pickard Matthew Savoie is being called up after dominating in the AHL this season, and if he makes a good enough impression, it's possible that he commands a roster spot for the rest of the season. Savoie is a player with offensive skill and also has earned praise for his defensive play in the AHL. If he can translate a 200-foot game with scoring alongside Draisaitl for a salary of $886K, he would make another winger disposable. Viktor Arvidsson emerging as candidate for cap dump trade with demotion to fourth line Arvidsson is falling to the fourth line after struggling to find a consistent groove with the Oilers all season. He's played through injuries much of the season, but only for a while was able to bring his best hockey. Oilers analysts have called out Arvidsson for having the worst year of his career this year. Only 7 goals and 18 points in 40 games is a disappointment alongside Draisaitl, especially at $4M for two years. Arvidsson does not have any trade protection, either. If Matthew Savoie can live up to expectations, it's possible the Oilers could deal Viktor Arvidsson to clear up $4M in cap space to address the blueline, or potentially goaltending in trade. If Evander Kane returns before playoffs, they may need to move him to clear the space."", 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily. Always free!']"
