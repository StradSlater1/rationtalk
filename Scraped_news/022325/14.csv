All four were then taken hostage, and the Regev siblings were released in November 2023.', 'Danino was slain in captivity in August 2024, in a tunnel under Rafah in southern Gaza, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat and Almog Sarusi.', '“He didn’t think about himself or his family, just that you don’t leave anyone behind,” Shelly said of Danino. “He is the hero and the angel who saved them.”', 'Omer Wenkert, who was snatched from the Nova festival by invading Hamas terrorists, lost more than 30 kilograms (66 pounds) while in captivity, his mother Niva said, adding that he never received any medical treatment for his colitis, a chronic condition he had prior to being taken hostage.', '“Omer defeated captivity,” Niva said, but vowed that even now, “our fight continues until the last hostage is home.”', 'Her husband Shai Wenkert thanked the country for its solidarity and reiterated the need to bring all the hostages home. He also thanked US President Donald Trump and US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts to return his son and all the other hostages.', 'Mor Korngold, the brother of Tal Shoham, said that it was hard for him to find the right words beyond “thank you,” as he thanked Trump, as well as the Austrian government and its ambassadors for their assistance, as Shoham is an Austrian citizen.', '“We’re always in the same boat, and always strong,” he said, thanking the country for its support over the past 16 month, and the government for making the necessary decisions that led to his brother’s release, even though it was difficult.', 'The family’s only request, said Korngold, was for an agreement to be reached that would “bring fathers to their children and children to their parents.”', '“We have a window and we can’t lose this opportunity,” he said of the hostage deal, which faces an uncertain future as the first phase is slated to end later this week. Bringing the rest of the hostages home, he said, “does not come at the cost of our security; on the contrary, it is the foundation on which our security rests.”', 'Echoing Korngold’s call for the remaining hostages to be brought back to Israel,  Eliya Cohen’s partner Ziv Aboud said that even though Eliya was now back with her, “there is no victory until everyone is home.”', 'Aboud, who campaigned for Eliya’s release with a number of prominent acts of protest, said that the past 16 months had been a journey of love.', 'She also used the opportunity to address hostage Alon Ohel, who was taken captive with Eliya from the same bomb shelter on the outskirts of the Nova festival, and with whom he was held. Ohel, who was wounded in his eye, was not released during the first phase of the ceasefire deal, and his family only discovered that he was alive after speaking to several recently freed hostages who were held with him.', '“Alon Ohel, it’s my promise to Eliya and to your family that we won’t stop until you’re home,” Aboud said.', 'She also thanked Aner Shapira, the “hero of the field shelter,” whose actions saved her, as well as Eliya and several others, as he tossed out grenades lobbed inside by Hamas terrorists until he himself was killed.', 'Eliya’s mother, Siggi, spoke of her son’s religious observance and said that he had prayed every day in captivity, and said the Kiddush prayer over water on Friday nights.', 'Like Aboud, Siggi addressed Ohel, vowing: “You’re not alone and we’ll fight for you until you come home.”', 'According to a Channel 12 report on Sunday, Cohen spoke to Ohel’s family soon after his return to Israel on Saturday, telling them it was hard for him to leave Ohel behind, as he is now being held on his own.', 'The report said that Eliya had undergone surgery during captivity to extract bullets, but was not given any anesthesia.', 'In addition to being held with Ohel, Eliya was held with Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were freed two weeks before him.', 'The men were chained together by both their hands and their feet, Channel 12 reported, which caused them physical injuries, in addition to those sustained as a result of their captors abusing them.', 'The report said the men were only unchained in recent weeks, pending their release, and had to “learn to walk again.” Cohen was also given a large amount of food in the time leading up to his release in order to improve his appearance.', 'Cohen reportedly told his loved ones that he was held in a tunnel that was bombed by the IDF, and managed to escape just in time.', 'At a different point in his captivity, he also spent some time with Sarusi, who was murdered in August along with Danino and four other hostages.', 'Also on Sunday, the families of Hisham al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu gave statements regarding both of their conditions, after the two spent more than 3,000 days in captivity.', 'Mengistu and al-Sayed entered the Gaza Strip of their own accord in 2014 and 2015, respectively, amid mental distress. Reports following the October 7, 2023, massacre indicated that Hamas had lulled Israel into complacency by feigning serious interest in a deal for Mengistu and al-Sayed.', 'The families of Mengistu, a member of the Ethiopian Israeli community, and al-Sayed, from the Negev’s Bedouin community, had struggled over the years to rally public support or pressure the government to negotiate their release, with some alleging racism.', 'Avera’s brother Ilan Mengistu said on Sunday that “finally, finally, the long terrible journey has reached its end.”', '“Avera, whose name means life, is home, Avera lives!” he said, speaking at the hospital where his brother was recuperating.', 'He noted, however, that Avera has a long path ahead of him as he rehabilitates, and said that while the photos of the reunions between released hostages and their families are emotional and joyful, there are many other issues to be dealt with upon their return home.', '“We’re here for you and pray for your full recovery,” Ilan said.', 'Hisham’s father Sha’ban al-Sayed said on Sunday that his son had returned a shell of a person, and was kept in inhuman conditions during his decade in Hamas captivity.', 'He slammed the terror group for “playing politics on the back of someone who is mentally unwell” and said that throughout his son’s captivity, he believed that the terror group would take care of the captives because it was in their interest.', '“Then I saw on October 7 how they killed Bedouin, Arab people who weren’t soldiers,” he said. “We want the Arab world to see this and to hear what they say. To know that they killed and took captive Arab people and a woman in Bedouin dress.”', 'Al-Sayed said that when his son returned Saturday, he was relieved to see him walking on his own, but when he finally hugged him, he was hugging a shell of a person.', 'Hisham can barely speak, he said, and has no memory.', '“It gives us the sense that he wasn’t kept by humans, and we want an answer, we want an answer,” he said.', 'Al-Sayed thanked everyone in the Israeli government who worked to secure Hisham’s release, as well as Trump, who he said “gave us strong support.”', 'He ended with a call for the remainder of the hostages to be brought home “without waiting for further stages” of the hostage deal.', 'Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had spoken by phone with released hostages Sagui Dekel-Chen and Ohad Ben Ami and their wives.', 'Dekel-Chen was freed on February 15, and Ben Ami was freed a week earlier.', 'According to Netanyahu’s office, he asked about their return to their homes and families, and emphasized “the victory of their bodies and spirits during their captivity.”', 'Netanyahu told the two that Israel had to apply great pressure on Hamas to secure their release.', '“Hamas demanded the release of only a limited number of live hostages in the current agreement, while the prime minister insisted on maximizing the number of live hostages who return in phase one of the deal,” said the self-congratulatory PMO statement, “and this effort succeeded thanks to our brave soldiers and determined and informed decision-making.”', 'Netanyahu promised that he will continue to work to bring all of the remaining hostages home.', 'Michael Levy, whose brother Or Levy was held along with Cohen and was released on February 8, said that his brother has met with the parents of Aner Shapira since he returned home, as well as the parents of Alon Ohel.', '“Aner’s parents heard about the last moments of their son’s life, they heard it from Or’s perspective,” said Michael.', 'He said his brother was briefly kept captive with slain hostage Goldberg-Polin at the beginning of their captivity, until Goldberg-Polin was relocated for medical care. They met again for a day or two sometime in November 2023, and Or had been sure Goldberg-Polin had since been freed, leading to shock when Or discovered his fate upon his release.', 'Or also suspected throughout his 15 months of captivity that his wife Eynav was killed in the roadside bomb shelter from which he was taken, but only when he was released did he find out that she had indeed been murdered that day.', '“He has two main things he thinks about,” said Michael. “To continue the struggle for the friends he left behind, and to return to some kind of normal life, somehow, to live in his own apartment, to work and to be a dad to Mogi,” Levy’s 3-year-old son.', 'He said it was very difficult to witness his brother’s skeletal condition when he was released. Or has said that their Hamas captors began giving them more food two weeks before they were released, so that they would not look quite so gaunt.', 'They “were kept in conditions that animals wouldn’t be kept in,” he said.', 'Or has a long rehabilitation ahead of him, said Michael, “but there’s nothing like running after a 3-year-old to keep you in shape.”', 'The Levy family is taking small steps toward normalcy, he added, including finally eating Shabbat dinner together, something they did not do during the entire 15 months that Or was a hostage.', '“It’s just small, meaningful things,” said Levy. “There’s all these things I wanted to ask him and talk to him about. And now I can finally call him, and ask him stupid questions, like about basketball. I can finally do that. People used to ask me questions for him. Now I say, ‘I have to check with Or, I’m not going to decide for him.”', 'Seeing the hostages released home is amazing, said Michael, as they change from two-dimensional posters into real, breathing people.', '“We’re still in the struggle to bring them all home,” he said. “We’re just holding different pictures now.”', 'Terror groups in the Gaza Strip are still holding 63 hostages, including 62 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 36 confirmed dead by the IDF.', 'Hamas has so far released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals; and the bodies of four slain Israeli captives — Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, and Oded Lifshitz — during the ceasefire that began in January. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war.', 'Eight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.', 'The body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt.

Israel delays release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees following recovery of six Israeli hostages from Gaza,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/22/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage-release-intl-hnk/index.html,"['', 'Israel has delayed an expected release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for returned Israeli hostages “until further notice,” the Palestinian Prisoners Society said early Sunday.', 'Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office confirmed the postponement, demanding guarantees that future hostage releases will take place without “humiliating ceremonies.”', 'Hamas released six Israeli hostages from Gaza on Saturday in two public ceremonies and one private transfer, the final return of live hostages in this first phase of a ceasefire deal that began last month. The next release, of the remains of four more hostages, is expected Thursday.', 'In return for Saturday’s release, Israel was expected to free 620 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 23 children and one woman. But Israeli officials delayed that release, citing further security reviews.', 'Hamas’ media office had earlier accused Israel of violating the truce with the delay, casting some uncertainty over the precarious ceasefire deal.', 'The delay, announced in the early hours of Sunday local time, is a response to Hamas’s “repeated violations” of the deal, according to the Prime Minister’s Office, including using hostages in videos and public displays that “demean their dignity.”', 'Hamas had released a heavily edited propaganda video showing two unreleased Israeli captives watching Saturday’s hostage release ceremony from a vehicle. The hostages seen in the video – identified by the Hostages and Missing Families’ Forum as Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa Dalal – plead for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their freedom. The men were likely speaking under duress.', 'The two men’s families authorized media use of “the sickening Hamas video,” according to the forum.', 'Hamas and its allies continue to hold 63 Israeli hostages in Gaza. At least 32 of those are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli government – one of whom, the soldier Hadar Goldin, has been held since 2014.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nHuman remains returned by Hamas to Israel confirmed as those of former hostage Shiri Bibas', 'The first two hostages to be released on Saturday – Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 – were turned over to Red Cross officials in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Shoham was kidnapped from kibbutz Be’eri during the Hamas-led attack of October 7, 2023, along with his two children, wife, and mother-in-law, all of whom were released the following month. Mengistu, an Israeli from Ashkelon, crossed into Gaza in 2014.', 'Later, thousands of people including Hamas fighters gathered at a separate location in Nuseirat, central Gaza, where three of the hostages – Eliya Cohen, 27, Omer Shem Tov, 22, and Omer Wenkert, 23 – were handed over in another heavily choreographed ceremony. A number of children appeared on the stage wearing shirts bearing photographs of Hamas leaders who had been killed.', 'The three men were kidnapped at the Nova music festival near the border with Gaza during the October 7 attack. They appeared thin but in better condition than some previously freed hostages, whose appearance sparked alarm in Israel. Shem Tov seemed to engage with some of the Hamas fighters on stage and blew a kiss toward the crowd.', 'A sixth hostage, 37-year-old Hisham al-Sayed, an Arab-Israeli from a Bedouin community in southern Israel who walked into Gaza in 2015, was turned over to the Red Cross in Gaza City, according to an Israeli security source and a Hamas source.', 'Al-Sayed and Mengistu both reportedly have serious mental health conditions. They were captured by Hamas about a decade ago.', 'The Israeli military said the hostages had crossed into Israel and would receive medical assessments before being reunited with their families.', 'Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv’s “Hostage Square” to witness the releases on screen, some waving to the sky as a helicopter carrying Mengistu passed overhead.', 'Just before being handed over to the Red Cross in Rafah early on Saturday morning, Shoham and Mengistu were paraded on stage, flanked by armed and masked militants. They were handed documents, and Shoham was forced to address the crowd.', 'In contrast, al-Sayed received a quieter handover, which one leading Bedouin figure in Israel said showed Hamas’ respect of “the Palestinians in the occupied territories.”', 'Many from this often marginalized community – one of several ethnic minority groups in Israel – identify distinctly as Bedouin Israelis, while others see themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel.', 'Throughout the day, crowds of Palestinians waited under heavy rain in front of Gaza’s European Hospital in Khan Younis, anticipating the eventual arrival of their loved ones. As the hours passed, some trickled out of the hospital while others slept in the hospital corridors in hopes of waiting out the delay.', 'According to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, 620 prisoners were expected to be released from Israeli detention on Saturday – a slightly higher figure than previously reported and the largest number of Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged since the ceasefire deal began.', 'Just under 500 of those are expected to be sent back to Gaza, including 445 who were detained in the enclave since the war began in October 2023 and have been held without charge, as well as 23 children and one woman, according to the group.', 'In addition, 151 prisoners serving life sentences and long sentences were due to be released to the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and some sent into exile.', 'According to prison authorities, a senior Israeli prisons official, Lt. Col. Kobi Yaakovi, ordered the Palestinian prisoners to wear clothes that included the inscription: “I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed.”', 'Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Saturday’s hostage release was a “moving and joyful moment” but was accompanied by “deep pain over the fate of Shiri Bibas and her sons.”', 'The remains of Bibas – the Israeli mother whose young family became a symbol for the plight of hostages being held in Gaza – had been expected to be among those of four hostages returned by Hamas on Thursday, alongside her sons Kfir and Ariel, and another captive, Oded Lifshitz.', 'However, while forensic tests confirmed that the remains included those of the two boys and Lifshitz, the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas – and nor did it match that of any other Israeli hostage, prompting demands for the correct remains to be returned.', 'On Friday evening, Bibas’ remains arrived in Tel Aviv following condemnation in Israel.', '“Last night, our Shiri was brought home. After the identification process at the Institute for Forensic Medicine, we received the news this morning that we had feared: our Shiri was murdered in captivity,” said a statement from her family provided by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum on Saturday.', 'Hamas, which says Shiri and the two boys were killed in an Israeli airstrike in 2023, said that her body may have earlier been mixed up with the body of another person killed in the airstrike, and vowed to investigate.', 'Israel and Hamas are holding indirect negotiations to extend the ceasefire.

Among them would be at least five journalists and the longest-serving Palestinian prisoner, local media and family members reported.', 'In the morning, Avera Mengistu, who had been held by militants since he crossed into the besieged strip in 2014, was released first alongside Tal Shoham, 40, who also has Austrian citizenship and was seized from Kibbutz Be’eri during Hamas’s bloody assault on 7 October 2023. Both were handed over to the Red Cross in the southern Gaza town of Rafah.', 'The family of Mr Mengistu, who was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to Israel at the age of five, said their relative had endured over a decade of “unimaginable suffering”. Mr Mengistu crossed into Gaza through Zikim in September 2014. His family said for nine years they had no indication of his condition until the first sign of life arrived in January 2023 when Hamas released a video of him.', '“During this time, there have been continuous efforts to secure his return, with prayers and pleas, some silent, that remained unanswered until today,” they added.', 'Later in front of hundreds of Palestinians in the central town of Nuseirat, three Israeli men – Omer Wenkert, 23, Omer Shem Tov, 22, and Eliya Cohen, 27, – were brought out by masked, armed Hamas fighters to pose on a stage dressed in fake army uniforms, though they were not soldiers when they were kidnapped. The trio were all seized from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023.', 'The final release was Hisham al-Sayed, 36, a Bedouin Arab Israeli man who reportedly struggles with mental health challenges. He crossed into Gaza in early April 2015 and has been held by Hamas ever since.', 'The latest hostage release, along with the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Isreal, is going ahead after a heart-wrenching and grisly dispute over the last exchange. Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants. Bibas and her two toddlers – one of them just eight months old – were killed in Gaza. Her body was handed to Israel overnight Friday.', 'More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will also be freed on Saturday, the Palestinian prisoners’ media office said Friday. The prisoners set for release include 50 serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences, 47 who were released under a previous hostage-for-prisoner exchange and 445 prisoners from Gaza arrested since the war began.

In the south of the country along the border with Gaza, more people lined the road to welcome the convoy carrying the freed captives.', 'The six Israeli hostages are the final living captives to be freed under phase one of the fragile ceasefire – Hamas said it will also release four more bodies next week. Under the agreement, 33 hostages were set to be released under the first phase, which comes to an end at the beginning of March.', 'If everything is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive.', 'The family of Mr Shoham, who was seized alongside his wife Adi, their children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three, as well as other family members, called his release an “unforgettable moment”.

Gaza ceasefire once again in doubt as first phase nears end,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x4pxwne1yo,"['As the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is meant to be drawing to an end, it has once again been put in doubt.', 'After the last six living Israel hostages due to be released in this phase were freed, more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were due to be released by Israel in exchange - the biggest number so far to be freed in one go.', 'But that has now been delayed indefinitely by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with his demand that Hamas must stop what he called its ""cynical use of hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas has in turn accused Israel of deliberately trying to disrupt the ceasefire agreement.', ""It's the latest big bump in the road that's intended ultimately to lead to a permanent end to hostilities and the start of rebuilding Gaza."", 'Israel complained about the chaotic scenes in one of the first handovers, saying the physical safety of the hostages had been put in jeopardy. Then, Israel said Hamas had broken the terms of the agreement by not releasing a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehud.', 'In response, it delayed opening access for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza for 48 hours. That was resolved when Arbel Yehud was freed in an extra handover before the next scheduled for the following Saturday.', 'Hamas later accused Israel of not living up to its commitments to permit heavy machinery, tents and caravans into Gaza. It then said it would not carry out the next hostage handover as scheduled.', ""That prompted threats from both Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump that all out war would resume in Gaza if the hostages weren't freed as agreed. With the clock ticking down, Hamas agreed to release them."", 'And just in the past few days, the discovery that the body Hamas handed over on Thursday as that of Shiri Bibas turned out not to be her. That set off new anger and shock in Israel, where the images of Shiri trying to shield her two young children as they were abducted on 7 October, 2023, is seen as the most potent symbol of the horror of that day.', 'Netanyahu denounced Hamas for what he called a ""cruel and evil violation"" of the agreement. Once again, the ceasefire was kept on track only at the last moment by Hamas providing another body within a day that this time did indeed prove to be hers.', ""All these incidents have shown how fragile the ceasefire process remains. They may also have contributed to the fact talks on the second phase - due to start earlier this month - have not yet got under way. Time is running out, with the first phase due to end in a week's time."", 'Hamas has offered to release the remaining hostages due to be freed in the second phase in one go, but only if Israel pulls all its forces out of Gaza and there is a permanent end to the war.', 'Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas, which it has so far rejected. The stage-managed ceremonies at each hostage handover, which Netanyahu has so strongly condemned, are intended to show it is still a force to be reckoned with in Gaza.', 'In Israel, voices on the right demand the government resumes its war against Hamas, while the families of the hostages - backed by much of Israel - say securing the release of the remaining hostages is what matters above and beyond all else.', ""Trump's plan for Gaza has brought new uncertainty into the equation. The third phase of the ceasefire is meant to set Gaza on the path towards reconstruction and renewal."", ""Arab states are hurriedly trying to come up with a concrete alternative proposal in which Palestinians would continue to live in Gaza while it is rebuilt, rather than being removed from the enclave as envisaged in Trump's plan."", 'The future governance of Gaza also remains a key sticking point, with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries all so far appearing to have contradictory proposals.', 'These issues will require difficult negotiations, which will be conducted amid the constant risk of a return to war, for which some on both sides continue to advocate.', 'But for now, the mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US may have their work cut out just getting the first phase of the ceasefire over the line.', 'Israel\'s defence minister says the camps are now ""empty"" and would be occupied by the Israeli military.', 'Hamas has previously claimed that the mother and her two sons were killed in an Israeli airstrike.', 'Hamas took 251 people hostage in the 7 October attacks.', 'Four of the men were kidnapped on 7 October 2023, while the two have been held for a decade.', 'Israel earlier said the body of a ""Gazan woman"" was returned instead of their mother, Shiri Bibas.', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

They are believed to be the final living hostages scheduled for release in the current first phase of the deal, with only four more hostages, all believed to be dead, set for release on Thursday.', 'The terror group paraded five of the six freed hostages on stages in propaganda-filled ceremonies in two locations in Gaza, handing them over to the Red Cross, while al-Sayed was released separately to the humanitarian organization later in the day, without a ceremony.', 'The men all looked frail and many had noticeably suffered dramatic weight loss.', 'Shoham, Shem Tov, Wenkert and Cohen were all taken captive on October 7, 2023 during the Hamas-led attacks and massacres, and had been held as hostages in Gaza for over 500 days.', 'Mengistu and al-Sayed both entered Gaza on their own accord in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and had been held captive by terror groups in Gaza for around a decade each.', 'The releases came hours after Hamas finally returned the body of Shiri Bibas; Israel said she had been brutally murdered by her captors along with her two small sons, Ariel, 4, and baby Kfir, whose bodies were returned on Thursday.', 'The first of three handovers took place on Saturday morning in Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip, during which the terror group handed Shoham and Mengistu over to the Red Cross after parading the two on a stage decorated with a propaganda poster featuring images of terror leaders and Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in 2014 and whose body is held by Hamas.', 'There was also a display of weapons Hamas said had been taken from Israel on October 7.', 'Shoham and Mengistu were then taken by the Red Cross to Israeli forces inside Gaza, who escorted them to an IDF facility inside Israel, near the border.', 'After brief medical checks and reunions with family members, the two men were taken via helicopter to hospitals in central Israel.', 'Later in the morning, at a second Hamas ceremony in central Gaza’s Nuseirat, Shem Tov, Wenkert and Cohen were paraded on stage holding certificates and gift bags, and wearing approximations of IDF uniforms as if they were soldiers.', 'The three civilians were kidnapped from the Nova music festival, and are not active members of the military. Hamas considers Israeli men under 50 to be soldiers.', 'It appeared that Cohen was made to wave by the gunmen flanking him, while Shem Tov seemed to be directed by a Hamas cameraman to also kiss two of the masked gunmen on their heads.', 'They, too, were taken by the Red Cross to Israeli troops before they were brought to the IDF facility near Re’im for medical checks and emotional reunions with close family members before they were transported to hospitals.', 'Later on Saturday afternoon, the Red Cross notified the IDF that Hamas had handed over the sixth hostage, Hisham al-Sayed.', 'He was released by the terror group without a ceremony, which Hamas said was out of “respect” for the Arab community in Israel, despite having held him for nearly a decade, as well as murdering and abducting several Arab Israelis during the October 7, 2023, onslaught.', 'Al-Sayed was then handed over to Israeli forces inside Gaza.', 'Avera Mengistu, 37, spent 3,821 days in captivity before his release.', 'Mengistu, who suffers from mental illness, crossed into northern Gaza from the beach at Zikim in September 2014.', 'The then-28-year-old was spotted by IDF security cameras but made it through the fence before troops could reach the scene. He was picked up by a Hamas patrol and was not heard from until the terror group released a video of him in early 2023.', 'Mengistu’s family has struggled over the years to rally public support or pressure the government to negotiate his release, with some relatives alleging racism.', 'Reports following the October 7, 2023, massacre indicated that one of the ways Hamas lulled Israel into complacency ahead of the onslaught was by feigning serious interest in a deal for Mengistu and al-Sayed.', 'Tal Shoham, 39, a dual Israeli-Austrian citizen from the northern town of Maale Tzviya, was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7 while visiting his wife’s family on Kibbutz Be’eri for the Simhat Torah holiday.', 'His wife, Adi Shoham, his daughter, Yahel, 3, and son, Naveh, 8, as well as his mother-in-law Shoshan Haran, his wife’s aunt Sharon Avigdori and her daughter Noam, 12, were also taken hostage, but released in November 25, 2023.', 'His father-in-law Avshalom Haran was killed during the attack, as were his wife’s aunt and uncle Eviatar and Lilach Kipnis, who lived next door in Be’eri.', 'The extended family had been hiding in the Haran family home but were forced to flee after Hamas terrorists set it on fire.', 'There had been no sign of life from him ahead of his release. It was not known if he was aware his wife and children had also been taken hostage, or that they had survived.', 'Eliya Cohen, 27, was with his fiancee, Ziv Aoud, at the Nova desert rave when Hamas gunmen attacked.', 'The two tried to escape but were chased by terrorists and both were shot.', 'They sought safety at a roadside bomb shelter, but it was attacked by terrorists and Aboud later said she felt Cohen being pulled up and then placed on a pickup truck and driven away. He was taken along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy and Alon Ohel.', 'Earlier this month, the family said they heard from recently released captives that Cohen has been chained up throughout his time in captivity and gets very little food or daylight.', 'A bullet wound in his leg has yet to be properly treated, the freed hostages said.', 'Omer Wenkert, 23, was also taken captive by Hamas terrorists at the Nova festival on October 7.', 'He was in touch with his parents that morning, telling them he was “scared to death.” Their last communication with him was at 7:50 a.m.', 'They later saw a Hamas video of Omer, tied up on the flatbed of a white pickup truck, in his underwear, confirming that he had been taken hostage in Gaza.', 'Omer Shem Tov, 22, from Herzliya was at the Nova festival with his friends Itay and Maya Regev, who were also taken hostage but were freed in November 2023.', 'He last spoke to his parents around 10 a.m. on October 7, as he sounded increasingly panicked about what was happening around him while Hamas terrorists shot hundreds and abducted dozens.', 'After getting into a friend’s car, he sent his family his live location, but they eventually noticed that it was headed toward Gaza, and contact with him was lost.', 'Hisham Al-Sayed, a 37-year-old Bedouin Israeli from the village of Hura in the Negev desert, entered the Strip near the Erez Crossing in April 2015.', 'Like Mengistu, al-Sayed suffers from mental illness.', 'According to his father, this was not his first time going into Gaza, but in this case, he was stopped by Hamas and taken into its custody.', 'By the time he was released on Saturday, he spent nearly 3,600 days in the hands of the terror group.', 'According to Human Rights Watch, in the years prior to his entering Gaza, al-Sayed was “diagnosed with schizophrenia and a personality disorder, among other conditions” and was repeatedly institutionalized.', 'Al-Sayed was not heard from until 2022, when Hamas released a video showing him looking sick and depleted in a bed and hooked up to an oxygen tank.', 'In a statement Tuesday, al-Sayed’s family said they had been waiting for him for a decade, and added that their happiness would not be complete until all hostages returned home.', '“It cannot be that the fate of other hostages will be a decade in captivity,” they said.', 'The six hostages released Saturday were the final living hostages slated for release under phase one of the deal.

A beaming Shem Tov even kissed two militants next to him on the head and blew kisses to the crowd. ', 'Watching the release, Cohen\'s family and friends in Israel chanted ""Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!"" and cheered when they saw him for the first time. Shem Tov\'s grandmother ululated in joy, shrieking, ""Omer, my joy! My life!"" as she saw him. ', 'Cohen\'s fiance, Ziv Abud, avoided capture by hiding under a pile of bodies the night of the concert. Abud, whose story was told in See It Now Studio\'s documentary ""We Will Dance Again,""  told the Daily Telegraph that she knows the man who could come out will be very different from the person who was snatched by Hamas terrorists more than 16 months ago.', '""We will start with the healing and go from there,"" Abud said ahead of his release. ""I want to believe that he is still the same Eliya, that he will love the same things we used to love. We loved to travel. We loved to dance. But we will see. He has had all this time of people telling him what he must do. When he is home he will need to do what he wants to do. And I will be with him, of course.""', 'The three men were put in Red Cross vehicles that then headed for Israel. The Israeli military said the three were in their custody and would undergo an initial medical assessment before being reunited with their families. ', 'During that reunion, Shem Tov called his parents ""heroes"" as they embraced, laughing and crying, near the Gaza border. ', '""You\'re amazing. You have no idea how much I dreamt of you,"" he said. His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 37 pounds while in captivity.', 'Earlier Saturday, two other hostages — Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 — were freed. Arriving in Israel, both were taken to medical centers for examination.', 'Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza on his own in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu\'s family broke out into a Hebrew song, ""Here is the Light,"" as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade.', '""This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us,"" Shoham\'s family said in a statement, calling for a deal the be reached for the release of all those still captive. Shoham\'s wife, two young children, and three other relatives who were abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. ""There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it.""', ""Later, Israel's military said the final hostage, Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released.

His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia."", ""The release of over 600 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel — the largest one-day prisoner release in the ceasefire's first phase — was delayed, apparently for Israeli security consultations on Saturday evening."", 'Among those set to be released is Nael Barghouti, 67. He has spent 45 years in Israeli jails, more than any other Palestinian. He was first arrested in 1978 for killing an Israeli bus driver. He was released in a prisoner exchange deal in October 2011, then rearrested in 2014 on grounds that he violated his release terms. According to the current exchange agreement, freed prisoners convicted of killing Israelis must be deported, leaving Barghouti unable to return to his home in the West Bank. ', 'The latest hostage exchange is going ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants.', 'The remains that Hamas transferred with her sons\' bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for ""a cruel and malicious violation,"" while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake.', ""On Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons — the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades — said it handed over a second body. On Saturday morning, Bibas' family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers."", '""For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it\'s here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,"" the family said.', ""The dispute over the body's identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult."", 'Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive.', 'Yael Alexander, whose son Edan is thought to be the last living American hostage, said the situation is a ""nightmare."" ', '""If suddenly they decided \'OK, it\'s not working, let\'s stop and that\'s it, no releases of hostages, this will be a disaster for us the families,"" Alexander said. ', 'The statement from the Bibas family said ""there is no more important goal"" than the release of the remaining hostages.

But Hamas suggested on Wednesday it was prepared to accelerate the process.', 'A senior Hamas official told Agence France-Presse that the group was ready to release all remaining hostages in one handover during the second phase.', 'The official, Taher al-Nunu, said: “We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase.”', 'Netanyahu has long resisted any talk about the second phase of the agreement, which would involve a complete military withdrawal from Gaza, as well as the handover of the remaining hostages, in return for hundreds more Palestinians held in Israeli jails.', 'Completion of the second phase would in effect represent the end of the war, but the far-right wing of Netanyahu’s coalition adamantly opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside Gaza.', 'The Israeli prime minister, however, has come under pressure to do so from Donald Trump’s special envoy, the US president’s friend and fellow real-estate developer, Steve Witkoff, who said over the weekend: “Phase two is absolutely going to begin.”', 'Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on Tuesday that talks on the second phase would begin this week, but a day later the timing remained unclear.', 'Under the original agreement, talks over how the second phase would be implemented were supposed to begin at the beginning of February. Not much time now remains before phase two is due to begin on 1 March, and there are contentious issues to be resolved.', 'Under the agreement, Israeli troops are due to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer running along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, in the first eight days of phase two. That is something the Israeli prime minister has previously refused to do, emphasising the corridor’s strategic importance.', 'At the same time, Netanyahu is demanding that the second phase include the disarming of Hamas and its removal as an organisation, but he has been hazy about who would replace them in running the territory. He embraced Trump’s declaration earlier this week that the US would take control of the Gaza Strip and that the entire Palestinian population of more than 2.2 million would somehow be moved out of their homeland.', 'Few in the region believe Trump’s proposal will be carried out. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) joined Egypt and Jordan in opposing the plan, which would require the cooperation of neighbouring countries to absorb the deported Palestinians.', 'There was no official account of a meeting between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the UAE leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
