How NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer Will Make a Looping Voyage to the Moon,https://www.nasa.gov/missions/small-satellite-missions/lunar-trailblazer/how-nasas-lunar-trailblazer-will-make-a-looping-voyage-to-the-moon/,"['6 MIN READ', 'Before arriving at the Moon, the small satellite mission will use the gravity of the Sun, Earth, and Moon over several months to gradually line up for capture into lunar orbit.', 'NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer arrived in Florida recently in advance of its launch later this month and has been integrated with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Shipped from Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, the small satellite is riding along on Intuitive Machines’ IM-2 launch — part of NASA’s CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative — which is slated for no earlier than Thursday, Feb. 26, from Launch Complex 39A at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center.', 'Approximately 48 minutes after launch, Lunar Trailblazer will separate from the rocket and begin its independent flight to the Moon. The small satellite will discover where the Moon’s water is, what form it is in, and how it changes over time, producing the best-yet maps of water on the lunar surface. Observations gathered during its two-year prime mission will contribute to the understanding of water cycles on airless bodies throughout the solar system while also supporting future human and robotic missions to the Moon by identifying where water is located.', 'Key to achieving these goals are the spacecraft’s two state-of-the-art science instruments: the High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3) infrared spectrometer and the Lunar Thermal Mapper (LTM) infrared multispectral imager. The HVM3 instrument was provided by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and LTM was built by the University of Oxford and funded by the UK Space Agency.', '“The small team is international in scope, which is more typical of larger projects,” said Andy Klesh, Lunar Trailblazer’s project systems engineer at JPL. “And unlike the norm for small missions that may only have a very focused, singular purpose, Lunar Trailblazer has two high-fidelity instruments onboard. We are really punching above our weight.”', 'Before it can use these instruments to collect science data, Lunar Trailblazer will for several months perform a series of Moon flybys, thruster bursts, and looping orbits. These highly choreographed maneuvers will eventually position the spacecraft so it can map the surface in great detail.', 'Weighing only 440 pounds (200 kilograms) and measuring 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) wide when its solar panels are fully deployed, Lunar Trailblazer is about the size of a dishwasher and has a relatively small engine. To make its four-to-seven-month trip to the Moon (depending on the launch date) as efficient as possible, the mission’s design and navigation team has planned a trajectory that will use the gravity of the Sun, Earth, and Moon to guide the spacecraft — a technique called low-energy transfer.', '“The initial boost provided by the rocket will send the spacecraft past the Moon and into deep space, and its trajectory will then be naturally reshaped by gravity after several lunar flybys and loops around Earth. This will allow it to be captured into lunar orbit with minimal propulsion needs,” said Gregory Lantoine, Lunar Trailblazer’s mission design and navigation lead at JPL. “It’s the most fuel-efficient way to get to where we need to go.”', 'As it flies past the Moon several times, the spacecraft will use small thruster bursts — aka trajectory correction maneuvers — to slowly change its orbit from highly elliptical to circular, bringing the satellite down to an altitude of about 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the Moon’s surface.', 'Once in its science orbit, Lunar Trailblazer will glide over the Moon’s surface, making 12 orbits a day and observing the surface at a variety of different times of day over the course of the mission. The satellite will also be perfectly placed to peer into the permanently shadowed craters at the Moon’s South Pole, which harbor cold traps that never see direct sunlight. If Lunar Trailblazer finds significant quantities of ice at the base of the craters, those locations could be pinpointed as a resource for future lunar explorers.', 'The data the mission collects will be transmitted to NASA’s Deep Space Network and delivered to Lunar Trailblazer’s new operations center at Caltech’s IPAC in Pasadena, California. Working alongside the mission’s experienced team will be students from Caltech and nearby Pasadena City College who are involved in all aspects of the mission, from operations and communications to developing software.', 'Lunar Trailblazer was a selection of NASA’s SIMPLEx (Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration), which provides opportunities for low-cost science spacecraft to ride-share with selected primary missions. To maintain the lower overall cost, SIMPLEx missions have a higher risk posture and lighter requirements for oversight and management. This higher risk acceptance allows NASA to test pioneering technologies, and the definition of success for these missions includes the lessons learned from more experimental endeavors.', '“We are a small mission with groundbreaking science goals, so we will succeed by embracing the flexibility that’s built into our organization,” said Lee Bennett, Lunar Trailblazer operations lead with IPAC. “Our international team consists of seasoned engineers, science team members from several institutions, and local students who are being given the opportunity to work on a NASA mission for the first time.”', 'Lunar Trailblazer is led by Principal Investigator Bethany Ehlmann of Caltech in Pasadena, California. Caltech also leads the mission’s science investigation and mission operations. This includes planning, scheduling, and sequencing of all science, instrument, and spacecraft activities during the nominal mission. Science data processing will be done in the Bruce Murray Laboratory for Planetary Visualization at Caltech. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California manages Lunar Trailblazer and provides system engineering, mission assurance, the HVM3 instrument, and mission design and navigation. Lockheed Martin Space provides the spacecraft, integrates the flight system, and supports operations under contract with Caltech. University of Oxford developed and provided the LTM instrument. Part of NASA’s Lunar Discovery Exploration Program, the mission is managed by NASA’s Planetary Mission Program Office at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.', 'For more information about Lunar Trailblazer, visit:', 'https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/lunar-trailblazer', 'Karen Fox / Molly Wasser\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\n202-358-1600\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / molly.l.wasser@nasa.gov', 'Ian J.

Space mission aims to map water on surface of the moon,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/22/space-mission-aims-to-map-water-on-surface-of-the-moon,"['A probe to be launched this week aims to pinpoint sites of lunar water, which could help plan to colonise the Earth’s satellite', 'Space engineers are set to launch an unusual mission this week when they send a probe built by UK and US researchers to the moon to map water on its surface. Lunar Trailblazer’s two year mission is scheduled to begin on Thursday when the probe is blasted into space from Florida on a Space X Falcon rocket.', 'Its goal – to seek out water on the lunar surface – may seem odd given that the moon has traditionally been viewed as an arid, desiccated world. However, scientists have recently uncovered strong hints that it possesses significant quantities of water. It will be the task of Lunar Trailblazer to reveal just how much water there is near the lunar surface and pinpoint its main locations.', 'The probe’s progress will be followed with keen interest by space engineers and astronomers who believe lunar water could play a key role in plans to set up staffed colonies on the moon. Using power provided by solar power plants, water could be turned into its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen. The former would then be used as fuel while the latter would allow astronauts to breathe.', '“This is primarily a scientific mission,” said Prof Neil Bowles, leader of the Oxford University team of physicists who built one of Lunar Trailblazer’s main instruments. “However, it should also tell us how water is transported across the lunar surface and that has implications for future lunar exploration by humans.”', 'Until recently it had been assumed that water molecules brought to the moon by meteorites and comets would decompose quickly as sunlight broke them down into hydrogen and oxygen which would then have drifted into space. However, several robotic probes have recently found compelling evidence that water, mainly in the form of ice, exists in fairly large amounts in some deep, permanently shadowed craters, with the lunar south pole offering the most promising candidates.', 'These discoveries were taken even further by India’s Chandrayaan-1 probe that found, in 2009, that traces of water could been seen on the moon’s surface far away from the poles. “It was a big surprise that changed our perceptions of what we might find on the moon,” said Bowles.', 'However, the instrument on Chandrayaan-1 that made the discovery did not have the spectral range to fully map out water on the lunar surface and Lunar Trailblazer has been designed to get round that problem. It will carry two instruments. The first is an infrared scanner that will pinpoint water and other geological features. The second, designed by Bowles and his team, is a thermal mapper that is essentially a highly advanced heat camera.', 'Working in tandem, these instruments should then be able to create a water map of the lunar surface. “We know there is water at the moon’s poles but we are not sure how it ended up there,” said Bowles. “We think there is a kind of lunar water cycle just as there is one on Earth although in the case of the one on the moon it has nothing to do with clouds or rain.”', 'There are two main scenarios, he added. “Either water is delivered by comets or meteorites that hit the lunar surface and release lots of water which then condenses in cold traps at the poles. Alternatively very thin layers of water may be formed by reactions in the lunar soil.', '“However, we do not know how that water would move around and build up into ice deposits. That is what we are trying to find out. We are interested in understanding why there is water on the moon and how it behaves there and that is important not just for our understanding of the moon but in appreciating what might be happening on other worlds that are similar to the moon, such as Mercury.”', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", '', 'Lunar Trailblazer will not be the only spacecraft scheduled to be blasted into space on Thursday, however. The launch manifest also includes the rocket’s main mission, IM-2, a lunar lander built by the US company Intuitive Machines. It is destined to settle on to the moon where it will drill beneath the surface in a bid to find water there.', 'In addition to these craft, there will be a probe – named Odin by its builder AstroForge – that will fly to a very different destination: asteroid 2022 OB5. Odin will take images there in preparation for a return mission which is planned to land on the asteroid and begin mineral extraction on its surface.', 'These missions are all part of Nasa’s commercial lunar payload services programme which has been set up to encourage companies to send small robotic landers and rovers to the moon and other near Earth destinations. The main aim is to make preparations for the eventual colonisation of the moon.']"
