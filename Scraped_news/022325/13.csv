The U.S. had proposed taking ownership of 50% of Ukraine’s critical minerals, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter.', 'Still, officials at Munich Security Conference have said there is scope to negotiate a deal that is palatable to both sides.', 'U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Saturday said such a deal could be a “game changer” in resolving the conflict and a “nightmare” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.', '“This minerals agreement between the United States and Ukraine is a game changer, because President Trump can go to the American people and say Ukraine is not a burden, it’s a benefit,” Graham said Saturday.', '“If this minerals agreement happens it’s a nightmare for Putin, because we have something to defend that we didn’t have before,” he added.', 'Ukraine is home to vast deposits of precious minerals critical for manufacturing high-tech products. The Kyiv School of Economics estimates that the country hosts deposits of 20 out of the 50 critical raw materials, including titanium, lithium and zirconium.', 'President Trump has said he wants $500 billion worth of such minerals from Ukraine to help reduce U.S. dependence on China, but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine.', 'Democratic Senator Chris Coons told CNBC Saturday that the deal could be a “positive” for both sides, provided it made security assurances for Kyiv.', '“If this is an investment opportunity where American companies and other companies from Europe would be involved in mining and processing, so that we can be independent of Chinese sources of these strategic minerals — and if his helps deepen and strengthen our partnership to help ensure the security of Ukraine going forward ... that would be a positive thing,” Coons said.', 'He added, however, that there were some descriptions of the deal that are “quite different from that.”', 'The existing U.S. proposal centers on the use of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals “as compensation” for funding already provided by the Biden administration, as well as payment for future support, the Associated Press reported current and former senior Ukrainian officials as saying Saturday.', '“The U.S. has made it very clear, their foreign policy is going to be transactional, nothing else,” Binaifer Nowrojee, president of the Open Society Foundation, told CNBC Sunday. Nevertheless, she said, Ukraine remains in a “good place to negotiate.”', 'Ukraine has long been looking to develop its critical mineral industry and an agreement with the U.S. could provide the support needed for the capital intensive work of mineral extraction and processing.', 'Nataliia Shapoval, head of KSE Institute, a think-tank within the Kyiv School of Economics, which compiled a database of Ukraine’s critical minerals, agreed that a deal could be mutually beneficial for both countries if negotiations were done “in good faith.”', '“Ukraine wants to believe that Trump wants an economics-based, serious basis for discussions with Putin. If there would be more U.S. investors in Ukraine, there would be more basis to protect Ukraine,” Shapoval told CNBC Thursday via video call.', 'Still, she emphasized that any agreement must contain more than reparations and would need to go hand in hand with a wider deal with Russia to end the fighting.', '“If Trump is not planning to use critical raw materials as part of the framework for negotiations with Russia, and is just thinking we want reparations for its help, it’s a waste of time for everyone involved,” she added.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

What are Ukraine’s critical minerals – and why does Trump want them?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/what-are-ukraines-critical-minerals-and-why-does-trump-want-them,"['Zelenskyy has rebuffed US’s initial attempt to take control of minerals as downpayment for its aid in war with Russia', 'Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has rebuffed an initial attempt by the US to corner his country’s critical minerals as a downpayment for continued military and economic aid for its war with Russia.', 'Three sources told the Reuters news agency that the US had proposed taking ownership of 50% of Ukraine’s critical minerals. Zelenskyy did not dismiss the offer out of hand, but said it did not yet contain the security provisions Kyiv needed.', 'Critical minerals are the metals and other raw materials needed for the production of hi-tech products, particularly those associated with the green energy transition, but also consumer electronics, artificial intelligence infrastructure and weapons.', 'The rush to tackle climate breakdown and move away from fossil fuels has triggered a rush for energy transition minerals such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which are useful for electrification of transport and the construction of wind turbines. The same minerals and others are also used for the manufacture of mobile phones, AI datacentres and arms such as F-35 fighter aircraft, placing them in high demand.', 'As the world’s economy and technology transforms, the value of critical minerals has soared and geopolitical competition for access to them is rising. In 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the market for energy transition minerals had reached £320bn in 2022, double its value five years earlier. And if countries fully implement their clean energy and climate pledges, demand is expected to more than double by 2030 and triple by 2040, the agency says.', 'The term critical minerals is not a scientific term so much as a political term, and different countries have different lists of critical minerals depending on their domestic and geopolitical objectives.', 'In 2022, the US Geological Survey (USGS) published a list of 50 minerals, from aluminium to zirconium, that it regarded as “play[ing] a significant role in our national security, economy, renewable energy development and infrastructure”. Notable inclusions were arsenic, for semiconductors; beryllium, used as an alloying agent in aerospace and defence industries; cobalt, lithium and graphite, crucial for manufacturing batteries; indium, which makes screens respond to a finger touch; and tellurium, which is used for solar power generation.', 'The US’s Energy Act stipulates that the list must be updated every three years, which means this year it will be up for review, and it will be interesting to see which minerals appear or disappear given the new political environment in the country.', 'Rare earth elements (REEs) are a subset of 17 critical minerals that are variously indispensable for mobile phones, electric vehicles, missile guidance systems and other electronics, industrial and energy applications.', 'Despite their name, most of the rare earth elements are not particularly rare, but their extraction and refining is fiendishly difficult – and environmentally highly destructive – meaning production is concentrated in very few places, mainly China.', 'REEs include europium, used in nuclear power station control rods; dysprosium, gandolinium and praseodymium, used in the magnets in your mobile phone; and gadolinium, holmium and ytterbium, used in lasers among other things.', 'A 2022 article by the chair of Ukraine’s Association of Geologists, Hanna Liventseva, claimed her country contained about 5% of the world’s mineral resources, despite covering only 0.4% of the globe’s surface, thanks to a complex geology that takes in all three of the main components of the earth’s crust.', 'According to Ukraine’s own data, cited by Reuters, the country has deposits of 22 of the 34 minerals identified as critical by the EU, including rare earths such as lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, erbium and yttrium.', 'Before the outbreak of war with Russia, Ukraine was a key supplier of titanium, producing about 7% of global output in 2019, according to European Commission research. It also claimed 500,000 tons of lithium reserves, and one-fifth of the world’s graphite, a crucial component of nuclear power stations.', 'However, with Russia controlling about one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory, much of these reserves have been lost. According to estimates by Ukrainian thinktanks cited by Reuters, up to 40% of Ukraine’s metal resources are under occupation. Russian troops also occupy at least two of Ukraine’s lithium deposits, one in Donetsk and another in Zaporizhzhia.', 'There is one big reason Trump is so keen to get his hands on Ukraine’s critical minerals: China. More than ever, the Asian superpower is the world’s factory and that means, wherever in the world critical minerals are torn from the ground, it remains a crucial staging point on the supply chain.', 'Most of the world’s processing capacity for critical minerals is in China. According to the IEA, China’s share of refining is about 35% for nickel, 50-70% for lithium and cobalt, and nearly 90% for REEs. Its dominance in the latter, especially, is overwhelming. According to USGS data, in 2024 China accounted for almost half the world’s REE reserves.', 'With Trump effectively instigating a trade war with China with his imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese goods, US access to critical minerals is potentially under threat. As mentioned earlier, the world is being gripped by an unseemly scramble for mineral wealth. They are the building blocks of the economy of the future, and if the US doesn’t get its hands on them, someone else will.']"
U.S.-Ukrainian Mineral Deal Getting Close To Fruition,https://www.twz.com/news-features/u-s-ukrainian-mineral-deal-getting-close-to-fruition,"['HOWARD ALTMAN', 'POSTED ON FEB 22, 2025', '(NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES OF UKRAINE)', 'Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky will soon sign a minerals agreement with the United States potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Friday. That move is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to end the war with Russia and a deal the American leader says will recoup billions in military aid provided to Kyiv.', '“Here’s the bottom line: President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,” Waltz said during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), according to The Guardian.', '', 'During his evening address on Friday, Zelensky hinted that a deal could be close.', '“Today, teams from Ukraine and the U.S. are working on a draft agreement between our governments,” he said. “This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome – a just result.”', '', 'An agreement could be signed as soon as Saturday, “although it is not yet complete, people briefed on the talks said,” The Wall Street Journal reported. The exact terms could not be learned. Asked if this would go through, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday: “I think they want it. They feel good about it.”', 'U.S. and Ukrainian officials negotiated all night into Friday morning to ink an agreement and end the souring Zelesnky-Trump relations, Axios reported, citing a U.S. official and a source with direct knowledge of the issue.', '', 'The pending deal would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s deposits of critical minerals including aluminum, gallium and titanium, Waltz said.  As we previously reported, Ukraine possesses materials that are essential components of microchips and electric vehicle batteries and have significant military value. Trump has been touting this as a way to reduce the burden for supporting Ukraine, with Waltz claiming US aid to Kyiv has exceeded $175 billion, The Guardian reported.', 'That figure, as we have explained before, contradicts information compiled by the Kiel Institute For The World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker, which shows that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with a little less than $120 billion from the U.S. More than half – $66.5 billion – was for direct security assistance in the form of donated weapons, according to Pentagon figures.', 'Last week, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, presented Zelensky with the draft proposal for that plan, with Ukraine providing approximately $500 billion worth of rare earth elements to the U.S., The Guardian explained.', 'There were claims that Bessent told the Ukrainian president to sign the deal on the spot, but we can’t confirm that.', 'News about the looming mineral deal came as the war of words between Trump and Zelensky continues to escalate in the wake of peace talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Moscow that did not include Ukraine.', 'In comments to Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade on Friday, Trump blasted Zelensky as a poor negotiator, and called Bessent’s trip “dangerous” and “a waste of time.”', 'The pair “couldn’t even come close” to a deal, Trump told Kilmeade. Ukrainian officials, however, said that they had only a few hours to study it before it was presented to them.', 'Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was “very upset” with Zelensky over the deal, claiming the Ukrainian leader misrepresented the outcome of a meeting he had with Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance.', 'Zelensky said he wanted to make the deal but needed the approval of his legislature, Rubio said.', 'However, “I read two days later that Zelensky is out there saying ‘I rejected the deal. I told him, No way that we’re not doing that.’ Well, that’s not what happened in that meeting,” Rubio explained. “So you start to get upset by something. We’re trying to help these guys.”', '', 'As we previously noted, it’s one thing to strike a deal, but something else entirely to extract and process the resources.', 'A little more than half of Ukraine’s mineral resources are contained in the four regions Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed in September 2022, and of which his army occupies a considerable swathe, The Independent reported earlier this month. That includes Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though Kherson holds little value in terms of minerals, the publication added. The Crimean peninsula, annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014, also holds billions in mineral wealth, The Independent added.', 'Regardless of the difficulty though, it seems that both sides see value in a mineral deal. Signing it could go a long way to cooling the tensions between Trump and Zelensky that have erupted over the past week.', 'On the battlefield, the bulk of the fighting continues to rage in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, but despite strong Russian pressure, its forces are making few advances. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment.', '', 'Representatives from the U.S. and Russia have been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding the future of the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Friday. That news comes as Zelensky has fumed over being cut out of a recent negotiation session between Washington and Moscow.', 'The informal meetings were described as “track two meetings,” a type of unofficial diplomacy meant to lower tension, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed sources.', '', 'Trump continued to blast Zelensky over the latter’s concerns about being left out of peace negotiations.', '“…he complains that he’s not in a meeting that we’re having with Saudi Arabia trying to intervene in peace,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade. “Well, he’s been at meetings for three years with …a president who didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He’s been at meetings for three years, and nothing got done. So I don’t think it’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you, he’s been there for three years. He makes it very hard to make deals.”', 'Kilmeade repeatedly interrupted, trying to get the president to acknowledge that the war was started by Russia.', '“But you know who is to blame for that,” Kilmeade interjected. Russian President “…Vladimir Putin that did the invasion, unwarranted, to try to take back land he had no right to…”', '', 'Trump also asserted that Russia has the upper hand in any peace negotiations because of all the land it has captured in Ukraine, the BBC reported.', '“I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they’ve taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,” Trump told the BBC on Air Force One.', 'When asked if he trusts that Russia wants peace, Trump said “I do.”', '', 'Russia used the first round of the recently concluded negotiations with the U.S. over ending the war in Ukraine to demand the withdrawal of NATO forces from the alliance’s eastern flank, the Financial Times reported. That triggered concern in European capitals that the Trump administration “could acquiesce to seal a peace deal,” the publication suggested.', 'The Romanian president’s chief of staff and adviser for defense and national security said while the U.S. delegation had rejected Moscow’s demand, there were no guarantees that Washington would not eventually make this concession to Vladimir Putin.', '“’As far as I understand, the situation can change from hour to hour or from day to day,’”’ Cristian Diaconescu told Antena3 television,” FT noted. Diaconescu was referring to Trump’s scathing criticism of Zelensky as well as the American leader’s “concessions made to Russia even before talks began,” according to FT.', 'Diaconescu “stressed that the Russian delegation to the talks in Riyadh earlier this week ‘failed to convince the Americans’ on a NATO withdrawal and that further visits by the leaders of the UK and France to Washington next week would seek to persuade Trump not to give in to this demand,” FT wrote.', 'There is a growing list of U.S. legislators objecting to Trump’s harsh comments about Zelensky, including calling the Ukrainian leader a “dictator.”', 'Several Republican Senators broke ranks with the president about that assessment, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and John Thune of South Dakota.', '“I would certainly never refer to President Zelensky as a dictator,” Murkowski told reporters. “It is quite clear who started the war. It was absolutely Russia at Putin’s directive.” ', '', 'Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), another staunch Trump supporter, also questioned Trump’s support for Putin.', '“I believe his instincts are pretty good,” Tillis said of Trump. “But what I’m telling you, whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin in the future of a stable globe, better go to Ukraine. They better go to Europe. They better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer, and the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.”', '', 'Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona took a similar stance.', '“To call one of our allies ‘a dictator’ while they’re defending their country against an actual dictator is ridiculous,” Kelly Xed. “I’ve met with President Zelensky multiple times and understand how hard the people of Ukraine are fighting to defend their homeland.  I’ll continue to stand with them against Putin even if Trump won’t.”', '', 'Russia is preparing to announce a supposed “victory” in the war against Ukraine by the “round date” of February 24, 2025, the third anniversary of the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claimed on Friday. “Moreover, the aforementioned plans may also include talk of ‘Russia’s victory over NATO,’ since Moscow’s propaganda has long described the war against Ukraine as a war with the Alliance.”', '', 'ISW produced a fact sheet it claimed counters several statements Trump has made about the war, U.S. support for it, and the ensuing negotiation process.', '', 'U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly expected to provide details about a potential Anglo-French peacekeeping force in Ukraine when he meets with Trump in Washington next week, according to The Telegraph.', 'The plan calls for fewer than 30,000 troops “deployed to Ukrainian cities, ports and other critical infrastructure sites, such as nuclear power stations, far away from the current front lines,” the publication reported.', 'Starmer will reportedly urge Trump “to have U.S. fighter jets and missiles on standby in Eastern Europe to respond with lethal force if Russia breaks the terms of any armistice,” The Telegraph noted, citing “Western officials briefed on the plans.”', '“Rather than stationing a much bigger force in the war-torn country, the mission will rely on ‘technical monitoring,’ including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, drones and satellites to provide a ‘complete picture of what is going on,” The Telegraph stated, citing a Western official. “The operation would be backed up by enough firepower to ‘monitor and shoot those attacks down,’” to reopen Ukraine’s airspace and enable commercial flights, the source added.', 'Naval patrol vessels would also be sent to the Black Sea to monitor Russian threats to commercial shipping routes.', '', 'French President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of increasing his nation’s military spending from 2.1% to 5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to the French France TV Info news outlet. The move comes out of concern that the U.S. will “no longer protect Europe via NATO,” the publication noted.', '“We are entering a time when we will have to […] reinvest even more, French and European, to strengthen our defense and our security,” Macron said, adding that he did not know “if 5% is the right figure for France, but in any case, we will have to go up.”', '', 'EU countries are preparing a military aid package worth at least €6 billion ($6.3 billion) for Ukraine, Politico reported, citing three EU diplomats. That aid was being gathered “to shore up Kyiv’s strategic position at the outset of U.S.-led talks with Russia, the news outlet explained.', 'The package, which should include everything from 1.5 million artillery shells to air defense systems, “would mark one of the EU’s largest military aid packages since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 and could be unveiled ahead of a highly symbolic visit by European commissioners to Kyiv on Feb. 24,” Politico noted.  ', 'Two of the diplomats said the package could be “increased to up to €10 billion ($10.5 billion) or more as countries dig into their inventories to see what they can send to Ukraine,” Politico posited. EU foreign ministers are expected to examine the package on Monday, during a regular gathering in Brussels next week.', '', 'ISW noted in a recent X thread that “Russia will likely face several materiel, manpower, and economic constraints in the coming months that will put pressure on the Kremlin’s ability to maintain its war effort in Ukraine in the medium- to long-term — if Russian forces’ loss rates in Ukraine continue at the current tempo.”', 'In addition, despite Putin’s efforts to paint the Russian economy as robust, inflation in that country has been rising due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,', '“Russia primarily recruits volunteer soldiers through large individual payments and has had to increase payments significantly to sustain recruitment. Russian lenders show signs of uncertainty about Russia’s economic future and the solvency of Kremlin coffers,” ISW stated. “Putin’s protracted war in Ukraine is destroying Russia’s national wealth through the steady erosion of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and growing inflation. The Kremlin has been trying in recent months to reduce state spending on benefits to military personnel, indicating that the Kremlin is aware that it cannot continue such high spending and must find ways to cut costs.”', 'These factors are contributing to Russia’s current force generation apparatus appearing to be “unable to recruit the manpower that the Russian military needs to sustain Russia’s current rate of offensive operations.” ISW posited.', 'To convince the Russian populous not to worry, the Kremlin “has been engaged in an information campaign in recent months that aims to posture the Russian economy as strong and stable to both domestic and international audiences, and the state of Russia’s economy is likely more strained than Kremlin officials publicly acknowledge,” ISW suggested.', '', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk “has called on the European Union to confiscate the assets of the Russian Central Bank, which are frozen due to sanctions, to finance future financial support for Ukraine,” Euronews reported.', '“So far, the bloc has only used the extraordinary revenues of the assets held in its territory, estimated to be worth €210 billion (about $220 billion), to deliver financial and military assistance to the war-torn nation,” the publication reported. “The option of asset confiscation remains a slippery slope, however, because the money is considered Russia’s sovereign property and is therefore protected by international law.”', '“Enough talking, it’s time to act” Donald Tusk posted on X on Thursday. “Let’s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets.”', '', 'Financial Times has produced a documentary claiming to show that Russia has a policy of executing Ukrainians who have surrendered.', 'The film “investigates the rise in cases of Russian soldiers executing Ukrainian POWs and reveals the likely identity of the Russian behind killings, FT reported Christopher Miller noted.', '', 'The onslaught of Russian missiles and drones against Ukraine has been so fierce that the nation has run out of interceptors, Zelensky said in an appeal for more.', '“We have nothing to shoot down missiles with,” the Ukrainian leader recently complained. “The commander calls me at 5 a.m. and says: “There are 8 targets approaching, but we have no missiles for the Patriot air defense system.”', 'Ukraine has received several Patriot batteries and a large number of missiles from the U.S. and allied nations, including the recent donation of about 90 interceptors provided by America from Israeli stocks.', '', 'It is no surprise that drones are playing a key role for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. A new study by RUSI shows just how effective they’ve been, causing the majority of damage to Russian equipment of any weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal. That’s despite challenges presented by electronic warfare (EW), weather and interference caused by multiple drones operating in the same area.', '“Tactical UAVs have significant limitations,” the report states. “Between 60% and 80% of Ukrainian [first-person view] FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators. Of those that do strike their targets, a majority fail to destroy the target system when striking armored vehicles.”', 'The success rate in wounding infantry is high, the report notes. ', '“Furthermore, there are long periods where either EW or the weather significantly degrades UAV operations. With FPVs that are remotely piloted by radio frequency, it is also difficult to concentrate multiple drones in time and space because they can interfere with one another’s guidance systems,” the report continues.', '“Despite these limitations, tactical UAVs currently account for 60%–70% of damaged and destroyed Russian systems,” RUSI found.', '', 'To help defend against Ukrainian drone attacks, some Russian troops are kitted out with backpack-style electronic warfare countermeasures bristling with antennae and hooked into a portable power supply.

Only three countries—Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea—are gaining direct experience in full-scale 21st-century warfare.

Assessing the Viability of a U.S.-Ukraine Minerals Deal,https://www.csis.org/analysis/assessing-viability-us-ukraine-minerals-deal,"['Photo: Manuel Augusto Moreno/Getty Images', 'Critical Questions by Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz', 'Published February 21, 2025', 'U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are in discussions regarding an agreement that would grant the United States access to Ukraine’s critical minerals and other valuable resources. While the specifics are still being finalized, the deal would allow the United States to obtain a portion of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in compensation for the financial aid provided to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia and potentially for future aid.', 'Q1: What is the proposed minerals deal between the United States and Ukraine?', 'A1: In Kyiv on February 12, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent presented President Zelensky with the first draft of a minerals cooperation agreement. The deal called for 50 percent of Ukraine’s resulting mineral and natural resources revenues to go to the United States as payment for previous military support for the war against Russia. This would include not only revenues from rare earth mining but the “entire economic value associated with resources in Ukraine” including uranium, lithium, oil, gas, and even some port revenues. The deal also specified that U.S. companies must hold 50 percent ownership of Ukraine’s rare earth elements deposits. The deal would override all of Ukraine’s other trade agreements.', 'Zelensky refused to sign the agreement as it included no security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump has said he wants $500 billion worth of Ukrainian minerals as compensation—but Zelensky claims that U.S. military aid has totaled nowhere close to $500 billion. Negotiations are currently ongoing, with a second, less binding memorandum of understanding presented days later by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Zelensky reportedly responded he could not sign the agreement without approval from Parliament. Zelensky’s team is reportedly working on a counter-proposal that includes explicit security guarantees.', 'Zelensky is not necessarily opposed to a minerals agreement with the United States in which Ukraine offers its strategic resources in exchange for continued military support and security guarantees. Ukrainian officials have confirmed that Zelensky has called the idea of exchanging “critical resources” as part of the “Victory Plan” he presented to Trump during a meeting last fall. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials are increasing pressure on the Ukrainian president to sign the current deal. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has called the co-investment deal “the best security guarantee they could ever hope for.” President Trump has begun issuing ultimatums, suggesting he may work towards a peace deal with Moscow instead if Zelensky does not cooperate.', 'Q2: How likely is the proposed U.S.-Ukraine deal to move the needle on U.S. minerals security?', 'A2: It’s unlikely to be consequential in the medium term given the barriers to investment. First, there is very limited data on whether Ukraine’s rare earth elements and other strategic materials are commercially viable to mine. According to the former director general of the Ukrainian Geological Survey, there is no modern assessment of rare earth reserves in Ukraine. Existing mapping was done 30–60 years ago by the Soviet Union and relies on old exploration methods. Considerations that impact the commercial feasibility of mining deposits include depth, ore grade, by-products, and location.', 'Second, the war has wiped out essential infrastructure. Mining is among the most energy-intensive industries worldwide. It accounts for approximately 38 percent of global industrial energy use and around 15 percent of total electricity consumption globally. Between 2022 and 2023, nearly half of Ukraine’s power generation capacity was either occupied by Russian forces, destroyed, or damaged, while about half of the country’s large network substations sustained damage from missile and drone strikes. As a result, Ukraine has been left with only about one-third of its prewar power capacity. There will need to be a significant buildout of energy infrastructure for mineral exploration or production can commence.', 'And finally, mining companies are hesitant to make long-term investments given the looming security risk in Ukraine. Mining is a long-term and capital-intensive investment. Globally, it takes an average of 18 years to develop a mine—and costs $500 million and $1 billion to build a mine and separation plant. A new mine can run for over 50 years. Confidence in the political and economic stability of a jurisdiction is critical given the size and longevity of the investment. While Trump, Putin, and Zelensky may reach a peace deal, the threat of further conflict and land expropriation will loom given the long-standing nature of the conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, started 11 years ago. After Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution, Russian forces took control of Crimea in early 2014. Russia later engaged in the conflict in the Donbas, leading to Russian and Russian-backed forces occupying parts of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.', 'Q3: What do these developments mean for U.S.-Ukraine relations under Trump, and what are the implications for the future of Ukraine and NATO security?', 'A3: Trump has consistently vocalized throughout his campaign run and first few weeks in office that he would be taking a different approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict compared to the Biden administration over the last three years. While the Biden administration aimed to isolate Russia on the international stage via tightening sanctions, Trump has opened diplomatic doors to Moscow with a 90-minute phone call weeks into his second term, high-level in-person talks with representatives from the administration, and a tentative meeting between President Trump and President Putin in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Additionally, while Biden consistently prioritized arming and aiding Ukraine, Trump has taken a more transactional approach and questioned the utility of continuing to financially and militarily bolster Ukraine.', 'Tensions have risen considerably between Trump and Zelensky, as critical mineral resource access is the latest arena for Trump to focus his transactional methods of diplomacy. But the viability of the deal remains to be seen as tensions continue to rise between the two world leaders. Trump seemingly blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia and called Zelensky a “dictator without elections.” Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of any security guarantees for the country.', 'Under the Trump administration, Ukraine, Europe, and NATO as a whole are likely to face a great decline in security guarantees from the United States without offering strategic resources or financial compensation in return.', 'Q4: Is there any precedent for a resource-for-aid swap?', 'A4: It’s an unprecedented move for the United States—but it’s a tried and tested tool out of China’s playbook. The Sino-Congolaise Des Mines (Sicomines) agreement, signed in 2007, is a prime example. This resource-for-infrastructure arrangement granted Chinese companies access to cobalt, copper, and other minerals in return for infrastructure development. China committed approximately $3 billion to infrastructure projects, securing mining rights to deposits near Kolwezi in the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), valued at an estimated $93 billion. At the time, it was the only way for the DRC to get the capital needed to build. However, in the long term, the DRC got shortchanged. The government recently revisited the resource for infrastructure deal with Chinese investors out of concern that some mining contracts are not sufficiently benefiting the country.', 'Gracelin Baskaran is the director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

The resolution condemns Russian aggression and reaffirms Ukraine’s sovereignty and pre-2014 international borders, before Russia annexed Crimea and started a covert military takeover of the eastern Donbas region.', 'This is the first time since the war started that the US has failed to back the resolution. About 50 countries are likely to support it, including the UK and most EU governments, it is understood.', 'The White House was blocking a similar statement from the G7 group of countries blaming Russia for the conflict, the Financial Times reported. It said US envoys had objected to the phrase “Russian aggression” and had not signed off on a plan to allow Zelenskyy to address G7 leaders by video.', 'Meanwhile, the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the White House could be willing to lift sanctions on Russia, or increase them, depending on Moscow’s readiness to negotiate. Bessent visited Kyiv this week, presenting Zelenskyy with the demand for minerals and saying it was “payback” for previous US military assistance.', 'Bessent said he had received assurances Ukraine would sign the deal.
