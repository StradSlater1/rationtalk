', 'MacBook Airs have traditionally been lightweight and slim laptops from Apple. The upcoming M4 MacBook Air will likely continue with this design philosophy. The MacBook Air models coming in March are expected to retain the sleek, thin profile that was introduced with the M2 versions. Interestingly we could see some advanced features of the MacBook Pro in the Air models this time. ', 'The new MacBook Airs could come with the ability to connect to two external displays simultaneously while keeping the MacBook’s lid open making it an appealing choice for multitaskers who have to jump between multiple monitors to maintain their workflow. Another potential upgrade could be an improved front camera, equipped with Apple’s Center Stage technology, which ensures users stay centered in the frame during video calls.  ', 'As the official release date approaches, Apple is preparing its marketing, sales, and retail teams for the launch, says Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. In preparation for the new models, Apple has begun to allow existing stock of the current MacBook Air models to deplete- a strategic move to ensure that customers will have access to the latest models right when they’re ready to make a purchase, without experiencing any delays.  ', 'In conclusion, the upcoming M4 MacBook Air is poised to deliver substantial upgrades in performance, design, and functionality, making it a powerful and versatile addition to Apple’s laptop lineup. With its faster M4 chip, enhanced graphical capabilities, and potential feature additions from the MacBook Pro, the new MacBook Air is expected to attract a broad range of consumers, from everyday users to creative professionals, all seeking a blend of portability and power.

Here’s how it works.', 'The M4 MacBook Air is widely expected to launch imminently, with the new chip touted to bring performance and efficiency improvements to one of Apple’s best MacBooks. And it looks like we won’t even have to wait until its release to find out its performance.', 'That’s because a benchmark has just leaked on the Geekbench website. The test results were published on February 19 and show a device running macOS 15.2 and bearing a ten-core M4 chip and 24GB of memory.', 'In terms of performance, the M4 chip in this MacBook scored 54,806 in the Metal graphics benchmark. Compare that to the 13-inch iPad Pro with M4 chip, which scored a very similar 54,064. Considering both devices are known for their thinness and fanless cooling, the slim margins between them make sense.', 'Labelled as “Mac16,12,” the mysterious MacBook is thought to be Apple’s upcoming M4 MacBook Air because it doesn’t match any existing Mac codenames. It does, however, line up with a Mac identifier that Apple itself accidentally leaked – one that was attributed to an M4 MacBook Air.', '', 'It’s possible that this benchmark was faked to give the appearance of belonging to an unannounced piece of Apple hardware. That seems unlikely, though, as it’s broadly in line with what we’ve come to expect from the M4 chip.', 'We mentioned the iPad Pro score above as a comparison point, but we can also see how this leaked benchmark does against the M4 MacBook Pro. On Geekbench, a sample Metal test scored 57,596, an improved result versus the MacBook Air that shouldn’t come as a surprise given that the MacBook Pro has active cooling that can help boost its performance.', 'So, all things point towards this leak being a believable, perhaps genuine result for the upcoming M4 MacBook Air.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', 'Aside from the new M4 chip, the next MacBook Air could get an improved LCD display (sadly an OLED panel is still a few years away), a better webcam, and stronger support for connecting multiple monitors.', 'It’s widely expected to launch this Spring (sometime between now and June), with Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman claiming it will be on sale “by March at the latest.”', ""Alex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.
