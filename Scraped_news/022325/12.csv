No title found,https://www.thefp.com/p/new-yorks-vigil-for-hassan-nasrallah,"['On Sunday evening, multiple collegiate chapters for Students for Justice in Palestine held a vigil service for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah—who was killed in an Israeli air strike on September 27—in New York City’s Washington Square Park. The poster encouraged attendees to bring flags, flowers, and candles, and of course mask-wearing was “highly suggested.” The strangest thing about this vigil was not its lack of ceremony or prayer, but that very few of the 100 or so in attendance knew who Nasrallah was.', 'Nasrallah was a founding member of Hezbollah, the Shia Islamist terrorist militia formed in 1982 with the aim of eradicating Israel. The following year, the group carried out a devastating bombing attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 230 Marines and 21 others. In 2012, Hezbollah targeted a bus carrying young Israeli tourists in Burgas, Bulgaria, resulting in five deaths and 32 injuries. In the days following Hamas’s October 7 attacks, Nasrallah authorized the terrorist group to launch rockets into Northern Israel, forcing nearly 70,000 people to flee their homes.', 'Under the Washington Square Arch, organizers set up a table with a Hezbollah flag, photos and paintings of Nasrallah, and dozens of small electric candles. But that was where the “vigil” ended. Within minutes, it quickly became a loud protest—people blew air horns and shouted “Free Palestine!”', 'Beyond the small table with Nasrallah memorabilia, there were college students, families with young children, a few dozen police officers, and one keffiyeh-clad man playing the drums. “From Palestine to Mexico, all these walls have got to go,” protesters chanted to the drumbeat.', 'One protester who did not share his name told us he knew who Nasrallah was and said he was “a hero,” and made sure to clarify that he was “not a Hezbollah member” himself.', 'Most of the people The Free Press spoke with said they supported Hamas and Hezbollah, even if they didn’t know who Nasrallah was. Haniya, a college-aged woman with a cheetah-print headscarf, said she showed up to “stand in solidarity with Hezbollah, Hamas, and the entire Resistance Axis in the Middle East.” When asked about the murders of the Bibas children, she said, “I don’t think any person from Palestine would celebrate a dead baby. That’s the difference between people with humanity and people without.”', 'Another vigil attendee, Julia, a Jewish woman in her late 40s, wore a keffiyeh and a pin with Zionist crossed out attached to her leather crossbody bag. Julia said she had seen the videos showing Gazan civilians cheering around the coffins of the Bibas children, whose corpses were released on February 20 as part of the recent hostage deal.', 'But she didn’t believe Hamas was responsible for their deaths. “I one hundred percent believe the Hamas version, that they died under Israeli bombing,” she said. “They were killed by Netanyahu.” She added that she found the parade of coffins to be “very dignified.” When we asked what she thought about a culture that cheers for children in caskets, Julia reasoned that “Palestinians care about the dead. Maybe they’re cheering that the family is going back.”', 'Across police barricades pro-Israel protesters launched a counterdemonstration, where some screamed, “Nasrallah is fertilizer!”', 'One woman wearing a MAGA hat and Jewish-star scarf, Evette Stark, told us she has been living in Greenwich Village for more than 30 years. She has seen many protests come through the neighborhood’s Washington Square Park, including gay pride and civil rights marches—which she says she proudly took part in. But Stark has become enraged with “woke bullshit” and demonstrators’ open embrace of terrorist organizations since October 7.', '“Anybody who’s supporting an organization like that needs to have their head examined,” Stark said.', 'Back on the other side of the barricades, a protester named Chucky wore a Palestinian flag around his neck like a cape, and a utility vest with a body camera. He was there to “keep the Zionists away,” he said, and was worried that a fight might break out. When asked about Nasrallah and Hezbollah, Chucky said, “I’m not going to speak on Nasrallah’s history. You can do your own research.”', 'Moments later, he admitted: “I don’t know much about Hezbollah.”']"

Several foreign delegations attended the funeral, including the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, and several Iraqi lawmakers.', '“I can’t even express how I feel, it feels like my father or grandfather I died. Most of us still don’t believe he’s actually dead,” said Mohammed Khalifeh, a Lebanese man who traveled from Australia for the funeral.', 'Nasrallah was born into a working-class family in Beirut in 1960, though he was originally from south Lebanon. One of the founding members of Hezbollah, he was the longest-serving leader of the group and was famed for his charisma and skills as an orator.', 'He became a celebrated figure in Lebanon for Hezbollah’s role in ending Israel’s 18-year occupation of south Lebanon in 2000, although that image was tarnished after the group’s intervention in Syria’s civil war in support of the long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad. The group’s dominance of Lebanon’s politics over the last two decades also engendered resentment among its opponents.', 'Mourners wept as Nasrallah and Safieddine’s caskets were paraded around the stadium and threw rings, jackets and scarves for pallbearers to rub on the coffins and return to them as mementoes of the late leaders. As the caskets were unveiled, four Israeli fighter jets flew low over the stadium, prompting cries of “Death to Israel!”.', 'Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said the planes were “conveying a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel and attacks Israel – that will be the end of him. You will specialise in funerals – and we will specialise in victories.”.', 'Israeli fighter jets bombed south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley before and during the funeral ceremony, despite the ceasefire agreement signed months earlier.', 'Nasrallah’s death marked the beginning of an escalation in the Hezbollah-Israel war, which up until then had mostly been defined by low-level, tit-for-tat-style fighting in Lebanon’s border region.', 'Hezbollah attacked Israel on 8 October 2023 “in solidarity” with Hamas’s attack from Gaza on Israel the day before. The conflict was confined mainly to the Lebanese border until a dramatic Israeli escalation and ground invasion in south Lebanon in late September 2024, which left more than 3,000 people in Lebanon dead and displaced more than a million people.', 'Fighting officially ended under a ceasefire agreement and Israeli troops mostly withdrew on 18 February, though Israeli troops have remained in five points in south Lebanon and continue to strike targets periodically.', 'Despite the organisation’s massive losses and the immense humanitarian cost of the war, Hezbollah’s followers said on Sunday that they remained undeterred.', '“They thought that after they killed our leaders that we would become weak and that they could occupy Lebanon, but they couldn’t do it,” said Lina Jawad, a 27-year-old designer who lives in Beirut.', 'Hezbollah’s secretary general, Naim Qassem, whose speech during the ceremony was televised from a remote location, said the group would “not submit” and would not accept Israeli forces remaining in the country.', 'The group’s status in the country and influence on the state after the war has been diminished, with Lebanon’s new government attempting to disarm the non-state group.', 'Hezbollah has long claimed its forces acted a deterrent to Israeli invasions, although some of the Lebanese public has grown frustrated with the now-weakened militant group.', 'In the government’s first statement last week, it dropped any references to the right to “armed resistance” – a reference to Hezbollah’s right to hold weapons – the first time since 2000 that the state did not pay homage to Hezbollah.', 'In a meeting with an Iranian delegation on Sunday, the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, said the country was “tired of others’ wars” and that Lebanon had paid a “heavy price” for the Palestinian cause.', 'The state faces the task of reconstruction, after large swathes of the country were levelled by Israeli bombing.

That he was only buried on Sunday underscores the militant group’s weakened state, after an Israeli military campaign in Lebanon last autumn nearly wiped out the group’s top military brass and killed thousands of its fighters, in addition to hundreds of civilians.', 'A ceasefire agreement between Hezbollah and Israel was signed last November, ending a months-long war, but drove the militant group deeper underground with Israel continuing to strike what it describes as Hezbollah targets.', 'Nasrallah’s death marks the end of an era for a militant group that grew from a rag-tag group of guerrilla fighters in 1982 to a regional force whose influence spanned at least four countries.', 'He was elected leader of the armed group in 1992 as a 32-year-old cleric. He went on to preside over a guerrilla campaign in southern Lebanon that ultimately drove Israeli forces out of the country in 2000, ending a 22-year occupation. In 2006, he led Hezbollah militants in an all-out war against Israel, which devastated large parts of Lebanon but foiled Israel’s stated goal of dismantling the group.', 'When wars raged in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, Nasrallah’s forces intervened on behalf of groups backed by Iran, shoring up Tehran’s support.', 'But Hezbollah’s fortunes changed after the Hamas-led surprise attack on Israel which killed around 1,200 people on October 7, 2023. The militant group launched daily rocket attacks on Israel’s northernmost territory, in support of Hamas, displacing some 60,000 Israelis. Around 100,000 Lebanese residents of the south were also displaced in Israeli attacks as part of a tit-for-tat that spanned nearly a year before it spiralled into an all-out war last September.', 'Nasrallah called it a “supportive front” that he said aimed to pressure Israel into ceasing its retaliatory offensive in Gaza, which has laid waste to large parts of the besieged territory and killed over 48,000 people.', 'In mid-September, Israel detonated explosives implanted in thousands of pagers and walkie talkies carried by Hezbollah members and assassinated several of the group’s leaders, laying bare Israel’s thorough infiltration of the armed group.', 'Severely weakened, Hezbollah’s future as a militant group is being called into question. Israel has vowed to continue to strike the group’s positions until the group disarms and has maintained five strategic positions inside Lebanon’s southern-most territory, breaching the November ceasefire agreement.', 'The group, which enjoys broad support among Shia Muslims across the region, is a designated terror organization in the US and many other Western countries.', 'Domestically, the group has come under increasing pressure to lay down its arms. That culminated with the newly elected President Joseph Aoun’s inaugural speech in January when he called on weapons to be monopolized under the authority of the state.', 'Hezbollah has long resisted calls to give up their arms, which it argues have prevented Israel’s reoccupation of the country.
