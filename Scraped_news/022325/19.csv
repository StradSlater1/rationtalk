European leaders hold crisis security talks as US signals transatlantic reset,https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-hold-crisis-security-talks-as-us-signals-transatlantic-reset/7978667.html,"['Print', 'European leaders held a crisis security meeting Monday in Paris after a blizzard of diplomatic interventions by Washington in recent days that have raised doubts over the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of European security.', 'British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders were among those attending the emergency summit at the Elysee Palace.', '', 'Starmer spoke to reporters after the meeting.', ""“At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole and therefore vital for Britain's national interest,” he said."", '“It\'s clear the U.S. is not going to leave NATO. But we Europeans will have to do more. The issue of burden-sharing is not new, but it is now pressing. And Europeans will have to step up, both in terms of spending and the capabilities that we provide.""', ""“Europe must play its role, and I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement. ... But there must be a U.S. backstop, because a U.S. security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again,” Starmer told reporters in Paris."", 'Scholz, who faces elections at the end of this week, echoed calls for Europe and Ukraine to be part of the peace talks.', '“It is now very clear to us that we must continue to support Ukraine. And it must and can rely on us that this will be the case. We welcome the fact that there are talks on peace development, but it must be and is clear to us — this does not mean that there can be a dictated peace and that Ukraine must accept what is presented to it,” Scholz said.', 'Ukraine aid', 'A series of policy shifts by Washington over the past week have transformed Europe’s geopolitical calculations.', 'U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO allies last week that Europe must provide the overwhelming share of aid for Ukraine as it fights Russian invaders.', ""“Now is the time to invest, because you can't make an assumption that America's presence will last forever,” Hegseth said in a Friday speech in Warsaw."", '“The reality that returning to 2014 borders as part of a negotiated settlement is unlikely. The reality of U.S. troops in Ukraine is unlikely. The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely,” Hegseth said.', 'Peace talks', 'Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump held a 45-minute phone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, effectively ending Moscow’s isolation since his February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both leaders agreed to begin Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh beginning Tuesday — with Kyiv and Europe excluded from the table.', ""“That may grate a little bit. But I'm telling you something that's really quite honest … when you looked at Minsk II [peace agreements], there was a lot of people at the table that really had no ability to execute some type of peace process, and it failed miserably. So, we're not going to go down that path,” Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told delegates Saturday at the Munich Security Conference."", 'That approach is unsustainable, said analyst Armida van Rij, who leads the Europe program at London’s Chatham House.', ""“Given the U.S. has taken itself out of the equation when it comes to … providing security guarantees for Ukraine or monitoring any kind of potential ceasefire that may happen, it’s really up to the Europeans to implement any kind of ceasefire or peace deal. So, you need the Europeans at the table to be able to discuss that, because otherwise, why would they sign up to something that's been discussed over their heads that commits their troops in a potential risk of direct conflict with Russia?” van Rij told VOA."", '‘Tectonic shifts’', 'The diplomatic flurry will have profound consequences for European security, according to Daniela Schwarzer, a political analyst at the Bertelsmann Stiftung Foundation in Germany.', '“We are witnessing tectonic shifts of the order structures and also of the positioning of major powers. We see that the United States wants to retreat from international organizations, so it is weakening structures of international order,” Schwarzer told Reuters.', 'European leaders should have been prepared, said van Rij.', ""“We could have seen this coming for a long time, but it hasn't been said that starkly and in such clear terms before, and that was really the wake-up call for many, many Europeans."", ""“Now it’s crunch time to get this going — particularly in the short term, of course, in terms of not just maintaining but upping support for Ukraine, given it's very clear that the U.S. is not going to play a major role anymore in the way that it has under [former President Joe] Biden. But also for European defense and security in the medium to longer term, what that's going to look like? So, there are huge questions hanging over Europeans,” van Rij told VOA."", 'Only 23 of NATO’s 32 members met the alliance target of spending at least 2% of gross national income on defense in 2024, let alone the 5% recently demanded by Trump.', ""“That's going to be a really difficult thing for many Europeans who are operating in a fiscally very constrained space,” van Rij said."", 'Democratic values', 'U.S. criticism went beyond questions of defense.', 'At the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice president JD Vance questioned Europe’s democratic values, criticizing mass migration and a perceived attack on freedom of speech in Europe, including the exclusion of far-right parties from power.', ""“The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values,” Vance told delegates in Munich on Friday."", 'His comments were described as “unacceptable” by German officials.', 'Europe is reeling from the new tone in transatlantic relations, said van Rij.', ""“What has come as a surprise is the style in which this has been done. And that's been really breaking all the norms in terms of how diplomacy is conducted, essentially. Reality has hit very, very clearly,” she told VOA."", '']"

French President Emmanuel Macron hosted key EU leaders, including British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, to address what German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called an ""existential moment"" for Europe\'s security framework.', ""The sense of urgency comes after senior U.S. officials delivered rebukes of Europe's defense spending and democratic values, which exposed the stark fractures between the U.S. and its allies. U.S. Vice President JD Vance's harsh criticism of European policies at the Munich Security Conference, the world's foremost defense summit, was met with disapproval from many delegates, who had hoped for reassurance of U.S. support for Ukraine. By contrast, his speech was praised by Trump for its bold stance."", ""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested creating a joint European military contingent that could pave the way for the establishment of unified European armed forces, a significant step in EU military integration.

Under the terms, the U.S. would claim half of Ukraine's recurring revenues from resource extraction, valued at an estimated $500 billion, and impose strict rights to future licenses, giving Washington near-total control over Ukraine's economic landscape. This demand has been described as tantamount to the economic colonization of the country and sparked panic among Ukrainian officials."", ""The agreement, which President Zelenskyy initially proposed to secure continued U.S. military support, mirrors the reparations imposed on defeated nations after World War II. Trump has framed his demand as a necessary payback, warning that Ukraine risks falling into Russia's sphere if it rejects the terms. Critics of the deal argue, however, that it imposes an unachievable financial burden on Ukraine, which is already reeling from the ongoing war. With Ukraine's mineral wealth often overstated and political pressures mounting, the country will likely face a painful decision between resisting U.S. economic domination and securing the country's survival in the face of Russia's ongoing military assault."", 'During the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian philanthropist Victor Pinchuk gathered officials from the US, Europe, and Ukraine to discuss various perspectives on the ongoing peace talks over an annual 8th Munich Lunch.', 'General Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, shed light on Trump administration’s efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We do want to make sure that the peace is lasting and sustainable, and ensure the sovereignty of Ukraine, and that once this thing stops, it will never start again. Otherwise, the consequences will be enormous on either side,” Kellogg said. However, no specific security guarantees have been outlined yet. Olha Stefanishyna, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, Minister of Justice of Ukraine, reminded everyone of the war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine: “The importance of Russia’s accountability and justice is beyond question.” Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Denmark, called for ramping up European defense output: “The most important thing for me personally, is to give Ukrainians what they need to win this war.” He warned against letting Russia define European borders in 2025.

Starmer to join Macron-led European crisis summit on Trump’s Ukraine plan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/europe-will-not-take-part-in-us-russia-talks-ukraine-kellogg,"['French president calls for urgent talks in Paris amid fears US leader is sidelining allies', 'The French president, Emmanuel Macron, was on Saturday night seeking to convene an emergency meeting of European leaders, including the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, as concerns grew over Donald Trump’s attempts to seize control of the Ukraine peace process.', 'Speaking at the Munich security conference, Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, said he was “very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris” to discuss “in a very serious fashion” the challenges posed by Trump.', '“President Trump has a method of operating which the Russians call razvedka boyem – reconnaissance through battle: you push and you see what happens, and then you change your position ... and we need to respond,” the Polish minister said.', 'The meeting, likely to be held on Monday, is expected to discuss US efforts to exclude European leaders from the peace talks, the position Europe should adopt on Ukraine’s future membership of Nato and how Ukraine can be offered security guarantees, either through Nato or some European force.', 'Downing Street confirmed on Saturday it had heard about the proposed meeting and officials made clear that Starmer would attend and take messages from the meeting to Washington this week, when he will meet President Trump. UK sources said they believed those invited to Paris by Macron would be the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the leaders of Germany, Italy, the UK and Poland.', 'Starmer said: “This is a once-in-a-generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia. It’s clear Europe must take a greater role in Nato as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia. The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together. We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.”', 'Macron’s speed in trying to unite European leaders behind a joint response shows the extent of anxiety in Europe about US efforts both to control the process and exclude European governments from any detailed negotiations between the US and Russia.', 'This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.', 'The prospect of Starmer’s involvement also highlights how the UK prime minister is becoming drawn into a European response, despite the UK having left the EU. With European leaders expected to convene in Paris, it is anticipated that Russian and US officials will meet in Saudi Arabia this week to map out what they intend to be the peace process.', 'The Europeans’ anxieties intensified on Saturday when Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said it was not realistic for Europe’s leaders to be involved. “It may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but I am telling you something that is really quite honest,” said Kellogg at the Munich conference.', '“And to my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending.’”', 'Kellogg said he was working on “Trump time”, and an agreement was expected in weeks and months.', 'The US is also reported to have sent a letter to European states, asking what troops they are willing to supply to a peacekeeping force.', 'One European diplomat said that “it appears Europe is going to be asked to police a deal that it had no direct hand in negotiating. In the meantime, Donald Trump is seeking to take 50% control of Ukraine’s rare minerals”.', 'Sign up to Headlines Europe', ""A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day"", '', 'Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said the world was experiencing a “moment of truth” as possible negotiations to end the war in Ukraine approached. “Everyone in the world has to decide whether they are on the side of the free world or on the side of those who are fighting against the free world.”.', 'In an assertion of Europe’s right to be present at the talks, she added that there can be “no long-term peace if there is no European peace”.', 'European sources said the serious concern was that Trump may negotiate the terms of the ceasefire that was intended to be a long-term deal, but that he would quickly wash US hands of any role in Ukraine’s future security.', 'The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it was vital to guard against the possibility of future Russian breaches of any agreement. He said: “We need a guarantee that, if the agreement is violated, we can act, and this is a sufficient threat for the Russian Federation not to violate this guarantee.”', 'He also urged the US not to disengage from Ukraine, saying the best security guarantee for the country against future Russian aggression was binding US industry, business and defence capability into its future. “That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention, and that is what’s attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal.”', 'Kellogg said one reason previous peace talks had failed was because too many countries were involved. “We are not going to get down that path,” he said on the margins of the Munich security conference.', 'Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had earlier used his speech to the conference to warn that Europe was likely to be excluded from the negotiations. He urged Europe to step up and form a European army in which Ukraine would play a central role.', 'Zelenskyy told Europe to avoid being abandoned at the negotiation table by Trump. “Let’s be honest – now we can’t rule out that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it. Many leaders have talked about a Europe that needs its own military – an army of Europe. I believe the time has come. The armed forces of Europe must be created.', '“A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot. The old days are over – when America supported Europe just because it always had.', '“Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe.”', 'With many European nations facing increasingly Eurosceptic electorates, his ideas about integration are unlikely to take off, but his remarks may galvanise the continent into more detailed discussions about what military role it can play in Ukraine, including by putting troops on the ground to protect a ceasefire.', 'European leaders went into Saturday’s session of the Munich conference already reeling from the confrontational speech on Friday by the US vice-president, JD Vance, in which he scolded them for ignoring popular concerns over immigration and accused them of suppressing free speech.', 'The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, characterised Vance as “trying to pick a fight” with Europe, home to some of the US’s closest allies.', 'The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, responded on social media, saying: “Europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interest … This plan must be prepared now. There’s no time to lose.”']"

This is not a Europe worth considering as a partner for a North American ally.”', '- CNBC’s Sophie Kiderlin helped contribute to this report.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

Macron convenes European leaders for Ukraine summit amid tension with US,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/ukraine-summit-paris-macron-european-leaders-us-russia,"['Paris meeting aims to devise action plan for Ukraine’s future as US and Russian delegates prepare to meet', 'The sudden transatlantic chasm over Ukraine will be laid bare this week when US officials start preliminary talks in Riyadh with Russian counterparts about a ceasefire, just as Emmanuel Macron hosts a Paris summit of European defence powers to demand the US ends the lockout of Europe and Kyiv from the process.', 'Talks are expected as soon as Tuesday between the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the first such meeting between the two countries in over two years. There are fears in Europe that Russia via the US talks will relaunch its plan for imposed Ukrainian neutrality and a joint US-Russia carve-up with agreed spheres of influence.', 'The Paris meeting will aim to outline a European action plan after days of chaotic briefing by the Trump administration. The summit will also need to decide how to respond to a request by the US to spell out whether leaders are prepared to commit troops to a stabilisation force in the event of a ceasefire.', 'Keir Starmer will attend, as well as Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. France is determined that the UK is closely involved in all future discussions on Ukraine.', 'Downing Street said it believed Starmer could play a central role in securing Ukraine’s future by conveying Europe’s warnings against a potential US-Russian carve-up of the country directly to Trump when the prime minister visits Washington DC next week. He will then report back to other European leaders. “It’s not a role we necessarily looked for, but it’s one the PM wants to step into,” a source said.', 'On Sunday night, Starmer told the Telegraph he was prepared to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine to safeguard peace.', 'The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking in an interview from the Munich Security Conference, said he was doubtful that Vladimir Putin was prepared to make concessions and repeated his claim that Russia was planning an attack on Nato countries next year. Ukraine and many of its closest European allies believe Putin wants a recasting of the postwar order as his precondition for a ceasefire.', 'Confirming the Paris meeting, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, told France Inter radio on Sunday: “The president will bring together the main European countries tomorrow for discussions on European security.” He said there was a wind of unity blowing through.', 'European diplomatic sources said the Monday afternoon summit would also include Italy and Denmark – representing the Baltic and Scandinavian countries – as well as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.', 'It will discuss what defence capabilities Europe could provide to give Ukraine credible security guarantees, including a plan for Ukraine to be given automatic Nato membership in the event of a clear ceasefire breach by Russia. The US has said there must be devastating consequences for any side that breaches a ceasefire agreement, an element missing from previous Ukraine ceasefires since 2014.', '“Only the Ukrainians can decide to stop fighting,” Barrot said. The Ukrainians “will never stop as long as they are not sure the peace suggested to them will be long-lasting”.', 'An offer of Nato membership conditional on a Russian ceasefire breach – probably requiring the US to remain a backstop guarantor for Ukraine – has been promoted by some US senators and now has the backing of senior European leaders, including Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president. He insisted the door should not be open for a Russian fantasy about spheres of influence.', 'Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy on Ukraine, briefed European leaders in Munich on the US negotiating strategy, which the Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, described as unorthodox.', 'Neither Ukraine nor European states have been invited to the talks in Riyadh. Kellogg argued their views would be taken into account, and claimed earlier peace talks had foundered due to the large negotiating table.', 'It became evident over the weekend that there were contrasting approaches within the Trump administration towards future talks over Ukraine. Rubio insisted on Sunday that any peace agreement in Ukraine would have to be enduring, fair, and respect Ukrainian sovereignty. He also said Ukraine and Europe would have to be involved in any meaningful talks.', '“The president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring, and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we’re going to have another invasion in three or four years,” Rubio told the CBS programme Face the Nation while on a visit to Israel.', 'Trump last week surprised Ukraine and America’s allies by announcing he had discussed Ukraine’s future in a phone call with Putin on Wednesday. The president said nothing about Ukrainian sovereignty and even suggested that Ukrainians might “be Russian some day”.', 'On Sunday night, Trump told reporters he was working hard to achieve peace and that he believed he would meet Putin “very soon”.', 'Macron has said he is not shocked or surprised by the speed with which Trump is acting to push through a ceasefire bargain, but European officials fear Russia is seeking not only Ukraine’s neutrality through capping the size of its army and the ousting of Zelenskyy, but also a spheres of influence agreement akin to the Yalta agreement signed over the heads of many nations in 1945 by the US, Britain and the Soviet Union.', 'That would put some western countries within “a sphere of coercion in which nations lives in fear”, one official said.', 'European leaders are divided in their response to Trump’s initiatives, with some predicting the opening of a fundamental rupture between Washington and Europe, and others arguing that if Europe can fulfil the US demand to improve its security offer then the transatlantic relationship can be repaired and Europe will find a place at the table on the future of Ukraine.', 'Downing Street said Starmer’s meetings with European leaders and Trump in successive weeks were in part an accident of scheduling, but also reflected the government’s desire to be a bridge to the US. It said Starmer was expected to try to lower the temperature.', '“Our whole approach is to not be alarmed by anything, but to try and be a calm partner for the US, and to play the role we can, which is to be a bridge,” the No 10 source said. “That’s why we can’t get distracted by things like JD Vance’s speech. Whatever your view on that, there are much bigger things to focus on.”', 'The EU leaders are also expected to discuss the outlines of a major boost to defence spending triggered by budget increases, and a relaxation of EU debt rules applying to defence investment.', '“We will launch a large package that has never been seen in this dimension before,” said the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock. “Similar to the euro or the corona crisis, there is now a financial package for security in Europe. That will come in the near future.”', 'It is likely to be launched after the German elections next weekend.', 'The phrasing of a call to arms issued to Europe by Zelenskyy in Munich on Saturday was regarded as unhelpful because he couched it in terms of a unified European army, anathema to many voters, but Macron has long argued that a distinctive European force is required. He was also the first nearly a year ago to suggest European forces enter Ukraine on an initial training mission.', 'Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, said: “If the US wants us to step up in defence, it should have a national component, a Nato component, but I also believe a European EU component, EU subsidies for the defence industry to build up our capacity to produce, but also an EU force worthy of its name.”', 'He reiterated that having Polish troops on the ground in Ukraine was “not a consideration, because Poland’s duty to Nato is to protect the eastern flank, ie, its own territory.”']"
Can Europe and UK persuade Trump they're relevant to Ukraine's future?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qjq4z0xw8o,"[""Europe's leaders are scrambling. Their hastily convened security summit in Paris on Monday is proof of that."", 'They are still reeling from not being invited by the US to talks with Russia over the future of Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he could be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin ""very soon"".', ""Can Europe, under pressure, put political differences and domestic economic concerns aside, and come up with a united front on security spending and on Ukraine's future, including potentially sending troops there - to force themselves a spot at the negotiating table?"", 'They are going to try.', 'On Monday morning, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was ""ready and willing to put troops on the ground"". Even in Germany, ahead of a heated election, the foreign policy spokesman of the CDU party, expected to win the most seats, said Europe\'s largest country would also be willing to commit troops within an international framework.', 'The Trump administration is clearly not 100% sure what it wants to do about Ukraine. There were a number of mixed messages over the weekend.', ""This allows Europe a tiny window of opportunity to try to persuade the American president it's an invaluable partner."", 'It hopes to do that via this Paris meeting, getting the ball rolling on two major issues demanded by Donald Trump: That Europe spend and do more for its own defence, and that Europe send troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.', 'Europe\'s leaders insist Kyiv be directly involved in ceasefire talks too. They\'ve long maintained the view that ""there can be no decisions about Ukraine, without Ukraine"".', ""But it's about even more than that for Europe."", 'It is the cold realisation - much dreaded, but not entirely unexpected - that the Trump administration does not prioritise relations either with European partners, or their defence.', 'Europe has relied on a security umbrella provided by the US since World War Two.', ""Depending on the parameters of the Russia-US talks over Ukraine, and how emboldened Putin feels by them, there is also a European fear this could end up changing their continent's security architecture."", 'Putin historically resents the spread of Nato eastwards. Russian neighbours - the tiny, former Soviet Baltic States and also Poland - now feel particularly exposed.', ""Not all European countries will be at Monday's summit. Just those with military heft: the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark - which is expected to represent the Baltic and Nordic nations, plus the EU Council president and the secretary general of the defence alliance, Nato."", 'Other countries will reportedly have later, follow-up meetings.', ""Even at the small Paris gathering, it will be hard, if not impossible, to agree concrete defence spending increases. Poland plans to spend 4.47% of its GDP on defence in 2025. The UK is struggling towards, and hasn't yet reached, 2.5% of its GDP."", ""But leaders can pledge to coordinate better, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. The EU is expected to bolster its defence effort too."", 'A large part of the Paris meeting will also focus on the question of sending troops to Ukraine after a ceasefire.', 'The idea being discussed is not for peacekeeping troops but rather a ""reassurance force"", stationed behind, rather than on, any eventual ceasefire line.', 'The aim of a European troop presence would be three-fold. To send a message to Ukrainians: that they are not alone. Another message to the US, to show that Europe is ""doing its bit"" for defence of its own continent, and the last message to Moscow, to warn that if it breaks the terms of an eventual ceasefire, it won\'t be dealing with Kyiv alone.', ""But it's a controversial concept and may not be popular with voters. In Italy for example, 50% of people asked don't want to send any more weapons to Ukraine, never mind sending sons and daughters, sisters and brothers there."", 'There are so many as yet unanswered questions:', 'How many troops would each European country have to send, for how long, and under whose command? What would their mission statement be - for example if Russia broke the terms of an agreed ceasefire, would that mean European soldiers would be directly at war with Russia? Would the US have their back if so?', 'Europe would want a US security guarantee before deploying soldiers to Ukraine. It may not get one.', ""It's far too much to be decided on Monday. And leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, come to Paris with their own domestic concerns - can they afford extra defence spending, do they have the troops to send to Ukraine?"", 'Richard – now Lord – Dannatt is the former head of the British Army. He told the BBC that the UK military is too depleted to provide a significant proportion of troops for Ukraine. He said around 100,000 troops would probably be needed in total and the UK would be expected to provide a considerable number of those. The British Army insists it has earned a worldwide reputation for excellence.', 'But this summit is more broad brushstrokes than fine print. The conversation can at least get started publicly.', 'Will Donald Trump be paying attention?', 'Hard to know.', ""There's talk of sending an envoy to Washington after the Paris meeting to make Europe's case. Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, is close to the Trump administration, for example."", 'Sir Keir Starmer has a planned visit to Washington in a few days. This could be his chance to act as a bridge between Europe and the US.', 'The Paris meeting also offers an opportunity for the UK and other European leaders to further mend relations after the bitterness of Brexit.', 'Mark Leonard, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations, notes that Starmer could ""demonstrate that Britain is a responsible stakeholder for European security ... Something that will be noticed and translate into goodwill when it comes to negotiations on other issues"".', 'Issues like trade relations and law enforcement co-operation which the UK hopes to improve with the EU going forward.', 'Host nation France is feeling confident. President Macron has long advocated that Europe be less reliant on outside countries for supply chains, tech capabilities and very much so when it comes to defence. He made headlines a year ago by first mooting the idea of troops on the ground in Ukraine.', 'France is ""fiercely proud"" that its intelligence and security services are not intertwined with the US, unlike the UK, says Georgina Wright, deputy director for international studies at the Institut Montaigne. That makes it less complicated to untangle, now that Trump is in the White House, demanding that Europe take care of itself.', 'The US has sent a document to European allies consisting of six points and questions, such as which countries would be willing to deploy troops to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement, and which governments would be prepared to increase sanctions on Russia, including more strictly enforcing existing ones.', ""But Julianne Smith, until recently the US ambassador to Nato, says this kind of complicated diplomatic work normally takes weeks of meetings and can't be organised by filled-in forms."", ""She adds that whatever Europe's leaders achieve in Paris, if they use that to demand a seat at the negotiating table over Ukraine, their hand is weak."", '""If Trump blinks and says no, does Europe refuse to help altogether? They can\'t cut off their nose to spite their face.""', 'Essentially, if the US plans to turn away from Ukraine and from Europe more broadly in terms of security, they will have to significantly up their defence game anyway.', ""If Donald Trump isn't watching, Vladimir Putin certainly is."", 'Children displaced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine are learning in their native language.', 'Nataliya Korovina, whose family fled to the UK, reflects on three years since Russia invaded Ukraine.', 'Maryna Korolova was nine months pregnant when, like millions of others, she fled war-torn Ukraine.', 'The library opened last year and is regularly used by those who have fled the war in Ukraine.', 'HopeFull blames security and funding issues after serving more than 2.5 million meals.', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.
