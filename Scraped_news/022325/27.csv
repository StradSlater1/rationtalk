3 Reasons You Should Buy Walmart Stock Right Now,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/31054805/3-reasons-you-should-buy-walmart-stock-right-now,"['', '', '', 'Share', 'Retail giant Walmart (WMT) delivered better-than-expected Q4 financials for its fiscal 2025. While the retailer’s top and bottom lines surpassed the Street’s forecast, its guidance was disappointing, leading to a drop in its share price. While Walmart’s conservative outlook dragged its stock lower, there are three strong reasons to buy it now.', 'Walmart is the dominant player in the retail space, and its market share is only getting stronger. Despite economic uncertainties and shifting consumer behaviors, Walmart continues to thrive, thanks to its growing e-commerce presence, value-driven pricing strategy, and expansion into private-label products. These factors set Walmart apart from competitors and position it for continued gains.', 'One of Walmart’s biggest strengths is its e-commerce business, which has been steadily growing. Its online sales now make up 18% of Walmart’s total revenue, a significant jump from just a few years ago. In the U.S. alone, the company has built a robust marketplace that expands its product offerings, enabling it to meet the growing demand for online shopping. Even more impressive is the efficiency with which Walmart fulfills these orders. It has processed over 500 million e-commerce orders from stores without opening new locations.', 'This continued digital expansion is paying off. In the most recent quarter, Walmart’s global e-commerce sales jumped 16%, reflecting the strong demand for its delivery and pickup services. Customers appreciate the speed and accuracy of Walmart’s online shopping experience, making it a convenient destination.', 'While brand-name merchandise is a staple at Walmart, the retailer is increasingly relying on its private-label products as a key driver of growth. These exclusive brands allow Walmart to offer high-quality, lower-priced alternatives to national brands, attracting price-conscious consumers while boosting profitability. With a strong mix of U.S. private brands and region-specific labels, Walmart is able to compete effectively on both price and product variety.', 'Walmart is growing its profits faster than sales. In the most recent four quarters, Walmart’s revenue grew at a steady pace — rising 6% in Q1, 4.8% in Q2, 5.5% in Q3, and 4.1% in Q4. In comparison, its adjusted operating income grew by 13.7%, 7.2%, 8.2%, and 7% in those same periods.', 'The momentum in its operating income will likely sustain as Walmart has been scaling up its higher-margin businesses, including its membership programs, third-party marketplace, and digital advertising. These segments are growing rapidly, diversifying Walmart’s revenue streams and supporting its margins. The company’s e-commerce operations, particularly in the U.S., have become increasingly efficient, contributing to stronger profitability.', 'Another key contributor is its booming advertising business, which grew 27% over the past year, reaching approximately $4.4 billion. Its U.S. Marketplace is also thriving, with revenue jumping 37%, and nearly 45% of orders now fulfilled through Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS). Additionally, global membership income rose 21% to around $3.8 billion. The growth in its membership income will likely be one of the largest drivers of its profitability and help grow its operating income faster than sales.', 'The retail giant’s stellar track record of dividend growth makes WMT a reliable income stock.', 'Walmart recently announced a 13% increase in its annual dividend, raising it to $3.76 per share — the largest hike in more than a decade. This marks 52 consecutive years of dividend growth, reflecting the company’s commitment to rewarding shareholders.', 'This significant dividend boost reflects management’s confidence in the company’s growth outlook and its ability to generate robust earnings and cash flow.', 'In conclusion, Walmart’s strong market position, expanding e-commerce presence, growing scale of its higher-margin businesses, and commitment to shareholder returns will support Walmart stock in the long term.', 'Wall Street analysts are optimistic, maintaining a “Strong Buy” rating on Walmart stock. While short-term market fluctuations may impact its share price, the company’s long-term growth story remains intact.', 'Stocks: 15 minute delay (Cboe BZX is real-time), ET.

Walmart’s Earnings Trigger Mixed Reactions Among Analysts,https://www.jomfruland.net/walmarts-earnings-trigger-mixed-reactions-among-analysts/,"['', 'Walmart’s recent earnings announcement left Wall Street buzzing, but perhaps not with the applause they anticipated. Despite reporting revenues of $681 billion and earnings per share that aligned with predictions, the retail giant saw its shares dip 8.9%, settling at $94.78. As analysts sift through the numbers, a clearer picture of Walmart’s future emerges, yet one that hints at tempered enthusiasm.', 'On examining future prospects, analysts project a modest rise in revenue to $701.1 billion by 2026, a 2.9% increase that pales against historical growth rates of 5.2%. A slight hiccup appears in their earnings per share forecast, downgraded from $2.74 to $2.63, signaling a faint ripple of concern about profitability.', 'Among analysts, a spectrum of opinions reflects a curious mix of optimism and caution. Price targets diverge broadly, with the most hopeful eyeing $120 and the skeptics settling at $58 per share. Yet, intriguingly, the consensus price target remains steady at $108, highlighting that not all faith has been lost.', 'The takeaway? Walmart faces a future where expectations lean towards slower revenue growth compared to industry peers projecting annual gains of 4.7%. This repositioning suggests a backdrop where Walmart must leverage its strengths to maintain its competitive edge amidst a dynamic retail landscape.', 'As the company navigates these forecasts, the emphasis remains on understanding Walmart’s long-term earnings power. While next year’s profits might not dazzle, it’s the sustained performance that will tell the true story. For investors, keeping an eye on the broader financial landscape and Walmart’s strategic maneuvers will be key.', 'Understanding Walmart’s Financial Landscape', 'Walmart’s recent earnings announcement highlighted mixed reactions from Wall Street, with revenues reported at $681 billion and earnings per share aligning with predictions. Despite these numbers, the company’s shares saw a notable dip of 8.9%, falling to $94.78. Analysts predict a modest revenue increase to $701.1 billion by 2026, a 2.9% rise that contrasts with the historical growth rate of 5.2%.', 'Real-World Use Cases and Industry Trends', 'Walmart’s strategy has long been centered around its position as a leader in affordable retail and efficient supply chain management. However, with the expected growth rate lagging behind peers projecting 4.7% annual gains, Walmart may need to innovate further. Retail trends show a shift towards e-commerce, sustainability, and personalized shopping experiences, areas where Walmart has begun to exert more effort.', 'Reviews, Comparisons, and Market Forecasts', 'Walmart’s share price reflects varying levels of analyst confidence, with targets ranging from $58 to $120 per share. This variability illustrates a broader uncertainty about Walmart’s ability to adapt quickly to market shifts. Competitors like Amazon continue to push the envelope in e-commerce and logistics, challenging Walmart to bolster its online presence and improve customer experience to capture market share.', 'Controversies and Limitations', 'Walmart has faced criticism over labor practices, environmental impact, and sizable market influence. Addressing these concerns increasingly affects consumer perception, with a growing emphasis on corporate responsibility influencing brand loyalty and sales.', 'Features, Specs & Pricing', 'Walmart’s vast range of products, from groceries to electronics, is facilitated by its robust distribution system. However, maintaining competitive pricing while ensuring quality and ethical standards is a persistent challenge that dictates long-term profitability.', 'Security & Sustainability', 'As global demand for responsible retail grows, Walmart’s efforts to improve data security and sustainability become pivotal. Investments in renewable energy, waste reduction, and securing customer data can enhance its reputation but require significant capital investment.', 'Pros & Cons Overview', 'Pros:\n– Expansive physical and online presence.\n– Competitive pricing and diverse product range.\n– Efficient supply chain.', 'Cons:\n– Slower projected growth compared to competitors.\n– Ongoing controversies around ethics and labor.\n– Vulnerability to market and economic shifts.', 'Insights & Predictions', 'Walmart’s future lies in its ability to innovate within digital transformation, sustainability, and customer experience. Investments in tech and streamlined logistics will be instrumental in countering slowed growth rates.', 'Actionable Recommendations', '1. For Investors: Monitor Walmart’s strategic investments in technology and sustainability as key indicators of growth potential.', '2. For Consumers: Look for value in Walmart’s pricing and product offerings, especially as they ramp up e-commerce and delivery services.', '3. For the Company: Invest in customer-centric innovations to capture market share and appeal to new consumer values centered around ethical practices and convenience.', 'For more information about Walmart’s latest strategies and financial details, visit the official Walmart’s corporate site.', ""Dr. Rachel Levine is a prominent financial analyst and economist with a Ph.D. in Finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

But its outlook disappointed Wall Street.', 'In the fiscal year ahead, the discounter said it expects net sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income to increase between 3.5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis. The company said that includes a 150 basis point, or 1.5 percentage point, headwind from acquiring smart TV company Vizio and following a leap year in 2024. For the just completed fiscal year, Walmart posted adjusted operating income growth of 9.7% on a constant currency basis.', 'The company also said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, which includes a 5 cent per share headwind from currency. That fell short of the $2.76 per share Wall Street had expected.', 'In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey described consumer spending patterns as “steady” and said “there’s not any sharp changes that we’ve seen.”', 'Yet he acknowledged “there’s far from certainty in the geopolitical landscape.”', 'About two-thirds of what Walmart sells is made, grown or assembled in the U.S. Yet if tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada take effect, he said Walmart is “not going to be completely immune.”', '“We’ve lived in a tariff environment for the last seven or eight years, and we’ll do what we know how to do,” he said. “We’ll work with suppliers. We’ll lean into our private brand. We’ll shift supply where necessary to try to take advantage of lower costs that we can then pass on to consumers.”', 'Since Walmart is not sure if the tariffs will take effect next month, the company did not factor them into its guidance, Rainey said.', 'Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:', 'In the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart’s net income fell to $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, compared with $5.49 billion or 68 cents per share in the year-ago period.

', 'Since Walmart is the nation’s top grocer, investors often view it as a barometer of consumer health.

He said that’s temporary, however, and doesn’t indicate a change in consumer spending patterns.', 'Even so, the big-box retailer faced many questions from retail analysts on Thursday’s earnings call about the reasons for its conservative forecast.', 'On the earnings call, Rainey said the outlook is consistent with Walmart’s guidance for the last two years, when it projected operating income growth of 4% to 6% annually. If the company took out the impact from the Vizio acquisition and extra day from leap year, he said the outlook would be 5% to 7%, which would represent an acceleration from its previous guidance ranges.', 'Still, he said, “it’s prudent to have an outlook that is somewhat measured.”', '“We have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time and we don’t want to get out over our skis here,” he said. “There’s a lot of the year to play out. Again, we feel good about our ability to navigate the environment, whether it’s tariffs or other macro [economic] uncertainty.”', 'Walmart has taken a page from rival Amazon’s book, as it chases ways make money outside of retail. Those newer moneymakers worked in its favor in the fourth quarter. Its advertising business and third-party marketplace are small compared with Amazon’s, but have posted gains and driven higher margins than Walmart’s retail business.', 'Global membership income grew by 16% year over year, with some of that coming from its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+, in addition to warehouse club Sam’s Club. Its global advertising business grew 29%, including a 24% increase in Walmart Connect.', 'Walmart’s third-party marketplace and its fulfillment services segment, which packs and ships orders for marketplace sellers, also rose by double digits.', '“These are all higher margin, faster-growing parts of our business where the math is just suggesting that our margins are going up over time,” he said on the call with CNBC. “And frankly, I don’t see any end to this.”', 'Faster and more frequent deliveries have helped Walmart’s e-commerce business become more profitable. On the earnings call, Rainey said the delivery routes for Walmart have become denser as customers place more orders. Plus, he said, shoppers have shown a willingness to pay more to speed online orders to their doors.', 'Over 30% of Walmart customers who have an item delivered from a store have paid an extra fee to have that delivered within a few hours, Rainey said. On Christmas Eve, he said, 77% of orders were express deliveries. Those faster deliveries, which are made in less than two hours, cost an additional $10.', 'One of Walmart’s newer services, pharmacy deliveries, is a growth opportunity, too, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said on the earnings call. The deliveries began in October in six states, but have expanded across the country.', 'As customers order a prescription for a sick family member or place an order for their regular medication, many are buying other items like groceries, Furner said.', 'Walmart also hiked its dividend by 13% to 94 cents per share, the largest increase in more than a decade.', 'As of Wednesday’s close, shares of Walmart are up about 83% over the past year.

Tariff Storm Clouds Loom Over Walmart’s Low-Price Empire,https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2025/tariff-storm-clouds-loom-over-walmarts-low-price-empire/,"['As Walmart navigates a shifting trade landscape, the specter of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration is casting a shadow over the retail giant’s hallmark promise: everyday low prices. With President Donald Trump threatening sweeping levies on imports from China, Mexico, Canada and India, Walmart executives are bracing for a challenge that could upend the retailer’s carefully calibrated pricing strategy — and test the loyalty of inflation-weary shoppers.', 'While concerns over inflation and tariffs persist, CEO Doug McMillon is optimistic about Walmart’s ability to continue delivering value to customers, especially through its growing eCommerce capabilities and expanded membership offerings.', '“Tariffs are something we’ve managed for years,” he said on the company’s Q4 earnings call on Thursday (Feb. 20). “We’re strengthening our ability to serve people in the moment. Customers are shopping with us more often and buying more items and we’re growing profit faster than sales. We know who we are and we know where we’re going.”', 'While Walmart reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, executives devoted significant airtime to addressing the tariff elephant in the room. Though two-thirds of Walmart’s products are sourced domestically, its massive global supply chain — particularly its reliance on Chinese manufacturing — leaves it exposed. The company is the largest U.S. importer of containerized goods, with its Great Value private-label brand sourcing over 70% of non-food household items from China, according to Zacks Investment Management.', '“U.S. customers remain resilient,” CFO John David Rainey told analysts. “We have to acknowledge we are in an uncertain time, and we don’t want to get out over our skis here. We feel good about navigating the environment, whether it’s tariffs or other uncertainties. Our business model is delivering as it’s designed to do. Becoming more convenient has helped increase our growth with higher engagement across income cohorts and positive traffic and unit growth across markets.”', 'Rainey emphasized Walmart’s playbook: negotiating with suppliers, expanding private-label offerings and shifting sourcing to lower-cost regions. “We can then pass on [savings] to consumers,” he said. Yet analysts warn the math may not be so simple. UBS estimates a 10% tariff on Chinese imports could squeeze Walmart’s margins by 30 to 40 basis points. “Tariffs are inflationary for customers,” Rainey acknowledged, noting past cycles saw “selected items” seeing price hikes.', 'But even Walmart’s vaunted efficiency has limits. The retailer warned in SEC filings that “significant changes in trade policies … could have an adverse effect” on its financials.', 'Tariffs arrive as Walmart’s core customers face mounting pressures. While the retailer has attracted higher-income households — a trend that accelerated during 2023’s inflationary spike — its base remains heavily reliant on budget-conscious shoppers. PYMNTS Intelligence found in a survey executed last week that 78% of consumers expect tariffs to drive prices higher, with 75% fearing product shortages.', 'The report also found that 71% of U.S. consumers and small businesses are knowledgeable about the potential import tariffs, but 57% of those informed consumers believe these tariffs will negatively impact their wallets. Small businesses, however, are somewhat optimistic, viewing tariffs as an opportunity to boost demand for domestically sourced products. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs may cause consumers to shift from spending to saving.', 'PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster concludes that both businesses and consumers have time to plan their next moves while waiting to see how the tariff talks conclude. “When the future is unsettled, the tendency for people and businesses is to hit the pause button on decisions,” Webster wrote. “The waiting game itself becomes an inevitable part of the economic narrative.”', 'That economic narrative also got a fair amount of attention from Rainey and McMillon.', '“The lower-income customer is still very stretched,” Rainey noted. Walmart’s data shows persistent increases in general merchandise, even as grocery prices remain elevated. The dichotomy was evident in Q4 results: while health/wellness sales surged and eCommerce jumped 20%, discretionary categories like electronics and home goods saw only modest gains.', 'Upper-income households now account for the majority of Walmart’s market-share gains, according to Rainey, but the retailer risks alienating its traditional base if tariffs force widespread price hikes.', 'Against this backdrop, Walmart’s Q4 performance highlighted both resilience and looming vulnerabilities. Revenue rose 5.2% to $173.4 billion, with adjusted operating income up 9.4%. U.S. comparable sales grew 4.6%, fueled by a 20% leap in eCommerce. Sam’s Club sales climbed 6.8%, while international markets like China and Mexico delivered strong results.', 'Yet the numbers also revealed cracks. The company projected sales growth between 3% and 4%, below analyst projections, as rising costs and uncertainties around U.S. tariffs weigh on consumer purchasing power. Inventory rose 2.8%, hinting at cautious ordering ahead of potential tariffs. Gross margins improved, but Rainey warned of “sustained merchandise category mix pressure” as shoppers prioritize essentials. Most tellingly, Walmart’s full-year guidance of 3-4% sales growth fell short of analyst expectations — a gap Rainey attributed to “uncertainty related to consumer behavior and global economic conditions.”', 'Investors reacted swiftly, sending shares down 7% premarket. “The stock has been treated like a high-flying tech stock,” noted Brian Mulberry of Zacks, per CNBC “The question is when challenges for lower-income customers start hitting results.”', 'As Walmart prepares for its April investor conference — where it plans to showcase supply-chain automation efforts — executives are betting on a multi-pronged defense: accelerating its U.S. sourcing initiative (a $350 billion, 10-year pledge), leveraging its growing ad and membership businesses, and doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven efficiency.', '“We feel like we’re just getting started,” McMillon said.', 'The head of the House Judiciary Committee is demanding more clarity on Europe’s tech regulations.', 'As Reuters reported Sunday (Feb. 23), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wants European Union (EU) antitrust chief Teresa Ribera to clarify how she enforces the European Union’s rules governing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), saying they seem to target American firms.', '“We write to express our concerns that the DMA may target American companies,” Jordan wrote in a letter sent to Ribera, seen by Reuters. ', 'The letter, co-signed by Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI), chairman of the subcommittee on the administrative state, regulatory reform and antitrust, argues the rules place undue burdens on companies and give Europe’s tech firms an advantage. It also criticizes the 10% fines on global yearly revenues companies are subject to under the DMA.', '“These severe fines appear to have two goals: to compel businesses to follow European standards worldwide, and as a European tax on American companies,” the letter said.', 'The lawmakers gave Ribera until March 10 to respond to their letter. PYMNTS has reached out to the European Commission (EC) — the EU’s antitrust enforcement arm — for comment, but has not yet gotten a reply.', 'As Reuters notes, the letter came two days after President Donald Trump signed a memorandum saying the White House would scrutinize the DMA and its counterpart Digital Services Act (DSA) “that dictate how American companies interact with consumers in the European Union.”', 'Adopted in 2023, the DMA governs tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and is designed to provide a level playing field and greater consumer choice.', 'However, complaints about the DMA are not confined to just Republicans. As covered here in late 2023, a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote to then President Biden with concerns that the new regulations unfairly target American tech companies.', 'They argued that the DMA designates five leading U.S. tech companies as “gatekeepers” while excluding many Chinese and European firms.', 'The news follows reports from last month that the EC was reconsidering its investigations into American tech companies ahead of Trump’s inauguration. One EU official said the shift was due to “tech oligarchs” being close to Trump, a situation that creates “a whole new ballgame,” per a report from the Financial Times.', 'We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.']"

So far, Trump has ordered tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada (the latter two pending trade talks) and signaled upcoming tariffs on select industries and possibly on Europe.', '“Tariffs are something we’ve managed for many years, and we’ll just continue to manage that,” McMillon said. “We’ve got a great team; we know how to do that. We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but we can manage it really well. And we’re wired to try and save people money, so that’ll be our ultimate goal.”', 'Walmart currently doesn’t have “any explicit assumption in our guidance around tariffs,” Rainey said.', '“We feel like we’ll be able to navigate that,” he said. “Will it turn out differently than maybe what we expect today? Perhaps, and we feel good about our ability to do that, though.

Operating income increased 8.3% to $7.86 billion and rose 9.4% in constant currency.', '“As we look at our results for the quarter and the year, we’re pleased to see, first, a healthy top line,” McMillon said. “We’re strengthening our ability to serve people how they want to be served in the moment. That’s what’s driving our growth. Our prices are low, and we’re becoming more convenient. Customers are shopping with us more often and buying more items. … Second, we’re growing profit faster than sales, and we have runway to scale our higher-margin businesses like membership, marketplace and advertising.”', 'Grocery fuels Walmart US', 'At the core Walmart US business unit, fiscal 2025 net sales increased 4.7% to $462.42 billion.

Operating income climbed 7.4% to $6.52 billion.', 'Walmart cited broad-based sales growth for Walmart US and noted strong holiday season sales despite a shorter shopping season.  The Bentonville-based company singled out grocery as a catalyst, with comparable sales up by mid-single digits and gains in transactions, units and market share. In food, sales were strong across categories — including dairy, fresh meat and produce — amid like-for-like inflation of 170 basis points, mainly due to eggs but also items such as bacon and ground beef. Private label penetration edged up 70 basis points.', '“Grocery remains a standout category with mid-single-digit growth, and we saw mid-teens growth in health and wellness due largely to GLP-1 (weight-loss drug) sales, which contributed about a point to the segment comp, consistent with prior quarters,” Rainey said.', '“US customers remain resilient, exhibiting behaviors that have been largely consistent over the past year,” he added. “As always, people are looking for value, and they want to save time. Becoming more convenient is helping to drive our growth.”', 'During fiscal 2025, Walmart US implemented more than 22,000 Rollbacks on pricing, McMillon said. Currently, 5,800 Rollbacks are in US stores, said John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart US.', '“That will fluctuate quarter to quarter,” Furner said in the call. “We’ve added about 1,000 in the last few weeks, and we’re prepared for all sorts of environments, whether it’s more promotional or less promotional.”', 'Walmart’s omnichannel model, too, is becoming a linchpin of its value proposition, McMillon noted.', '“In addition to low prices and a growing assortment to choose from, we’re focused on delivery speed and accuracy,” he said. “If I could change anything about how we’re perceived today, it’d be that more people know about our breadth of assortment online and our increasing delivery speed. For Walmart US, we recently announced same-day pharmacy delivery, and the early response has been strong. Customers love being able to get a basket of items delivered to their door that includes fresh, frozen, general merchandise and now pharmacy.

We’ll lean into our private brand. We’ll shift supply where necessary to try to take advantage of lower costs that we can then pass on to consumers.”', 'Since Walmart is not sure if the tariffs will take effect next month, the company did not factor them into its guidance, Rainey said.', 'While a given company must pay a tariff up front if it imports a good from an affected country, the firm is ultimately forced to decide how to mitigate on those costs — and they often get passed down to shoppers.', 'Rainey previously told CNBC that there would likely be cases where prices for consumers would increase as a result of tariffs, adding that they are ""inflationary"" for customers.', ""U.S. companies are seeing mounting queries about how they would be impacted by the levies Trump has called for.

The drop is due to slowing growth and tariff fears but does little to alter the long-term outlook for earnings, cash flow, equity gains, and capital return. While slower growth and tariffs are headwinds for retailers, consumers remain strong, and the business remains solid, leaving the company to do what it does best: manage its supply chain and provide compelling value for consumers. "", 'The tariff threat is real, but it is not new. The company has been navigating a tariff-laden environment since the first Trump administration and is prepared to mitigate the impact of new tariffs to a degree. Less than 35% of the company’s products come from outside the U.S., minimizing exposure that can be further reduced through strategic sourcing and private labels.', 'Walmart had a strong FQ4 2025/CQ4 2024 with revenue of $180.6 billion, rising by 4.1% and outpacing MarketBeat’s reported consensus by nearly 100 basis points.

Sales at Walmart U.S. rose by 5% on a 4.6% comp increase, a 2.8% increase in ticket count, and a 1.8% increase in ticket size. Sam’s Club was also strong, driven by a robust 13% increase in membership income. Sales at Sam’s rose by 5.7% on a 5.4% increase in transactions and a 1.3% increase in ticket size.', ""The margin news is also good. The company widened its gross and operating margin to drive leveraged growth on the bottom line and outperformance relative to analysts' forecasts. The net result is $0.66 in adjusted EPS for a gain of 1000 BPS, nearly double the top-line growth, with strength expected to continue in F2026. "", 'The problem is that the guidance is weaker than forecasted but likely cautious due to consumer trends. The company forecasts only 3% to 4% revenue growth compared to the 4.2% expected by analysts, cautious because of labor market strength and retail sales data. The latest data shows persistently strong job growth, declining unemployment, and average wages rising more than 4%, underpinning a 4.2% increase in retail sales. These trends are expected to continue in F2026 and may gain momentum later in the year as Trump’s policies spur domestic activity. ', 'Walmart’s investment attraction includes the capital return program. Neither the dividend distribution nor buybacks are significantly large, but together, they amount to more than 1% annualized return with shares near $100 and are sustainable. The dividend is worth less than 35% of the F2026 earnings outlook, including the 13% increase announced for the year; it yields about 0.8% and is compounded by buybacks. The buybacks reduced the count by 0.3% in 2024 and will likely reduce it by a similar amount in F2026. ', 'Regarding the balance sheet, it is as healthy as ever. At the end of F2026, the highlights include reduced cash offset by increased inventories, receivables, and assets and reduced debt. The net result is a nearly 8% increase in shareholder equity and low business leverage. The long-term debt is about 0.35X equity. ', 'After the guidance update, Walmart’s share price fell more than 8% in premarket trading but may not fall much further. The move put the market at a critical support level near $95, likely to trigger buying if not a rebound in action. Assuming the market confirms support at this level, Walmart’s stock will likely move sideways within a new range until later in the year. If support is not confirmed at this level, Walmart’s stock could fall to $90 or lower before hitting solid support.
