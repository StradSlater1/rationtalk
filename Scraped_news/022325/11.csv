Pope Francis 'seriously worried' in hospital and tying up loose ends as health condition worsens,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/pope-francis-seriously-worried-hospital-34697982,"['Pope Francis\' health took a turn on Monday after his doctors warned that his bronchitis has advanced into a ""polymicrobial infection"" that is presenting medics with a ""complex clinical picture"". Reports have indicated that the progressive religious leader is ""seriously worried"" that he won\'t make it and is trying to secure some of his reforms ahead of a potential conclave to pick the church\'s next leader.', 'Sources close to the Pope told Politico that the head of the Roman Catholic religion had been suffering ""intense pain"" as a result of the infection, adding that the 88-year-old had privately ""expressed fears"" that he might not pull through his present illness. After being forced to abandon his regular Sunday sermon by medics, one person close to the situation disclosed that he is now acting entirely on ""doctor\'s orders.""', 'The Pope was admitted to a respiratory ward in Rome\'s Gemelli Hospital on Friday for treatment, but is understood to have undergone a change in medication in recent days as his condition has worsened. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni has not given a timetable for his recovery and instead stated that he ""will require an appropriate hospital stay.""', 'READ MORE: GP says racing heart could be sign of condition that affects millions', ""READ MORE: Woman, 20, died with 'blood oozing out of eyes' after being told she didn't have killer disease"", ""In recent weeks, the spiritual leader of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics has been keen to secure his progressive legacy amid his worsening health, appointing reform-minded allies to key positions. On Friday, as his condition got worse, he made a nun, sister Raffaella Petrini, the first-ever woman to be Governor of Vatican City."", 'At the start of February, with an eye to a potential conclave to decide on his successor, he also extended the term of ally Italian cardinal Giovanni Battista Re as the dean of the College of Cardinals - a position that oversees the preparations to select a new pope.', 'This could mean Francis\' successor following in his reform-minded footsteps, with a more liberal approach to women in the church and LGBT issues. One of the Vatican sources that spoke to Politico explained: ""The run-up to the conclave is more important as that’s where lobbying goes on.""', 'Even if Francis pulls through his current infection, insiders are marking his hospital stay as a turning point in his leadership. Another official said: “He may not die now but of course he eventually will. We all die — and he’s an 88-year-old man with lung problems.”', 'This is the fourth time that the Pontifex Maximus, a title held by the papacy since the days of the Roman Empire, has been admitted to hospital since his election in 2013.', 'Francis has suffered health issues for most of his life, first having most of a lung removed as a young man after a pulmonary infection, and has suffered with winter bouts of bronchitis in the years since. In 2021, he had part of his large intestine removed and has, at times, used a wheelchair or cane due to problems with his knee ligaments.', 'A statement released by the Holy See on Monday asked for Catholics to pray for their pontiff. It stated: “Pope Francis is touched by the numerous messages of affection and closeness that he has been receiving in recent hours; he especially wants to extend his thanks to those who are hospitalized at this time, for the affection and love they have expressed through drawings and messages of good wishes; he prays for them and asks that they pray for him.”', 'At the same time on Monday, Pope Francis welcomed artists and pilgrims to the holy city ahead of a series of cultural events from his hospital bed, but apologised for not being able to greet them in person. The Holy Father said: ""I would have liked to be among you but, as you know, I am here at the Gemelli Hospital because I still need some treatment for my bronchitis.""', 'He added: ""I would like to thank the doctors and healthcare workers in this hospital for their care: they do such a valuable and tiring job""', ""Get email updates with the day's biggest stories"", '', 'At Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update.', ""“The Holy Father’s condition continues to be critical, therefore, as explained yesterday (Friday), the pope is not out of danger,” the statement said. It was the first time “critical” had been used in a written statement to describe Francis' condition since he was hospitalized Feb. 14."", 'The statement also said that the pontiff “continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday."" Doctors declined to offer a prognosis, saying it was “reserved.”', ""Doctors have said Francis' condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and preexisting lung disease."", 'They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he was taking, the pope’s medical team said in its first in-depth update on the pope’s condition.', ""Saturday's blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood and help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health."", 'Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened.', ""Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed “absolute rest” and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Saturday's update marked the first time the Vatican has referred to Francis suffering an “asthmatic respiratory crisis of prolonged magnitude, which also required the application of oxygen at high flows.”"", 'Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, said Friday that the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.', '“Sepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,” Alfieri said at a news conference Friday at Gemelli. “The English say ‘knock on wood,’ we say ‘touch iron.’ Everyone touch what they want,” he said as he tapped the microphone. “But this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.”', ""“He knows he's in danger,” Alfieri added. “And he told us to convey that.”"", 'Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious and alert, eating and working.', 'The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred.', 'Parolin said such speculation seemed “useless” when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican.', '“On the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,” Parolin was quoted as saying. “However, I don’t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven’t heard anything like that.”', 'White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the pope’s condition and was working on his own statement that will be released later.', '“We’re praying for the pope,” Leavitt said.', 'Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on first- and fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says Leavitt and two others are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.', 'Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican’s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood.', 'In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday’s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis will skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it.', ""“Look, even though he's not (physically) here, we know he's here,” said Luis Arnaldo Lopez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. “He's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.”"", '___', 'Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

According to today’s bulletin, “the prognosis remains reserved,” the update said. It reported that “the Holy Father continues to be alert and well oriented” and receives “high-flow oxygen through the nasal cannulas” when he needs it.', 'Yesterday’s medical bulletin described Francis as suffering from “thrombocytopenia associated with anemia.” This evening’s update said that as a result of blood transfusions (“two units of concentrated blood cells”) the pope’s hemoglobin (an oxygen carrier in red blood cells) had increased and the deficiency of platelets in his blood “remained stable.” The Mayo Clinic explains that insufficient hemoglobin can make a person feel weak, because their body is not getting enough oxygen.', 'At the same time, the evening medical bulletin noted that “some blood tests show an initial, mild, kidney insufficiency.”', 'It concluded that given “the complexity of the [pope’s] clinical picture” and the need to allow the necessary time for the pharmacological therapies to take effect, “the prognosis remains reserved.”', 'Dr. Anna Lisa Bilotta, who works in the Salvator Mundi hospital and is not treating the pope, told America that both the absence of another respiratory crisis after yesterday’s and the increase in hemoglobin were “good news.” She did not consider the “initial and slight” kidney insufficiency a major problem, saying there could be several reasons for it.', 'She concluded that the pope’s “overall clinical picture is a little better than yesterday, even if his doctors maintain a ‘reserved prognosis’ because of his critical condition and the need to give the medical therapies the necessary time to take effect and produce positive results.” Yesterday she explained that the “reserved prognosis” means that “the situation is unpredictable and has to be monitored.”', 'An informed source told America that Dr. Alfieri pointed out during last Friday’s press briefing, “it takes little to change the balance” of Francis’ condition from one day to the next, as happened yesterday with the severe breathing crisis. The source said other crises could occur during the next 10 or more days while Pope Francis undergoes treatment, but that what is important is that his doctors are able to overcome these crises as they did yesterday.', 'This evening’s Vatican report, based on information from the pope’s medical team, also said that this morning, Pope Francis participated in Mass “together with those who take care of him in these days of hospitalization.""', 'This morning, in a message for the noonday Angelus, Pope Francis said, “I am confidently continuing my hospitalization at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment” and “rest is also part of the therapy!”', '“I sincerely thank the doctors and health workers of this hospital for the attention they are showing me and the dedication with which they carry out their service among the sick,” he added.', 'The Vatican reported earlier this morning that Francis had spent “a peaceful and restful” ninth night on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital. This good news brought relief after the alarming update last evening that Francis had experienced a serious breathing crisis on Saturday morning and had to be given a significant amount of “high-flow oxygen” and blood transfusions due to low platelets and anemia.', 'The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, told journalists that the medical report published last evening that said the pope was in critical condition and “not out of danger” is the only recent medical information on the pope’s current state of health.
