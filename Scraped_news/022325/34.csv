Exploit asteroids for resources using automated mining equipment as they hurtle through your space-claim in Astronomics,https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/exploit-asteroids-for-resources-using-automated-mining-equipment-as-they-hurtle-through-your-space-claim-in-astronomics/,"['Asteroid mining can be pretty chill, except for that ticking clock.', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""Earth. It's a great place to live, as far as you know. You've never been there, but all you have to do is earn a quick 600 million bucks and you'll be guaranteed your own little residence on that big blue marble."", ""That's gonna take a while because it turns out space-capitalism is even harsher than regular capitalism. As an asteroid miner in Astronomics, which is now in early access on Steam, the precious resources you collect from mining space rocks will make massive profits for the Cube Corporation, but you'll receive only the tiniest sliver of the profits."", ""On the plus side, mining those asteroids is tons of fun. Jump in your space freighter, blast off to one of the asteroids passing through your claim, then land on it with your shuttle craft. It's a little too dangerous to walk on the asteroid yourself, but you have a command bot you control as if it's your own body. Use a scanner to find the most valuable resources hidden across the asteroid, shoot a mining laser to break up rocks, and use a gravity tether to yank resources free and carry them to your ship."", ""That's a lot of manual labor (well, remote-controlled manual labor), but where Astronomics gets fun is in the automation. Slow-moving little worker bots that look like Roombas will trundle out to collect any resources you tag for pickup, saving you the trouble of dragging them back to the shuttle yourself. Problem is, asteroids are craggy, jagged places and those little wheeled bots can't always get where you need them them be, so you'll need to set up cranes on top of cliffs or across chasms that can lift your little bots and place them where they'll need to go. It's pretty satisfying to have four or five cranes lifting and placing your small army of carrier bots, all trundling back and forth across the asteroid you're mining, carrying precious metals to your cargo hold."", ""What turns Astronomics from a chilled-out automation game to a rather tense affair is the ticking clock. Asteroids aren't just sitting there motionless waiting for you to stripmine them for spare parts. They're hurtling through your space-claim at untold speeds, so once you've landed you need to get to work if you want to haul off as much as you can. Once an asteroid passes beyond your claim, it's no longer yours. It's pretty exciting to land on an asteroid, set up a full conveyor system of cranes and bots to move all its resources into your ship, then disassemble it all and blast off just before the asteroid speeds out of your claim."", '', 'As you return to the space station with your hold full of precious metals, you can sell some for cash to spend on upgrades (more bots and better tools), invest some into improvements for your freighter and shuttle (like increased cargo space and fuel capacity), and sell the rest to Cube Corporation—with a small sum being added to that $600 million goal that will get you to earth.', ""What I like most is how Astronomics provides a nearly seamless experience. I can run from the space station to the captain's chair on my freighter, plot my trip to an asteroid, fly there, then leave my captain's chair and enter my shuttle, navigate through the asteroid field to the main asteroid I'm going to be mining, land, then take control of my mining robot, and start running around on the asteroid's surface. Only one part of that is a loading screen, which is the trip between the space station and the asteroid. All the rest is seamless, which makes everything more satisfying."", 'Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.', ""The seamlessness is pretty important. I'd set up on an asteroid but with only eight minutes left I realized I'd filled my shuttle to capacity, but there were still more minerals I wanted to carry off. I left my cranes and robots working, jumped into my shuttle, flew back to my freighter (zigzagging through the asteroid field), dumped out my cargo, then flew back to the asteroid. I had just enough time to gather the rest of the resources, get my bots back into the shop, and disassemble my cranes before the asteroid passed out of my claims. Fun stuff."", ""Astronomics is still in early access and I'm pretty keen for March to roll around because its development roadmap shows that's when Steam Deck support will arrive. I'm loving it so far, but would definitely love it if I could take my mining enterprise from the desktop to the couch. You'll find Astronomics here on Steam."", ""Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s. Following a few years as a regular freelancer, PC Gamer hired him in 2014, probably so he'd stop emailing them asking for more work. Chris has a love-hate relationship with survival games and an unhealthy fascination with the inner lives of NPCs.

Spring-loaded Robot Could Explore the Asteroid Belt Almost Indefinitely,https://www.universetoday.com/170932/spring-loaded-robot-could-explore-the-asteroid-belt-almost-indefinitely/,"['UNIVERSE TODAY', 'Space and astronomy news', 'The asteroid belt beckons – it contains enough resources for humans to expand into the entire rest of the solar system and has no biosphere to speak of. Essentially, it is a giant mine just waiting to be exploited. So, a student team from the University of Texas at Austin has devised a plan to exploit it as part of the Revolutionary Aerospace System Concepts – Academic Linkage (RASC-AL), a competition sponsored by NASA to encourage undergraduate and graduate students to develop innovative ideas to solve some of space exploration’s challenges. UT Austin’s submission to the competition last year, known as the Autonomous Exploration Through Extraterrestrial Regions (AETHER) project, certainly fits that bill.', 'AETHER was submitted to the AI-Powered Self-Replicating Probes sub-section of RASC-AL 2024, which solicited ideas that would advance John von Neumann’s idea of a self-replicating space probe. AETHER addresses those challenges in two distinct ways.', 'First, it combines a spring-loaded landing system and a metal-burning rocket engine to hop between different asteroids in the belt. To fuel its rocket, it uses a system to harvest water and metal (specifically aluminum) from the surface of the asteroid it’s currently on, splits it into its components, and then dumps them into a fuel tank that can be used to power its next trip to a different asteroid. All of this is powered by a Kilowatt Reactor Using Stirling TechnoloY (KRUSTY) nuclear reactor that has been undergoing NASA and DoE testing for over a decade.', 'The springs in AETHER’s legs have a two-fold purpose. First, they allow for a soft landing on the surface of the gravitationally weak asteroid and can transfer some of the energy created by that landing into stored energy, which can be used to launch the system from its landing place later. It also has a set of wheels to navigate around the asteroid’s surface. When it’s time to jump off again, it replants its legs and springs back into space – with a little help from its rocket engine.', 'The rocket engine designed as part of AETHER can burn metal, such as aluminum, that the craft harvests from the asteroid to use as fuel. It is the primary system designed to take the craft from asteroid to asteroid, and it is meant to be a high-delta-v option for doing so quickly.', 'AETHER also tries to mimic a von Neumann probe by using a machine-learning algorithm to improve its resource-harvesting efforts. It would take data from various sensors, including synthetic aperture radar and a spectrometer, and estimate where the best spot would be to land to refuel. While collecting that additional fuel material, it would communicate back with Earth via a high-speed optical communication link, allowing an Earth-based server to update the machine learning parameters and improve the algorithm’s outcome for the next hop.', 'The original mission design for AETHER has it stopping at two specific asteroids before moving on to as-yet-unnamed ones. The first, which is probably no surprise, is Psyche, the big metallic asteroid that is about to be visited by its own dedicated probe. Data from that probe will help inform the first iteration of AETHER’s learning algorithm, and the input the sensors provide from its visit will update it before its next step – Themis. That asteroid, though smaller, is expected to contain a large amount of water ice, which is a necessary component for AETHER’s rocket engines.', 'After visiting the first two asteroids, the mission moves on to places unknown, as completing those steps would be considered a success. But given the longevity of the KRUSTY reactor and the craft’s ability to refill its own fuel tank, it is possible, or even likely, that AETHER would consider operating well past its rendezvous with Themis.', 'The UT Austin team was comprised entirely of undergraduate students, though it’s unclear what year of study they were in. But, given their experience with the 2024 version of RASC-AL, they would seem well-placed to submit a project proposal for the recently announced 2025 version. If they do, hopefully, their idea will be just as innovative as AETHER’s.', 'Learn More:\nFlores et al – AETHER\nUT – Miniaturized Jumping Robots Could Study An Asteroid’s Gravity\nUT – NASA Funds the Development of a Nuclear Reactor on the Moon That Would Last for 10 Years\nUT – Engineers Design a Robot That Can Stick To, Crawl Along, and Sail Around Rubble Pile Asteroids', 'Lead Image:\nLanding and take-off depiction of AETHER.\nCredit – Flores et al.', 'You must be logged in to post a comment.', 'This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
