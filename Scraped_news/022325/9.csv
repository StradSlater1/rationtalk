The federal government is divided into three branches: legislative, judicial, and executive. These three branches comprise departments and agencies that are responsible for specific government functions.', 'Legislative. The legislative branch makes laws and levies taxes to fund the federal government’s services. This branch includes Congress, which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It also includes agencies that support Congress, such as the Capitol Police, the Government Accountability Office, and the Library of Congress.', 'Judicial. The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws and how they are applied. It is made up of the Supreme Court of the United States; lower courts, such as Courts of Appeals; special courts, including the Tax Court; and support organizations, such as the Federal Judiciary Center.', 'Executive.

OPM establishes minimum qualifications by occupation or job. For example, workers in professional and technical occupations often need at least a bachelor’s degree, and those in clerical occupations may qualify with a high school diploma.', 'The federal government uses a few different systems to classify jobs. For example, the Federal Wage System classifies jobs in trade, craft, and other blue-collar occupations. But the most common is the General Schedule (GS) system. Under this system, agencies assign each job a GS grade from 1 to 15 based on job duties and qualifications. When federal agencies refer to job classifications, they combine the “GS” classification with a hyphen and the grade level.

Jobs at GS-13 or above may be supervisory or managerial positions.', 'Some jobs, such as editor, require a bachelor’s degree but do not specify a field of study. Others, such as museum curators, require a degree in a specific major or designate a minimum number of credits in a particular subject area. And in some cases, having more education or experience than a position requires may qualify applicants for a higher GS grade—and higher pay.', 'In 2013, according to OPM, the average annual federal salary was just over $79,000.', 'Federal workers’ wages or salaries are based on their job classification, grade level, geographic location, and length of employment. To help offset higher living costs, the federal government includes a premium, called locality pay, for employees who work in 34 urban areas. This premium provides a percentage-based increase over the base pay. For example, a GS-7 job pays nearly $3,000 more in Boston, Massachusetts, than it does in Decatur, Alabama.', 'Workers typically are eligible for “step increases” every 1 to 3 years, until they reach the maximum step in the grade for their job. There are 10 steps at each grade level. Step increases are accompanied by a small bump in pay.', 'Along with salaries or wages, employee compensation in the federal government include benefits, such as subsidized health insurance.', 'Federal workers choose government employment for many reasons; some of these are job security and the opportunity to serve the public. But, like any job, federal work has rewards and challenges.', 'One of the biggest draws of federal work is the chance to make a positive difference, which workers say is a source of pride. Satisfaction often comes from knowing that they are helping and serving people in their roles as public employees.', 'Another appeal to working for the government is job security. Many federal services—including national security, emergency response, and air traffic control—are essential and ongoing. For this reason, federal workers may feel they have greater job stability than private-sector employees.', 'The federal government also offers benefits such as low-cost life insurance and paid vacation and sick leave that begin accruing on the first day of work. Some agencies allow flexible work arrangements, such as alternative schedules. And, when funding is available, agencies may pay for workers to get additional education, such as a professional certificate or graduate degree.', 'For many workers, the biggest challenge of federal work is its bureaucracy: the sheer size of the federal government makes it difficult for agencies to act independently.', 'The vastness of the government contributes to another commonly cited challenge: the complexity of the hiring process. Some people find the job descriptions and application procedures confusing, for example. And workers with technical skills often feel their career options are limited.', 'Similar to many other organizations, federal agencies don’t control their own budgets. Spending is set by the President and Congress for the government as a whole. Uncertain budgeting makes long-term planning difficult and may negatively affect worker morale. An agency’s ability to maintain or improve their operations, such as through updating equipment and supporting innovation, depends on the funding it receives.', 'Despite the challenges, some federal workers feel the rewards of working for the public are worth whatever sacrifices they make to forego the private sector.

While many of these efforts are being challenged in court, the strategy behind them is clear: Villainize public servants, fire or push them out of their jobs, and then dismantle the federal services they were faithfully executing. By sowing public distrust in those who provide government services, the public’s faith in the goods provided by the government is at risk of eroding too, making it easier for the administration to eliminate core government functions that hundreds of millions of Americans rely on.', 'The public goods provided by federal agencies are so commonplace that we may not even recognize how prevalent they are in our lives. When we walk into the grocery store, we purchase our food knowing that it won’t make us sick because of the efforts of the Food and Drug Administration. When we travel in a car, we have confidence in reaching our destination safely because of the standards set and enforced by the Department of Transportation. We can evacuate areas in advance of life-threatening natural disasters because of the efforts of the National Weather Service and other federal agencies. These and countless other services provided by the federal government are possible because of the dedication and expertise of federal employees who are now under attack.', 'The impact of these attacks will be felt throughout the country. Every congressional district has federal workers. Below, we provide a snapshot from FedScope of the federal workforce and the actions the Trump administration has taken to undermine them.', '', 'The federal workforce consists of roughly 3 million employees and represents the diversity of the country. Individuals holding these jobs are hired and discharged based on their merit and are protected from undue political influence or reprisal.

According to NBC News, around two dozen staffers from the CDC’s Laboratory Leadership Service—known as “disease detectors”—were among the people fired. The FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods Jim Jones resigned earlier this week, citing the “indiscriminate” firings of 89 staffers, Bloomberg reported."", 'Department of Energy: As many as 2,000 probationary employees at the agency were fired Thursday, according to Politico, citing anonymous sources—though Bloomberg reports some department staff who work on nuclear security were asked back.', 'Department of Education: Some probationary employees at the agency—including those from the general counsel’s office, office of Special Education and Rehabilitation and Federal Student Aid office—were notified of their termination via a letter this week that cited their “performance,” CNN reported, citing an unnamed union source who claimed “dozens” of employees were let go.', 'Department of Veterans Affairs: The agency announced Thursday that more than 1,000 employees were dismissed “effective immediately,” including some probationary employees, claiming the personnel changes would save the department more than $98 million annually.', 'U.S. Forest Service: More than 3,400 employees were fired Thursday, including positions at each level of the agency, two people familiar with the firings told Politico.', 'Small Business Administration: Some probationary employees at the agency received emails notifying them of their terminations, before another email said the initial notices were a mistake, only to be notified in a third email on Tuesday confirming their firings, outlets reported.', 'Office of Personnel Management: Probationary employees at the office were let go Thursday, a union official with the American Federation of Government Employees told NPR, adding about 100 people were present in a video call notifying the staffers of their dismissal because they declined to take the Trump Administration’s resignation offer.', 'Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: The union that represents workers at the financial agency said about 73 of its members had been terminated, after the agency—which has drawn ire from Trump’s tech allies—was ordered to stop all work, though union leaders and the Trump administration reached a deal Friday that agency employees won’t be terminated while litigation challenging the cuts is still pending.', 'National Nuclear Safety Administration: An employee at the agency—which oversees nuclear weapons in the U.S.—told NPR the agency would fire about 300 of the agency’s 1,800 staff, though the Trump administration is now reportedly trying to hire some of those employees back.', 'General Services Administration: More than 100 people were affected by layoffs at the agency responsible for the federal government’s real estate portfolio, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.', 'Federal Aviation Administration: Hundreds of probationary FAA employees received emails starting late on Feb. 14 from a non-governmental email informing them they’d been fired, according to Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union president David Spero—and one unnamed air traffic controller told the Associated Press people fired included personnel “hired for FAA radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance,” just weeks after a fatal mid-air crash highlighted the shortage in traffic controllers.', ""Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Trump’s administration has reportedly made a number of other high-profile terminations: At least 17 inspectors general, the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency plus three other FEMA workers, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on cases against Trump, at least nine high-ranking FBI agents and the director of the Office of Government Ethics, among others.', 'Trump’s wide-scale job cuts are drawing criticism even from some Republican senators. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, noted Friday the administration has fired more than 100 Alaskans and argued many of the terminations “will do more harm than good” and the Trump administration’s “approach is bringing confusion, anxiety, and now trauma to our civil servants.” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., similarly criticized job cuts at the FBI, saying Saturday, “I am all for efficiency and ultimately downsizing the federal government, but firing large numbers of new FBI agents is not the way to achieve this.”', 'They are mostly new employees who have been in the federal workforce for less than a year and are not afforded some job protections, including a right to appeal terminations.

That’s how many probationary workers are in the federal workforce, according to Office of Personnel Management data.', 'The Trump administration separately offered all federal civilian workers pay with benefits through September if they choose to voluntarily resign, an offer 75,000 federal workers have reportedly accepted so far. The administration has suggested employees who don’t participate in the program could be subject to the mass terminations. The buyout deal was temporarily put on hold amid a lawsuit, but a federal judge allowed the program to resume this week.', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', 'It’s unclear. The administration is facing multiple lawsuits over some of the more high-profile firings. A judge temporarily reinstated the head of the Office of Special Counsel, Hampton Dellinger, who filed a lawsuit Monday contesting his firing. Eight inspectors general also argued in a lawsuit filed Wednesday their terminations violated federal rules that require the executive branch to give Congress 30 days notice before firing them, plus a justification for the terminations. The administration is also facing lawsuits from former National Labor Relations Board Chair Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired by Trump on Jan. 27, and former Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris, who was fired Feb. 10. Harris is a Democrat. Trump has also fired the three-member panel’s other Democratic member, Raymond Limon, and appointed its sole Republican member, Henry Kerner, as chair.', 'Federal regulations of mass layoffs, known as “reduction in force,” require the government to give 60 days advance notice of a layoff. The job must also be eliminated entirely—not an attempt to replace a worker, according to the Wall Street Journal. Employees who believe the administration broke protocol in terminating them can file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board. There are also protections in place for independent boards and commissions, such as the NLRB. Presidents can only fire members of the board for “malfeasance” or “neglect of duty,” according to the Wall Street Journal.', 'Trump is aiming for budget cuts between 30% and 40%, on average, across all government agencies, with staffing reductions serving as a major area for spending rollbacks, the Washington Post reported, citing two anonymous sources. Many of the spending cuts are led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.', 'Trump has sought to dismantle multiple arms of the federal government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the CFPB and all Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. A judge recently blocked Trump’s attempt to put 2,200 USAID staff on paid leave. Shortly after taking office, Trump ordered all DEI employees be placed on paid leave. A staff shakeup is also expected at the Department of Justice, where Trump’s appointees are investigating prosecutors who worked on cases related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.', 'Trump signed an executive order to reinstate a policy from his first term that reclassified tens of thousands of federal civilian employees to at-will employees, making it easier for him to fire them by ridding them of their job protections. Several unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union have filed lawsuits to block Schedule F from taking effect.

He replied to the Office of Personnel Management with his intent to accept the “Fork in the Road” terms — only to be fired as a probationary employee at the Department of Homeland Security on Friday.', '“It’s just a dirty deal — you volunteer to take it, and they still nix you 2 1/2 weeks later,” said the worker, who asked to speak anonymously in part because most of his neighbors are fervent Trump supporters.', 'The worker provided emails that showed just how chaotic the administration’s bureaucratic shake-up has been.

""Things break almost immediately when these employees leave, and so you have to call them back.""', ""Another contributing factor is likely political pressure from Congress, Bednar says, even if it's happening behind closed doors.

How Mass Layoffs Of Federal Employees Could Affect The Economy,https://www.investopedia.com/how-mass-layoffs-of-federal-employees-could-affect-the-economy-trump-musk-doge-11681896,"['', 'Kristen Norman / The Washington Post / Getty Images', 'Experts have identified some potential economic benefits and big risks from President Donald Trump\'s mass firing of federal workers.\n\nIn the first month of Donald Trump\'s presidency, he and his billionaire advisor Elon Musk have moved rapidly to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Trump has frozen hiring at all federal agencies and ordered ""large-scale reductions in force"" through buyout offers and layoffs.\n1', 'Out of the 2.4 million non-postal and non-military federal employees, 75,000 reportedly accepted buyout offers to leave their jobs.\n2\nLast week, a slew of federal agencies fired thousands of employees with probationary employment status, mainly those in their first year on the job, a move potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.\n3', 'On top of that, the administration has moved to dismantle at least two agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development, and threatened to close the Department of Education. Unions representing federal workers have challenged the moves in court.\n4', ""Some economists saw potential benefits in Trump's policies to the extent that they reduce federal spending."", 'The U.S. persistently runs a budget deficit, which adds to the national debt every year and potentially threatens the country\'s financial stability and the ability to respond to future crises. In 2024, the U.S. spent $1.8 trillion more than it took in, adding to the national debt.\n5\nAll else being equal, lower spending on federal workers could help improve that situation.\n\n""While they might hurt growth in the short run, it\'s likely that higher taxes and lower spending will help growth in the long run by reducing the swollen federal budget deficit, which is putting upward pressure on interest rates and crowding out private investment."" Robert Fry, an independent forecaster, said in a commentary.\n\nHowever, mass firings of workers are likely to make only a small dent in the overall federal budget.\n\nAssuming a 10% reduction in the federal workforce of 2.4 million people, the government would save $25 billion annually, economists at Deutsche Bank calculated. That would be less than 1% of federal spending, which amounted to $6.75 trillion last year.', 'The economists said a significant reduction in the federal deficit cannot happen without raising new taxes or making changes to the big entitlement programs. Social Security, Medicare, the military, and interest payments on the national debt take up most of the federal budget each year.', 'Firing large numbers of federal workers also carries some risks to the economy.', 'Should the Trump administration achieve its goal of reducing the federal workforce by 75%, the unemployment rate would skyrocket in places where the federal government is a major employer. In Washington D.C., for example, the unemployment rate would spike to 9.6% from its current level of 2.8%, an analysis by think tank the Urban Institute found in January.\n6\n\n\nDemocrats, union representatives, and some economists warned that many of the employees dismissed by last week\'s order were doing important work.\n\nThe layoffs reportedly included personnel at the Federal Aviation Administration working on air travel safety; staff at the Food and Drug Administration who worked on baby formula safety; employees at the National Institutes of Health overseeing grants for outside research on cancer and other diseases; workers at Department of Agriculture labs who were working to control the ongoing bird flu epidemic that is ravaging poultry flocks across the country; and workers at the IRS who are in the midst of tax season.\n\nDisruptions to government services could backfire on Trump\'s cost-saving efforts. For example, layoffs at the IRS could delay the processing of taxpayers\' returns. They could also reduce federal revenue because fewer IRS workers would make tax cheats less likely to be caught, Elaine Kamarck, director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a commentary.\n7\n\n\n""The agencies and jobs that are disappearing play vital roles in protecting the public, supporting the safety net, and bolstering demand for U.S. products, among many other functions,"" Adam Kamins, and Justin Begley, economists at Moody\'s Analytics, wrote in a commentary. ""This injects additional uncertainty into an environment that is already littered with risk.""\n8', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

They pose an unparalleled danger to every single American.', 'Trump’s mission is simple: to exert authoritarian control over all branches of the federal government. To do that, he can’t merely fire the people at the top of government agencies. He needs workers at all levels of government who will put his wishes ahead of everything else, including the law. And to do that, he has to break the back of the federal employee labor movement.', 'That’s why Trump has unleashed Musk to take a wrecking ball to piece after piece of the government under the guise of trying to increase efficiency. The organized power of federal workers is the main obstacle to MAGA’s looting of public services and consolidation of authoritarian rule. The stronger they are, the harder it is for Trump to fully impose his agenda on American society.', 'Just as ominously, Trump and Musk are using these attacks to wage an ideological assault on the very principle of public services. Dols’s response to Musk expressed this clearly: “Everything public is under attack. The entire public sphere is under attack by a handful of billionaires behind Donald Trump.… Are you trying to do this for the American people, or are you trying to do this for your own gain? I get the feeling you didn’t become the richest person in the world by looking out for others.”', 'Nobody else is as well positioned as federal workers to halt this administration’s reactionary ambitions. Democratic leaders seem mostly interested in convincing their base that there’s nothing they can do. And while it’s still possible that the courts may pause or rein in some of Trump’s most egregious legal violations, we shouldn’t expect the Supreme Court, a third of which Trump appointed, to check his conduct in any significant way. Besides, courts move slowly. While waiting for legal edicts to come down, Musk can gain de facto control of the entire governmental apparatus, while doing everything possible to decimate public services.', 'But by refusing to quit, by refusing to comply with the power grab, and by making a compelling public case for the importance of their services, federal workers can throw a major wrench into Trump’s operations. And by taking their story to the American people through attention-grabbing fights like the day of action taking place across the country today, they can challenge Musk’s disgusting claims that they are “a parasite class.” Only federal workers can convince the American public that MAGA is threatening their Medicare, Social Security, health care, and education, as well as basic safety protections at work and beyond. The following point must be loudly, bluntly, and repeatedly hammered home to the American public: The new administration is threatening you and your family’s ability to get by, all for the benefit of a handful of corrupt billionaires.', 'Until we can show ordinary Americans that their immediate material interests are being hurt by Trump’s billionaire wrecking crew, the sad reality is that our side will continue to lose.

If Musk is also able to illegally bust federal unions with little public outcry or broad labor fightback, already-emboldened bosses will take it as a sign that the gloves can fully come off. We saw in 1981 how President Reagan’s firing of striking federal PATCO air traffic controllers sparked an employer offensive in all industries and against all unions. The result? Union memberships plummeted, inequality skyrocketed, and ordinary people’s living standards stagnated. We’re still dealing with the damage today.', 'The task ahead is to convince nonunion workers that the fight of federal workers is also their fight. Trump is playing with fire, since, contrary to what he now claims, he was not elected with any mandate to decimate public services or unions. Indeed, the popularity of labor unions remains at historically high levels, even among Republicans. But workers outside of progressive echo chambers still need to be convinced that if Musk can terrorize federal employees into submission, every boss in the country will be tempted to run the same playbook: use brutal intimidation tactics and mass layoffs to dramatically cut their workforces, obliging those who remain to work more for less.', 'The new administration’s witch hunt against federal employees has left many scared to speak out, a hesitancy exacerbated by legal restrictions on civil service employees’ free speech. This fear can be overcome, as the administration’s attacks deepen, as a minority of federal workers begin speaking out, and once public opinioncontinues to shift against the new administration. Always attuned to his popularity, Trump is surely measuring the extent of pushback against Musk’s wrecking-ball operation. Trump’s main instinct is forself-preservation, not ideological crusading.

The events now unfolding are not merely the result of an election shifting political power from one party to another during a deeply partisan time. These events also herald more than the end of the international liberal political order that evolved from the New Deal to neoliberalism. We are witnessing a regime change in America.', 'The new regime’s brazen aggression and extreme goals are most visible in the frontal attack on the U.S. federal workforce, which has witnessed the gutting or disabling of several agencies, layoffs at virtually all others, the shredding of collective bargaining contracts with federal unions, and an attempt to effectively break the civil service.', 'The leaders of this effort told us long ago that this is what they had in mind. In September 2021, J.D. Vance laid out this vision with shameless candor to a conservative podcaster. What Donald Trump should do if he regained office, Vance said, is “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state” and “replace them with our people.” And “when the courts stop [him],” he said, “because [he] will get taken to court,” Trump should “stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say the Chief Justice has made his ruling, now let him enforce it.”', 'The arrival of this moment has brought the American labor movement to a crossroads. Not since President Ronald Reagan broke the illegal air traffic controllers’ strike in 1981 by firing and permanently replacing the strikers has an administration’s treatment of federal workers threatened to impact U.S. labor relations as broadly and profoundly as the recent actions of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Reagan’s breaking of the walkout by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) inspired a torrent of private sector anti-unionism that saw employers break a host of prominent strikes in the 1980s, dealing a devastating blow to the union movement and hurting workers more broadly. Yet compared to the current administration, Reagan’s approach to the PATCO strike was mild.', 'Trump and Musk’s actions are shaping up to be worse than Reagan’s union busting, not only for federal workers, but also for workers across America. As the nation’s largest employer, the federal government’s labor relations policies inevitably ripple across the economy, influencing how employers of all kinds behave. Not only do they threaten to weaken unions, as Reagan’s breaking of PATCO did, they jeopardize the entire edifice of workers’ rights erected over more than a century.', 'Comparing the crisis the PATCO strike created for labor to the one that workers and unions currently face is instructive. Doing so reveals not only how much more dangerous the threat posed by Trump is, but also how much more vulnerable Trump might become to a well-organized, principled, and determined resistance, something that never developed in 1981.', '', '', '', 'Neither PATCO nor Reagan anticipated at the outset just how important a turning point in organized labor’s history their conflict would become. As the only former union leader ever to win election to the presidency, Reagan didn’t set out to provoke a confrontation with PATCO, one of the few unions that had endorsed him in 1980. Rather, he authorized his negotiators to offer more to PATCO than the government had ever given to a federal union during bargaining. Unfortunately, Reagan contributed to elevating unrealistic expectations among his former supporters. When they staged an illegal strike in protest of what they considered to be a low-ball offer, he gave them forty-eight hours to return to work. When the vast majority refused, he fired them. This move came as a relief to his conservative advisors who felt he had offered too much to the union to begin with.', 'Even Reagan’s harshest critics had to admit that he was acting within his powers under the law. Had Jimmy Carter still been president he might well have done the same. After all, Carter’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had drawn up the strike contingency plan that Reagan’s people followed to break PATCO’s walkout. Reagan’s amendment to Carter’s plan was his refusal to rehire any strikers long after their union had been broken. That move burnished his reputation for toughness at the expense of the nation’s air traffic control system, which still suffers from the lingering effects of the mass firing.', 'It was his ability to pull off the dramatic, sudden erasure of 70 percent of a vital agency’s skilled workforce that proved most inspiring to private sector employers. In the 1980s, they sought to emulate Reagan. Many incited strikes by instituting draconian wage cuts just to have the opportunity to replace their strikers. For a decade, strike debacle after strike debacle played out for the copper miners of Phelps Dodge, the meatpackers of Hormel, the operatives at International Paper—causing many other workers to realize that they had lost the ability to strike effectively. This realization drove down the nation’s annual average of large work stoppages from 289 in the 1970s to thirty-five in the 1990s. That decline signaled a dramatic setback for bargaining power and opened the door to a new era of growing inequality that put us on the road to the present moment.', 'Still, compared to Trump, Reagan was a union sympathizer who respected the rule of law. Ironically, his decision not to rehire any PATCO strikers was largely intended to warn Moscow’s leaders that they had better not test his mettle, for if they did, he would show them no more mercy than he had shown controllers whose lives were shattered by being banned from the highly skilled profession for which they had spent years training. As heartless as that act was, Reagan never attempted to violate collective bargaining contracts in the federal sector, nor did he question federal workers’ legislated union rights. Indeed, his administration recognized a new air traffic controllers’ union at the FAA before he left office. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association exists to this day. And as mean-spirited as Reagan was in his denigration of government, with quips like “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help,’” such sentiments constituted rhetoric more than policy: the number of federal employees actually grew on his watch.', '', '', '', 'The contrast between the Reagan and Trump administrations are stark. Trump is pursuing his attack on federal workers’ rights through a “department” Congress neither created nor approved, Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE). Musk’s minions have rummaged through some of the most sensitive private information the government possesses at agencies such as the Social Security Administration. When Democratic lawmaker Robert Garcia challenged Musk, Trump’s U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia raised the specter of investigating Garcia for making threats against a government employee. In the meantime, federal agencies have tossed aside collective bargaining agreements with their unions and run roughshod over civil service regulations in announcing mass layoffs and unilateral changes in remote work policies.', 'Trump has also outdone Reagan in his hostility to the key federal agencies charged with protecting workers’ rights: the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). Reagan appointed staunch conservatives to those agencies—including naming Clarence Thomas as chair of the EEOC—and by doing so weakened their protective powers. But Reagan never claimed the right to fire Carter’s appointees in the middle of their terms of service. By contrast, Trump has removed duly appointed and Senate-confirmed members of each of these bodies, effectively disabling their function and seeking to ensure that henceforth such agencies will never act with any degree of independence. In the meantime, Musk’s SpaceX has joined with other employers to contest the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court.', 'As the unprecedented attack on the NLRB and the EEOC already indicates, Trump’s current war on workers’ rights will not remain confined to the federal sector. Considering the speed, breadth, and radicalism of the current administration’s moves, its lasting impact is likely to be many orders of magnitude more harmful than anything Reagan did.', 'Trump can inflict more damage in part because U.S. workers are more vulnerable to a rollback of their rights today than they were in the 1980s. The potential bases of resistance have all been dramatically weakened over the past forty-four years. In relative terms, today’s union movement is less than half the size it was when Reagan broke PATCO. Unions are also more geographically isolated (a state like Alabama has seen union membership plummet from over 20 percent of its workforce to under 7 percent today). Our political system is far more polarized on labor issues now than it was in 1981 with only one party committed to upholding the last century’s accumulation of labor laws that were enacted with bipartisan support. A new class of multi-billionaires bends its knee to the far right. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court, whose misguided ruling in Trump v. United States offered a broad cloak of immunity to the president, is more hostile to workers’ rights than any court in a century. The court’s tendency to slow-walk any decision that challenges Trump means that plenty of irreversible damage will likely ensue before it ever weighs in.', '', '', '', 'Where does this leave today’s labor movement and its allies? In answering that question, it is instructive to recall how labor responded to Reagan in 1981.', 'Organized labor was caught flat-footed by Reagan’s breaking of PATCO. The union neither sought nor received support from the AFL-CIO prior to launching its disastrous strike. AFL-CIO leaders were at a pre-scheduled meeting on August 3, 1981, when they heard that PATCO’s walkout had begun. They immediately worried about its potential impact on the entire movement. After all, the strike was an illegal action waged against a popular president who had been elected by a landslide and then earned bipartisan sympathy by having survived an assassination attempt six months earlier. At the same time, PATCO strikers seemed tone deaf. They were asking for large wage increases at a time when other unions were making concessions in their contract negotiations and taxpayers were staggering under the weight of stagflation. Union leaders knew that many workers, union or not, believed Reagan was right to give an ultimatum to the strikers.', 'Facing this situation labor leaders believed they could neither abandon their fellow unionists by condemning the walkout as a strategic blunder nor fully commit their organizations—many of whose members were divided on the issue—to a full-scale resistance to Reagan’s firing of the strikers. To be sure, AFL-CIO leaders marched on picket lines and their members participated in demonstrations at airports across the county. Sporadic acts of civil disobedience occurred in some places, but they were not organized by labor’s top leaders. Those leaders instead concentrated on organizing the massive Solidarity Day march on Washington, on September 19, 1981. It was the largest protest march that had yet been held in the capital’s history, but when the marchers went home afterward nothing had changed. Reagan had broken PATCO and the union movement could manage little more than to raise the chant that union busting was disgusting.', 'The psychological impact of that defeat on the labor movement and its opponents alike was profound. Labor’s inability to marshal significant resistance to the PATCO firings helped inspire business to bust unions with gusto in the 1980s. In some ways, the labor movement never fully recovered from that era of retreat.', 'Today’s labor movement and its allies face a similar moment of truth. At stake in Trump’s attack on federal workers and unions is more than the fate of one federal agency’s workforce, as was the case in 1981. At stake now is more even than the fate of all federal workers, or of American workers’ rights in the public or the private sector. At stake now is the very character of our government and the norms of democratic governance that have been constructed over decades. At stake now is whether we will have any labor movement at all to speak of ten years from now.', 'On February 19, I joined a rally organized by the Federal Unionists Network (FUN) outside the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of a national day of action. FUN—a grassroots network that includes union members from multiple unions across the federal service and around the country—is one of the most inspiring efforts to emerge over recent weeks. There were a thousand spirited protesters on hand, and they were clearly frustrated with Democratic leaders. When Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen told the rallygoers that he stood in solidarity with them, they interrupted him with cries of “Shut down the Senate!” When he concluded his remarks, they chanted “Do something!” I added my voice to their chant but, as I left, I was haunted by the recollection of many such gatherings that popped up in support of PATCO forty-four years ago to no avail.', 'As happened in 1981, today’s labor movement thus far appears unsure of how to respond to an emergency situation. In many ways, this is quite understandable. Few could have anticipated how fast this crisis would emerge and how dangerous it would quickly become. To this point labor is doing the things that are in its comfort zone: filing lawsuits, sponsoring rallies, and launching initiatives like the AFL-CIO’s “Department of People Who Work for a Living” to counter DOGE.', 'But labor and its allies can and must do much more. The conditions that inhibited unions in 1981 don’t exist now. Unions are riding a wave of popularity they have not seen since the days when Reagan was a Democrat. Unlike Reagan, Trump was not elected by a landslide, nor is he broadly popular. The public has none of the animosity toward federal workers today that many felt toward PATCO members, whom many saw as arrogant. While the public blamed controllers for flight delays, those whose federal contracts, grants, and services are being sacrificed amid these cutbacks have only Trump and Musk, a multi-billionaire who cares more about occupying Mars than addressing the concerns of everyday Americans, to blame. Public opinion is not clamoring for the complete dismantling of our government that is now underway. Perhaps most important, this time it is the president, not the workers he is targeting, who is breaking the law, and early public opinion polls reflect this realization.', 'These circumstances give labor and its allies, including non-federal workers, permission to escalate their tactics in a fight that must be waged not only for the future of the movement but for that of the nation as well. The context of this fight makes escalation possible; the enormous stakes make escalation necessary. What we are currently doing is simply not enough. Any escalation should of course be framed in ways that broaden support for the struggle to save our government and its workers from Musk’s chainsaw.

Eight inspectors general also argued in a lawsuit filed Wednesday their terminations violated federal rules that require the executive branch to give Congress 30 days notice before firing them, plus a justification for the terminations. The administration is also facing lawsuits from former National Labor Relations Board Chair Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired by Trump on Jan. 27, and former Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris, who was fired Feb. 10.

Trump has also fired the three-member panel’s other Democratic member, Raymond Limon, and appointed its sole Republican member, Henry Kerner, as chair.', 'Federal regulations of mass layoffs, known as “reduction in force,” require the government to give 60 days advance notice of a layoff. The job must also be eliminated entirely—not an attempt to replace a worker, according to the Wall Street Journal. Employees who believe the administration broke protocol in terminating them can file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board. There are also protections in place for independent boards and commissions, such as the NLRB. Presidents can only fire members of the board for “malfeasance” or “neglect of duty,” according to the Wall Street Journal.', 'Trump is aiming for budget cuts between 30% and 40%, on average, across all government agencies, with staffing reductions serving as a major area for spending rollbacks, the Washington Post reported, citing two anonymous sources.

They allege that the firings “represent one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country.” In federal service, new employees and employees who change positions (including through promotions) have probationary status. The unions claim that OPM is exploiting and misusing the probationary period to eliminate staff across federal agencies, and are asking for an injunction to stop further terminations and to rescind those that have already been executed. ', 'The plaintiffs in this case consist of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO; AFGE Local 1216; and United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals, AFSCME, AFL-CIO. They are  represented byState Democracy Defenders Fund (SDDF)and the law firm Altshuler Berzon LLP.', ""The complaint says that OPM’s egregious firings were made on false pretenses and violate federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act and other statutes defining federal employment and OPM's role. These firings were executed across federal agencies, based on directives from OPM. OPM, the complaint asserts, acted unlawfully by directing federal agencies to use a standardized termination notice falsely claiming performance issues. Congress, not OPM,controls and authorizes federal employment and related spending by the federal administrative agencies, and Congress has determined that each agency is responsible for managing its own employees.     "", '“This administration has abused the probationary period to conduct a chaotic, ill-informed, and politically-driven firing spree. The result has been the indiscriminate firing of thousands of patriotic public servants across the country who help veterans in crisis, ensure the safety of our nuclear weapons, keep power flowing to American homes, combat the bird flu, and provide other essential services,” said AFGE National President Everett Kelley. “These actions aren’t just illegal. They are hurting everyday Americans and making us all less safe. It’s a stark reminder of the price we all pay when you stack the government with political loyalists instead of professionals.”', '“Overnight, tens of thousands of federal employees received the same termination letter citing ‘performance issues’ without any explanation or reasoning,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders. “These mass firings are yet another unlawful attempt by this billionaire-run administration to gut public services without regard to the health and safety of our communities. Federal workers are qualified professionals who make our nation stronger – supporting our schools, parks, hospitals and vital infrastructure. We will keep fighting these attacks on their freedoms that threaten everything from food safety to national security to health care.”', '“New hires are crucial as our country continues to face nurse staffing challenges. Indiscriminately firing these nurses, who are essential to the care their units provide, could truly cost lives,” said Charmaine S. Morales, RN and UNAC/UHCP President.', 'Norm Eisen, representing the plaintiffs and executive chair of State Democracy Defenders Fund, said, “SDDF is proud to stand with leading public service unions in this critical fight to protect their members, who dedicate their lives to serving our nation. The mass firings ordered by OPM are illegal and betray the trust of countless federal employees. We are committed to restoring justice for these workers.”', 'The complaint is available here.', '#####', ' ', 'The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is the largest federal employee union, representing more than 800,000 workers in the federal government and the government of the District of Columbia.

The national park will probably see its staff gutted, leaving it more vulnerable to wildfires and without search and rescue capabilities. “I honestly can’t imagine how the parks will operate without my position,” a park ranger who was cut wrote on Instagram. “I mean, they just can’t. I am the only EMT at my park and the first responder for any emergency. This is flat-out reckless.”', 'You keep an eye on the bird flu levels and a measles outbreak – the winter has been punishing for illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were hit with a first round of layoffs this week, which could affect outbreak response and reporting. The Epidemic Intelligence Service, a disease-detective training program, could be on the chopping block.', 'Oh, and you’re working on your taxes – while thousands of Internal Revenue Service probationary employees are expected to be laid off during tax season.', 'The government certainly has room for improvement – backlogs that should be cleared, investigations that should be more thorough, communication that should be sharper, actions that should be more transparent. But all of this work is done by the federal government and its millions of workers and contractors, whose daily jobs touch the lives of all Americans and many around the globe.', 'In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the president and the billionaire Elon Musk, tasked with cutting government through the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), have waged war against federal workers. Musk and his team have moved from agency to agency, indiscriminately firing probationary employees and those whose work they say doesn’t align with the administration’s priorities, including many who work on diversity initiatives or in international development.', 'The result is a hobbled and terrified federal workforce that is just at the beginning of the expected cuts – and an American public that is starting to experience the repercussions.', '“We’re playing Russian roulette, and basically you’re putting a whole bunch of more bullets in the chambers,” said Max Stier, the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit that advocates for a strong civil service. “You can’t prevent all bad things from happening, but our federal government is, in a lot of ways, a manager of risk, and it does a pretty darn good job of managing that risk, even though it can be improved.”', 'An email went out in January to millions of federal employees offering a deferred resignation, which the White House says about 75,000 people have accepted, although it’s unclear how many of the people who accepted are actually eligible.', 'Joel Smith works at the Social Security Administration and is the president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which covers more than 90 agency offices in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana. He said the office of management and budget, which has coordinated the buyout program it’s calling a “fork in the road”, hasn’t communicated with the agencies about which employees accepted the buyout. Some employees didn’t show up the first day the program’s leave was supposed to begin, and the agency had to call them to figure out where they were, he said.', '“It’s just chaos on top of chaos, on top of terror, on top of employees that want to leave are being told they can’t leave. I’m trying to think of a good word for it. I don’t know if there is one, other than clusterfuck,” Smith said.', 'Those that remain in their jobs worry about whether they’re next as they add to their workloads to cover for those who lost their jobs or quit. People eyeing next career moves will avoid civil service, previously seen as a stable career, to stay out of the current chaos.', 'Many people take core functions of the federal government for granted, as it protects them from disasters or national security concerns, but might not otherwise affect them. But that could change after widespread firings. For example, layoffs in the Environmental Protection Agency mean that those remaining in their positions have less capacity to do their jobs.', '“That could come in the guise of someone not being able to respond to an environmental disaster,” said Nicole Cantello, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704. “Or what about if there’s a facility illegally flaring air pollutants? We might not be as able to respond to something like that which could have health effects. There could be devastating effects to the American people.”', 'If you or your loved ones use any direct services such as benefits programs, you could see the effects of a beleaguered federal workforce up close.', 'Let’s say you’re helping your parents sign up for social security. The Social Security Administration is already understaffed, so losing any positions will make wait times longer for people who need to access benefits, Smith said.', 'Smith’s father filed for retirement benefits in November to begin in February, but by February, his case hadn’t been processed – it was stuck in somebody’s backlog. A member of Congress had to intervene to bring attention to the delay, a frequent tactic to overcome stalled claims.', '“What people think they’re witnessing now and they’re complaining about now, in terms of delays, is going to be considered the good old days here in a year or two if this continues,” he said. “We already don’t have the people to do the work.”', 'For federal workers and their families, the impact is heavy and immediate if they lose their livelihoods.', '“The way it’s working now is that the career civil servants are viewed as the villains,” said Rob Shriver, former acting director of the US office of personnel management who now works at Democracy Forward. “They’re viewed as people who are to be worked around and not worked with. They’re being deprived of the thing that’s most important to them, which is to contribute to the agency’s mission and bring their skills and expertise to the table to help inform decision makers.”', 'Though many have focused on the disruption caused in Washington, federal workers live throughout the US and, in some cases, other parts of the world.', '“There’s a human aspect of it, which is these people are not just being fired, but they’re being fired in the worst way. No notice, no nothing. This is true across the board. There is zero humanity being demonstrated,” said Stier, of the Partnership for Public Service. “It is unbelievably costly to the individuals involved, and it’s costly to the system and to the American taxpayers. It’s going to cost the American taxpayer a ton of money. It is not going to save any money.”', 'Send us a tip\nIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.']"
