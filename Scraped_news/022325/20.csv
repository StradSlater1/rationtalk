He kept his comments on the stock market brief but reinforced his long-standing investment philosophy: Berkshire prefers owning great businesses over holding cash, even as its cash reserves hit a record $321.4 billion, equivalent to more than most American big companies’ market cap.', '', '', 'Buffett emphasized that Berkshire is not shying away from stocks. “Despite what some commentators see as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, most of your money remains in equities,” he wrote. While it’s rare to find outstanding businesses for sale in full, Buffett noted that investors can still buy shares of these companies on Wall Street, though genuine bargains are slim pickings.', '', '', '', '']"

Warren Buffett Dismisses Concerns About Cash Holdings,https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/warren-buffett-dismisses-concerns-about-cash-holdings,"['Plus, more takeaways from the famed investor’s 2024 letter to shareholders, including Berkshire’s growing Japanese investments and record tax bill.', 'Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B Chairman Warren Buffett released his closely watched annual letter to shareholders on Saturday.', 'In his 60th year at the helm of the massive conglomerate, Buffett offered reassurance to investors concerned about Berkshire’s massive cash pile along with insight into the firm’s Japanese holdings and the strong performance of its insurance business in 2024.', 'The letter was accompanied by the firm’s 2024 financial results, which showed operating earnings rise to $47.4 billion, a 27% increase compared with the prior year. That’s despite the fact that more than half of the company’s operating businesses saw their earnings decline last year, Buffett said.', 'Strong earnings from Berkshire’s insurance segment helped drive a large portion of the overall gains. Buffett also cited “predictably large” gains in investment income from Treasury bills.', 'Berkshire’s stock is up 5.6% so far this year and 17.2% over the past 12 months. The Morningstar US Market Index has returned 2.31% since the beginning of January 2025 and 21.76% over the past year. Berkshire crossed the threshold of $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time late last summer.', 'Here are a few key takeaways for investors.', 'Berkshire’s cash reserve has been the subject of mounting speculation from market watchers in recent months. As of the end of the fourth quarter, the firm’s cash holdings amounted to an eye-watering $334 billion, a sum that has been augmented by the sale of holdings in Apple AAPL and Bank of America BAC and a slowdown in stock buybacks.', 'Investors have been itching for answers: What kind of opportunity is Berkshire waiting for? Are there no bargains to be found? The Oracle of Omaha didn’t offer insight into his reasoning, but he had these words of reassurance for investors about his lasting preference for equities over cash:', '“Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities,” Buffett wrote. “That preference won’t change.”', 'Buffett noted that while the firm’s holdings in stocks fell last year, the value of its private holdings rose “and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio.”', 'He continued: “Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities—mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned.”', 'Buffett highlighted the success of Berkshire’s property-casualty insurance business, which he called the “core” of the firm’s business model. Berkshire’s operating earnings from insurance underwriting jumped 66% to $9 billion in 2024 compared with the prior year.', 'He pointed specifically to the performance of Geico under CEO Todd Combs, describing the firm’s improvement in 2024 as “spectacular” even though more work remains to be done.', 'Buffett argued that Berkshire is uniquely suited for the rare financial model of the industry, where payment is received upfront and the true cost to the business is only determined years or even decades down the line.', '“Berkshire can financially and psychologically handle extreme losses without blinking,” he wrote. “We are also not dependent on reinsurers and that gives us a material and enduring cost advantage. Finally, we have outstanding managers (no optimists) and are particularly well-situated to utilize the substantial sums P/C insurance delivers for investment.”', 'Buffett also highlighted what he calls a “small but important exception” to Berkshire’s US-focused strategy: the firm’s growing investment in Japan through share purchases in five companies: Itochu ITOCY, Marubeni MARUY, Mitsubishi MTSUY, Mitsui MITSY, and Sumitomo SSUMY. The five companies are conglomerates not unlike Berkshire itself; they own interests in a wide range of businesses both within Japan and globally.', '“We simply looked at their financial records and were amazed at the low prices of their stocks,” Buffett wrote.', 'Buffett added that “our admiration for these companies has consistently grown” in the years since Berkshire began investing in them in 2019. The companies increase their dividends and repurchase shares when appropriate, he said, and their executive compensation programs are “far less aggressive” compared with their American counterparts.', 'Buffett says he expects Berkshire to continue holding this Japanese position for decades to come. Berkshire had previously agreed to limit its holdings to no more than 10% of each company’s shares, but that limit could increase.', 'Buffett used Berkshire’s growing tax bill as a benchmark for the firm’s success over the past six decades.', 'Berkshire paid no income tax in 1965, the year Buffett took the reins. Sixty years later, Buffett said, Berkshire wrote the US government four tax checks totaling $26.8 billion, which accounted for about 5% of what all of corporate America paid in taxes last year. That’s the most any company has ever paid in income tax to the US government, “even the American tech titans that commanded market values in the trillions.”', 'Over time, according to Buffett, the firm’s tax payments to the Treasury Department have exceeded $101 billion.', 'Perhaps just as notable as Buffett’s words of wisdom for investors was what he didn’t address. He was tight-lipped on today’s stock market conditions, though he did offer his lasting optimism on the earnings power of American companies over time. “I have depended on the success of American businesses, and I will continue to do so,” he said.', 'While Buffett offered no concrete details on any plans to transition away from his role at the company, he noted that at his age of 94, it “won’t be long” before Greg Abel, the vice chairman of Berkshire’s noninsurance operations, takes over as CEO.', 'Buffett reiterated his confidence in Abel’s ability to identify good investments when they arise: “Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,” Buffett wrote. “Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie.”', 'Key takeaways from Warren Buffett’s 2023 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders.', 'Great investing opportunities are rare, which is why indexing makes sense for most investors.', 'Warren Buffett discusses why he keeps cash on hand, warns of “bloviated bull,” and explains why he’s not a stock-picker.', 'What Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman left out of this year’s annual shareholder letter is almost as notable as what he put in.', 'Warren Buffett addresses Berkshire Hathaway after his exit, the problem with corporate boards, and why equities are still the place to be long-term.', 'In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett argues why the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts--and comments on that sizable cash stake.', 'In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett makes the case for doing less and sticking to the fundamentals of investing.', 'Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett praises indexing, and American dynamism in his 2016 letter to shareholders.', 'America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs, writes the Berkshire chairman and CEO in his annual letter to shareholders.', ""In the firm's annual letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger reflect on Berkshire Hathaway's history and future prospects."", 'The author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

Right at the start, Buffett took the time to go back and count how often he’s the same language over and over in several of his previous letters.', '“During the 2019-23 period,” Buffett wrote, “I have used the words ‘mistake’ or ‘error’ 16 times in my letters to you.

Take a tour of New England today and tell me how many flourishing textile mills you still see.', 'I think it’s to his credit that Buffett kept the textile business going as long as he did – basically 20 years after he acquired Berkshire — primarily because it employed lots of older workers who didn’t have many other economic opportunities.', 'But from a pure business and investing perspective, and with the benefit of hindsight, there are a lot of other things that Buffett could have done with the money.', 'Buffett writes in the context of investments, of course, but often his insights seem broadly applicable to other parts of business, and even life in general.', 'Further, he’s at the point where he’s serving as a conduit for the advice that he received from some of his mentors, most of whom lived into their 90s, but are now deceased.', 'Two examples:', 'There’s the advice he says his mentor Thomas Murphy (a former Berkshire board member, among many other things, who died in 2022 at age 96), gave him about offering public praise and criticism:', '“[P]raise by name, criticize by category.”', 'Then there’s the key advice he says his right hand, Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger (who died in 2023 at age 99), offered:', '“The cardinal sin is delaying the correction of mistakes or what [Munger] called ‘thumb-sucking.’ Problems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away.

The company’s operating earnings for the quarter were recorded at $14.5 billion.', 'A significant portion of the earnings increase was due to a 48% increase in insurance investment income, which amounted to $4.1 billion. The firm’s insurance underwriting business also experienced a strong recovery, with operating earnings multiplying fourfold to $3.4 billion.', 'GEICO, a major contributor to Berkshire’s insurance results, more than doubled its pretax underwriting earnings to $7.8 billion in 2024. This was achieved by reversing a years-long downward trend and adding new clients in the latter half of the year.', 'However, despite these positive results, Berkshire expects pretax losses of approximately $1.3 billion due to the wildfires that ravaged parts of Los Angeles last month. Furthermore, Buffett’s cash reserves increased to a record $334.2 billion at the end of 2024, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of growth.', 'In his letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett revealed the company’s performance exceeded his expectations.

From NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun: “Mortgage rates have refused to budge for several months despite multiple rounds of short-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. When combined with elevated home prices, housing affordability remains a major challenge.”', 'Home prices fall. Prices for previously owned homes declined from last month’s levels but were above year ago levels. From the NAR: “The median existing-home sales price for all housing types in January was $396,900, up 4.8% from one year ago ($378,600).”', 'Homebuilder sentiment tumbles. From the NAHB’s Carl Harris: “While builders hold out hope for pro-development policies, particularly for regulatory reform, policy uncertainty and cost factors created a reset for 2025 expectations in the most recent HMI. Uncertainty on the tariff front helped push builders’ expectations for future sales volume down to the lowest level since December 2023. Incentive use may also be weakening as a sales strategy as elevated interest rates reduce the pool of eligible home buyers.”', 'New home construction starts fall. Housing starts fell 9.8% in January to an annualized rate of 1.37 million units, according to the Census Bureau. Building permits ticked up 0.1% to an annualized rate of 1.48 million units.', 'Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.85% from 6.87% last week. From Freddie Mac: “Mortgage rates decreased slightly this week. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has stayed just under 7% for five consecutive weeks and in that time has fluctuated less than 20 basis points. This stability continues to bode well for potential buyers and sellers as the spring homebuying season approaches.”', 'There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million (or 40%) of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.', 'Unemployment claims rise. Initial claims for unemployment benefits increased to 219,000 during the week ending February 15, up from 213,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth.', 'Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 14 Feb 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 3.3% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 14 Feb 2025, our estimate of the US Census February control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.33%.”', 'From BofA: “Total card spending per HH was up 0.5% y/y in the week ending Feb 15, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Y/y total spending in the Midwest seems to have been impacted by snowstorms in the week ending Feb 15. Also, there was a negative impact from the Superbowl timing change (2/9/25 vs. 2/11/24), weighing on y/y total spending.“', 'Gas prices idle. From AAA: “Most drivers saw few changes at the pump this past week, as the national average for a gallon of gas remained steady at $3.16... According to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gasoline demand decreased from 8.57 million b/d last week to 8.23. Total domestic gasoline supply dropped from 248.1 million barrels to 247.9. Gasoline production also decreased last week, averaging 9.2 million barrels per day.”', 'Consumer vibes tumble. From the University of Michigan’s January Surveys of Consumers: “Consumer sentiment extended its early month decline, sliding nearly 10% from January. The decrease was unanimous across groups by age, income, and wealth. All five index components deteriorated this month, led by a 19% plunge in buying conditions for durables, in large part due to fears that tariff-induced price increases are imminent. Expectations for personal finances and the short-run economic outlook both declined almost 10% in February, while the long-run economic outlook fell back about 6% to its lowest reading since November 2023. While sentiment fell for both Democrats and Independents, it was unchanged for Republicans, reflecting continued disagreements on the consequences of new economic policies.”', 'CEOs are more optimistic. The Conference Board’s CEO Confidence index signaled improving optimism in Q1 2025. From The Conference Board’s Stephanie Guichard: “The improvement in CEO Confidence in the first quarter of 2025 was significant and broad-based. All components of the Measure improved, as CEOs were substantially more optimistic about current economic conditions as well as about future economic conditions — both overall and in their own industries. CEOs’ assessments of current conditions in their own industries also improved. (This measure is not included in calculating the topline Confidence measure). Consistent with an improved expected outlook, there was a notable increase in the share of CEOs expecting to increase investment plans and a decline in the share expecting to downsize investment plans. Still, a majority of CEOs indicated no revisions to their capital spending plans over the next 12 months.“', ""This is the stuff pros are worried about. According to BofA’s February Global Fund Manager Survey: “39% of February FMS investors say a recessionary trade war is the biggest 'tail risk', overtaking inflation causing Fed to hike (31%), and followed by AI bubble (13%).”"", 'Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: “Peak day office occupancy was 61.2% on Tuesday last week, down 2.1 points from the previous week. Winter weather affected workers in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Philadelphia, as Wednesday occupancy fell 36.1 points, 22.3 points, and 13.9 points, respectively. San Jose reached 64.5% occupancy on Tuesday, hitting a new record single-day post-pandemic high. The average low was on Friday at 36.4%, up six tenths of a point from last week.”', 'Surveys point to cooling activity. From S&P Global’s February Flash U.S. PMI: “The upbeat mood seen among US businesses at the start of the year has evaporated, replaced with a darkening picture of heightened uncertainty, stalling business activity and rising prices. Optimism about the year ahead has slumped from the near-three-year highs seen at the turn of the year to one of the gloomiest since the pandemic. Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments. Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.”', 'Keep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.', 'Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.3% rate in Q1.', 'The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth.

At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded.', 'To be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.', 'We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.', 'Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.', 'Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent.

He wrote that Abel will be ready to act whenever he spots significant investment opportunities, and he will continue writing an annual report like Mr. Buffett's to update shareholders. Mr. Buffett's letters are always popular among investors because of the insights he offers and his remarkable track record."", ""Mr. Buffett hardly reflected on his long tenure as CEO in the letter — unlike 10 years ago when he and his longtime investing partner Charlie Munger, who died in 2023, issued separate reflections on the company after 50 years of their leadership. But Berkshire will offer a special 60th anniversary book at the annual meeting with stories and lessons from the company's history."", 'Mr. Buffett cited the fact that Berkshire paid zero income tax in the decade before he took over in 1965 as a sure sign the investment was a mistake, but over time the amount Berkshire pays to the IRS has grown along with the conglomerate to hit $26.8 billion last year — “far more in corporate income tax than the U.S. government had ever received from any company — even the American tech titans that commanded market values in the trillions.”', ""Mr. Buffett has hardly mentioned politics and current events in his recent letters — preferring to stay away from anything controversial that might hurt Berkshire's companies — but Saturday he urged the government to be responsible with the money he sends it."", '""Thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send you even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" Mr. Buffett wrote, reinforcing some of the Democratic ideals he has long supported.', 'CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said, “I thought honestly in a very subtle way that was a powerful message.”', ""Abel will have plenty of resources to work with when he eventually takes over given that Berkshire now holds $334.2 billion cash after selling off much of its Apple and Bank of America stock in the past year and continuing to generate money from all its subsidiaries that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, a collection of major utilities and an assortment of major manufacturers and well-known retail businesses that include brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy. That's almost double the $167.6 billion cash Berkshire held a year ago."", ""Mr. Buffett did find a few things to use some of that cash on last year by spending $3.9 billion to acquire the rest of its utility business from the estate of a former partner and another $2.6 billion to buy the rest of the Pilot truck stop chain it didn't already own. Mr. Buffett said he also increased Berkshire's investment in five major Japanese conglomerates, and he'll likely invest more in them because those companies agreed to let Berkshire increase its ownership beyond 10%. Berkshire has now spent $13.8 billion over the past six years on those Japanese investments that are now worth $23.5 billion."", 'But while Mr. Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions in recent years he affirmed that he has no plans to offer a dividend because he believes reinvesting the money will generate better returns.', 'Investor Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management said Mr. Buffett\'s actions show he\'s actually “bearish as hell but won’t admit it."" He said Mr. Buffett doesn\'t want to scare people, but shareholders can look to his past writings and his actions to see that he likely thinks the stock market is terribly expensive. And some of the best investment opportunities he\'s found in recent years have been outside the United States.', ""But Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said Berkshire's cash pile should also be viewed as a key asset because it ensures “the competitive ability of Berkshire to respond with alacrity and at significant scale when motivated. Although infrequent, when the conglomerate does deploy it has historically led to measurable future returns.”"", ""Mr. Buffett said Berkshire did better than he expected last year even though 53% of the 189 companies it owns reported lower earnings in 2024. That's because Berkshire collected more interest on all of its short-term investments and its insurance units reported much higher profits."", ""The bottom-line profit numbers Berkshire reports can make it hard to see how its companies are really doing because the numbers include the paper value of all the company's investments, which can vary widely quarter to quarter. So Mr. Buffett has long recommended focusing on the operating profits."", ""In the fourth quarter, Berkshire earned $19.69 billion profit, or $13,695 per Class A share. That's a little over half the $37.57 billion, or $26,043 per Class A share, it reported a year ago. But the operating earnings tell a much different story. By that measure, operating profits were up substantially at $14.5 billion, or $10,102.07 per Class A share, from the previous year's $8.5 billion, or $5,878.21 per A share. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted operating earnings of $6,932 per share."", ""Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said the weakness in Berkshire's operating companies is worrisome."", '“There may not be a better company to look at for a diversified look into the strength of the broader manufacturing, retail, consumer economy than Berkshire. And these results kind of look soft to me, and it makes me concerned about how strong the economy might really be right now,” Shanahan said.', ""And Berkshire's earnings might decline throughout 2025 if that weakness persists, he said. The company also said it expects to record at least a $1.3 billion loss in the first quarter on insurance claims related to the devastating California wildfires."", ""In what might be a nod to the 94-year-old Mr. Buffett's age, the legendary investor announced that this year's shareholder meeting in May that routinely attracts tens of thousands of people will be shorter. Mr. Buffett and Berkshire's two vice chairmen will only answer questions from 8 a.m. until 1 p.m. — several hours less than usual. Mr. Buffett also acknowledged using a cane these days to avoid “falling flat on my face.”"", ""Mr. Buffett said this year there won't be a humorous movie that traditionally opens the meeting with an assortment of celebrity cameos, sketches and ads from Berkshire companies. But he assured shareholders there will still be plenty of time for them to buy products from all the Berkshire companies that set up booths in the exhibit hall adjoining the Omaha arena where the meeting is held."", 'First Published: February 22, 2025, 3:55 p.m.']"

Berkshire explains that estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior accident years were reduced $1.7 billion in 2024, mostly attributable to lower-than-expected losses in the property line of business.', 'Somewhat offsetting the lower loss ratio of 55.1%, P&C reinsurance underwriting expenses increased slightly with a ratio of 27.8% compared with 26.3% in 2023.

The comparative decline reflected a significant increase in loss estimates at GUARD and lower reductions in estimated losses across several of our other businesses that write medical professional liability and commercial liability coverages, partially offset by increased reductions of property loss estimates.

The Oracle of Omaha touches on the importance of corporate transparency; his faith in his designated successor Greg Abel; and the company’s extraordinary $47.4 billion of operating earnings in 2024.

But, concurrently, we needed many Americans to consistently save and then needed those savers or other Americans to wisely deploy the capital thus made available. If America had consumed all that it produced, the country would have been spinning its wheels.', 'That’s a powerful message for a country that now pays more in interest expense than it spends on its military and has amassed national debt that’s greater than the entirety of its gross domestic product. Trump is paying lip-service to addressing the problem and letting Musk playact as a belt-tightener, but he’s been wholly unwilling to make the hard choices required to really do something — including, for starters, forgoing tax cuts. ', 'Buffett also discusses saving in the context of Berkshire itself. He comes back to an old hobbyhorse of his — his disdain for dividends — which he’s been harping on since at least his famous 1984 letter. In his latest reflection, he says that “Berkshire shareholders have participated in the American miracle by foregoing dividends, thereby electing to reinvest rather than consume.” Investing, he says, is what made America great, and he holds out the stewardship of Americans’ investments as a sacred responsibility.', 'Here’s the quote (emphasis mine):', 'The American process has not always been pretty — our country has forever had many scoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance — which remains in full force today — and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist.', '(This is pure speculation, but something tells me that Buffett — who has described Bitcoin as “probably rat poison squared” — isn’t a fan of $Trump, the “official” Trump memecoin released last month, which you can use to engage in reckless speculation and transact in Trump-branded sneakers, watches and fragrances.)', 'Lastly, Buffett used his annual reflection to underscore the importance of a stable currency. ', '…never forget that we need [the government] to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part.', 'Currency policy has come into focus in the first month of the Trump presidency, though it’s hard to know exactly what the president wants. On the one hand, he says the dollar should keep its role in global trade and has threatened anyone who would pursue a substitute. On the other hand, several Trump advisers — including Stephen Miran, Trump’s nominee to chair his Council of Economic Advisers — have lamented the ways in which the strong dollar has disadvantaged US exporters. There may even be tentative consideration of ways to weaken it — an experiment that could lead to capital flight and have disastrous economic consequences.', 'Of course, Buffett has written about currency stability several times over the years, and he often seems to be talking about the way in which inflation erodes the purchasing power of the dollar for domestic consumers. In his 2011 shareholder letter, Buffett memorably penned this zinger: “‘In God We Trust’ may be imprinted on our currency, but the hand that activates our government’s printing press has been all too human.”', 'On the inflation front, Trump is acting like a malicious kid with a box of matches. At a moment in which Americans are still off-balance from the inflation of the past four years, Trump is levying tariffs and launching trade skirmishes around the world — developments that promise to push up consumer prices and de-anchor household inflation expectations. His tax-cut plans and efforts to limit or even curb the number of immigrant workers in the economy probably won’t help either.', 'Here’s hoping that Trump finds some of the “wisdom and vigilance” Buffett talks about and rethinks that recipe for resurgent inflation. Meanwhile, as the debate between tax cuts and the government’s duty to vulnerable Americans rages on, Berkshire’s singular success and $26.8 billion in tax payments is testament to what shared prosperity could look like.', 'Read also:', '© 2025 Bloomberg L.P.', '', '', 'BizNews', '© 2025 BizNews, Inc. | The Rational Perspective\nTerms & ConditionsComments Policy']"

That was led by by a whopping 302% jump in insurance underwriting from the year-earlier period to $3.409 billion. Insurance investment income also ballooned by nearly 50% to $4.088 billion.', 'Operating earnings also popped 27% for the full year, coming in at $47.437 billion.', '“In 2024, Berkshire did better than I expected though 53% of our 189 operating businesses reported a decline in earnings. We were aided by a predictable large gain in investment income as Treasury Bill yields improved and we substantially increased our holdings of these highly-liquid short-term securities,” Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire, said in his annual letter to shareholders. “Our insurance business also delivered a major increase in earnings, led by the performance of GEICO.”', 'To be sure, Berkshire warned that the wildfires that broke out in Southern California will lead to an estimated pre-tax loss of about $1.3 billion for its insurance business.', 'Berkshire Hathaway ended 2024 with $334.2 billion in cash, up from $325.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. This fortress comes as Buffett struggles to find his next big investment target.', 'In his annual letter, Buffett defended the large cash holdings.', '“Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change. While our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to $272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio,” he said, adding that “Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities.”', 'Investment gains slowed sharply in the fourth quarter to $5.167 billion from $29.093 billion in the year-earlier. Indeed, Berkshire pared stock investments during the year. Notably, it sold a chunk of its Apple stake through 2024.', 'To be sure, Berkshire always notes in its earnings releases that: “The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules.”', 'Berkshire’s total earnings for the quarter came in at $19.694 billion, a 47% decrease from the year-earlier period of $37.574 billion. For the full year, the company’s bottom line came in at $88.995 billion, down 7.5% from $96.223 billion in 2023.', 'Got a confidential news tip?
