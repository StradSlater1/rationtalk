That’s a substantial increase from past estimates.', '3.1% is HUGE. That’s not the issue. But that’s the probability that it will hit somewhere.', 'What will it most likely hit? Water and not a lake or a river, but, rather, an ocean. The reason is that oceans cover 71% of the earth.', 'Still, that leaves 29%. But think about what we know about that 29%. Most of it has no one living on it, or, if it has people living on it, the population density is probably less than 50 people per square mile. An AI-assisted Google search says that over 90% of the Earth’s land has a population density of under 50 people per square mile. That leaves 10% (or a little less) of the earth’s surface with more than 50 people square mile.', 'Now we’re ready to do some calculations.', 'The probability of the asteroid hitting an area with more than 50 people per square mile = 0.031 * 0.29 * 0.1 = 0.000899.', 'That’s a 1 in 1,112 chance.', 'That’s still large. But it’s not huge.', 'What about the idea that even if the asteroid hits an ocean or a piece of land on which almost no one lives, it will destroy the earth?', 'The article I read says that that’s not true. It states:', 'To assess the danger of asteroids, scientists use the Torino Scale, which ranges from 0 to 10. A score of 0 means no risk, while a 10 indicates a global catastrophe. Asteroid 2024 YR4 currently holds a rating of 3, meaning it has a chance of localized destruction. This rating is rare and is only [sic] given to objects with an impact probability greater than 1%.', 'At its current size estimate of 131 to 295 feet, YR4 falls into the “city killer” category. Bruce Betts, chief scientist for the nonprofit Planetary Society, explained, “If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs.”', 'This kind of impact could devastate cities like Mumbai, Bogota, or Lagos, which lie within its projected trajectory, endangering about 110 million people.', 'However, the asteroid is not large enough to cause a global catastrophe like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. “This is not the dinosaur killer.

The Tunguska Event, in 1908, when such an asteroid exploded over a forest in Siberia. Fortunately this was indeed in the middle of nowhere, so it’s thought that maybe as many as three people might have been killed. We have no definitive historical record of other such events (of this magnitude) in human history, which would be odd if they occur about once every 150 years or so, unless of course most of them occur over the ocean and most of the ones that do occur over land occur in sparsely inhabited places-like Siberia.', 'On the other hand, there is probably marginally more risk to human populations than at any prior point in history, because more places have become more developed and more heavily inhabited. A colonial report from 1908 suggests that Lagos had a population of around 58,215 at the time of Tunguska. Today, estimates vary and are controversial, but probably somewhere between 10 and 20 million. The disappearance of a city of 50 thousand people, even in pre colonial times, probably would not have escaped the historical record, so such events must still be infrequent enough that they’ve never hit a substantially populated area before. But that’s a potentially many orders of magnitude worse disaster.', 'Overall I would say your assessment of the risk is correct-it is actually quite low. But in the long term, it’s definitely worth developing the capacity to deflect asteroids like this, to say nothing of dinosaur extinction level asteroids.', 'I agree with everything you said.', 'I would just add that I would rather leave it to people like Elon Musk and Nathan Myrhvold than to the feds.', 'I’m not sure what the size of the impact area is expected to be. If we assume that a “city killer” destroys a typical sized city, I’m going to guess something like 100 sq miles. Earth is home to about 8 billion people and has a surface area of roughly 197 million square miles. So the expected death total would be 0.031 * 8,000,000,000 / 197,000,000 * 100. That’s 1,259. That’s a much lower expected annual death toll than deaths from earthquakes (about 37,000/year) or hurricanes (15,000/year).', ' ', 'Well done, Mark.', 'Even assuming a confirmed impact, there are several strategies for deflection that don’t involve nukes. A couple of the more outlandish ones in the links.

I agree with Bryan Caplan that an eternity of that would be much worse than extinction.', 'I’ve seen arguments of this type but I’m not convinced, and here is why.', 'Yes, where it eventually hits is unlikely to do a lot of damage, but the concern I have is the damage done in the days leading up to the impact.', 'My guess is that there will be a fairly large margin of error when determining the impact site. There will be a lot of people in that area desperate to be anywhere but right there. It could lead to chaos as people panic to evacuate.

But astronomers can’t yet rule out a potentially catastrophic encounter projected for December 2032.', 'Alejandro Miranda/Alamy Stock Photo', 'Editor’s Note (2/20/25): Hours after this story’s publication, NASA announced that new data collected overnight had reduced the Earth-impact probability for asteroid 2024 YR4 from a record-setting 3.1 percent to 1.5 percent. The asteroid’s impact probability will continue to evolve—likely diminishing to zero—but 2024 YR4 will officially remain an object of concern so long as its estimated chance of striking Earth remains above 1 percent.', '', 'A “city killer”–sized asteroid called 2024 YR4, which had been discovered swooping uncomfortably near Earth last December, now has an estimated 3.1 percent chance of striking our planet during another close encounter in late 2032, space scientists announced on Tuesday. The escalation makes this sizable space rock the most threatening ever forecasted to impact Earth, although the prospect for catastrophe remains relatively slim: the chance for a direct hit is now one in 32.', '“This is the highest impact probability we have seen for an asteroid of this size or larger,” says Davide Farnocchia, an impact hazard expert at the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). But Farnocchia notes that 2024 YR4’s superlative status is unlikely to last. “The impact probability might change by the time you write this up,” he says.', 'First spotted by a specialized asteroid-alert telescope in Chile on December 27 last year, 2024 YR4 didn’t enter the limelight until a month later, when preliminary assessments of its orbit showed the 40- to 100-meter-wide object had a greater than 1 percent chance of colliding with our world on December 22, 2032. The risk corridor stretches from the eastern Pacific Ocean to South Asia, cutting across vast, people-free stretches of sea and desert—but also massive population centers, including Bogotá, Colombia, Lagos, Nigeria, and Mumbai, India. There’s even a vanishingly small chance that the incoming space rock could strike the moon.', 'If there is a collision with Earth, whether the asteroid breaks apart in our planet’s skies or punches a crater into the surface, the immediate effects could resemble a detonating hydrogen bomb, unleashing enough localized devastation to destroy any unlucky metropolis in the way.', 'It’s no wonder, then, that the subsequent intermittent upticks to 2024 YR4’s impact odds have concerned astronomers—as well as the increasingly befuddled public. How could scientists be so uncertain about this space rock’s set course around the sun? Why don’t they seem very worried about the rising odds that it will hit us? And what’s taking them so long to discern the true danger (if there is any)?', 'PHIL PLAIT', ""JONATHAN O'CALLAGHAN"", 'LEE BILLINGS', 'PHIL PLAIT', 'The simple answer is that pinning down an object’s orbit gets easier the longer you look at it, and astronomers haven’t yet had enough time and opportunity to do that for 2024 YR4. The asteroid is now zooming away from us and has already become too faint in Earth’s skies for most telescopes to see. But it is still being regularly monitored by multiple large observatories. A team of astronomers will use the keen infrared eyes of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to further constrain estimates of the asteroid’s size and trajectory in early March—and again in early May, just before it dwindles from view (until its orbit brings it close to Earth again in 2028).', 'The relative scarcity of data points lies behind the fluctuating risk assessment, which, until yesterday, had pegged the asteroid’s probability of impact at 2.6 percent. This boost came from two effects, Farnocchia says: February’s full moon prevented precise observations for about a week, followed by an influx of fresh data from two facilities (the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico and the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, part of Spain’s Canary Islands, both of which renewed their tracking on February 15). Independent number crunching on all those data occurs at three separate facilities worldwide: NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at JPL, which is in California, plus the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Near-Earth Objects Coordination Center and the Near Earth Objects Dynamics Site (run by the private company SpaceDyS), which are both in Italy. So far, all three centers have reached the same general conclusions, showing a low but steadily increasing chance of impact.', 'Still, “for now I would not be worried,” says Detlef Koschny, a planetary scientist at the Technical University of Munich, who, on behalf of ESA, chairs the United Nations–affiliated Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG)—an organization tasked with coordinating global responses to asteroid threats. “As the uncertainty reduces, the probability for it to cross our planet actually increases—until the uncertainty area doesn’t cross our planet at all.” Imagine 2024 YR4 as a bullet fired down a shooting range and Earth as the bull’s-eye on a paper target. An initial projection might forecast the bullet hitting anywhere on the paper, but as the projectile flies downrange, a better estimate predicts that it will hit somewhere in the target’s center. The bull’s-eye (Earth) will occupy a larger area of this smaller region, and its calculated chance of being struck will rise, even if the bullet (asteroid) is actually off target.', 'This is what happened with Apophis, the previous record-setting potentially hazardous asteroid. After its discovery in 2004, forecasters projected a possible collision with Earth in 2029. Over a few months the probability peaked at 2.7 percent, only to plummet to 0 percent after sufficient further observations. In all likelihood, within months 2024 YR4’s rising impact probability will prove to be a similar false alarm (which is perhaps why astronomers so far have stubbornly refused to bestow it with a catchier name). In the meantime, you can call it what you like—and safely ignore ebbs and flows of its odds for catastrophe.', 'The orbit of 2024 YR4 is already certain enough that “nobody really reacts to the day-to-day changes,” says Timothy Spahr, an astronomer who manages the International Asteroid Warning Network. “Yes, the probability [of impact] can change, but in order to really drill down beyond ‘a few percent,’ we’ll need to increase the observational arc another 30-plus days.” The process “can seem a little tedious,” he admits. But by the time the asteroid fades to black later this year, astronomers should know much more about how worried everyone should be.', 'If 2024 YR4’s forecast is still ominous by then, let alone by its next approach in 2028, preventive measures for 2032 may be in order. These could range from evacuating areas in the risk corridor to launching high-stakes space missions to nudge the asteroid off its collision course—or even to blast it to bits. But “given that continued observations are likely to rule out the possible impact,” Farnocchia concludes, “it’s still premature to talk seriously about deflecting 2024 YR4”—for now anyway.', 'Additional reporting by Meghan Bartels.', ""LEE BILLINGS is a science journalist specializing in astronomy, physics, planetary science, and spaceflight, and is a senior editor at Scientific American.

Why the chance that an asteroid might hit Earth in 2032 keeps changing,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/asteroid-hit-earth-why-chances-keep-changing-rcna192723,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'An asteroid between 130 and 300 feet wide has a slight chance of hitting Earth in 2032 — but the precise odds have been a moving target since the space rock was first detected nearly two months ago.', 'NASA’s latest estimate for the asteroid, known as 2024 YR4, is that it has just a 0.28% probability of striking Earth — about a 1 in 360 chance. But the agency had put the probability at 1.5% on Wednesday, and the day before that, NASA estimated the chances of a collision to be a record high of 3.1%, or 1 in 32.', 'Those prior odds made the space rock the first object officially classified as a Level 3 out of 10 in a measurement known as the Torino scale, which astronomer Richard Binzel first proposed nearly three decades ago.', 'A Level 3 classification means the object merits attention by astronomers, and that it poses a threat of a “close encounter.”', 'Named after the Italian city where astronomers officially adopted it in 1999, the Torino Impact Hazard Scale is a way to communicate to the public the risks that near-Earth asteroids and other cosmic objects may pose to the planet.', 'The scale is color-coded, with categories from 0 (white for no hazard) to 10 (red for certain collisions). When 2024 YR 4 was thought to have a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth, that placed it in the scale’s intermediate yellow zone.', 'The flurry of news coverage about the asteroid has brought the Torino scale more attention than ever before. Binzel said this type of situation is precisely why he created the system in the first place.', '“The idea was to be as transparent as possible about what astronomers know,” said Binzel, a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But it’s a bit like being between a rock and a hard place because we want to report what we know to maintain public trust, but we also don’t want to raise any unnecessary anxiety.”', 'The challenges of walking that fine line have been apparent with asteroid 2024 YR4.', 'The reason the impact probability fell this week, NASA said, is that ground-based telescopes were able to get a better look at the space rock overnight on Feb. 19 and 20. Based on those observations, astronomers have been able to refine models of the asteroid’s orbit, allowing them to more accurately estimate the space rock’s trajectory. This in turn helps scientists predict with more certainty where 2024 YR4 will be on Dec. 22, 2032, the date when the asteroid will likely have its close encounter with Earth.', 'Although the shifting probabilities have been somewhat dizzying, it’s perfectly normal for a near-Earth asteroid’s chances of impact to dance around like this, according to Binzel.', '“If you think of it like a baseball game, the amount of information we have to track this asteroid is like trying to figure out where a fly ball will land at the crack of the bat,” he said.', 'In other words, it will take more time to observe and measure the asteroid’s size and path before figuring out if it’s still a threat at all.', 'When Binzel debuted the Torino scale to the astronomical community decades ago, his goal was to foster greater public awareness of impact risks. The idea, he said, was to implement something similar to the Richter scale that measures an earthquake’s magnitude, or the Saffir-Simpson scale that assigns categories to a hurricane based on its wind speeds.', 'But when he first presented the system — at a United Nations conference in 1997 — it was not well received, he said. Some astronomers, according to Binzel, were skeptical that it would be useful for the public.', 'That same year, though, scientists discovered an asteroid dubbed 1997 XF11 that some thought could hit Earth in 2028. It didn’t take long for astronomers to rule out a potential collision, but the doomsday narrative proliferated in news reports, followed by blame for what was perceived to be a big mistake.', '“It ended up being a bit of an embarrassment,” Binzel said. “It wasn’t that astronomers had made an error, but we didn’t have a good way of communicating uncertainty. So that became the motivation for proposing a simple system for categorizing any object for which we can’t immediately rule out that it will miss the Earth for centuries to come.”', 'Binzel presented the scale once again at a conference in Torino in 1999 attended by representatives from NASA and the European Space Agency. At that workshop, the system was finally adopted by the International Astronomical Union, a nongovernmental organization made up of professional astronomers that functions like a governing body for the astronomical community.', 'In addition to its use of colors and numbers corresponding to various risk levels, the scale also includes descriptions of the potential consequences, the likelihood that risk assessments may change, and what actions governments or members of the public should take.', 'A Level 6 threat in the orange zone, for instance, describes a likely close shave by “a large object posing a serious but still uncertain threat of a global catastrophe.”', 'Astronomers are advised to give this object “critical attention” in order to figure out conclusively if a collision will occur. “If the encounter is less than three decades away, governmental contingency planning may be warranted,” the scale says.', 'On the other hand, a Level 3 threat means: “Current calculations give a 1% or greater chance of collision capable of localized destruction,” according to the scale’s description. “Most likely, new telescopic observations will lead to re-assignment to Level 0. Attention by public and by public officials is merited if the encounter is less than a decade away.”', 'Unsurprisingly, then, Binzel correctly suspected when asteroid 2024 YR4 was considered a 3 on the scale that it would eventually be downgraded.', 'But during that brief time, 2024 YR4 did hit some uncomfortable milestones: It was the only known asteroid with a classification above Level 1, and it set records for reaching the highest impact probability and for spending the longest time with a probability greater than 1%, according to the European Space Agency.', 'The only time an asteroid of similar or larger size has been classified higher on the Torino scale was in 2004, when the asteroid Apophis was briefly ranked as a Level 4, with an estimated 2.7% chance of hitting Earth.', 'To witness the scale function in real time has been gratifying, Binzel said, though he is happy to be discreet about his connection to it.', '“At the end of the day, if the Torino scale is helpful, there’s enormous satisfaction in that. It really makes my day,” he said. “But it is nice to hide my name behind the location where the scale was adopted. That helps keep my phone from ringing too much.”', 'Denise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Why we should get used to being worried about asteroids crashing into Earth,https://www.the-independent.com/space/asteroid-2024-yr4-b2702373.html,"['', 'The most scare about an asteroid strike has passed – but advances in technology mean we can now see more and more of them out there in space, writes Andrew Griffin', 'T\nhe world wasn’t in need of another reason to panic, but asteroid 2024 YR4 gave them one anyway. It was first spotted at the end of last year, and in the days that followed it went from minor curiosity to major concern as astronomers came to worry that it might hit Earth when it flies towards us in 2032. More observations meant that its chances of hitting Earth ticked up, and so did the press coverage, and by February it was being regularly described as a city killer or a potential apocalypse.', 'Astronomers said there was little reason to worry. The chance of a collision only ever reached 3.1 per cent – a record for an asteroid of its size, but still tiny. Even at its worst, its rating on the Palermo scale never got over zero, which means that Earth is actually more at risk of being hit by another, unknown object.', 'Richard P Binzel knows better than most how worried we should be. In fact, he invented the scale for it. The Torino scale was modelled on the Richter scale and Binzel’s hope was that it would be used in much the same way: a quick way of understanding exactly how much devastation a natural disaster would pose. When it comes to both asteroids and earthquakes, that devastation tends to be less than might be feared.', 'The scale gives specific information about who exactly should be worried about an asteroid. Level one is marked as “normal”, and advises there is no cause even for “public attention”; it then progresses up through “meriting attention by astronomers” (2-4); at five, it suggests that “governmental contingency planning may be warranted”. It’s only really when an asteroid gets to level eight – which no asteroid has ever been anywhere near – that the scale enters the “red zone” and panic might be encouraged.', 'Speaking from his office in Colorado, surrounded by trinkets of a career spent tracking asteroids, Binzel certainly does not look panicked. “These objects are there – they have always been there,” he tells The Independent. An object like YR4 probably passes as close to us as the Moon is every month, he notes; the meteor showers that intermittently dazzle us down on Earth are themselves caused by the small specks of space dust that we collide with as we fly through the solar system.', '“What’s changing is our ability to see them out there – and right now our capability to discover small things far away exceeds our ability to track them for a long time,” he says. That means we can discover lots of asteroids, but don’t necessarily know where they’re coming from or going, which makes it difficult to know exactly whether they might hit us or not.', 'Scientists also tend to like to work that out in public, which means that people can see very well just how uncertain they are. For decades, astronomers and policy experts have wondered whether that’s the best approach, since most potentially hazardous asteroids will turn out to pose no threat at all, and so there is the danger of either undue panic or boy-who-cried-wolf apathy. But Binzel says there is little option anyway: the asteroids are up there in the sky for anyone to spot, and so it wouldn’t be possible to keep them secret from the world.', 'He acknowledges that this means that astronomers might come in for criticism. The chances of a collision with 2024 YR4 are now rapidly falling, and at the time of publication are close to zero; as the panic fades, there is a chance that the public will instead become annoyed that they were ever worried. But “it’s a price we pay for being open – we just kind of sigh and say that’s just how it’s going to be. It’s the price for honesty”, he says.', 'Astronomers might very soon have much more to talk about. Later this year, the Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile will be switched on, and it will start taking a broad and detailed view of the sky. In 2027, after a run of budget problems and delays, Nasa hopes to launch the NEO Surveyor, a space telescope specifically made to find potentially hazardous asteroids.', 'That means that we will see more asteroids; many of them might pose at least some threat to us, though of course they would be there whether we saw them or not. With that new era of astronomy could come a new era for worry, as there are more objects to panic about bringing life on Earth to an end.', 'But it could also allow for a newly informed sense of just how much danger we are in. Californians are used to checking the Richter scale to know whether they need to worry about a given earthquake, and that knowledge will often actually turn out to be calming; those who live in the Gulf of Mexico are used to checking whether they are at risk from a given hurricane and responding accordingly.', 'Binzel likens it to having your house expected and finding faulty wiring: the danger was always there, now you just know about it. In the case of asteroids, the job of responding to that danger might be huge: Nasa has tested sending spacecraft to smash into asteroids and redirect them, for instance. The world would have to come together to undertake something bigger and with higher stakes than perhaps anything ever before. But we would be able to respond, at least.', '“Whatever the danger is, there’s either an object out there with our name on it or there isn’t,” says Binzel. “But we’re worse off not knowing what’s out there, because we could be taken by surprise; we’re increasing our security by finding these objects.” Until then, there’s little we can do but wait.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

Here's what happened and why it matters."", ""2024 YR4 is around 180 feet (55 meters) wide, with the potential to release 500 times more energy than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. A little concern was therefore understandable on Tuesday (Feb. 18), when the likelihood of YR4 hitting us crept up to 3.1% — the highest impact probability NASA has ever recorded for a space object of 2024 YR4's size or larger."", 'Fortunately, the record-high impact probability was short-lived, and the chances of a strike soon fell to 1.5% and, at the time of writing, dow to 0.28%. None of what played out came as a surprise to astronomers.', ""The most likely scenario for 2024 YR4 has always been that it will miss us on its closest approach to Earth in 7 years time. That's because, while astronomers have been aware of 2024 YR4 since last year, uncertainty about its orbital path has meant that they couldn't — and still can't — rule out the possibility of a strike.

Binzel said that it\'s ""perfectly natural"" for 2024 YR4\'s odds of impact to ""bounce around a bit.""

The Odds of a City-Killing Asteroid Hitting Earth Keep Rising,https://www.wired.com/story/the-odds-of-a-city-killer-asteroid-impact-in-2032-keep-rising-should-we-be-worried/,"['AN ASTEROID DISCOVERED late last year is continuing to stir public interest as its odds of striking planet Earth less than eight years from now continue to increase.', 'Two weeks ago, when Ars first wrote about the asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies estimated a 1.9 percent chance of an impact with Earth in 2032. NASA’s most recent estimate has the likelihood of a strike increasing to 3.2 percent. Now that’s not particularly high, but it’s also not zero.', 'This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast.', 'Naturally the prospect of a large ball of rock tens of meters across striking the planet is a little worrisome. This is large enough to cause localized devastation near its impact site, likely on the order of the Tunguska event of 1908, which leveled some 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers) of forest in remote Siberia.', 'To understand why the odds from NASA are changing and whether we should be concerned about 2024 YR4, Ars connected with Robin George Andrews, author of the recently published book How to Kill an Asteroid. Good timing with the publication date, eh?', 'Ars: Why are the impact odds increasing?', 'Robin George Andrews: The asteroid’s orbit is not known to a great deal of precision right now, as we only have a limited number of telescopic observations of it. However, even as the rock zips farther away from Earth, certain telescopes are still managing to spy it and extend our knowledge of the asteroid’s orbital arc around the sun. The odds have fluctuated in both directions over the last few weeks, but overall, they have risen; that’s because the amount of uncertainty astronomers have as to its true orbit has shrunk, but Earth has yet to completely fall out of that zone of uncertainty. As a proportion of the remaining uncertainty, Earth is taking up more space, so for now, its odds are rising.', 'Think of it like a beam of light coming out of the front of that asteroid. That beam of light shrinks as we get to know its orbit better, but if Earth is yet to fall out of that beam, it takes up proportionally more space. So, for a while, the asteroid’s impact odds rise. It’s very likely that, with sufficient observations, Earth will fall out of that shrinking beam of light eventually, and the impact odds will suddenly fall to zero. The alternative, of course, is that they’ll rise close to 100 percent.', 'What are we learning about the asteroid’s destructive potential?', 'The damage it could cause would be localized to a roughly city-sized area, so if it hits the middle of the ocean or a vast desert, nothing would happen. But it could trash a city, or completely destroy much of one, with a direct hit.', 'The key factor here (if you had to pick one) is the asteroid’s mass. Each time the asteroid gets twice as long (presuming it’s roughly spherical), it brings with it 8 times more kinetic energy. So if the asteroid is on the smaller end of the estimated size range—40 meters—then it will be as if a small nuclear bomb exploded in the sky. At that size, unless it’s very iron-rich, it wouldn’t survive its atmospheric plunge, so it would explode in mid-air. There would be modest-to-severe structural damage right below the blast, and minor to moderate structural damage over tens of miles. A 90-meter asteroid would, whether it makes it to the ground or not, be more than 10 times more energetic; a large nuclear weapon blast, then. A large city would be severely damaged, and the area below the blast would be annihilated.', 'Do we have any idea where the asteroid might strike on Earth?', 'The “risk corridor” is currently spread over parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, parts of Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia. Additional observations will ultimately narrow this down, if an impact remains possible.', 'What key observations are we still waiting for that might clarify the threat?', 'Most telescopes will lose sight of this “small” asteroid in the coming weeks. But the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to track it until May. For the first time, it’s been authorized for planetary defense purposes, largely because its infrared eye allows it to track the asteroid further out than optical light telescopes. JWST will not only improve our understanding of its orbit, but also constrain its size. First observations should appear by the end of March.', 'JWST may rule out an impact in 2032. But there’s a chance we may be stuck with a few-percentage impact probability until 2028, when the asteroid makes its next Earth flyby. Bit awkward, if so.', 'NASA’s DART mission successfully shifted an asteroid’s orbit in 2022. Could this technology be used?', 'Not necessarily. DART—a type of spacecraft called a kinetic impactor—was a great success. But it still only changed Dimorphos’ orbit by a small amount. Ideally, you want many years of advance notice to deflect an asteroid with something like DART to ensure the asteroid has moved out of Earth’s way. I’ve often been told that at least 10 years prior to impact is best if you want to be sure to deflect a city-killing-size asteroid. That’s not to say deflection is impossible; it just becomes trickier to pull off. You can’t just hit it with a colossal spacecraft, because you may fragment it into several still-dangerously sized pieces. Hit it too softly, and it will still hit Earth, but somewhere that wasn’t originally going to be hit. You have to be super careful here.', 'Some rather clever scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (which has a superb planetary defense contingent) worked out that, for a 90-meter asteroid, you need 10 years to confidently deflect it with a kinetic impactor to prevent an Earth impact. So, to deflect 2024 YR4, if it’s 90 meters long and we have just a few years of time, we’d probably need a bigger impactor spacecraft (but don’t break it!)—or we’d need several kinetic impactors to deflect it (but each has to work perfectly).', 'Eight years until impact is a little tight. It’s not impossible that the choice would be made to use a nuclear weapon to deflect it; this could be very awkward geopolitically, but a nuke would impart a bigger deflection than an equivalent DART-like spacecraft. Or, maybe, they’d opt to try and vaporize the asteroid with something like a 1-megaton nuke, which LLNL says would work with an asteroid this size.', 'So it’s kind of late in the game to be planning an impact mission?', 'This isn’t an ideal situation. And humanity has never tried to stop an asteroid impact for real. I imagine that if 2024 YR4 does become an agreed-upon emergency, the DART team (JHUAP plus NASA, mostly) would join forces with SpaceX (and other space agencies, particularly ESA but probably others) to quickly build the right-mass kinetic impactor (or impactors) and get ready for a deflection attempt close to 2028, when the asteroid makes its next Earth flyby. But yeah, eight years is not too much time.', 'A deflection could work! But it won’t be as simple as just hitting the asteroid really hard in 2028.', 'How important is NASA to planetary defense?', 'Planetary defense is an international security concern. But right now, NASA (and America, by extension) is the vanguard. Its planetary defenders are the watchers on the wall, the people most responsible for not just finding these potentially hazardous asteroids before they find us, but also those most capable of developing and deploying tech to prevent any impacts. America is the only nation with (for now!) a well-funded near-Earth object-hunting program, and is the only nation to have tested out a planetary defense technique. It’s a movie cliché that America is the only nation capable of saving the world from cosmic threats. But, for the time being—even with amazing planetary defense mission contributions from ESA and JAXA—that cliché remains absolutely true.', 'This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.', 'In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear', 'Musk takeover: DOGE’s race to the bottom', 'Big Story: The bust that took down Durov and upended Telegram', 'WIRED’s favorite ‘buy it for life’ gear', 'Event: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London', 'MORE FROM WIRED', 'REVIEWS AND GUIDES', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

Notable Asteroid Impacts in Earth’s History,https://www.planetary.org/notable-asteroid-impacts-in-earths-history,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Throughout Earth’s history, there have been many instances of near-Earth objects (NEOs) impacting our planet, either reaching the surface or exploding above ground from the intense energy released as the object passed through the atmosphere. Asteroid impacts are natural processes that shape the surface of our planet, like volcanoes. The vast majority of these impacts were from very small objects, but there have been some remarkable exceptions.', 'In 2013, an asteroid about 20 meters in diameter entered Earth’s atmosphere above the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia. It exploded while it was still in the air, releasing the same amount of energy as 500 kilotons of TNT. Luckily it exploded about 30 kilometers above ground and did not cause direct impact damage. Still, it created a shockwave that injured 1,500 people and damaged 7,200 buildings across six cities. Most of the injuries were caused by curiosity: people saw the bright flash and walked to windows to look outside. The shock wave, traveling at the slower speed of sound, arrived later and shattered the windows, injuring people with flying glass.', 'In 1908 an approximately 30-meter-diameter asteroid or comet entered the atmosphere and exploded above ground in Tunguska, Russia. The explosion knocked down approximately 80 million trees over an area of 2,150 square kilometers (830 square miles). This explosion has been estimated at 1,000 times more powerful than the explosion of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. Had this taken place over a metropolitan area, that city would have been completely destroyed. Luckily, it happened in a remote area of Siberia, and nobody is thought to have been killed.', '65 million years ago an asteroid roughly 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) in diameter hit Earth in what is now Mexico. The impact killed 70% of all species on Earth, including the dinosaurs.', 'An impact of that size would have had devastating effects, and the geological record gives us some indication of what happened. The asteroid hit in water, creating mega-tsunamis reaching from southeastern Mexico all the way to Texas and Florida and up a shallow interior ocean that covered what is now the Great Plains. The blast would have thrown chunks of the asteroid and Earth so far that they would have briefly left the atmosphere before falling back to the ground.', ""Like millions of shooting stars, all this material would have been heated to incandescence upon re-entry, heating Earth's surface and igniting wildfires. It is possible that all of Earth’s forests burned. Meanwhile, colossal shock waves would have triggered global earthquakes and possibly volcanic eruptions. A cloud of super-heated dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor slammed underground in less than a second. This dust could have covered the entire surface of Earth for up to a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. Perhaps more significantly, the dust could also have lingered in the atmosphere, blocking out the Sun and interrupting the photosynthesis of plants that the entire food chain depends on, as well as cooling the temperatures of the Earth for many years."", 'Although immense impactors like the one that devastated the entire planet 65 million years ago are rare, NEOs of many different sizes can pose serious threats. An impact on or over a densely populated city could cause millions of deaths, and an impact on water could cause massive flooding on coastlines. Any major impact would lead to widespread damage, injury, and death, and would create unparalleled humanitarian and refugee crises around the world.', 'Asteroids and comets that come close to Earth can pose a very real threat to our planet, but impacts from these objects aren’t inevitable. With proper planning we can prevent this natural disaster from happening.', 'When you become a member, you join our mission to increase discoveries in our solar system and beyond, elevate the search for life outside our planet, and decrease the risk of Earth being hit by an asteroid.', 'Your role in space exploration starts now.', 'Sign up for updates, weekly tools, and exclusive opportunities to support space exploration.', 'You may opt out any time.

If larger, the effects would extend to several tens of (kilometers).""', ""About 3,000 new near-Earth objects are found each year, but it's been more difficult to find asteroids within the size range of 2024 YR4 because they're dark, smaller and harder to spot with telescopes. Scientists estimate that there are about 600,000 rocky objects similar in size to the asteroid, but only about 2%, or 12,000, have been found, according to the ESA."", '""Tiny asteroids do hit the Earth all the time, disintegrating in the atmosphere as fireballs; fortunately small ones cause little damage on the ground,"" said Larry Denneau, an astronomer at University of Hawaii\'s Institute for Astronomy and coprincipal investigator at the ATLAS telescope, in a statement. ""Larger asteroids can cause much more damage, but they impact the Earth much less frequently. There are still many large ones out there that we haven\'t found yet, which is why we are continuously monitoring the whole sky to ensure that we stay ahead of potential threats.""', 'Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.']"

Is it going to hit us, or not? Every day, a different answer.', 'Last Tuesday, Nasa calculated it had a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, and so some people set to worrying. Twenty-four hours later, however, the agency provided an update. New observations, made since the passing of the full moon, show it now has a 1.5% chance of impact. Time to exhale? Not necessarily.', 'The asteroid is estimated to be 40-90 metres wide, about the same size as a large building. If it does hit, and doesn’t splash down into the sea, it could decimate a city. Scientists calculate that its impact could be similar to that of the Tunguska asteroid, which flattened an area more than double the size of New York in Siberian forest in 1908. If it landed in central London, windows 20 miles away in Slough would be broken – an event that would exceed the wildest dreams even of John Betjeman, who once wrote a rather mean poem about the town.', 'How to feel about this lump of rock hurtling towards us at 38,000mph? To pinch from The Simpsons Movie, is it the pub or the church for you?

Seven years is a long time: you’ll be a size 10 by then – that, or getting divorced.', 'The key thing about Armageddon is that it’s always in the future, as the followers of myriad cults have found to their cost down the years. Let us trust the experts – remember them? – to sort it out. A few years ago, Nasa significantly changed the orbit of an asteroid. The Dart spacecraft slammed into a 150-metre asteroid moon at speed, changing its orbital period by more than 30 minutes – a result that could be replicated, if planning began now.', 'A few, should the predictions get worse, may go full survivalist, filling their bunkers with tinned carrots. But their number will be small. The news cycle is hardly relaxing at the moment, the old order as frangible as digestive biscuits.

In Armageddon, a rogue asteroid is broken into fragments by a nuclear bomb that is somehow inserted into it by, among others, an oil driller played by Bruce Willis – though it’s not all good news: Shanghai is obliterated by another meteor strike along the way.
