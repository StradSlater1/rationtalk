Formula One Q&A: Lance Stroll Looks Ahead To 2025 Season,https://www.insidetracknews.com/formula-one-lance-stroll-looks-ahead-2025-season/,"['Lance Stroll met with Canadian media members ahead of the 2025 F1 season. COURTESY: Aston Martin Aramco Formula One Team', 'Aston Martin Aramco Formula One Team driver Lance Stroll met with select members of the Canadian media to answer some questions about the 2025 season.', 'The interview took place a few hours ahead of the F1 75 Live event that served as the official launch of the 2025 FIA Formula 1 World Championship.', 'Question: I want to get your thoughts on where you think the team and the car might be to start the season simply because of where it left off at the end of last season?', 'Lance Stroll: That’s the million dollar question. I don’t have the answer for you. I wish I knew myself. Honestly, I don’t know. That is why we all show up to Bahrain and go racing in Australia. It’s that big question mark of where we’re gonna end up, you know? I mean, all I know is that we put a lot of work into this year’s car, learned a lot of lessons from last year — even longer than that — the last 18 months. We’ve learned a lot on some of the decisions, directions that we’ve taken with development, AMR 23 into AMR 24, and we’re really trying to address some of those mistakes we made and weaknesses we had in the car going into ’25. Is it going to be good enough? It’s never good enough until you’re on the top step of the podium, but we’ve definitely put a lot of time and effort into addressing the biggest issues of last year’s car, and we’re trying to make that better for this year.', 'Question: There’s been a lot of changes going on in the team. A lot of new people in new places, a lot of old people in other places. Just wondering, what’s the mood like inside the team? How do you deal with all that change and how is the team dealing with all that change?', 'Lance Stroll: I think everyone’s very excited about the future; I think everyone should be very excited about the future. We have a new simulator that’s now operational, we have a wind tunnel that’s being commissioned that’s going to be ready to go in a few weeks time, we have an incredible new facility that everyone comes to work to every day, and a lot of talent has joined the team amongst talent that’s been there a long time. Yes, the results have been frustrating, especially the second half of last season. And we’re not where we want to be as a team, but I think the future is extremely exciting. And, I hope and think everyone sees that. You know when they come into work every day, and you see everything I said, the incredible facility we have, and all the tools we have as a team to really build a fast race car, and be a great team. I believe that’s where everyone’s head is at.', 'Question: It’s been a few years now that you’ve been in Formula 1 and you’re getting older like everybody does, have you changed your training program – it’s not like we all see grey hair – but I think we recall your mountain biking accident last year in Spain, so did you, for example, avoid biking this off-season in preparation for this year?', 'Lance Stroll: I have one or two grey hairs (laughs). I think every year I change things a bit. I’m not the same athlete I was when I was 18-years-old, so I think every winter presents an opportunity to improve some little things and places where I had issues in the season. For example, I felt it when it was really hot, so I did some sauna exercising, so there’s always a little modifications every year. But, in general, every year it’s usually the same things I’ve always done: lots of cardio, cycling – less mountain biking, that’s for sure, after my accident – three or four times a week working on my neck and shoulders, because this is an area that gets huge stress in the car. A lot of the same things but also a few small things that change.', 'Question: What’s your main objective moving forward, next week, in pre-season testing?', 'Lance Stroll: Well, I think as a team, we want to really understand the car – that’s what the test is all about. We’re so limited with running time and come Australia, and pretty much for the whole year, in terms of trying setups and stuff, only three practice sessions. Yeah, Bahrain really gives us an opportunity to turn the car upside down over the course of three days and really try a lot of different setup items and see what makes the car happy and what gets it in the window. So, that’s going to be a lot of the stuff we’re doing in Bahrain. Then, for results, it’s all really about where we pan out in the order. Of course, I want to win the race in Australia but we have to see what’s a realistic goal come, not in the Bahrain tests, but more really, in the race weekend in Australia. That’s kind of when you start to see everyone’s real car pace.', 'Question: Regarding the new FIA rule about the language was restriction. What’s your opinion on this subject? Because many of your colleagues are saying the FIA is going too far. What do you think about it?', 'Lance Stroll: I think it’s f—ing bullshit.', 'Question: Why?', 'Lance Stroll: I’ve said enough.', 'Question: Why and when do you think bad language became a bad habit on the radio in the garage and in the paddock. Is it because of the Netflix series? Is it because of some personalities among the teams? Is it because it’s cool now, why? And when do you think this bad language became a bad habit?', 'Lance Stroll: I don’t know. I don’t have the answer to that question. I honestly don’t know.', 'Question: And, just to be clear, this is not an official FIA session, so we’re okay, right?', 'Lance Stroll: Hence the rough language, yeah.', 'Question: You’ve talked about the future before Lance. I’m just wondering, [your teammate] Fernando [Alonso] is getting to the point where he’s going to leave at some point. Do you feel that you need to have your role in the team change a little bit because he’s going to go and you’ll be the veteran? I mean, it’s hard to think about it, but you’ve been there for a long time, right? You’re still young but…', 'Lance Stroll: Yeah, I mean, unless the next guy’s, I don’t know, someone older than me again. But, I don’t think that the role changes. I mean, you know, my mindset is always show up to the track and get the most out of myself and the guys that are around me, my team, my engineers, the guys that I’m working with every weekend. You know that whether it was Seb [Vettel], Fernando, Checo [Sergio Perez], that mindset approach stays the same, so I don’t think whoever is next – if Fernando ever retires, I don’t know, it doesn’t look like it, he’s still pedaling very hard. So, I mean, that’s my mindset going into every weekend. And you know, that stays the same no matter who is next to me.', 'Question: Knowing that the new regulations are coming into force for 2026, is the team already turning to next year or is it focusing on this one and scoring lots of points and chasing wins?', 'Lance Stroll: I’m sure that 2026 will offer a huge opportunity for all the teams. It’s certain that, at some point in the season, we will completely change our focus to 2026 and forget about 2025 because that’s what we need to do to be ready for 2026. On the other hand, lots of work has gone into the 2025 car and right now we are completely concentrating on the first race and developing the 2025 car.', 'From local grassroots racing to Canadian touring series and the Canucks who compete on the international stage, Inside Track Motorsport News is the leader in terms of timely, in-depth and thought-provoking coverage of the motorsports that matter to Canadians.', '© 1997-2025 Inside Track Motorsport News.

Aston Martin AMR25 uncovered: Rival concepts absorbed into DNA,https://www.planetf1.com/aston-martin/aston-martin-amr25-uncovered-rival-concepts-absorbed-into-dna,"['Aston Martin have revealed the AMR25 ahead of it being put through its paces for the first time tomorrow, as Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll will both shake the car down, in Bahrain.', 'This year’s challenger has absorbed several concepts that we’ve seen some of their rivals have success with last season into its DNA.', '', 'The front wing seen on the AMR25 in these renders bears some similarities to the one introduced by the team at the United States Grand Prix, which arrived alongside a suite of other components that the team were evaluating in the closing stages of the season, not only to help with the remainder of their 2024 campaign but also as a backdrop for their development plan for 2025.', 'The team have suggested that this new design direction affords their drivers more stability through all phases of cornering but is more highly focused on delivering improved low-speed downforce, as such, like several items on this render, we must wait to see the physical car, in order to see if this is merely a placeholder for the render.', 'Push-rod suspension has been retained at the front of the car, albeit the individual fairings have been optimised to suit the revised flow characteristics both up and downstream of them. Furthermore, some adaptations have been made to the front brake duct, including the intake and outlet geometries, as the team look to harness the potential of the Brembo and Carbone Industries housed within.', 'As you’d expect, given the design direction that their competitors have taken last season and appear to be following again this season, Aston Martin now have an overbite-style sidepod intake, which has enabled them to increase the size of the undercut, lifting the bodywork high above the floor and allowing them to optimise the rest of the sidepod’s bodywork as a consequence of it.', 'Much like McLaren last season and the design seen on the Ferrari SF-25, the overbite is created by a mid-wing arrangement, with the intake sat behind. The shoulder of the sidepod is also narrower, exposing the mid-wing’s tip, resulting in it being used as a shedding surface, that should improve flow downstream.', 'Meanwhile, the deeper waterslide gullies that the team introduced in 2023 have been retained on the upper surface of the sidepod, albeit having been modified to find more performance from them.', 'Internally the team have suggested that there’s also some changes, in order to extract more cooling performance from the new intake, sidepod geometry and alterations that have been made to the engine cover and the outlets that will reject the heat that’s generated within.', 'There’s a switch to the Ferrari-style Cobra winglets beside the halo, as the team had previously used a looped version of this type of aerodynamic furniture on the AMR24. This will provide another shedding surface that may help to tie in the flow structures around the sidepod, engine cover and reduce the losses created around the cockpit and halo.', '', '👉 The ultimate F1 2025 guide: Everything you need to know about the 2025 season', '👉 F1 2025 cars: What name has each team given its chassis for the 2025 season?', 'In terms of the engine cover there’s no longer a gradual lowline shark fin along the entire length of its spine, rather it now features a short fin up top and a larger, wedge-shaped fin at the base of the engine cover. This portion of the fin is also hung over the top of a larger cut out that’s being employed to help with heat rejection.', 'The rear wing in this render is a very simplistic design when compared with some of the solutions we’ve seen fielded in recent seasons, not only by their rivals but by Aston Martin themselves.', 'This suggests that whilst the renders do afford a general sense of direction that the team are taking with the AMR25, there’s some detail they’re not willing to share until we see the physical version of the car lapping the track.', 'Read more: Adrian Newey ‘stifle’ warning as Aston Martin set out ‘dream’ F1 scenario', 'Aston Martin have rolled out the changes for their AMR25...', 'Two of the most intriguing F1 2025 subplots can be found at Ferrari and Aston Martin...', 'Lance Stroll: ""Don’t believe everything you read!""', 'Fernando Alonso has been told ""your time is over and by the way, has been for a long time""...', '', '', '', '© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved']"

Gary Anderson's verdict on Aston Martin's crucial 2025 F1 car,https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/aston-martin-2025-f1-car-technical-analysis-gary-anderson/,"['With Adrian Newey being about a week away from ‘officially’ starting his new job with Aston Martin, the pressure is on the existing technical group to prove that they actually know what makes an F1 car tick.', 'It’s the fourth and last year of these current ground effect rules so it should be about packaging what has been learned over the last three years. No team should really have to rely on someone of Adrian’s experience coming in to give them direction on how to achieve that.', ""It's a different story for 2026 with new rules, new concepts, new ideas, new ways of understanding and new ways of working, so in reality that is what Adrian should be let loose on, with the 2025 project simply giving him an idea of where Aston Martin are strong and where it is weak."", 'The covers are off and the AMR25 is here for everyone to see, so let’s have a closer look and put together a few comparisons.', 'So as normal let’s be a bumble bee and try to find the fastest route from the front to the back without suffering from getting too many bruises, after all that’s what the airflow has to do.', 'In its press release, Aston claims to have made a lot of changes to the front wing to help the front grip in low speed corners.', 'The comparison shots are from slightly different angles so somewhat exaggerate the differences. Yes the various element cord lengths have changed which can affect this characteristic but it’s always very difficult to predict slow-speed aerodynamic effects against high-speed aerodynamic effects, especially when rotational flexing comes into play, or at least until the flexi wing clampdown post-Spanish GP.', 'The nose is a bit bulkier but to counter Aston also retained the leading element to the nose slot gap (red highlight). This is something that I am in favour of as it improves the consistency of the airflow on the underside of the nose and in turn to the leading edge of the underfloor.', 'The gap between the front wheel and the trailing edge of the front wing endplate (red highlight) looks bigger than normal, it might just be an optical illusion but if it is it will increase outwash and potentially help the front wing performance when higher angles of steering lock are applied in slow corners.', ""This is very similar to last year, I can't see any major differences in anti dive, top wishbone forward leg (dark blue highlight) and rearward leg (light blue highlight) unlike the new Ferrari, Aston also retains the pushrod driven suspension system (magenta highlight)."", 'The radiator intake has changed (red highlight) which I have gone into detail below.', ""The radiator intake in comparison to the 2024 car has now got the Peaky Blinders hat brim' top surface over the inlet, most teams went to this solution to some degree last year but Aston Martin stuck with the older 'duck bill' style."", 'This new style of inlet (red highlight) is beneficial when you are running high angles of front wing, the top peak is roughly where the airflow separation point happens, below it is the wake from the underneath of the front wing (yellow arrows), above it is the flow that comes over the top of the front wing (orange arrow).', ""Interestingly the radiator opening appears to be a little bigger than it was previously. Most 2025 cars we've seen so far seem to have gone that way, perhaps everyone is expecting a very close season and they are preparing for more running in traffic."", ""The surface profile of the sidepods are less complicated than last year's version. I have highlighted the main profile features in red, it has retained and exaggerated the sidepod top surface gulley."", 'The low pressure behind the central section of the car pulls this flow down through this gully (light blue highlight). What you need to be careful of is that the expansion rate increase of this gulley is consistent otherwise it would be very easy to induce airflow separation in the gulley where it gets narrower (yellow ellipse) to clear the exhaust system. If this happens it could reduce its effectiveness.', 'The airflow coming over the top surface of the sidepod (light blue arrows) is pulled downwards onto the centre of the car. The large body radius is in compliance with the regulations to minimise potential vortex generation off body fins etc.', 'Aston uses the Mercedes transmission system and with it, I’m pretty sure most of the rear suspension layout.', ""Again I can’t see a big difference from last year in this comparison, it's still a very shallow angle pushrod operated system (magenta highlight). It may just be the angle of the picture but referencing it to the exhaust tail pipe angle it looks like Aston has gone for reduced anti-lift characteristics, top wishbone rear leg (dark blue highlight) and forward leg (light blue highlight)."", ""Is this a preview of what Mercedes might be up to? We'll find out when the team reveals its W16 on Monday."", 'To increase the cooling exit area Aston has a trailing edge slot on the centre line of the engine cover and a fin in the middle of it, the regulations define the side view that you are required to have and this fin is to legalise this slot feature.', 'I have highlighted the fin in red and the cutout in yellow, it’s not a big exit area but it allows some of the hot air that has gone through whatever cooling is mounted high up to not interfere with the main sidepod cooling.', 'Again Aston has said in its press release that it has concentrated on getting more corner entry stability from the design of the rear wing.', ""In my book that’s the first principle that should come from any overall design, spook the driver on corner entry and it won’t take long before they're not a happy camper, and lose confidence and that will show up in the laptime very quickly."", 'The rear wing is a bolt-on component so we will see various configurations as the season unfolds but on this version, I have highlighted the change with a red ellipse.', 'From what we have seen from the other cars that have been released other teams have separated the rear flap, main plane and endplate as much as possible, it looks like Aston Martin has gone in the opposite direction.', ""Just to get a handle on how last year unfolded this was Aston Martin's 2024 percentage performance deficit compared to whoever was fastest over each race weekend."", 'As can be seen, Aston started reasonably well but faded away, especially in the second and fourth quarters of the season. The number in brackets is where they were in the pecking order for that particular stint of races.', 'To be a contender for points regularly you need to be well within that one percent deficit over the complete season.', 'They started the season competitively but faded away, for potential podium positions you need to be within half a percentage deficit, that alone is no guarantee but from there on in you need a bit of luck.', 'The contrasting case studies of two upgrade packages introduced one year apart is proof of how Haas has overcome a fundamental F1 flaw', 'Life at Ferrari could have started much worse for Lewis Hamilton. Jon Noble picks six reasons why Hamilton seems to have arrived at the right moment', 'Aston Martin’s hopes for 2025 with the new AMR25 are discussed in the latest edition of The Race F1 Podcast', 'The new Aston Martin 2025 Formula 1 car has been officially unveiled three days before the start of pre-season testing', ""All the 2025 Formula 1 cars and liveries revealed at F1's O2 season launch..."", 'Formula 1 drivers have elected a new director to replace the retired Sebastian Vettel, with the role going to Carlos Sainz.', 'The Race started in February 2020 as a digital-only motorsport channel.
