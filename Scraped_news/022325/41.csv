Sheridan has continued to drive the streaming platform’s success with new seasons of Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown. Landman joined his television universe in 2024. Although 1923 announced its second season renewal in 2023, it had been delayed indefinitely due to the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild strikes.

The first, 1883, found country stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill playing James and Margaret Dutton. While the family tree might seem difficult to keep track of, the main thing to know for 1923 is that Jacob is James’s brother, and he does not have any children. Because of this, they raised John Dutton Sr. and Spencer Dutton as their own.', 'The John Dutton III (Kevin Costner) who viewers got to know in Yellowstone traces back to James and Margaret, as they had three children, and so on.', 'Season 1’s finale found Jacob and Cara facing an uncertain future on the Dutton ranch. Jacob has to pay the wealthy Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton) back for taxes, otherwise, he will lose the property (remember—all of Yellowstone has been about who possesses the land and values it properly, something the main show got back to with its finale this past winter). Jacob’s nemesis, Banner Creighton (Jerome Flynn), is released from jail without bail, getting Whitfield’s help after he rallied the sheep herders to attack Jacob and Elizabeth earlier in the season. John Dutton Sr. was also killed during the vengeful fight.', 'Meanwhile, James’s grandson, Jack Dutton (Darren Mann), and his wife, Elizabeth “Liz” Strafford (Michelle Randolph) are reeling from the loss of their child after she suffered a miscarriage.', 'Spencer (Brandon Sklenar) and his girlfriend, Alex (Julia Schlaepfer), also had a rough time. Her ex-fiancé, Arthur, escalated a duel with Spencer by bringing a gun. Spencer ultimately fought back and threw Arthur overboard the Majestic as they made their way to London. After Arthur’s death, Spencer was arrested and separated from Alex—leaving the fate of their reunion up in the air.', 'Teonna Rainwater (Aminah Nieves) started season 1 by suffering abuse at a Catholic Indian boarding school.

You are its only hope. You are our only hope. You must hurry, Spencer. You must hurry. Or there will be nothing left to fight for. Cara,“ she wrote in the letter in the finale.', 'Not only does the fate of the Duttons seemingly rely on Spencer, but season 2 will raise the question of whether he’ll see Alex again and if he’ll face any retribution for Arthur’s death.

Now, her face is sky-high on billboards everywhere, and people all across the country cannot wait to discover what happens next to Alexandra and her husband, Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar). Woman’s World couldn’t wait either, so we met with the actress and learned what’s in store for her character this season and how she really felt about the shocking season 1 finale. Keep scrolling for more, and be sure to watch the exclusive clip of Schlaepfer above. ', 'In 1923, Schlaepfer plays Alexandra Dutton, a young English woman who meets Spencer Dutton (Sklenar) while on an African Safari with her fiancé, Arthur, the Earl of Sussex (Bruce Davison). The two quickly fall in love despite being from different worlds and end up married. It was a love story for the ages—until it wasn’t. ', 'At the end of season 1, Spencer gets in a fight with Alexandra’s ex-fiancé and later kills him after shoving him over a boat ledge and into the ocean. He is then exiled from the ship and forced to leave Alexandra behind, with nothing but the hope of a Montana-based reunion to keep her going. ', '“I knew it was going to be the first time that Alexander sees Spencer unleash that violent part of himself, both while he’s beating [Arthur] up, and then when he throws him overboard,” Schlaepfer told Woman’s World.  “’Watching someone you love kill another person is a very scary thing, and definitely something for her to keep in mind. And I think it sticks with her. I think it scares her a little bit in that moment, because that sort of violence that he probably experienced in the war is not something that she’s ever been used to seeing.” ', 'Despite the violence and fear her character is facing, though, Schlaepfer still loves Alexandra and Spencer’s relationship, saying, “It’s so unlike how romance works today because they met and they were, like, ‘That is who I want to spend my life with. That is my purpose.’” ', '“That’s such a beautiful thing that modern-day romances miss a bit. I also love that they’re polar opposites, and they just pick out each other. They’re just very funny together because he’s so serious, and she’s just fine. So, I like that dynamic as well.” ', 'Sklenar is set to appear in season 2 of 1923, but it is unclear if/when his character will be reunited with Schlaepfer. ', 'Even though her character might be without the love of her life, Schlaepfer is still super excited for the upcoming season of 1923, and a large part of that comes from Alexendara’s emotional development. ', '“I can say that it is a very tumultuous journey. It is a lot more brutal,” the actress explained.  “She’s doing it all on her own, at least at the beginning. And so, she’s got to find a really deep level of grit and determination to power forward. We see a new side of her.” ', '“There was a big emotional journey for me to map out for Alexandra this season, which was so much fun to get to dig into. Normally, we see her so happy-go-lucky with her heart on her sleeve. And balancing that with the hardships she’s facing was really exciting as an actor.', 'Most of Alexendara’s storyline in season 2 is believed to be about her finding her way to the Dutton Ranch in Montana in hopes of reuniting with Spencer. However, how she plans to get there and what obstacles she will face remain a mystery. ', 'No matter what happens, Schlaepfer is ready, saying that she “loves this period so much.

Much darker. In the first episode alone, Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar) is on a voyage to America, but he’s stashed in a brig full of criminals and vagrants. Though he’s trying desperately to return home and help his family save their Montana ranch, he winds up entangled in a fighting ring on the high seas. And that’s just the first hour.', '“Tonally, it’s almost a different show entirely,” Sklenar tells me over Zoom. “I love that. It’s fun to tap into that energy, especially with a character who has so much darkness in him. Season 1 had to allude to it. Now we get the chance to let the cat out of the bag.”', 'The 34-year-old American actor first arrived on our screens as Spencer Dutton a little over two years ago, when his World War I veteran and big-game hunter—whose chiseled abs repeatedly found themselves in frame—easily garnered the title of Esquire’s hottest cowboy on TV.', 'Since 1923 season 1, Sklenar has starred in other projects, including the contentious This Ends with Us. It’s no secret that both the romantic drama and the flagship Yellowstone series have been marred in behind-the-scenes feuds. First, Taylor Sheridan vs. Kevin Costner. Then Blake Lively vs. Justin Baldoni. I’m sure it’s exhausting. Recently, Sklenar told CBS Mornings, “[I] want people to remember why we made the movie in the first place and what it stands for, and just keeping the focus on that.”', 'So it’s no surprise that Spencer Dutton’s aggressive turn in 1923 season 2 was a very cathartic process for the actor. “He goes through a lot this season,” Sklenar says. “I care about him deeply and he feels like he’s a part of me. So I didn’t have to do much to tap into it, to be honest with you. I put on some size because I wanted him to feel a little more intimidating—like a bit of an animal.

I’m just excited to get it out there. I’m really proud of it and I know people are going to love it. It’s well worth the wait. [Sheridan] wrote something really special, and everyone involved was at the top of their game. We all care deeply about it, and I’m sure you can feel that in it.', 'Last time we spoke, you mentioned that Sheridan outlined Spencer’s whole arc for you, basically from day one. Is the end result close to how you envisioned it back then?', 'In a way, yes. We didn’t know that he hadn’t written it yet, so he didn’t have all the specifics, but it was more than I could have imagined it would be. The season finale of this is special. I don’t know how he writes these things, but damn am I grateful for it. It’s beautiful.', 'I’m sure it was also a dream to finally work with Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren this time around. Your character was on such a journey in season 1 that he has yet to make it back home to the ranch even when season 2 begins.', 'Yeah, I was waiting for a long time. [Laughs.] I still can’t confirm or deny… but I could imagine if one were to work with them, it would be a pretty special experience.', 'Whenever I talk to someone from Yellowstone about Montana, there’s always the joke that fans who visit the location—who are looking for the picturesque Montana Summer at the Dutton ranch—are shocked to find it snowed over in the offseason. It’s fitting that Sheridan finally decided to film in the snow this season.', 'It was cool. I liked being in the elements. We actually didn’t get too much snow, so we had to make a lot of snow. When we were in Africa last time, they were in Montana around Halloween, and I think they had a foot of snow. But it was pretty bone-dry there through most of the shoot [for season 2]. We were in Texas a lot of the time and it was hot as hell. And then we went to Montana and it shifted about 60 degrees in the span of a week. So that was a fun adjustment.', 'What do you mean they made snow? They had snow machines everywhere?', 'Yeah, we did winter in Texas during summer in Texas. It was like 100 degrees and 100 percent humidity. And I’m in a long leather coat and pretending like it’s cold outside. I’m wearing an ice-pack vest, so I don’t get heatstroke. But I love that he put us out there and it’s not too cushy.', 'Last time we spoke, you said you had just downloaded Instagram.

I’ve been home for four weeks since June, so when I finish this movie, I’m just going to put my feet in the earth and kind of see where I’m at because the train’s been moving so fast. I’m really grateful for it. It’s a special thing. And I owe it all to this show. I was grinding for 12 to 13 years before that, and this was the thing that did it.

Paramount+’s Yellowstone prequel series 1923 returns on Feb. 23, after a two-year hiatus. In a darker second season, the Dutton family saddles up for a looming war in the Montana countryside — their legacy and territory on the line.', 'Led by Jacob (Harrison Ford) and Cara Dutton (Helen Mirren), the Western drama from creator Taylor Sheridan serves as a prequel to Yellowstone, which ended its five-season run in December 2024, and a sequel to 1883. Season 2 of 1923, which consists of eight episodes, won’t be an easy journey as the Duttons — and those in their orbit — are presented with new challenges and must tend to unfinished business against the backdrop of a harsh winter.', '“It really is about survival for everyone,” the actress Julia Schlaepfer, who plays Alex, told Yahoo Entertainment. “Taylor Sheridan wrote such a beautiful story for everyone, and I think people are really going to love it.”', '', '', 'The actors’ and writers’ strikes in 2023 pushed Season 2 production back one year to June 2024. The yearlong postponement also forced a change in filming location — from Butte, Mont., which was the main hub for Season 1, to Austin, Texas.', 'The extended break was a “blessing in disguise,” 1923 star Brandon Sklenar, who plays Jacob and Cara’s nephew Spencer, told Yahoo Entertainment.', '“I’m a different person than I was two and a half years ago — two and a half years older and [having lived] two and a half years of life,” the actor said, adding that the jobs he took between seasons, including Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s It Ends With Us, colored his performance in 1923. “Everything puts an imprint on you.”', '“But that guy’s so deep in my bones that it’s like second nature now,” Sklenar said of Spencer, who begins the new season while on an arduous journey home. “It was interesting to see how he felt in me now, versus me two years ago, because it’s definitely different in the best way.”', 'For his co-star Aminah Nieves, who portrays the Indigenous teen Teonna Rainwater, being back on set held a deeper meaning after the death of their co-star Cole Brings Plenty. The actor, who played Teonna’s friend Pete Plenty Clouds, a sheep herder, in Season 1, was found dead in Kansas in April 2024.', 'Nieves told Yahoo Entertainment she wanted to “honor Coco, Cole Brings Plenty, this season,” and “to be back with the family.”', 'It took an entire season for Spencer and Alex’s love story to blossom on 1923, but by the end of the first season, the couple was literally oceans apart. Their only ounce of hope was the desperate promise they made to each other that they would somehow reunite at Yellowstone — no matter how long their respective odysseys would take.', '“He’s never been more sure of why he’s doing what he’s doing — his convictions, his mission and his purpose,” Sklenar said of Spencer’s motivation for Season 2. Adding urgency to his mission is the threat to his family’s homestead from those who are circling it.', '“He’s dead set on getting home, and he’s gonna get there,” he said. “He doesn’t care what stands in his way or what he has to do. He’ll do whatever he has to do and sleep well at night, because he knows he’s doing it for the ultimate reason, which is to save his family and to build a life with his wife.”', 'Whether that means finally sharing a scene with Ford and Mirren, Sklenar played coy. “If I were to work with them, I’m sure it would be [great],” he said with a laugh. “They’re everything you want them to be and more. I’m not blowing any smoke there. There’s a reason they have the careers they have and they’ve lasted as long as they’ve had and continue to be loved by so many people and come up with interesting performances.”', 'Don’t be surprised, then, if Spencer finds himself in less savory situations in Season 2. In the first episode, he takes part in underground fighting to earn more money. “There’s no greater reason to do anything outside your own moral lines than the love of your family,” Sklenar said.', 'On the other side of the world, Alex begins the season wilting away in London after being separated from Spencer. It’s only when she discovers a life-altering development that changes the course of her (and Spencer’s) life that she decides to embark on a solo journey to America.', 'The “seasickness” Alex endured aboard the ship last season led fans to speculate whether she was pregnant. “It would add more fuel to his fire,” Sklenar said of the possibility. Schlaepfer added that it would “completely raise the stakes for her journey — it’s not just about her anymore.”', '“Everything that fuels her from this point on is her love for Spencer and her commitment that she made to the two of them being together,” Schlaepfer said, promising that her character matures quite a bit. “She was naive to the world [in Season 1] and she’s always been strong, feisty and fiery, but she always had Spencer there to take care of her. This season, she’s a woman moving through the world on her own and she’s very determined.”', 'It was vital to Schlaepfer that Alex experience hardship on her own this time. “She’s not a damsel in distress — and I never wanted her to be one,” the actress said. “It’s a much more tumultuous, brutal journey for her.”', 'Should Alex reunite with Spencer in due time, Sklenar said, “it’d probably be a beautiful scene.” Schlaepfer agreed, saying she’d want the moment — if it ends up happening — to be “peaceful” and “romantic.”', '“I want them to reunite sooner rather than later, too,” the actress admitted, acknowledging that fans were “upset” over their prolonged time apart. “I’m right there with y’all.”', 'Their characters may eventually cross paths with a powerful new character. Jennifer Carpenter, best known for her role as Debra on Dexter, plays U.S. Deputy Marshal Mamie Fossett in 1923. In doing research on the real-life persona, Carpenter told Yahoo Entertainment she found “maybe 10 sentences on her.”', '“She is someone who monitors the scales of justice, but she’s private, and she’s tethered to something that holds her still when things are chaotic around her,” Carpenter said, comparing her character to a slug in a rifle, always ready to stand her ground. “She basically intersects the orbit of all the other characters’ planets.”', 'A fan of the first season, Carpenter described 1923 as a panacea — “a missing piece” in her creative life. She said the series had “a simplistic, delicate way of telling a story” that held a mirror up to her.', '“It changed your trajectory to how you want to play your ticket to this life,” she said.', '1923 Season 2 returns Feb. 23 on Paramount+.']"

With harsh conditions and adversaries threatening to end the Dutton legacy, Spencer embarks on an arduous journey home, racing against time to save his family in Montana. Meanwhile, Alexandra sets off on her own harrowing trans-Atlantic journey to find Spencer and reclaim their love.', 'Review: While Yellowstone finished its run just a couple of months ago, Taylor Sheridan’s second prequel series still has a few more stories about the origin of the Dutton Ranch in Montana. Following the acclaimed ten-episode run of 1883, Sheridan jumped into the twentieth century with the Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren-led 1923. Envisioned as a two-season epic, 1923′s first season was a massive success as it blended a sprawling period epic across multiple continents and chronicled the early days of the Duttons and their ranch on the border of Yellowstone National Park. While we know Yellowstone has a couple of spin-offs in the works, the second and final season of 1923 will wrap the story of Jacob and Cara Dutton and set the table for the already announced series 1944, which will pick up with the generation immediately preceding the birth of Kevin Costner’s John Dutton. As far as final seasons go, 1923 is exceptional as it continues the first season with some impressive early chapters that lend more to the legendary clan of Taylor Sheridan’s dynastic franchise.', 'When 1923 originally debuted, we were only given a single episode to review. However, it was still a strong enough premiere chapter that we knew Taylor Sheridan had another hit on his hands. 1923 introduced the successors to 1883 characters James Dutton (Tim McGraw) and his wife Margaret (Faith Hill) after they arrived in Bozeman, Montana. Picking up with Jacob Dutton (Harrison Ford) and his wife Cara (Helen Mirren), 1923 followed their fight to secure their homestead from tycoon Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton) and rival Banner Creighton (Jerome Flynn). The series split time with the Montana Duttons and Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar) as he traversed Europe after fighting in World War I. At the end of the first season, Jacob and Cara faced an ultimatum as Whitfield paid their property taxes and was on the verge of claiming their land. At the same time, Spencer was separated from his new wife, Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer), aboard a ship. Season two opens with the story split across continents and focal points as the various Duttons begin defending their home.', 'In the first three episodes of 1923‘s second second, Jacob and Cara are struggling through a brutal Montana winter. With mountain lions and wolves desperate for warmth and food, the Dutton ranch is crawling with predators. At the same time, they must also contend with a pending trial for foreman Zane Davis (Brian Geraghty), who is married to an Asian woman who violated the law at the time. As Jacob tries to free Zane, Cara must protect the fort from the encroaching wildlife. Across the Atlantic, Spencer is working on a ship to try to reunite with Alexandra and get home to help his family defend the ranch from Whitfield. Alexandra is also trying to find a way to Spencer and has decided to travel to America. Unprepared for the plight of Ellis Island and being a single woman travelling halfway across the world, these three narratives have a lot going on. This does not even scratch the surface of what 1923 has in store in these early episodes, as Whitfield’s scheming with Banner Creighton echoes what the Duttons would face a century later at the hands of corrupt developers and rivals for the priceless acreage.', 'The brutal elements of Montana in the winter were barely a factor in Yellowstone, but the sparse resources in the early twentieth century made for some thrilling television. A sequence involving Harrison Ford trying to protect people in a blizzard echoes his scenes on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back. But, aside from the Duttons, 1923 also returns to following the escape of Teonna Rainwater (Aminah Nieves) as she tries to stay one step ahead of Father Renaud (Sebastian Roche) and Marshal Kent (Jamie McShane) along with her father Runs His Horse (Michael Spears) and Pete Plenty Clouds (the late Cole Brings Plenty). Without divulging too much about the various directions everyone is taking, the story is set in Montana, Texas, Oklahoma, New York City, and Italy, giving the vastness of the distances traveled an epic scope that seems challenging to conclude in just five remaining episodes. Nevertheless, 1923 is as engaging and enthralling as ever, especially with Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren continuing to give their all in their performances.', 'Echoing the behind-the-scenes work done in season one, the first three episodes of 1923 season two hail from Taylor Sheridan as writer and Ben Richardson as director. Having found their groove as a creative unit, this season is reminiscent of the best parts of Yellowstone‘s first season and the propulsive period drama of 1883. With appearances in the early episodes from Robert Patrick as Sherrif William McDowell and new characters played by Jennifer Carpenter and C. Thomas Howell, 1923 blends the Western genre with a look at milestone historical moments, including Prohibition and the Rise of Mussolini, while incorporating a first look at pizza to Americans. It also gives us a bleak look at what entering the United States through Ellis Island was like in one of the most disturbing sequences in any Taylor Sheridan series. The massive budget reportedly given to 1923 is evident on screen as the impeccable production values elevate the story in a way that feels even more genuine than the contemporary-set Yellowstone.', 'While these characters would not exist without Taylor Sheridan’s original Yellowstone, I feel that these prequels are far more consistent and well-developed than the original series. Maybe it is the condensed episode count or the finite length of the overall series. Still, with 1883 delivering a strong single season of ten episodes and Yellowstone wavering in quality across five, 1923 may represent the single best overall series that Taylor Sheridan has created to date. With exceptional performances from the entire cast led by Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as good as they have ever been, 1923′s second and final season is already shaping to be a powerful chapter in Yellowstone mythology. With 1944 picking up a couple of decades later, it is possible we could see Brandon Sklenar, Jilia Schlaepfer, Michelle Randolph, and Darren Mann, amongst others, in the next saga of the Dutton family. Still, for now, fans are in for a fantastic run of television that rivals every other entry in the Yellowstone universe.', 'Season two of 1923 premieres on February 23rd on Paramount+.', 'AMAZING', '', ""Alex Maidy has been a JoBlo.com editor, columnist, and critic since 2012.

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'F\nor all her plummy, Oscar-winning regality in The Queen, Helen Mirren has wielded her fair share of shooters over the years. There was her chain-smoking DCI Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect, her retired assassin in Red and – ahem – four Fast & Furious movies. Perhaps that’s why she looks right at home with a shotgun broken over her elbow in 1923, the expansive Yellowstone prequel series set amid the backdrop of Prohibition-era Montana. In fact, season one opened with her character Cara Dutton gunning down an assailant before letting out a guttural scream.', '“[It was] a very dramatic moment, and subsequently you find out why she commits this rather appalling act,” the septuagenarian actor remembers of that particular storyline. “In season two, the use of the gun is much more related to dealing with the wildness of the environment and the potential danger of wild animals coming to attack and possibly eat you,” she teases.', 'Guns and violence are at the heart of 1923, which stars Mirren as the steely, Irish-accented matriarch of the Dutton family. Her ranching dynasty will one day spawn Kevin Costner’s John Dutton III. A typically gruff Harrison Ford plays her husband, Jacob Dutton, lines like canyons now etched in his wizened face. In a dilemma that will perennially face the ranch owners’ descendants, people are after their land. This season, it’s short-lived Bond Timothy Dalton and Game of Thrones’s Jerome Flynn. They play the reprehensible tag team of Donald Whitfield and Banner Creighton – the former a sexually sadistic mining tycoon, the latter a vengeful Scottish sheep farmer out for Jacob’s blood. In season two, Donald sponsors Banner to build an army to take down the Duttons once and for all.', 'Appearing over Zoom from Los Angeles, wearing a deep-cut red blouse and a gleaming silver pendant, Mirren admits to having mixed feelings about firearms on screen. “It’s always difficult, isn’t it, between dealing with the truth of history and at the same time, not wanting to proselytise about the use of guns.”', 'She recalls her role in Red. “I rather foolishly said to the director, ‘Alright, I know I’m a sniper, but I don’t think I should kill anyone.’ I said, ‘She’s very accurate. So she only ever kills to stop people in their tracks. She’ll just get them in the legs so they can’t continue. But it’s got to be very clear that I don’t kill anyone.’” She laughs. “It didn’t work out that way, of course. But you know, I did try.”', 'There would likely have been little point attempting to sway the mind of series creator Taylor Sheridan anyway. The prolific writer-director is known for taking a “my way or the highway” approach with his actors – a clash of egos was reportedly behind Costner’s acrimonious exit from Yellowstone last year.', 'Happily, Mirren’s 29-year-old co-star Julia Schlaepfer tells me Sheridan had a much more hands-off approach when it came to the prequel. If Ford and Mirren are the show’s leads in Montana, Schlaepfer and the It Ends with Us star Brandon Sklenar are its leads abroad – the pair’s characters, haughty English aristocrat Alexandra and haunted Dutton heir Spencer, meet while on safari in Kenya. She promptly ditches her snooty wisp of a fiancé for the American hunk.', 'Sheridan flew the show’s young duo out to his sprawling, $600m ranch in Texas to rehearse with him before shooting began. “By the end of that weekend, he said, ‘Just bring as much of your own spirit to the characters as you can. I cast you for a reason.’ Which was kind of an honour and very empowering as an actor,” Schlaepfer tells me.', 'In season one, Spencer is busy drowning his PTSD from the First World War in whiskey and the blood of man-eating leopards when the captivating “Alex” convinces him to trade it in for the quiet life. In Sheridan’s distinctively theatrical style, they’re married within a day but their honeymoon is cut short as Spencer receives a letter from Cara warning that his family is in grave peril.', 'Season two sees the couple making their way to Montana separately after a debacle on a cruise ship involving Alex’s ex (let’s just say it didn’t end well for him). “It was very exciting for me to know that I would begin on my own and you would see Alex using her own strength and fighting her own battles, as opposed to relying on Spencer,” Schlaepfer says.', 'It quickly becomes apparent that Sheridan is out to shock audiences this time around – in the first episode of the new series, a man is violently raped and a small child is unceremoniously trampled by a horse. Ominously, the premiere ends with the revelation that Alex’s ticket to America has been downgraded to third class, or as her friend calls it, “thieves and beggars class”. “It is a bit ominous,” Schlaepfer agrees, laughing. Alluding to the troubles that lie ahead, the actor admits she received a foreboding call from Sheridan about her character’s journey. He told her: “This is the arc. It’s going to be really challenging, and it’s going to test you as an actor. It’s going to bring out a different side of you than season one. Are you game?”', 'Schlaepfer says an intimacy coordinator was pivotal in allowing her to get through some of the season’s more challenging scenes. “You don’t realise how overwhelming it [is] to be in such a vulnerable position,” she says. “And then you have everyone touching you because they have to make sure the mic is right, the hair and makeup and the costume and everything. I love my crew so much, but it can be very overstimulating. So [the coordinator] was really there just to defend me and make sure I felt safe. And I really utilised her a lot this season.”', 'Sheridan has been accused of gratuitous violence against women in the past, particularly with Indigenous characters in Yellowstone. 1923’s first season was no different in its toe-curling treatment of Teonna (Aminah Nieves) – a defiant student at a Catholic-led indoctrination school for Indigenous girls – who was relentlessly brutalised by a cruel nun (Jennifer Ehle). In season two, things finally seem to be looking up for Teonna as she falls in love while on the run with her father and his friend’s son Pete (played by the late Cole Brings Plenty). However, Sheridan fans will know that peace is merely a temporary conduit for more violence.', 'Plenty of that violence looks set to take place on the Dutton home turf this season. The first episode ends on a symbolic note, with Mirren standing on the porch, looking out over a frosty vista as wolves howl in the distance, closing in on her precious property. In a recent interview, Mirren revealed that Ford’s 2015 plane crash had informed his performance in a scene in season one where his character is riddled with bullets. “He’s been carried into the kitchen, dying and covered in blood, and later Harrison did say to me, ‘That was how I was after the accident,’” Mirren recalled.', 'Has her own understanding of mortality ever been shaken in such a way? “No, not personally,” she tells me. She pauses to consider the question. “But as you get older and life develops around you and you lose friends or family, obviously, your awareness of the finality of life becomes more and more real to you,” she says. “Hopefully that informs your acting – because what are you as an actor except a reflection of life around you?”', '‘1923’ season two, episode one is out now on Paramount+.

Brandon Sklenar Has Always Known How ‘1923’ Season 2 Would End,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/brandon-sklenar-1923-season-2-it-ends-with-us-sequel-1236143679/,"['', '', ""The actor who plays Spencer Dutton talks about his physical transformation and doing his own stunts on the 'Yellowstone' prequel, while sharing hopes for the ‘It Ends With Us’ movie sequel."", 'BY JACKIE STRAUSE', '', '[This story contains spoilers from the season two premiere of 1923, “The Killing Season.”]', 'Brandon Sklenar has been on quite a journey with Spencer Dutton.', '1923, which returned with its second season on Sunday, has been charting the transcontinental escapades for the elder Dutton in the Yellowstone prequel series from Taylor Sheridan. Will Spencer ever make it home to Montana, so he can save his family’s cattle ranch from the threats the Duttons faced in 1923? How will he manage that promise now that he and his soulmate, wife Alex (Julia Schlaepfer), have been separated by bodies of water?', '', 'Sklenar had promised a tonal shift for season two. If season one was Spencer’s origin story, season two is poised to show how he rises from the ashes to be the hero. “The pain and the guilt that he’s carrying into this next part is going to shape him into a version of himself that we haven’t seen yet,” he said after the season one finale.', 'Now speaking with The Hollywood Reporter two years later, Sklenar reveals that he has known from creator-writer Sheridan how this two-season story would end and that, no matter what ends up happening for Spencer, Sklenar says there is more 1923-era Dutton story to tell. “It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read in my life, truly,” he says of the season two finale. (Paramount+, meanwhile, has not confirmed if season two will be the final season of 1923.)', 'Below, Sklenar teases what’s to come on 1923, while also talking about his physical transformation for season two so he could do his own stunts, why he very much hopes to reprise his role in a sequel for the currently embattled It Ends With Us and what his plans are next.', '***', 'Last season ended on this huge and heartbreaking cliffhanger separating Spencer and Alex. Spencer enters this season with two promises — to find Alex and also to save his family and return to the ranch in Montana. Can he accomplish them both?', 'I think they are ultimately one and the same: His commitment to the people he loves, and it’s unwavering. It’s rooted in his feeling of responsibility to protect these people and make sure they’re OK, and show them how much he loves and cares about them. So they are one and the same.', 'Spencer is emotionally but also physically not to be messed with when this season opens. Did you train for his arduous journey? How did you get back into character after such a long break?', '', 'When I read the episodes, I was like: Ok, I definitely want to come in physically bigger than I was last season. So I put on quite a bit of size. I called Taylor [Sheridan] and I was like, “I think I’m going to get physically way bigger for this season because I want to feel imposing and I want to feel scary and I want to feel solid. And it will kind of work, because he’s been shoveling coal for four months [on his ship] (laughs).”', 'I’m also two years older, so that just changes your body as well. In terms of training, I had to do a lot of stunts this season and a lot of physically demanding things, so I definitely wanted to be prepared for that so I could actually do all the things myself and be capable in that respect. I grew up doing martial arts so I’m no stranger to punching things, and I enjoy it.', 'I understand that 1923 was pitched to be a two-season story. Have you known from Taylor Sheridan how it was going to end ever since you began?', 'They haven’t confirmed if it’s stopping here at season two, but I knew before we left to shoot season one ultimately where this was going. He kind of told me, not the specifics of what as going to happen, but he told me. I’ve always known to some degree how it was going to wrap up at the end of season two.', 'It was interesting to know where Spencer needs to be emotionally and physically, and having to allude to it in season one but never really go there. You’re playing this cat-and-mouse game and it’s kind of this magic trick where you’re like, how do I just open the window a little bit into letting the audience see what’s in there, but not letting it out fully because I have to save that? It was just such a joy to read these episodes and finally get to go to some cool places with Spencer.', '', 'Sheridan has a knack for writing epic and beautiful finales, whether they are series or season enders. How can you describe how the season two ending made you feel when you read it and then filmed where Spencer ends up?', 'It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read in my life, truly. I’m not just saying that, people say that. It’s genuinely, crazy beautiful. I don’t know how the man does it, but I’m grateful to him ’till the end of time for giving me this gift to play this role and say these words.', 'Does the ending open the door to continue more of 1923?', 'This story is going to continue one way or another, and I honestly don’t know. But there’s more Dutton story to be told for sure. [Note: There are several Dutton spinoffs in the works.]', 'When you were filming, were you aware of how Yellowstone the flagship series was going to end?', 'No. For my own process, I don’t think about that at all because Spencer doesn’t know what his family is doing in 100 years, so I try and stay in the lane of his reality and his day to day. I’ve since watched the season finale. Me as a viewer, not necessarily having anything to do with Spencer Dutton.', 'The Yellowstone finale brought the franchise full circle and paid tribute to the 1923 and 1883 characters. Elsa Dutton’s (Isabel May) monologue confirmed there have now been seven generations of Duttons, which, it seems, lines up the Dutton family tree so that Jack (Darren Mann) and Liz Dutton (Michelle Randolph) are the grandparents of John Dutton (Costner). Yet the season opens with Alex pregnant with Spencer’s baby. This is something that we have asked you about, and that you as a cast have speculated about. So, did you get your answer about who the grandparents to Kevin Costner’s John Dutton are in season two of 1923?', '', 'We may get an answer to that at some point this season. Yeah we may. I sure hope we do. (Laughs)', 'Spencer and Alex are such a star-crossed lovers story, and Sheridan doesn’t always write happy endings. Is their journey ahead hopeful, tragic?', 'It’s all the things. I can’t say anything specially, but I can say it’s all the things all at once. I can’t say anything else! I can say that you will genuinely love it. I think everyone who watches it is going to be moved by it. I’m supremely confident that people will love the arc of every character in the show. Taylor delivered over and above in these pages and in the way he wrote this.', 'You have been very busy with 1923 and your other roles. What are you looking to take on next?', 'I’m shooting this film right now, Housemaid, with Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried. Paul Feig is directing and that’s been a crazy experience playing a different character. I’ve never played any character like this. I’m almost done with that and then I’m going to have a little time off. I’ve been going since June nonstop, so it’s been seven months. I’m excited to just be in my house and my yard, and be Brandon for a while (laughs). I want to spend some time with myself, my family, my friends and my dog.', 'There is a lot in flux with It Ends With Us, but fans love your character. If there were to be a sequel, are you hoping to reprise your role?', 'Yeah, absolutely. I don’t know what’s happening with that, but I’m really proud of that movie and what it means and what it stands for. It was deeply personal to me. I’ve got someone very, very close to me who has been in that situation that Lily [Blake Lively‘s character] has been in for years, and I’ve been really on the frontlines helping her. So it means a lot to me and I’m just happy that it meant a lot to so many people as well.

The Duttons are low on numbers as Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton) and Banner Creighton (Jerome Flynn) up the ante in an effort to claim their land, made worse by the fact wolves and lions are invading the family\'s sought-after property. Elsewhere, newlyweds Spencer (Brandon Sklenar) and Alexandra Dutton (Julia Schlaepfer) have been separated in Europe and must find a way to get to Montana on their own, which won\'t be an easy task. Then again, when is life ever easy for the Duttons?', ""Despite this season boasting some compelling storylines, however, it isn't all good. Much like Season 1, this second installment already includes some unnecessary gross-out moments — namely, Whitfield and his habit of making sex workers Lindy (Madison Elise Rogers) and Christy (Cailyn Rice) brutally punish each other for his own amusement. These scenes were polarizing the first time round, and at this point, they aren't enhancing the story. This begs the question: is the show being gratuitous for the sake of it?"", '', '""1923"" is often justifiably brutal. For example, the Native American boarding school abuse scenes are extremely difficult to watch, but they play a key role in the story of Teonna Rainwater (Aminah Nieves), while simultaneously highlighting a brutal time in history. However, the scenes involving the mistreatment and humiliation of Lindy and Christy have received plenty of criticism, yet it seems they\'re set to continue for the foreseeable future, as the women are still locked up with Donald Whitfield when the Season 2 premiere ends.', 'That said, Whitfield\'s seedy exploits served their purpose the first time we saw them in Season 1. The first scene arguably provided some insight into the rich capitalist\'s sadistic nature, but the rest are nothing more than pointless torture sequences that would have been more suited to Taylor Sheridan\'s forgotten horror movie, ""Vile."" As one Redditor put it, ""[They\'re] completely pointless. Lazy writing. We saw the same exact scene in [\'Game of Thrones\'], except way better written and part of a gradual character development with huge payoff in the end.""', 'While ""Yellowstone"" lost its way eventually, at least the show wasn\'t short on ideas and surprises. ""1923"" is strong, for the most part, but the series would be more interesting if it didn\'t double and triple down on its worst elements, such as this one, and instead found other ways to showcase Whitfield\'s wickedness during his personal time. Maybe these scenes will lead to an interesting storyline payoff down the line, but for now, they appear to be leaving a bad taste in people\'s mouths.', 'New episodes of ""1923"" premiere Sundays on Paramount+.', '', '', '', '', '']"

""The sex and all of that is fabulous; don\'t get me wrong, it\'s great,"" Mirren says. ""But it\'s the partnership that survives. That\'s one of the most beautiful things in human relationships. And we don\'t often see that on TV.""', 'We do in ""1923,"" the Taylor Sheridan Yellowstone-verse Prohibition Era drama that kicks off Season 2 on Paramount+ Sunday, centered on the rare (for TV) mature relationship.

""We haven\'t been in touch that much over the years, but there\'s an incredible natural fit when I\'m working with her.""', 'Mirren compares the relationship with Ford, who has been married to ""Ally McBeal"" star Calista Flockhart since 2010, to meeting up with a friend ""you loved in college, but you haven\'t seen for years.

The passionate duo is still traveling from Kenya to Montana to save the besieged Dutton family, but the first season\'s most notable period of youthful heat stemmed from their Season 1 vacation on Zanzibar\'s white sands beaches.', '""It\'s different flavors. To see young people in love, we see that so often,"" says Sklenar, who starred in 2024\'s ""It Ends With Us"" (a film overshadowed by a protracted legal battle between co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni). ""To see older people just crazy about each other is so sweet and so pure. We don\'t see a lot of that on TV.""', 'While the senior Dutton\'s relationship is relatively chaste, Ford jokingly insists Jacob has a yet-unseen ""sex scene on the beach.

Taylor Sheridan’s “1923” Returns with Same Degree of Self-Proclaimed Grandeur,https://www.rogerebert.com/streaming/1923-season-two-paramount-plus-tv-review-2025,"['TV/Streaming', '', 'As he sits on the throne as the King of the Streaming Era, writer/director Taylor Sheridan has sometimes been accused of being pretentious and even misogynistic. Whatever criticisms can be levied at his output, he is arguably the creator who has most earned the right to his pretensions today. He is more of an industry than a showrunner, someone who has created thousands of jobs and millions of fans with shows like “Tulsa King,” “Mayor of Kingstown,” “Lioness,” and “Landman,” just to name a few.', 'But the first line of his obituary will reference the true phenomenon that is “Yellowstone,” a show that just ended as one of the biggest hits of its generation but that is going nowhere in terms of franchise expansion. There was the prequel “1883” in 2021 and the follow-up “1923” in 2022; a direct sequel called “The Madison” has been completed to air later this year; three more spin-offs are in various stages of pre-production. It’s an industry of old-fashioned storytelling about heroic, morally righteous men and the women who stand by their side. Sheridan has been accused of making “Red State Television,” but it doesn’t matter how you frame it: People love these shows. And those people should be satisfied by the new season of “1923,” even if they’re starting to wonder if the writers will ever connect their competing subplots.', 'The new season picks up shortly after the end of the last one and again keeps its protagonists on parallel tracks for the three episodes sent to press, leading one to consider the likelihood that they won’t actually intersect until the series finale. The main draw remains Jacob (Harrison Ford) and Cara Dutton (Helen Mirren), struggling to keep their Montana homestead safe from both natural enemies—a lion on the porch in the opening scenes of the season could come from a book called Foreshadowing 101—and those who so desperately want their land. The latter is led by the truly villainous Donald Whitfield (a scenery-chewing Timothy Dalton), who is reintroduced this season in a truly nauseating scene that first sees him fondling a naked woman a third of his age and then ordering her to go get the sex slave they have bound in the closet. Sheridan loves to show off how far he can push his audience when it comes to sex and violence, especially against women, using them as devices to raise the villain or hero profile of his male characters.', 'The strongest female character on “1923” might be Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer), who was finally torn from her husband Spencer Dutton (series MVP Brandon Sklenar) at the end of last season. The first three episodes of the new season keep the Jack and Rose of this show divided with Spencer stuck aboard an Italian ship and Alexandra struggling to find her way to the States, where she hopes they can be reunited. Schlaepfer and Sklenar were the best thing about the first season as their actual chemistry enlivened the old-fashioned storytelling as their undying love fought through everything from elephant attacks to a shipwreck to an actual duel. Sklenar is a truly charismatic screen presence, someone who looks like he could have stepped out of adventure films of the era in which the show is set, and Schlaepfer has dramatic chops, especially in the third episode this season, which also features some of the most remarkable period detail of the streaming era.', 'If the Spencer/Alexandra arc remains the most interesting and the Cara/Jacob arc is entertaining through the sheer acting ability of the performers who embody it, the weakest plotting on “1923” remains with Teonna Rainwater (Aminah Nieves), the character abused so fully in the first season that she’s now a fugitive on the run. Jamie McShane takes more of the spotlight this season as U.S. Marshal Kent, roaming the hills with Father Renaud (Sebastian Roché) in search of Teonna, someone the writers still struggle to turn into a character more than a plot device.', 'Yet the consistently shallow and clichéd writing often fades away under the production value of “1923” and the sheer scope of what Sheridan and his team are attempting. It’s old-fashioned dramatic entertainment, where we swallow lines like “I will not allow today to be the last time I see your face” because of the deep sincerity with which they’re uttered. Yes, this kind of nostalgic storytelling comes with its pitfalls when it comes to gender (almost all the women on this show are pregnant or injured at one point or another). Still, it clearly strikes a chord with many people looking for something simple in an increasingly complex world.', 'Watching “1923” as one run from the first season through these three episodes gave me a greater appreciation for what Sheridan does than the modern shows that I consider missteps (I don’t like “Tulsa” or “Kingstown”). Something about his vision of heroic men and troubled women fits the Western genre, whether it’s a modern one like “Yellowstone” or a traditional one like “1923.” Sheridan may bristle at the idea that he’s a creator for MAGA households, but his programs do recall a bygone era of network TV Westerns that used a modern lens to transport viewers back to a “simpler time.” He may not want to make America great again, but he’s doing his part to make TV great again, and millions think it’s working.', 'Three episodes screened for review.', 'Brian Tallerico is the Managing Editor of RogerEbert.com, and also covers television, film, Blu-ray, and video games. He is also a writer for Vulture, The Playlist, The New York Times, and GQ, and the President of the Chicago Film Critics Association.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"
