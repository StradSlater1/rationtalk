5 Android phones I would buy instead of the iPhone 16e,https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-16e-alternatives-3527388/,"['Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.', 'February 21, 2025', 'The Apple iPhone 16e is official. And you know what? It actually looks pretty solid. Three years after the last iPhone SE was released, the iPhone 16e is the SE’s spiritual successor and packs a lot of significant upgrades. It has a new design with a larger 6.1-inch display and a notch, Face ID support, a new 48-megapixel camera, and the same A18 chip used in the iPhone 16. And, of course, Apple Intelligence features are here, too.', 'Those upgraded specs and features also come with a price increase, taking the old iPhone SE’s $429 price and upping it to $599. If you want a modern iPhone but can’t stomach the cost of the mainline series, the iPhone 16e should be a solid choice. But it’s not your only choice.', 'As someone who uses an iPhone and an Android phone, I won’t deny that the iPhone 16e looks promising. But there’s another side of me that can’t help but think there are better Android phones to be had. If you’re thinking about getting the new iPhone SE but aren’t fully committed to the iPhone world, here are five Android phones I would buy instead.', 'Whenever discussing $500-$600 smartphones, it’s impossible not to bring up the Google Pixel 8a. Put side-by-side with the iPhone 16e, the Google Pixel 8a has a few immediate advantages — the first of which is its display. Both phones have compact OLED screens (each measuring 6.1 inches), but Google’s phone has one significant upside: a 120Hz refresh rate.', 'Like the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16e is stuck with an ancient 60Hz display — meaning it refreshes twice as slowly as the Pixel 8a’s. From animations, gameplay, scrolling, etc., everything on the Google Pixel 8a will look and feel much smoother than on the iPhone.', 'Google also has Apple beat at cameras. While the upgrade from a 12MP rear camera on the iPhone SE 3 to the 48MP sensor on the iPhone 16e is a welcome change, it can’t compete with the Pixel. Not only does the Pixel 8a offer a high-quality 64MP primary camera, but there’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera for zoomed-out shots. It’s not the best ultrawide camera we’ve ever seen, but it offers flexibility that’s simply not present on the iPhone 16e.', 'There’s also something to be said about Google’s software experience, which is a perfect fit for anyone switching from iOS. Android 15 on the Pixel 8a is easy to use, isn’t cluttered with unnecessary features, and has iPhone-level software support, getting seven years of Android OS upgrades and security patches — and being first-in-line for those updates as soon as they’re available.', 'Considering you get all this for $499, $100 less than the iPhone 16e, it’s easy to see why the Pixel 8a is our number one pick for the best budget smartphone — even with the Google Pixel 9a right around the corner.', 'The Google Pixel 8a is a phenomenal alternative to the iPhone 16e. And, for most people, it’s the best overall choice. However, if I could only pick one phone from this list, it would be the OnePlus 13R. It’s the same price as the iPhone 16e ($600) and a better value in every way imaginable.', 'The OnePlus 13R has one of the most impressive spec sheets for a phone in its price range. Its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, 120Hz refresh rate, and incredibly well-optimized OxygenOS 15 software make it one of the smoothest and most responsive phones I’ve used this year. The 6,000mAh battery is big enough to get you through at least two days per charge, and it takes just under an hour to recharge from 0-100%. The iPhone 16e has a great chipset and should last about a day for most people. However, if fast performance, long battery life, and fast charging are priorities for you, the OnePlus 13R has it handily beat.', 'I also love the OnePlus 13R’s hardware, which is exceptionally well-built and iPhone-like — thanks to its flat edges and rounded corners. It’s quite a bit bigger than the iPhone 16e, touting a 6.78-inch screen, but I found the 13R easy and comfortable to hold. The 50MP primary camera on the back is great, and while their quality is just OK, the versatility of the 50MP 2x telephoto camera and 8MP ultrawide camera are very much appreciated. Remember, the iPhone 16e has just one camera.', 'What’s not to like about the OnePlus 13R? No wireless charging is annoying, and for some people, the bigger size may not be for you. But if that doesn’t deter you, I can’t recommend the OnePlus 13R enough. So many smartphones try to offer a “flagship-like” experience at a lower price, but they often make one too many compromises. The OnePlus 13R strikes this balance perfectly in my book — and makes the iPhone 16e look like a ripoff by comparison.', 'The Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) may not have the best name, but it was one of the most surprising budget phones I used last year. Motorola’s Moto G handsets are hit-or-miss, but the latest G Stylus is a strong showing.', 'For me, it all starts with the design. The Moto G Stylus has a lovely vegan leather backside that’s easy to grip and does an excellent job of hiding fingerprints. The Caramel Latte color you see above looks great, but I’m particularly fond of the bright red Scarlet Wave color that’s also available.', 'Motorola did a fantastic job with the G Stylus display, offering a 6.7-inch OLED panel. It’s bright, sharp, and smooth, too, thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset isn’t the most capable, but it’s more than enough for apps and casual games. The large 5,000mAh battery should get you through multiple days on a single charge (much more than the iPhone 16e), and the camera setup is decent as well — featuring a 50MP primary camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera (which is also capable of taking macro photos).', 'Also, as the name suggests, the Moto G Stylus 5G comes with a stylus! There’s no pressure sensitivity like you get with the S Pen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it’s still quite handy for jotting down notes or making quick doodles. It even neatly slots in the bottom of the phone when you aren’t using it.', 'The Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) isn’t an amazing phone, but it is extremely solid across the board. The best part is its price, which comes in at just $400. Buy this instead of the iPhone 16e, and you have an extra $200 for a new smartwatch, earbuds, or whatever else you want.', 'Similar to how the iPhone 16e is a budget version of the iPhone 16, the Galaxy S24 FE is a more affordable take on the Galaxy S24/S24 Plus. It was a bit overlooked when it launched late last year, but compared to the iPhone 16e, there’s quite a lot going for it.', 'It does a commendable job in categories like performance, battery life, and charging. Day-to-day responsiveness is excellent, the battery comfortably lasts for over a day, and while you’ll be waiting about 75 minutes for a full recharge, you also have the option to charge wirelessly if you prefer. The 6.7-inch AMOLED display is bright, colorful, and — you guessed it — has a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The camera setup is solid, too, giving you a 50MP primary camera, an 8MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultrawide camera.', 'What makes the Galaxy S24 FE a particularly interesting iPhone 16e alternative is its software suite. The S24 FE has Samsung’s entire package of Galaxy AI features, including AI-assisted photo editing tools, writing suggestions, etc. — just like Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16e. The Pixel 8a and OnePlus 13R have some AI features, too, but they don’t quite match Apple Intelligence the way Galaxy AI does.', 'Like the Pixel 8a, Samsung also promises seven years of software updates for the Galaxy S24 FE. The company isn’t always the fastest with its updates (as evident by its endlessly delayed One UI 7 rollout), but it’s generally pretty reliable — and the seven-year commitment is the best in the industry.', 'The $650 retail price for the Galaxy S24 FE isn’t the best value, but in typical Samsung fashion, the phone is regularly on sale and heavily discounted. At the time of publication, Amazon sells it for as low as $609, while Samsung’s website offers up to a $400 discount with a trade-in. Buy the Galaxy S24 FE on sale, and it’s a fantastic iPhone 16e killer.', 'My final pick is a bit of a wild card, but it perfectly encapsulates how much variety exists in the Android world at this ~$500 price. While you could buy the iPhone 16e, I think you’d have a much better time with the Motorola Razr (2024).', 'Launched last summer, the Razr (2024) is one of the best folding flip phones you can buy today. You have a “normal” 6.9-inch OLED display when it’s open, and you can use it like any other Android phone. But the magic of the Razr (2024) is that you can close the phone and still access a 1.5-inch screen on the outside. You can do almost anything on the cover screen. You can check and reply to notifications, browse your calendar, talk to Gemini, and run any Android app you’d like.', 'In addition to the added functionality of the cover screen, there are other benefits of having a flip phone like the Razr (2024). You can fold the phone halfway and use it as an impromptu stand for group photos. The cover screen can be a viewfinder for the two main cameras, seriously upgrading your selfie game. The Razr (2024) is also about half the height of a slab phone when closed, making it that much easier to fit into tight pockets or a purse/bag.', 'This means you can use the Razr (2024) in ways that aren’t possible with the iPhone 16e — and amazingly — it doesn’t cost that much more, either. The Motorola Razr (2024) has a retail price of $700, but as is often the case for Motorola phones, it’s almost always discounted. Right now, Amazon has it down to just $450.', 'The Razr (2024) may not be the first phone that comes to mind as an iPhone 16e alternative, but at this price, it really should be. The Razr (2024) doesn’t have the best specs compared to other phones on this list, but it is the most fun, and there’s something to be said about that.', '']"
"The iPhone 16e is crucial to the iPhone’s future, here’s why",https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-16e-apple-c1-crucial-to-future-of-iphone/,"['Apple has finally unveiled the new iPhone SE. Scratch that, the SE lineup is presumably dead and the latest member of the iPhone family is dubbed the iPhone 16e.', 'Designed to offer the best of the iPhone 16 series at a slightly more affordable price, the iPhone 16e brings a host of features found on its sibling devices, but it also brings something entirely new: it’s the first iPhone with the Apple C1 modem.', 'Apple has been building its modem for almost seven years, and while we first expected it to launch many years ago, the endeavor faced many early challenges. Instead of a roaring success — and presumably burned by the signal issues that plagued the iPhone 4 — remember the antenna gate? — Apple struck successive agreements with Qualcomm to power the modems inside the latest iPhone.', 'This approach has worked so far, but Apple was always likely to continue building its modem, and presumably, the iPhone 16e is just the first iPhone to feature it. This makes the iPhone 16e crucial to the success of future iPhones, and several Apple supplier relationships, here’s why.', 'To understand the past of the C1, you need to trace the history of Apple back almost a decade to the now-infamous legal wars with Qualcomm. Apple wanted to break away from its reliance on Qualcomm and sued the company in 2017 over what it claimed were excessive patent fees.', 'Two years later, the two companies settled and announced a multi-year partnership for Qualcomm to provide 5G modems for the latest iPhones. Although that partnership is still active — and has been extended until 2027 — Apple clearly showed its future intentions by acquiring Intel’s smartphone modem business and thousands of engineers just months after the Qualcomm agreement in 2019. We first expected Apple’s in-house modem to launch two years ago, but the extension of the Qualcomm agreement suggested Apple had underestimated the task of building its own 5G modems.', 'Two months ago we heard that Apple was planning a phased approach to its modems, with the first product launching this year. The C1 inside the iPhone 16e isn’t expected to meet the current Qualcomm X75 modem used inside the iPhone 16 series, but this phased approach will likely work in Apple’s favor.', 'Apple hasn’t officially confirmed it — and the company almost certainly won’t — but all signs point to the Apple C1 modem struggling to meet the speeds, reliability, and signal reception found on the Qualcomm modem used by other iPhones. If that proves to be the case, launching with the iPhone 16e is bound to be the best business decision we’ll see this year.', 'The iPhone 16e launches at $599, and as the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE series have both been discontinued, it is now the cheapest way to get one of Apple’s latest phones with Apple Intelligence. If the modem inside fails to live up to the rest of the iPhone series, it’s easy to blame this on it being an affordable device.', 'Consider the alternative: Apple waited and launched the C1 inside the iPhone 17 series, including the rumored iPhone 17 Air. The potential for a PR nightmare, and another antenna gate aside, this move would also represent a huge problem as the C1 is not designed to be a flagship chipset. There’s no mmWave support which would likely frustrate US carrier partners. Unless the speeds and reliability were as strong as the best modems inside other flagships, Apple likely also has to contend with an impact on its share price.', 'Instead, the iPhone 16e is a proving ground that will either see Apple go all-in on its modem efforts, or sign yet another agreement with Qualcomm.', 'It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Apple wants a modem that it has made in-house. One of the key benefits of the new iPhone 16e is a reported 26-hour battery life, and the modem plays a part in helping Apple achieve this goal.', 'Apple Silicon showed that the company is capable of excellent vertical integration between all its components, and the benefits of doing so are considerably more than sticking with the status quo. Apple Silicon brought outstanding performance, battery, and efficiency benefits to all Macs and helped usher in the ARM-based computing era that has seen Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD also launch competitors.', 'It’s not just Apple Silicon: Apple has a track record of achievements when it focuses on vertical integration between its components. The iPhone uses a smaller battery and less RAM than the best Android phones that aim to compete with it, but achieves similar results. Apple is presumably aiming for similar benefits by operating its own modem, and the two that come to mind are battery life and connectivity.', 'Battery life will almost certainly be considerably improved. Yes, we don’t know how much by, but if the iPhone 16e is any indication, Apple’s in-house modem could be crucial to achieving a marked improvement in iPhone battery life.', 'At first, I would expect connectivity to be inferior to Qualcomm-powered iPhones, but the iPhone 16e will show how important features like mmWave are to consumers and to Apple’s carrier partners. In particular, will future iPhones still support mmWave? Could Apple launch a flagship without this high-speed 5G technology? There are many unknowns — especially as we’re yet to test the C1 inside the iPhone 16e — but in the years to come, this could prove to be as consequential as the Apple Silicon launch.', 'The company likely to be most impacted by the launch of the iPhone 16e is its current modem supplier. Qualcomm has been diversifying its business interests for many years — and the Snapdragon Cockpit is stunning — but the modem business still plays a key part in the company’s overall outlook.', 'It’s clear why the success of the iPhone 16e is crucial to Apple, but I suspect it’s also crucial to Qualcomm. The company won’t say it publicly, but I would expect that its best-case scenario is an outcome that pushes Apple’s modem project back a few years. The worst case? The C1 modem has the same effect as Apple Silicon and hastens a faster shift for future iPhones.', 'Regardless of what happens with the iPhone 16e as a phone, it could prove to be crucial for the future of more than just the iPhone. I can’t wait to see how it performs with pre-orders launching tomorrow ahead of its general release on February 28.', 'The names of our smartphones matter. Too clunky and we forget, too wordy and we don’t remember, or too bizarre and we won’t say it. They don’t have to mean anything at all, but they need to fit. The new iPhone 16e’s name fits, far more so than the expected alternatives, and it was one of Apple’s best decisions with the phone. But there’s another name I would have preferred even more.\nYou’re family now', '', ""Apple announced the iPhone 16e earlier this week. As expected, the company's latest budget smartphone features its first custom-designed modem chip, known as the C1. However, this chip does not support ultra-fast mmWave 5G technology, indicating that another upcoming iPhone model may also lack this capability."", '', ""Now the Apple iPhone 16e has officially been announced — and is available for preorder, no less — you might wonder what accessories you need to buy for it. This handset has been a long time coming and fits nicely into the lineup between the higher-end iPhone 16, holding to many of the flagship's most useful features, while still remaining a budget-friendly option.\nDoes the iPhone 16e  have a headphone jack?"", '', 'Upgrade your lifestyle\nDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Apple rolls out its C1 modem six years after buying in the technology from Intel,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/apple-rolls-out-its-c1-modem-six-years-after-buying-in-the-technology-from-intel,"['', 'Features in the new iPhone 16e mainstream handset.', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""Apple on Wednesday formally introduced its first in-house developed 5G modem that will be used in the company's new $599 6.1-inch iPhone 16e smartphone, aimed at the mainstream audience. The modem is the first fruit from Apple's acquisition of Intel's 5G modem business unit six years ago."", 'Apple says its C1 is the ""most power-efficient modem ever on iPhone"" and delivers ""fast and reliable 5G connectivity."" Indeed, the modem supports most key 4G and 5G technologies, including sub-6 GHz 5G with 4x4 MIMO, Gigabit LTE with 4x4 MIMO, FDD-LTE, TD-LTE, as well as 3G and 2G capabilities for compatibility.', ""Yet, the company does not disclose how this energy efficiency was achieved. Apple could use its own custom Arm or RISC-V-based cores with optimized power consumption. Also, the company uses one of TSMC's 4nm-class process technology (presumably N4P) to make C1 chips (according to an interview with Reuters), which assists in reducing power consumption. Since Apple tends to tightly integrate its hardware (C1) and software (iOS 18), it can enable its own proprietary power states that allow it to cut power consumption without performance degradation."", ""For now, Apple's C1 is used exclusively inside the iPhone 16e, which is a mainstream handset that does not support a number of performance-enhancing yet power-hungry capabilities, such as Wi-Fi 7, mmWave 5G, TDD (time division duplex) 4G and 5G networks, and DC-HSDPA."", 'mmWave 5G can deliver very high data rates, but to achieve them, the phone has to pack phased-array antennas and rely heavily on beamforming. 5G handsets with mmWave support must constantly adjust beams and manage multiple antenna elements in real-time, which means greater signal processing, more frequent power amplifier usage, and higher power consumption.', 'TDD networks use a single frequency channel for both uplink and downlink transmissions but at different time intervals, which adds flexibility and improves spectrum efficiency, making them beneficial in dense urban areas. However, TDD networks require strict timing synchronization between the phone and the base station, as well as switching between UL and DL, so the phone has to continuously adjust its transmission timing and radio circuits, which adds processing overhead and increases power consumption. Also, in weak signal areas, a phone has to increase its transmission power to maintain a connection, which is more taxing in TDD than in FDD.', ""The same applies to DC-HSDPA: the feature increases data rates by using two carrier frequencies instead of one, which inherently means that the device's radio components are working harder, leading to increased power consumption. However, this can all be optimized."", ""Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox."", ""At this point, we do not know whether Apple's C1 lacks support for certain power-hungry features altogether, or if it is the iPhone 16e that omits certain features to cut its costs and power consumption. For example, the smartphone does not feature Apple's ultra-wideband chip, Thread networking technology, or MagSafe charging (although it does support Qi wireless charging and lacks magnets for MagSafe), and even the Camera Control button — four features that are cheap and easy to implement."", ""On the bright side, Apple's iPhone 16e is based on a rather powerful A18 processor with six cores and a cut-down quad-cluster GPU that comes equipped with enough memory to run Apple Intelligence applications."", 'Apple tends to use its own silicon instead of third-party chips whenever possible, so expect the C1 and its successors to be used more widely over time. For now, the C1 enables Apple to cut its costs (as it does not need to pay a premium to Qualcomm) and perhaps use it as bargaining leverage when negotiating prices with Qualcomm. Nonetheless, over time, Apple plans to use its own modems across all of its devices.\n\n""C1 is the start, and we\'re going to keep improving that technology each generation, so that it becomes a platform for us that will be used to truly differentiate this technology for our products,"" Johny Srouji, Apple\'s senior vice president of hardware technologies, told Reuters.', 'Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom’s Hardware.

Both devices also have a USB-C port, and neither has a headphone jack.', 'The iPhone 16E comes in black and white, while the iPhone 16 comes in black, white, pink, teal and ultramarine.', ""The iPhone 16E has Apple's C1 modem, which Apple says is the most efficient modem in an iPhone, and this should help lengthen battery life."", 'Both the iPhone 16E and 16 come in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB options. Apple boasts that the 16E can get up to 26 hours of video playback and 21 hours of streamed video playback, while the 16 will last for up to 22 hours of video playback and 18 hours of streamed video playback.', 'One of the reasons behind the cheaper iPhone\'s longer battery life is because it runs on Apple\'s very first 5G modem, called C1.

iPhone 16e Versus iPhone SE 3. How Much Did Apple’s ‘Budget’ iPhone Really Change?,https://www.vice.com/en/article/iphone-16e-vs-iphone-se-3/,"['Newsletters', 'The Apple didn’t just fall far from the tree. It practically flew off in a hurricane.', 'By Matt Jancer', 'The iPhone 16e seems sure to go down in tech history as a pocket-sized example of feature creep, in which a development team keeps adding more and more fancy tech to the point they undermine the product’s value.', 'It packs a better chip and better screen than we were expecting, but what’s the point? The iPhone SE 3, officially known as the iPhone SE (3rd Generation), came out on March 18, 2022 as a mid-priced phone that also served the Apple-faithful and Apple-curious who bemoaned that iPhone screens were growing too large to comfortably use.', 'Then we got our official glimpse of the newest iPhone when Apple announced it on Wednesday, February 19. The first major surprise was that the SE moniker was dead. Apple’s new tiny, budget iPhone would henceforth be known as the iPhone 16e, and it wasn’t very tiny at all. And come to think of it, it wasn’t very budget, either.', 'The iPhone SE 3’s retail price started at $430, and a major selling point of the iPhone SE was that you could have Apple’s it-just-works slickness and intuitive iOS ecosystem for… not cheap, but cheaper than the high price of entry that even base-level iPhones require.', 'I thought (what we now know is called) the iPhone 16e would target the $400-500 price bracket that all three previous generations of the iPhone SE occupied, and boy, was I wrong. The iPhone 16e jacks up the entry-level price to $599. It’s no longer a budget smartphone.', 'It is a higher-spec phone than the mid-budget iPhone SE family ever was, but is it needed? An iPhone 16 is only $200 more. Once you’re that close in cost, you may as well spring for the iPhone 16.', 'For that extra $200, you gain dual camera lenses (it adds a 12 megapixel ultra-wide), macro photography, sweet Dynamic Island, faster MagSafe wireless charging, cinematic video mode, faster Wi-Fi 7 (versus the iPhone 16e’s Wi-Fi 6), and spatial photos.', 'Aside from price, the iPhone SE’s other major calling card was its smaller screen size. As smartphones get bigger and bigger, people with hands on the small side are left behind juggling a handheld device that doesn’t quite fit in their hand, at least not comfortably or ergonomically.', 'The iPhone SE 3’s screen measures 4.7 inches, and the case’s overall dimensions measure 5.45 by 2.65 inches, with a thickness of 0.29 inch. Next to the iPhone 16e’s 5.78 by 2.82 inches, and a thickness of 0.31 inch, it’s functionally identical. Not only that, but the iPhone 16e packs a much larger screen, at 6.1 inches.', 'All good, right? More screen for roughly the same overall size. But it’s not only the overall size of the device that frustrates folks with smaller hands. It’s also the reach across the screen to type and swipe their way through apps, and so that far larger screen on the iPhone 16e presents the same, familiar size problem as the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro do. Once again, there’s no iPhone option for people who value a smaller screen.', 'How do you like them Apples? Myself, I’m still trying to decide. The SE made a clear case for itself in the Apple lineup. It was quite different from the main lineup of iPhones and significantly cheaper. The iPhone 16e is neither.', 'It’s not budget enough to be a true successor to the SE, and it intrudes on the iPhone 16’s turf. The strongest case against the iPhone 16e is the iPhone 16 itself.', '', '', 'BY HALEY MILLER', 'BY SAMMI CARAMELA', 'BY SAMMI CARAMELA', 'BY SAMMI CARAMELA', 'BY SAMMI CARAMELA', 'BY SAMMI CARAMELA', 'By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from VICE Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.', 'BY SAMMI CARAMELA', 'BY MATT JANCER', 'BY MELANIE A.

There’s No Longer a Sub-$500 iPhone. Does It Matter?,https://www.wired.com/story/no-longer-an-iphone-under-500-does-it-matter/,"['If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED', ""Yesterday, the cheapest iPhone cost $429 if you wanted to buy directly from Apple. Today? It's $599. The new iPhone 16e replaced the iPhone SE, giving the aging device a much-needed cosmetic upgrade and power boost, but it comes at a cost. The overhaul is so big that the iPhone 16e is essentially a new class of device in Apple's smartphone lineup, hence the name change. (Apple didn't say what the “e” stands for.)"", ""Apple also took this opportunity to cut the $599 iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus from its roster, though it has kept the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, which cost more than the iPhone 16e. All of this effectively means Apple no longer sells an iPhone for less than $500. Does it matter? It might not make much of a difference in the United States, where most people purchase phones subsidized through carriers, and globally, there's a “premiumization” trend where consumers are opting for higher-end phones. First, let's dig into the details."", 'These are Apple’s two cheapest iPhones right now. The iPhone 16e has the more powerful A18 processor with access to Apple Intelligence, and the new Apple-designed C1 modem is supposedly so efficient that it enables better battery life than even the iPhone 16 despite the same 6.1-inch screen size. It also includes the same easy-to-replace battery mechanism.', ""But there are a few reasons to pay a bit more for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15. The screens are brighter, portrait photos might look better, and there's a spare ultrawide camera lens. Also, some camera features are available on the 15 series that aren't on the 16e, such as Cinematic and Action mode."", ""The iPhone 15 series also features Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, so you can access a wealth of MagSafe accessories, whereas the iPhone 16e is stuck on the slower and less energy-efficient Qi wireless charging standard. You'll have to make do with MagSafe cases that replicate the functionality, though it doesn't improve energy efficiency or charging speed. (Weirdly, maybe Apple should have followed Samsung's “Qi2 Ready” approach?)"", ""Then there's the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 15, which is baked into the floating selfie camera bar. It makes use of the camera cutout by letting you access live app activities, like seeing how far away an Uber is or quickly hopping back into the Maps app. This is unavailable on the iPhone 16e, which has a static notch like the original iPhone X."", ""Finally, the iPhone 15 also has the second-gen ultra-wideband (UWB) chip, whereas the iPhone 16e doesn't feature it at all—this is what enables you to precisely track the location of nearby AirTags. You can still track AirTags with the iPhone 16e, but the iPhone can't point out exactly where it is in your vicinity."", ""By and large, those are most of the differences between the phones. It's worth pointing out that the iPhone 16e is launching in fewer countries than other models—59 countries to be exact. Apple didn't share why, but it may have something to do with the new C1 modem, as carriers often need to certify them for use."", 'The pro move? Stick to a used iPhone 15 Pro, which you can find for roughly $600 these days on sites like Swappa in Good condition, even less if you buy a carrier version. It includes Apple Intelligence if you really want it, plus you get many more extra features.', ""The lack of a sub-$500 iPhone seems like a gaping hole in Apple's smartphone strategy, but Maurice Klaehne, a senior research analyst at Counterpoint Research, doesn't think it will affect consumers much, particularly in the US."", ""He says roughly 10 percent of iPhone sales in America come from Apple Stores, meaning the vast majority of the population purchases subsidized devices from carriers. While Apple may not directly sell older iPhones like the now-gone iPhone 14, these carriers still carry these devices that consumers can purchase for cheaper, not to mention the enticing promotions for newer devices. (Of course, these subsidized phones have caveats in that they're locked to a network. That's why we recommend unlocked phones as it doesn't force you into a contract and allow you to freely switch carriers.)"", ""Globally, there's far more choice in the sub-$500 smartphone category than there is in the US, especially from Chinese companies. However, Klaehne says there's a premiumization trend, where consumers are opting to shell out for higher-end devices, whether it's as a status symbol—Apple is an aspirational brand after all—or for more premium features. This is compounded by an apparent desire for smartphones with generative AI capabilities—a Counterpoint survey found that 59 percent of respondents were open to upgrading to a GenAI phone in 2025—and that number is even higher in the US with 67 percent."", ""“There's more of an interest now for these devices especially as we're getting away from generation one GenAI to AI agents that do more specific tasks for you and are able to be more integrated into your device,” he says."", 'Apple Intelligence Clean Up', ""It all comes back to artificial intelligence. There's a reason why Apple did not choose to use the iPhone SE branding but include “16” in the name of the iPhone 16e. Apple Intelligence was heavily tied to the launch of the iPhone 16, and naturally, people will expect those capabilities with the iPhone 16e."", ""While Apple Intelligence is free at the moment, Klaehne thinks it opens up a future where it could add to Apple's Services revenue stream—Google already offers a subscription tier for phones to access a more powerful model of its AI assistant (along with other perks), and an offering like that seems ripe for Apple and its Apple One plans. Getting capable AI-ready devices into people's hands now means a larger pool to pull subscription revenue from in the future."", ""But in the end, if you walk into an Apple Store hoping for a cheap, unlocked iPhone, you're out of luck. Instead, Apple will try to sway you into the iPhone 16e—it's $200 cheaper than the iPhone 16 after all.

The iPhone 16e Sets the Stage for a More Expensive iPhone 17,https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/the-iphone-16e-sets-the-stage-for-a-more-expensive-iphone-17,"[""At $599, Apple's iPhone 16e costs more than many (including me) anticipated. More importantly, it foreshadows a potential price increase for the iPhone 17 later this year."", '', ""We should have seen it coming. When Apple announced the iPhone 16e, many, including myself, were taken aback by its $599 starting price. Apple is pitching the iPhone 16e as a more affordable version of the $799 iPhone 16—which it is—but most of us had anticipated it to be a fourth-generation iPhone SE, which has historically been priced around $400. It's a classic case of rumors leading to mismanaged expectations."", 'That said, the iPhone 16e looks to be a notable step up from what we would expect from another iPhone SE, so the higher price makes sense. It also signals a potential price adjustment on the horizon.', ""Apple has been fairly consistent with iPhone pricing over the last several years. The iPhone 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 all share a $799 starting price, with the Plus and Pro models also carrying over their prices ($899 and $999, respectively) from generation to generation. The Pro Max is the only phone that's seen a recent price change: It increased from $1,099 for the 14 Pro Max to $1,199 for the 15 and 16 Pro Max, which, given some of the upgrades, felt fair."", ""The original iPhone SE was launched in 2016 with a starting price of $399. That was a steal compared with the iPhone 7, which launched in 2016 at $649. The second iPhone SE didn't arrive until 2020 but carried over the $399 price. It was a bargain compared with the iPhone 12, which started at $799. Two years later, the third-generation iPhone SE arrived at a slightly higher price of $429, but it was still significantly less than the $799 iPhone 13."", 'It\'s easy to see why the iPhone SE has become known as the ""budget"" or ""cheap"" iPhone. It\'s not as affordable as some of the cheapest phones on the market, but it traditionally costs about half as much as a standard iPhone.', ""Rumors about the fourth-generation iPhone SE started swirling around the internet more than a year ago. Many wondered if it would carry over the outdated design, the Home button with Touch ID, and the single-camera configuration of the third-gen model. It wasn't until after the iPhone 16 family launched that reports of a dramatic change for the budget-friendly iPhone started to appear. Over time, the picture became more clear. The iPhone SE 4, as it was being called, would adopt a more modern design with an all-screen front. It would lose the Home button and switch to Face ID. It would get a better camera, better radios, a faster processor, and better battery life."", ""You can't have all this improvement without driving the price up at least a little—even if it recycles an older design and shares the processor and camera components with the iPhone 16. I was hoping Apple's economies of scale would help keep the cost reasonable. I expected the price to go up, but not any further than $499."", ""Then again, the iPhone 16e is the first iPhone to have Apple's custom C1 modem, which the company spent billions of dollars developing. While Apple isn't looking to recoup all those R&D dollars in the iPhone 16e, it surely plays a role in the pricing."", ""The disappointment in the much higher price boils down to the point of view. Many believed Apple's next device would be an updated version of an existing product line, so it was logical to think that the price would remain in line with what preceded it. Instead, Apple approached it from the completely opposite direction. It started with something more expensive and retooled it to bring the cost down. This disconnect is why our collective eyes popped a little when Apple priced the iPhone 16e at $599."", ""So, is $599 a fair price? Well, it's not out of line, considering the feature set. Yes, it's basically a starter version of the iPhone 16, but it's also a significant upgrade compared with the 2022 iPhone SE. Moreover, it's priced near its top Android competition, including the $649 Samsung Galaxy S24 FE (a pared-back Galaxy S24) and the $499 Google Pixel 8a (an entry-level Pixel 8)."", ""The $599 price means Apple is focusing on driving up the average selling price of its iPhones. With no $429 option, we'll all collectively be paying more, on average, for our iPhones. Apple would have priced the iPhone 16e more aggressively if it wanted to steal market share from Google's Android platform. At $499, the iPhone 16e could have put midrange Android phones on serious notice, particularly in markets outside the US where people can't break down the cost over two or three years through their carrier."", ""Finally, consider this: The iPhone 16e's higher price sets the stage for more iPhone price increases later this year. For example, the latest rumor about the iPhone 17, expected in the fall, suggests it will undergo a massive redesign. Primarily, it will be thinner and have a fresh camera module, but we'll also see upgrades that mirror the 16e. This means the C1 modem is highly likely to be on board, as is a wholly new internal design with a different battery, an upgraded processor, and more. It wouldn't be completely out of left field for these major changes to come with an increase in price. (Let's not even get into what tariffs could mean for industry pricing altogether.)"", ""We'll get more indicators soon. Apple is widely expected to announce a new base model iPad and a refreshed version of the iPad Air as early as March or April. Some believe the base iPad will see a price jump of $100 from $349 to $449. Further, the iPad Air has maintained the same $599 starting price for several generations. If the new model shows up with a higher price, we can almost certainly consider a costlier iPhone 17 a lock."", 'Sign up for Fully Mobilized newsletter to get our top mobile tech stories delivered right to your inbox.', '', 'This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Apple’s iPhone 16 starts at $799.', 'Analysts said the mid-range pricing strategy and earlier-than-expected release reflects Apple’s effort to boost adoption in lower-end markets. The new handset replaces the SE series and is Apple’s first lower-price model since 2022.', '“The 16e is a big step up from the SE and aligns more closely with market demand in that upper mid-end segment but China is hyper competitive, especially in that price range,” Archie Zhang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm, told CNN.', 'In China, Apple’s second most-largest market, homegrown giant Huawei has made a stunning comeback after being pummeled by American sanctions since 2019. According to data from Canalys, a market research firm, Huawei overtook the Cupertino-based tech giant last year with 16% market share, compared to Apple’s 15%. In 2023, Apple was comfortably ahead with 19% market share, compared to Huawei’s 12%.', 'Last year, the iPhone maker introduced its Apple Intelligence, which has so far released its AI service to limited English-speaking markets, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Chinese tech giant Alibaba said last week that Apple had chosen to work with it in rolling out its AI features in China, though the release date remains unclear.', 'Besides the slow rollout of AI features and fierce competition from Chinese brands like Oppo, Huawei and Vivo, which often offer higher specs at lower prices, Apple also faces challenges like greater patriotism among Chinese consumers, according to Lori Chang, a senior analyst at market research company Isaiah Research.', 'Globally, Apple is increasingly facing an uphill battle in luring new customers. Its smartphone sales have declined since peaking in 2022, and its global shipment share has fallen from 19.3% in 2023 to 18.2% last year, according to Counterpoint Research.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nApple launches the iPhone 16e, a cheaper new version of the iPhone 16', 'On Tuesday, Huawei released its trifold smartphone, the Mate XT, in the Malaysian capital, marking one of its largest overseas smartphone launches since it was hit by export restrictions imposed by US President Donald Trump during his first term in 2019.', '“The significance of XT’s overseas launch is to show how far we could go,” a Huawei spokeswoman told CNN.', 'The world’s first commercial trifold phone, which folds around two hinges and expands like a tablet, was first launched at home in China in September, just hours after Apple introduced its iPhone 16. But its steep price tag, at $3,673 outside China, positions it as a luxury device.', 'Huawei’s high-profile outside China has symbolic importance as it’s another sign of its revival.

But its global phone sales plunged after Trump choked off its access to critical technologies like semiconductor chips in 2019.

What does the new iPhone naming system mean for how often this part of the iPhone series will be refreshed?', 'Apple iPhone 16e is almost here. Will there be an iPhone 17e next year?', 'According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter, the fact that Apple has put a number instead of the letters SE in the name could hint at annual updates. I don’t buy it and I’ll tell you why, but let’s explore the argument and what it will mean for consumers.', '“Then there’s the fact that Apple added a model number to the device, suggesting that the 16e will eventually give way to the 17e and 18e in an annual upgrade cycle. (The old brand was just called the iPhone SE for nearly 10 years.),” Gurman says.', 'Apple changes release schedules regularly, so it’s impossible to be certain, but I’d say this is very unlikely. The most affordable iPhone, when it was called the SE, swung between a two-year and three-year upgrade cycle, and I’d expect that to be the case here, too.', 'It’s worth noting that, as Gurman points out, though the 16e is the most affordable iPhone, it’s not a budget option any more, costing $170 more than the last iPhone SE.', '“Rather than a truly cheap iPhone, the new model is more of a slightly downscale version of Apple’s flagship lineup. For $200 less than a regular iPhone 16, you get most of the features — but not all,” he says.', 'Forbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.', '', '', '', 'Which could theoretically lead to a more frequent renewal. Here’s why I think that’s wrong.', 'This fall, Apple will launch its iPhone 17 series and almost certainly will retire the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. The range will consist of the new iPhone 17 models, plus the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus at lower prices, and perhaps the iPhone 15.', 'The iPhone 16e will continue in the range, for certain, and at the same price, I would have thought. Though we are in new territory here, so it’s hard to be certain.', 'But next spring, the thought that the iPhone 16e will be replaced by the iPhone 17e seems fanciful to me. I believe it will stay for the launch of the iPhone 18 series in 2027 at least, and possibly until 2028, when it could be replaced by something called the iPhone 18e.', 'Gurman doesn’t think the annual upgrade is a shoo-in. “I’d bet Apple is waiting on early buyer data to decide whether to continue the line or not. As of now, I’d assume it’s not a yearly release,” he says. I agree with the lack of annual release, though I’d bet Apple has made up its mind and will not release an iPhone 17e next year.', 'One Community. Many Voices.

It features a much-improved Fusion camera, longer battery life, the Action Button, and even the latest A18 chip—the same chip we praised in our iPhone 16 Plus review.', 'While the A18 was primarily introduced to support Apple Intelligence—a feature I still find extremely underwhelming—it’s great to have Apple’s latest SoC, which means it will get years of proper support.', 'I’d even say the iPhone 16e has the best-looking back of any iPhone yet. It has a clean, minimalist design that stands out. And since I don’t mind the notch much, I’m completely sold on how it looks. It definitely seemed like a good deal at $599 at first glance, even if I was hoping the price would be a bit lower.', 'But then I started noticing some things. Several nice-to-have features, like Precision Finding and MagSafe, are completely missing. But what concerns me the most isn’t their absence—it’s Apple’s new C1 chip.', 'If you haven’t heard of the C1 chip, I don’t blame you—even Apple barely mentioned it in its press release. It’s Apple’s first in-house modem—the part of the phone responsible for cellular connectivity—and it debuts with the iPhone 16e. However, I already have some concerns.', 'For starters, the iPhone 16e lacks mmWave 5G, which enables much faster cellular speeds in areas that support it. I’m also a bit concerned about carrier support in different regions.', 'While major providers like Verizon will likely work fine in larger U.S. cities, if you live in a more remote area or rely on a less popular carrier, I’d be cautious about cellular performance when thinking about pre-ordering.', 'Dropped calls, inconsistent signal strength, and spotty data speeds can make even the best smartphone feel unreliable. That’s why I’m a bit wary of the C1 chip—since it’s Apple’s first in-house modem, it hasn’t been tested in the wild yet.', ""Until we see real-world performance from everyday users, we can't really know how well it holds up. Apple has a solid track record with chip design, but modems are a completely different challenge, and there's a reason it has taken this long for Apple to make one."", ""You won't miss out on much if you get the standard iPhone 16 variants."", 'So, if you’re considering the iPhone 16e, I’d caution you to wait a month or two for proper reviews before committing to a purchase.

This Week: Apple Gets Its Own Cellular Modem to Market,https://www.eetimes.com/this-week-apple-gets-its-own-cellular-modem-to-market/,"['This week, a significant piece of news was the launch by Apple of its iPhone 16e, which features the first cellular modem designed by Apple, the C1. Other news we saw but did not manage to cover includes the launch of the Ambient IoT Alliance, as well as the $21.5 million funding for former Intel CPU architects’ RISC-V startup AheadComputing.', 'In its announcement, Apple said the C1 is designed from the ground up, from silicon to the radio systems to the firmware and software, to deliver “robust cellular connectivity, great performance” and power-efficiency.” The C1 baseband is built using a 4-nm process technology, the transceiver is built using 7-nm transistors and the product features custom Apple-designed accelerators to run the full stack of its baseband firmware and software.', 'This news is significant because Apple is evolving to develop more of its own fully integrated silicon and software, and the C1 is a way of getting this to market through one of its lower-end phones. What does this mean? Since it is tightly integrated with its A18 chip, the C1 can use information from A18 to prioritize what data to send to help optimize overall cellular performance.', 'The integration and power efficiency translates to Apple being able to claim that it provides the best battery life ever in a 6.1 inch iPhone, and the smaller C1 helps optimize its internal design for battery size. While the C1 modem’s promotion says it also allows the phone to quickly and seamlessly connect to the internet by communicating with cell towers and satellite networks, as well as provide GPS and location capabilities, the modem does not support mmWave networks. The company added that the C1 transceiver is the first in the world to be built using 7-nm transistors.', 'Meanwhile, a press release announced the Ambient IoT Alliance, stating it was a cross-industry coalition driving the next era of IoT, in that its aim is to support IoT devices harvesting energy from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 5G. This would enable “billions of always-connected devices without batteries or wired power,” according to prepared remarks.', 'The founding members are, in alphabetical order, Atmosic, Infineon Technologies, Intel, Pepsico, Qualcomm, VusionGroup and Wiliot. A minimal website lists the mission statement, logos with the press release and adds, “We are not able to accept new members yet.” The Alliance’s mission is to promote and support the development of an open, harmonized and aligned multi-standard ecosystem.', 'The announcement highlights that ambient IoT represents an evolution of IoT with more and more everyday battery-less things being interconnected, detecting location, temperature, humidity and more, as well as communicating with the wireless infrastructure. A nearby mobile device, as well as wireless access points, domestic appliances or other standard gateways, can receive the data generated by ambient IoT-enabled devices (if using a compatible standard).', 'The alliance adds that ambient IoT and AI are symbiotic technologies, each unlocking the promise of the other. The simultaneous rise of ambient IoT and AI will give businesses and consumers “unprecedented” understanding of the world around them. The alliance said that its members are focused on the next generation of ambient IoT standards for battery-free, low-cost technologies to connect products and assets, which can also improve AI services in the cloud.', 'The alliance also emphasized that it is not intended to replace standardization activities in other organizations, but may contribute documentation, support, use cases and more while at the same time advocating, promoting and increasing awareness of ambient IoT standards, solutions and interoperability.', 'Venture capital firm Eclipse announced a $21.5 million seed funding round in one of its investee companies, AheadComputing. The startup was formed last summer by former Intel CPU architects Debbie Marr, Jonathan Pearce, Mark Dechene and Srikanth Srinivasan.', 'In a blog posted by CEO Debbie Marr earlier this month, she said, “The current computing ecosystem is in disarray; the industry is undergoing a major transformation, fueled by emerging market leaders and disruptive technologies. As the founders of AheadComputing, we see chaos as an opportunity and believe our team possesses unique expertise to help create a new and improved ecosystem for the future. AheadComputing is joining the RISC-V ecosystem. The opportunity exists today to enhance per-core performance, which we consider the cornerstone of multi-processor system efficiency.”', 'As a former Intel veteran, she talks in the blog about where Intel missed the opportunities for CPU supremacy, where AMD has not taken the mantle effectively and how Arm’s success could be jeopardized by rumors that it might shift from licensing IP to manufacturing and selling its own chips.', '“We anticipate that the Arm ecosystem will experience considerable strain in the coming years. If Arm’s current customers are pressured excessively, they will consider transitioning to an alternative architecture like RISC-V,” she added.', 'The $21.5 million seed funding this week in AheadComputing will be used to develop and commercialize its “breakthrough microprocessor architecture designed to meet the new, unique computing demands across HPC, AI, cloud and edge devices,” according to Eclipse.', '', 'Nitin Dahad is editor-in-chief of EE Times.

But, the C1 lacks 5G mmWave connectivity and isn't built for Wi-Fi 7."", 'February 21, 2025', ""Of the new features baked into the iPhone 16e, the standout is a hardware upgrade in the form of Apple's first 5G modem, the Apple C1 cellular modem."", ""The launch of the modem makes Apple less reliant on Qualcomm's chips, noted Reuters. Apple's in-house modem has been a long time coming, with reports the company was working toward building its own cellular modems dating back to 2019."", ""At the time, Apple announced plans to open an office in San Diego and hire up to 1,000 employees. This was noteworthy considering San Diego is Qualcomm's headquarters and home to part of Intel's Mobile and Communications Group, which meant Apple was likely interested in luring Qualcomm and Intel engineers for its modem design."", ""In 2019, Apple was also in the midst of a legal battle with Qualcomm, arguing that Qualcomm charges too much for licenses to its wireless patents, which was partly the reason for Apple's switch to Intel as its iPhone wireless modem supplier. But, Apple ultimately settled with Qualcomm, forgoing Intel, and said it would use Qualcomm chips in its iPhones."", ""A closer look at Apple's in-house modem"", ""Beginning with its launch in the iPhone 16e, Apple told Reuters that it plans to use the C1 chips across its product line in the coming years. Apple also said the C1 system is responsible for the best battery life of any of the company's 6.1 inch smartphones."", 'Related:Huawei tri-fold phone expansion coincides with farewell to iPhone SE', 'Yet, it\'s a challenge to test whether the new modem is as energy efficient as Apple claims. ""We will never *really* know if the modems draw less power as Apple has the entire stack as one can\'t actually test this without some very specific design knowledge and some sophisticated test equipment,"" said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy, in a LinkedIn post.', '""No surprise Apple would pop a modem out at some point, more surprised it took over 5 years with ""billions invested"" after acquiring Intel\'s 5G modem business,"" Moorhead added.', ""The C1 system also only supports Wi-Fi 6 (login required), whereas the iPhone 16 is Wi-Fi 7 enabled. The system includes a 4-nanometer chip and 7-nanonmeter transceiver, and the chips were tested with 180 carriers in 55 countries, according to Reuters. The modem also has a custom GPS system and satellite connectivity for when terrestrial wireless networks are unavailable. It's worth noting the chips can't connect to 5G mmWave, a capability that Qualcomm chips have."", 'Apple\'s in-house chip raises a number of connectivity concerns.

The iPhone 16e is no cheap phone. By the way, the iPhone 15 is still available directly from Apple for $699, which gets you an ultrawide camera, MagSafe and Dynamic Island capabilities.', 'While most of the coverage deems the 16e as “Apple’s affordable iPhone,” that term is relative only to the rest of the iPhone 16 series. This begs the question…', 'Older iPhone SE users? Compact phone users (RIP iPhone mini)? The “I just want an iPhone” crowd? We’re not so sure ourselves. Apple is asking premium money for what is essentially a device entirely made with recycled parts from previous generations of iPhones.', ""Yes, the A18 chip is fairly new, though it's not the exact one used in the iPhone 16 series phones. But at least the 16e boasts a custom 5G modem."", 'After years of speculation and reports of completely abandoning its in-house modem plans, the stars finally aligned for Apple. The 16e is the first Apple device with an in-house 5G modem and it will lay the foundation for a future of less reliance on Qualcomm.', 'The hefty $1 billion acquisition of Intel’s modem business may be finally justified if the 16e performs up to par, which remains to be seen.', 'It’s been a part of every new iPhone (sans the SE models) for the last five years but Apple chose to omit its MagSafe charging and accessory system even though the 16e is reusing the iPhone 14’s body.', 'Apple confirmed that its new C1 modem is not interfering so we can only see this as just another cost-cutting measure. At least the OLED display, FaceID and Action Button made their way.', 'We cannot help but draw parallels between the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 5c. When Apple launched the iPhone 5c back in 2013, we got some of the most unique and fun colors on an iPhone to date.', 'We feel like Cupertino could have applied that same approach with the 16e to boost its appeal, but the only way you’d be able to add some pop is by slapping on a case.', 'The binned A18 chip, paired with the 6.1-inch OLED screen (60Hz) and that new C1 modem, should deliver some mighty battery endurance. Apple is already promising “the best battery life in an iPhone this size” on the 16e’s official page.', 'While we don’t have an actual battery capacity to go with, we can only use Apple’s video playback claims, which promise 26 hours on the 16e compared to 22 hours on the iPhone 16.

Will Apple Release an iPhone 17e? Here's What We Know,https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/will-apple-release-iphone-17e/,"[""Apple's unveiling on Wednesday of the iPhone 16e, which replaced the iPhone SE line, marked a strategic shift in the company's flagship smartphone lineup. Starting at $599, the iPhone 16e offers a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, and a USB-C port, positioning it as a more affordable alternative within the iPhone 16 family. Does that mean we should expect an iPhone 17e to be added to the upcoming iPhone 17 series?"", ""Apple's iPhone 17 lineup is expected to feature four models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and a new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air that replaces the existing Plus model. The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a significantly thinner design with an aluminum chassis and a 6.6-inch display, aiming to offer a balance between portability and performance."", 'Given this lineup, it\'s unclear whether Apple will continue the ""e"" series with an iPhone 17e. Indeed, as of now, there are no specific rumors or reports suggesting that Apple will release an iPhone 17e this year or next. The introduction of the iPhone 17 Air may represent Apple\'s approach to providing a mid-tier option, potentially replacing the need for an ""e"" variant. However, without official confirmation or credible leaks, the existence of an iPhone 17e remains speculative.', 'One possibility is that Apple releases an iPhone 17e next year around the same February window, using the model\'s launch as a way to reinvigorate its flagship lineup mid-cycle. Apple could choose to do this each year. It\'s a more exciting strategy than simply offering new iPhone colors in the spring, which Apple has done in the past. Alternatively, it may opt to release ""e"" series iPhone models based on a non-linear roadmap, similar to the iPhone SE. The first-generation iPhone SE was released on March 2016, while the second-generation model arrived in April 2020, and the third-generation iPhone SE came in March 2022.', 'As Apple continues to evolve its iPhone strategy, the success of the iPhone 16e in the coming months may ultimately determine whether we\'ll see future ""e"" variants alongside the main iPhone lineup.

"Great cameras, not Apple Intelligence, is what people want from an iPhone 16e",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/great-cameras-not-apple-intelligence-is-what-people-want-from-an-iphone-16e-130041307.html,"[""After much anticipation, Apple finally announced the iPhone 16e yesterday. Looking at its position in the company's lineup, the 16e is a headscratcher. My colleague Ian Carlos Campbell already wrote about how strange it is that the phone is missing MagSafe, a feature universally loved by Apple users. However, the omission that stands out the most to me is that the iPhone 16e doesn't come with more than a single rear camera, and no, 2x telephoto cropping doesn't count."", ""Sure, if you put the 16e against its predecessor, the 2022 iPhone SE, it’s not a surprising omission — but when you consider today's broader smartphone market, it's a glaring weakness. At $599, the 16e is $100 more than the Pixel 8a, a device with two amazing rear cameras and an AI-capable processor (more on that in a moment). The 8a is also frequently on sale for as little as $399. Some people hate the Pixel comparison, so I'll give you another one. Last spring, Nothing released the $349 Phone 2a. Like the 8a, it has two rear cameras. Oh, and a fresh design that's not borrowed from 2020. At almost $200 more than the phone it replaces, the 16e is very much not a midrange device."", ""I know what you're thinking: what's wrong with one camera, as long as that camera is great? In the case of the 16e, I think the problem is that Apple is misreading the market and what people want from their next phone. All consumer devices are a compromise in some way. Those become more pronounced as you move down the market."", 'For most people, their phone is their primary camera and how they document their lives and memories. Think about what was the first thing you tested when you upgraded to your current phone. I bet it was the cameras. In that context, more are better, because they make it easier to capture moments that are important to you.', 'For a device some outlets are describing as ""low-end,"" the iPhone 16e features a state-of-the-art chip. It might be cut down with one less GPU core, but the 16e\'s A18 is still a 3nm chip with 8GB of RAM to support the processor. Apple clearly felt the A18 was necessary to get its AI suite running on the 16e. But that means the rest of the phone had to suffer as a result, starting with the camera package.', ""I don't know about you, but if I were in the market for a new phone, I would want the most bang for my buck. The SE line had its share of drawbacks, including a dated design and a lackluster screen, but at $429, they made sense. For all its faults, the SE still felt like a bargain in 2022 because you were getting a modern chip, access to iOS and all the great apps that come with it and Apple's excellent track record of software support. With the iPhone 16e, you're not saving nearly as much off the price of a regular iPhone. Yes, everything I said about the SE's strengths is still true of the 16e and it even builds on that phone with additions like a better battery and an OLED screen, but the smartphone market has evolved so much in the last three years."", ""Again, I know people hate the Pixel comparison, but the 8a makes far fewer compromises. Not only does it feature a more versatile camera system, but it also comes with a high refresh rate OLED. The 8a's Tensor G3 chip is also fully capable of running Google's latest AI features."", ""I know offering the best hardware features for the price has never been Apple's approach, but that approach only made sense when the company had the best software experience. We can all agree Apple Intelligence has not met its usual quality standards. Just look at notification summaries, one of the main selling points of Apple Intelligence. Apple recently paused all news and entertainment alerts generated by the system to address their poor quality."", 'Right now, Apple Intelligence is not a compelling reason to buy a new iPhone, and its inclusion on the 16e at the expense of other features feels, at best, a cynical attempt to boost adoption numbers. If the 16e was $100 cheaper, maybe I would be less critical, but right now it feels like Apple missed the mark.']"

As a point of reference, the iPhone 16e has identical dimensions to the iPhone 14."", ""The iPhone 16e is also slightly lighter at 5.88 ounces compared to the iPhone 16's six ounces, though the difference is likely imperceivable."", ""One of the biggest visible differences is the iPhone 16e's display notch, whereas the iPhone 16 comes with Apple's Dynamic Island. While not a dealbreaker, the notch leaves you without the Dynamic Island's useful functionality. It also dates the iPhone 16e's design to 2017, when the notch was first introduced with the iPhone X."", ""Another tell is the iPhone 16e's single camera on the rear compared to the iPhone 16's dual camera."", 'The iPhone 16e is only available in white and black, whereas the standard iPhone 16 colors include Ultramarine, Teal, and Pink, alongside white and black. Both models have matte exterior textures.', ""Both the iPhone 16e and iPhone 16 run on Apple's A18 processor, but there's a minor difference.

The iPhone 16 can also dim down to one nit for a more comfortable experience in the dark."", 'Despite the brightness differences, the iPhone 16e should still offer a comfortable experience in bright and dark conditions, based on our experience with previous models like the iPhone 14 with similar brightness levels.', ""The iPhone 16e also sports Apple's first-generation Ceramic Shield glass panel, whereas the iPhone 16 uses the latest generation model, which the company claims is 50% tougher. Despite the generational advancement, we recommend equipping either phone with a protective film, as none of the best phones are impervious to display damage. See our guides to the best iPhone 16e screen protectors and best iPhone 16 screen protectors."", ""The iPhone 16e single-camera system lacks the iPhone 16's ultrawide camera, and it doesn't include macro photography."", ""The iPhone 16 is also a better option if you take lots of portrait shots thanks to its next-generation portrait mode. It includes focus and depth control, whereas the iPhone 16e's portrait mode only supports depth control."", ""The iPhone 16e also doesn't support Apple's latest-generation Photographic Styles (basically high-quality filters), which means you can't add or adjust a Photographic Style to a photo that's already been taken."", 'Still, the iPhone 16e features a similarly high-resolution 48MP camera as the iPhone 16. Thanks to cropping the center 12MP of the sensor, both phones can take optical-quality 2x zoom photos.', ""While capable of the same 4K video recording up to 60 frames-per-second (fps) as the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e omits advanced video recording features. There are no Cinematic or Action modes, no Spatial recording for viewing on Apple's Vision Pro AR headset, and no macro video recording. It also uses more basic optical image stabilization compared to the iPhone 16's advanced sensor-shift optical image stabilization."", ""Unlike the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e doesn't support the fastest 5G networks, also known as mmWave 5G, offered by T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. However, the iPhone 16e supports low- and mid-band 5G networks, which can be enough for most people — these networks can easily handle most common data loads, like video and music streaming, and scrolling through high-resolution photos in social media apps."", ""With that said, if you're paying for a plan that includes high-band 5G connectivity, like those in our best cell phone plans guide, you're not going to get your money's worth with the iPhone 16e.

They include Mint Mobile, Visible, Tello, and US Mobile."", 'We haven\'t tested Apple\'s claim that the iPhone 16e has the ""best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch phone,"" but the company has shown that its battery life claims deserve credibility.', 'The iPhone 16 already has the best score for a 6.1-inch phone (65%) after finishing our battery test, so we expect an even better result with the iPhone 16e, which would be astounding. For more information, see our guide to the best phone for battery life.', 'The iPhone 16e has the same USB-C port for charging and USB 2 data transfers as the iPhone 16, and Apple touts the same charging speed (50% charge in 30 minutes with a 20W charger).', ""The iPhone 16e supports Qi wireless charging, which is typically under 10W and rather slow. The iPhone 16e doesn't support Apple's MagSafe wireless charging for faster charging up to 25W, which is utterly confounding. Nor does it support other MagSafe accessories."", 'A case that includes ""MagSafe-compatible"" magnets can overcome the iPhone 16e\'s lack of MagSafe support.

It's essentially a shortcut button to various preset functions, like toggling the flashlight or enabling a Focus mode. The Shortcuts app allows you to customize its functions, which can be incredibly useful if you manage to figure out the app itself."", 'However, only the iPhone 16 comes with the Camera Control button — a shortcut button to the Camera app that also supports light presses and swipes for finer controls for zooming, exposure, depth, and switching Photographic Styles and Tones.', ""The Camera Control button is nice to have, but it's not a reason on its own to upgrade to the iPhone 16."", ""The iPhone 16e has the same performance and longevity potential as the iPhone 16, making it an incredibly powerful and reasonably-priced phone you could keep for six years or more (based on Apple's usual support window for iOS and security updates)."", ""Since the iPhone 16e's lack of MagSafe support can be mitigated by a magnetic case (though at slower wireless charging rates), the choice really boils down to your budget, whether you value an ultrawide camera or the Dynamic Island, and whether your plan includes access to the fastest 5G networks."", ""In short, the iPhone 16e is a better pairing with economical phone plans that don't include high-band 5G. However, those who value an ultrawide camera will prefer the iPhone 16, regardless of high-band 5G connectivity."", ""The iPhone 16e can also be a more suitable option than the iPhone 16 for parents who shudder at the thought of spending $800 on a kids' phone. You're getting the performance and support longevity of the current A18 processor for a lower price than a current or previous-generation premium flagship phone."", ""If you want a more high-end experience complete with an ultrawide camera for less than the iPhone 16, whether or not your plan includes high-band 5G access, the iPhone 15 is worth considering.

The new phone comes out Friday, Feb. 28, and perhaps its biggest selling point is the sub-$600 starting price, which makes it $200 less than the iPhone 16. The iPhone 16E has many of the more expensive device's best features, like an A18 chip, a 48-megapixel main camera, iOS 18, Apple Intelligence and access to Apple services like Facetime, iMessage and Emergency SOS via Satellite."", 'What more could you want, right?', ""Well, as with other affordable phones, compromises were made to get to that lower price. These omissions tell you a lot about what Apple values -- like Apple Intelligence, for example. I've reviewed more budget phones than I can count, and the best ones always offer far more than just their low sticker price. It's a pleasant surprise when a company like Motorola, OnePlus or Google nails the balance of what to keep and what to omit. So how did Apple do?"", ""I'll save my thoughts until I can test and review the iPhone 16E. For now, though, let's take a look at the features you don't get on the iPhone 16E."", ""MagSafe has become a popular aspect of being an iPhone owner, and it's wild that the iPhone 16E doesn't have it. MagSafe debuted in 2020 on the iPhone 12 and uses magnets inside the phone to help it wirelessly charge by ensuring it's in the optimum position. The magnets have an added benefit because they let you attach magnetic accessories to your iPhone, like a wallet or battery pack, as well as secure your phone to mounts, like one in a car."", ""The iPhone 16's MagSafe supports 25-watt wireless charging speeds. But the iPhone 16E only supports 7.5W wireless charging, the original Qi standard -- not even Qi2 speeds of 15W."", ""The iPhone 16E has something of a rarity in 2025: a single rear camera. But as I've said before, in other stories and reviews, I'd rather have one really good camera than the two or three mediocre ones that can often be found on sub-$300 phones. The 16E's main camera has a 48-megapixel sensor, which has enough resolution for sensor cropping to offer a 2x magnification -- not quite the same as having a second camera, but close."", ""Sensor cropping can't replace having a dedicated ultrawide camera, which on the iPhone 16 doubles as a macro camera, letting you focus on close-up subjects, like for food photos."", 'The iPhone 16E weighs 167 grams, making it 3 grams lighter than the 170-gram iPhone 16. Hey, not all omissions are bad.', 'The iPhone 16E has a screen notch.', ""The iPhone 16E brings back the screen notch, a cutout at the top of the screen that houses the phone's selfie camera and FaceID technology. But it lacks the Dynamic Island cutout, which is a smaller, oval-shaped hole at the top of the display on the iPhone 16. Apple uses the screen space around the Dynamic Island cutout to show system alerts as well as background tasks, like when music is playing. Obviously the 16E's lack of a Dynamic Island won't prevent it from showing alerts, but it's still missing out on a clever software interface."", ""The C1 modem is Apple's first in-house 5G modem."", ""In its launch video, Apple proudly pointed out that the iPhone 16E has an in-house designed 5G modem called C1. The new Apple modem forgoes the Qualcomm 5G modems used in other iPhone models. Designing its own modem allows Apple to tailor the device for its phones. The new modem helps extend the iPhone 16E's battery life, which Apple says is longer than it is with other iPhone 16 models."", ""But the C1 modem has one wrinkle: It doesn't support 5G mmWave (or ultra-wideband), which is the very fast flavor of 5G that you might experience in parts of some cities or at a stadium for an event."", 'The iPhone 16E comes in black or white.', 'When the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus launched, one of the best aspects was that they came in colors like ultramarine, teal and pink. The iPhone 16E comes in only black or white.', ""One of the iPhone 16E's biggest features is that, like the iPhone 16, it has the A18 chip and can run Apple Intelligence. But the chip isn't exactly the same. The iPhone 16's A18 chip has five GPU cores, while the 16E's has only four. So, what does that mean exactly? Well, the good news is that the difference likely won't have a noticeable effect on daily use with the iPhone 16E. But if you're someone who plays graphics-intensive games for hours on end, the iPhone 16 could have a slight edge."", ""Here's the pop-up menu (top right) that appears as you're using the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16."", ""Apple's omission of the Camera Control button, which also triggers Visual Intelligence searches, makes sense, since the 16E has only a single camera. Those people who are likely to use a Camera Control button are probably going to get an iPhone 16 or 16 Pro, because those models have more cameras. Apple also smartly enabled the 16E's Action button to start a Visual Intelligence search."", ""The iPhone 16E lacks Apple's ultra-wideband chip, meaning you won't be able to use the Precision Tracking feature in Find My for AirTags. The phone supports Wi-Fi 6 but not the newer 6E or 7 standards. Wi-Fi 6 speeds are good, but as more Wi-Fi 7 routers come out, the 16E won't be able to take advantage of faster peak speeds. The 16E also lacks support for Thread radio and won't be able to directly connect to some smart home devices with a built-in Thread border router."", ""The iPhone 16E's Camera app doesn't have:"", ""The iPhone 16E has Photographic Styles, but not the newer ones that debuted on the iPhone 16 series. The 16E can take Portrait mode photos, but it lacks the ability to change focus after the fact like on the iPhone 16.

I'm talking about something most people don't care about — the modem."", ""The 16e is the first iPhone that uses Apple's new in-house C1 5G modem, which the company developed after a lot of expensive R&D and buying out Intel's 5G business. It's a modem that doesn't match up very well with Qualcomm's, at least on paper."", ""This is a bigger deal than you might think because Apple's C1 has no support for millimeter-wave 5G frequencies. That means two things — it will never get the hyper-fast 5G speeds we were promised and you might have seen yourself, and the network coverage in many places will be sub-par or fallback to LTE (4G)."", ""This is because most of the technology to power a millimeter-wave modem is from Qualcomm. The company invented or re-invented it and marketed it in a way that it has become almost mandatory in North America. A lot of network tech is Qualcomm's and I imagine Apple has liscensed a good bit of it for its in-house offering, but it either declined to pay for better millimeter-wave support or Qualcomm is unwilling to license it at a cost Apple finds fair."", '', ""I have no special affinity for Apple products but I don't like what I'm seeing here. On one hand, you might think that this proves Apple doesn't need Qualcomm so other manufacturers might not need the company, either. That's true if you're OK with a sub-par product with missing features found in many devices at all price ranges."", ""What I see is that even Apple, a company with more than enough resources to do almost anything it imagines, couldn't break the grip Qualcomm has in North America."", 'We have no details about the process or licensing agreements (and probably never will) so we don\'t know exactly why Apple decided to forgo millimeter-wave 5G but I\'m sure it\'s a decision that wasn\'t made lightly. Apple does not want its ""budget"" phone to be worse than a $300 OnePlus Nord when it comes to network performance, but it will in places like New York or Chicago.', 'Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android', ""Apple says it has plans to expand the C1's usage to other models in its lineup. I'm betting it will find a way to integrate millimeter-wave technology before that happens."", ""What I know for sure is that Apple and Qualcomm have a long-standing love-hate relationship and this almost certainly factored its way into the decision-making process. Qualcomm does have competitors like Samsung and its Exynos 5G modems and there is more to a cellular modem than millimeter-wave support. There's also no denying that Qualcomm does it better.

On the other hand, it’s a bit odd that this thing exists at all. It’s missing a couple of the best things about the iPhone ecosystem — MagSafe, multiple cameras — and if you’re already spending $600 on a phone, it’s not clear that another $200 is a particularly huge deal.

Here’s how it works.', 'The iPhone 16e is official. Following months of rumors, Apple announced its new budget smartphone on February 19, and the feature-packed device (which we thought might be called the iPhone SE 4) looks set to rank among the best cheap phones released in 2025.', 'The iPhone 16e replaces both the iPhone SE (2022) and the iPhone 14 in Apple’s iPhone lineup, and as such brings several meaningful upgrades over its now-outdated predecessors.', 'We’re reacting to the phone’s announcement in our iPhone 16e live blog, but below, we’ve rounded up five things you need to know about the iPhone 16e – from its price and availability to its display, chipset, and software upgrades.', '', 'The first thing to note about the iPhone 16e is its name. All previous generations of the iPhone SE have been marketed as separate from their respective mainline counterparts – the iPhone SE (2022), for instance, was considered entirely separate from the then-flagship iPhone 13 line – but the iPhone 16e is being positioned as part of the main iPhone 16 family.', ""In Apple terms, SE stood for 'Special Edition,' and the three SE models released prior to the iPhone 16e arrived at inconsistent intervals (2016, 2020, and 2022). The switch to a new naming convention – specifically ‘[generation number]e’ – could allow Apple to release a budget-friendly iPhone every year, similar to how Samsung releases lower-spec 'FE' versions of its flagship Galaxy devices every year."", 'Of course, ‘iPhone 16e’ also sounds more premium than ‘iPhone SE (2025)’ or ‘iPhone SE 4’, so the move could simply be Apple trying to boost the appeal of what is, essentially, its new entry-level iPhone.', '', 'The first hardware upgrade to note about the iPhone 16e is its screen size. Where the iPhone SE (2022) used a 4.7-inch LCD panel, the iPhone 16e boasts a comparatively huge 6.1-inch OLED display, which brings the SE series in line with Apple’s base-model iPhones and, incidentally, the Google Pixel 8a (so long, small phones). It’s stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate, but again, so are Apple’s base-model iPhones.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', 'The move to a more modern display size also means the omission of a physical Home button on the iPhone 16e. There are no Touch ID capabilities to speak of here – it’s Face ID or nothing, the components for which are tucked away in a visible notch at the top of the iPhone 16e’s display.', 'Visually, then, the iPhone 16e looks a lot like the now-discontinued iPhone 14, but the newer phone does benefit from an Action button (first introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro) and a more powerful (albeit solitary) main camera – more on this below.', '', 'Let’s talk about that camera. The iPhone 16e gets a single, 48MP wide lens on the back, which is complemented by a 12MP selfie camera on the front.', ""Being a lower-spec iPhone, we’re not surprised to see Apple stick with a single-lens rear setup for its latest budget-friendly model. In fact, the phone’s 48MP main camera is the same as the one you’ll find on the regular iPhone 16 – it's Apple's 'Fusion' lens, which features an integrated 2x telephoto that lets you zoom in with optical quality."", 'Considering that the iPhone SE (2022) used a 12MP main camera, the iPhone 16e’s 48MP lens marks quite the step up, though you’ll still miss out on a dedicated telephoto and ultra-wide lens by going for Apple’s new model. Camera Control, too, remains exclusive to the rest of the iPhone 16 line.', '', 'Under the hood, the iPhone 16e is leagues ahead of the iPhone SE (2022) and indeed many other iPhones released since then.', 'The device is equipped with an A18 chip, which is the same chipset inside the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, and Apple has also included a larger, longer-lasting battery in the iPhone 16e versus the 2022 iPhone SE. We don’t have specifics yet, but given that the standard iPhone 16 managed 15 to 16 hours of screen-on time during our testing, we’d expect the iPhone 16e to deliver similar levels of endurance (Apple is quoting up to 26 hours of video playback, which is certainly an improvement).', ""Other internal upgrades for the iPhone 16e include the first-ever Apple-made 5G modem, the C1.

Previously, the company’s AI feature suite was reserved for owners of the very best iPhones – think the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, and iPhone 16 Pro – but now, software tools like Clean Up, Notification Summaries, and the redesigned Siri are much more accessible, given the iPhone 16e’s less-than-flagship price (more on this below).', '', 'Now for the big question: how much does the iPhone 16e cost?

Here’s how it works.', ""For the longest time I was excited about the release of the iPhone 16e, or as it was originally named, the iPhone SE 4. Well, Apple finally revealed the device in all its glory, and I don't think I'll be upgrading from my iPhone 15 Pro Max anytime soon."", ""First, a bit of quick history if you have no idea what I'm talking about. For the longest time, Apple kept to only making iPhones sequentially. However, Apple eventually realized there was a market for an affordable option and started the SE series in 2016, with the last being the iPhone SE (2022)."", ""The next in line was the rumored iPhone SE 2024, and there was a lot of buzz about the phone. However, when it was finally announced it was clear that Apple had fully dropped the SE name, something that was speculated by several sources. In theory, the phone should still follow the iPhone SE format, so that means I should like it, but I just really don't."", ""So what is the reason for this general dislike, is it just a lack of features or is it something more? well, let's delve into the phone to see why this is the least excited I've been for a phone in a while."", '', ""Now, it wouldn't be fair to just start hating on the phone without first acknowledging what Apple has done right. Firstly, there’s no doubt that the iPhone 16e has some great features, mainly the inclusion of more RAM. I have said it before, and I will say it again: Apple has constantly hindered itself by limiting the RAM in the iPhone."", ""With that said, Apple's iPhones still manage impressive GeekBench scores, and usually easily outpace many of the best phones including the ones with up to 24GB of RAM. However, the lack of RAM produced one major issue for the iPhone, primarily Apple Intelligence. The problem is that a device needs at least 8GB of RAM to make use of Apple's AI, which means that any phone older than the iPhone 15 Pro loses access to the feature."", ""So it wasn't a surprise to see that Apple launched the iPhone 16e with 8GB of RAM, as well as full Apple Intelligence support. I honestly expected Apple to hold back on at least some features for the new phone, but it seems everything is on the table. This is great news for consumers, especially for those looking to explore Apple Intelligence for $100 less than it costs to buy a new iPhone 16."", '', 'However, that isn\'t to say that the iPhone 16e has everything, in truth, a lot is missing from the phone. Firstly, while it is cheaper, it is not a lot cheaper and the lower cost is a bit of a wooden horse in my eyes. Here\'s the thing: yes the iPhone 16e is cheaper, but the 512GB option is still $899. That\'s a pretty high cost for a phone that is intended to be ""affordable"" or do we only count the low-memory options as affordable?', ""Next, the new iPhone doesn't feature the Camera Control button, instead, it has the iPhone 15's Action Button. Now, this might be a bit more personal, but I don't like the Action Button. I've always seen it as an overly complex silent mode toggle that you might consider changing the function of but likely won't. The iPhone 16e also doesn't have the Dynamic Island seen in modern iPhones, instead, it uses the same notch seen in the iPhone 14."", ""Finally, and frankly, kind of strangely, there's no MagSafe on the iPhone. This is weird because MagSafe has been a part of the iPhone range since the iPhone 12. It is such an odd thing to remove that stores have to put MagSafe stickers on the phones to display them."", '', 'There was a lot to love about the iPhone SE 4 in concept, mainly the idea of having access to some great features while sacrificing some hardware. To my mind, the idea of the phone basically being an AI-capable iPhone 14 was a great one, but somewhere along the line Apple has made a strange chimera of a device.', ""For some reason, Apple has seemingly slapped parts onto the device with little thought to why. For instance, what purpose does the Action Button have on the phone compared to, instead, the Camera Control button considering the iPhone 16e has Visual Intelligence? Why make the phone so similar to the iPhone 15, then stick what looks like an iPhone 14 display in so that you're stuck with the notch?"", 'When I look at my iPhone 15 Pro Max I have to wonder what the point of my upgrading would be. At this point, I already have a phone that is Apple Intelligence capable, with a bigger screen no less. What about if I still had my iPhone 14 Pro Max? Honestly, I think I would wait a bit and then just upgrade to the iPhone 16 instead, even if it does have slightly lower memory.', ""Now, I should be fair and say that there is still a fair amount we don't know about the iPhone 16e's performance. Not only that, there is little doubt that Apple will push sales when the iPhone 17 is finally released.

Pre-orders are live now, and the phone itself will begin shipping on February 28."", 'As the new name suggests, the iPhone 16e isn’t exactly a direct follow-up to the iPhone SE, but it does have the same spirit. It’s got the internals of the iPhone 16 packaged in an older design with a single-camera setup and fewer bells and whistles than its more expensive contemporaries. That’s the iPhone SE MO if ever there was one.', 'However, there’s more than just a name separating the iPhone 16e from its predecessor. At $599 / £599 / AU$999, the iPhone 16e is far more expensive than the iPhone SE (2022) ever was. Up until February 19, Apple sold the latter for just $429 / £429 / AU$719, which is an absolute steal in comparison.', 'Off the top of my head, that’s the largest price jump between two iPhone ‘generations’ in recent memory. To me, this price hike echoes the reveal of the iPhone X at $999 / £999 / AU$1,579 way back in 2017, which marked a sizeable increase over the iPhone 7’s $649 / £599 / AU$1,079 launch price.', ""Though the iPhone 16e won’t have nearly as much impact as the then-flagship iPhone X, it still suggests that Apple is feeling braver about its smartphone pricing than in recent years, during which time things have stayed pretty stable across the company's mobile portfolio."", '', 'Just recently, I wrote that I’d struggle to recommend an iPhone SE 4 that cost in excess of $500 / £500 / AU$800, but as mentioned, the iPhone 16e seems to be starting a new product line. So, in the spirit of fairness, let’s take a look at what you get for your money.', 'As expected, the iPhone 16e has effectively the same internal makeup as the baseline iPhone 16, with the powerful A18 chipset, 128GB of storage, and presumably 8GB of RAM as the phone supports Apple Intelligence. The iPhone 16e also debuts Apple’s new C1 modem for 5G and cell service connectivity.', 'The real differences come with the camera and design. The iPhone 16e sports the same 48MP main camera as the iPhone 16, but that’s it – there’s no ultra-wide camera, no telephoto lens, and fewer shooting modes. Design-wise, the iPhone 16e borrows the display of the iPhone 14 – notch and all – and the body of the iPhone 15, including the handy Action button.', 'With five models in the iPhone 16 series, and the iPhone 15 still kicking about, Apple’s mobile pricing ladder has never made less sense.', 'Older display aside, it’s a modern-looking phone that doesn’t look particularly out of place alongside the rest of the iPhone lineup. It’s clearly not aiming for the same combination of nostalgia and familiarity as the iPhone SE, which in its final incarnation sported the internals of the iPhone 13 and the chassis of an iPhone 8, complete with a Lightning port, massive bezels, and even a Touch ID-enabled Home button.', 'The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have also been discontinued, replaced by the iPhone 16e. The iPhone 14, with its A15 chipset, 6GB of RAM, and 12MP camera, was previously sold by Apple at a price of $599 / £599 / AU$999, and when you put it next to the iPhone 16e, the latter definitely seems like better value for money.', 'That said, I think the takeaway here is that the iPhone 14 was overpriced, rather than the iPhone 16e being particularly good value for money. For a better read, we need to look over the fence at what Android phone makers are up to in the same price bracket.', '', 'As I mentioned in my previous op-ed, for $100 / £100 / AU$150 less than the cost of the iPhone 16e you can pick up the Google Pixel 8a, which offers pretty much all the same functionality as Apple’s mid-ranger, albeit via Android and Google Gemini rather than iOS and Apple Intelligence – you also get an ultra-wide camera and a 120Hz display with a punch-hole selfie camera.', 'Google’s phone lineup is also well-stratified while offering real value at every step, because the company takes an additive approach to value, adding features to justify higher price points. It also helps that Google keeps the lineup neat at just four phones.', 'It’s my suspicion that Apple is more subtractive with the way it decides value, seemingly starting with the top-end Pro Max and taking away features to justify cheaper price points. But with five models in the iPhone 16 series, and the iPhone 15 still kicking about despite being outclassed in hardware power and AI support by the new iPhone 16e, Apple’s mobile pricing ladder has never made less sense.', '', ""Furthermore, the iPhone 16e is oddly positioned as a gateway device to Apple's AI suite. As the cheapest iPhone you can buy from Apple directly, this will be the choice for people who want something cost-effective and simple. I’m unconvinced that this is the same audience that cares much about Apple Intelligence."", 'Even with all the confusion, my gut tells me that the iPhone 16e is just too expensive for what it is. Apple has missed the mark with a phone marketed to AI lovers, built for digital minimalists, and sold at a price that can’t claim to be budget-friendly but also prevents a truly premium feature set. I’m still looking forward to our iPhone 16e review, but I’m not sure I’ll be convinced that the iPhone 16e is worth the money.', 'What do you think of the iPhone 16e?

"I tried to hate the iPhone 16e, but I couldn’t",https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/i-could-not-hate-the-iphone-16e/,"['The iPhone 16e launched earlier this week, but it’s far from what we had initially thought of it. For starters, it is not a successor to the iPhone SE (2022).', 'The changes to the design weren’t exactly unexpected, and through a series of leaks over the several past months, we were persistently reminded of the overhaul the iPhone SE would undergo. Despite setting our expectations already, the iPhone 16e was able to drive some strong reactions, mostly disappointment, at launch. The $600 price tag and cutbacks in some seemingly crucial areas were the likely culprits.', 'I, personally, set out with a mission to count its flaws, carefully comparing it with the other iPhones you can buy for the same price. But after clearly observing my thoughts and clearing out my biases, I feel the iPhone 16e is an entirely different phone — not a new SE. And for this reason, it deserves a fair chance, especially for what it offers rather than what it lacks. So, here are the reasons, why, despite wanting to hate the iPhone 16e, I failed.', 'I test dozens of phone cameras each year as part of my job. When I do, it becomes imperative to test every camera unit on the phone, and gauge its quality against the others. But when I’m shooting photos for myself, I rarely find myself willingly choosing for the ultrawide camera.', 'There are a few reasons for that. First, most phones, irrespective of their price, cheap out on the quality of the ultrawide camera while focusing on the primary and the telephoto cameras. Take for instance the 12MP ultrawide angle camera on the regular iPhone 16. It not only has a lower resolution count than the 48MP main camera, but the sensor inside is also physically smaller. That immediately leads to less sharp images, with losses mounting as we subject the camera to lower light.', 'Secondly, ultrawide cameras have evolved the least in recent years. One pressing issue that brands have shied away from fixing is the wonky perspective. This makes the images look unnatural, and I would rather limit my span of view than slaughtering scenic views for the sake of accommodating more.', 'It’s not entirely useless, especially since autofocus on the iPhone 16’s ultrawide-angle camera enables macro mode. But giving up on the feature is a compromise I’m willing to make at that price.', 'What concerns me more about the iPhone 16e’s camera is the lack of the same features as the base iPhone 16, primarily, the improved photographic styles we saw as part of the iPhone 16 series. Instead, the iPhone 16e gets the older version, which is limited and must be set from system settings instead of within the camera, making the whole process less intuitive.', 'As for the actual camera quality, I would want to try the camera first before doling out a verdict.', 'With the iPhone 16e, Apple moved away from using Qualcomm’s 5G modems to using its in-house C1 chip. While Apple claims the new modem leads to lower battery drain while hitting triple-digit megabit speeds, the C1 is effectively less capable than the Qualcomm X71 modem that powers the iPhone 16 and the 16 Pro. The most evident disadvantage of the new modem is that it lacks support for mmWave spectrum, which uses higher frequency waves and, in theory, allows for faster data transfer rates, even in densely packed regions.', 'The lack of mmWave can seem a deal-breaker until you learn about its limitations. The high frequency spectrum has a shorter range than traditional sub-6GHz networks, and, therefore, requires a larger number of substations to keep the network running. This eventually leads to higher operational expenses, which is why most careers in the U.S., besides AT&T, have invested in lower frequencies, primarily focusing on the mid-band spectrum, which is a subset of the sub-6GHZ spectrum. If you’re outside the U.S., chances are most careers haven’t even deployed their networks in the higher bands.', 'So, while mmWave has practical advantage — especially if you’re chasing Gigabit speeds on your 5G connection, you would probably be fine if the iPhone 16e runs at 200Mbps instead — I know I would be.', 'The other key feature missing from the iPhone 16e is a dedicated chip for ultra wide band (UWB) that is otherwise present on all phones since the iPhone 11. UWB is a short communication tech that operates at frequencies lower than other wireless communications like Wi-Fi, which makes it immune to interference. On the iPhone specifically, UWB helps with faster AirDrop connections and precisely maneuvering to AirTags or other Apple devices through the Find My app.', 'It’s unquestionably groundbreaking, but it’s still not indispensable. Unless you live in a smart home where UWB helps you with your digital keys or have dozens of Apple devices where you are tired of waiting for the right device to pop up on the AirDrop menu, I would say UWB is not that big of a deal. And if you’re an Android user who has only one foot into the Apple ecosystem, you probably don’t need to worry about it.', 'Perhaps, when I witness a future where UWB becomes more dependable while we rely on machines to interact with each other without human discretion, I would change my stance on UWB. Until then, I am perfectly fine without it.', 'Apple has particularly outraged a lot of people by skipping MagSafe from the iPhone 16e. That means while the new iPhone has wireless charging, it lacks magnets that can be used to anchor it to a wireless charger or attach a panoply of accessories such as wallets. That also means wireless charging is limited to a paltry 7.5W instead of 25W as on the rest of the iPhone 16 series.', 'Although it was initially speculated that Apple ditched MagSafe to ensure magnets do not interfere with the new modem’s performance, the company refuted this. The only other reasonable explanation for omitting magnets was so Apple could cut manufacturing costs. If you think of it like that, it does seem outrageous.', 'However, if you’re like me and mostly top up your iPhone with a cable instead, the lack of MagSafe isn’t a deal-breaker. Further, case manufacturers have stepped up and circumvented the need for internal magnets by offering MagSafe-compatible cases for older iPhones or even Android phones without MagSafe — Samsung being the latest one to skip internal magnets yet support the faster Qi2 wireless charging standard, and there are plenty of affordable options, too, to bring MagSafe-like functionality to any phone, not just the expensive ones.', 'In essence, using a case instead of relying on MagSafe has one major drawback, i.e., you don’t get access to the fastest wireless charging speeds. But in all honestly, I’m not among those who will be bogged down by this. That’s because I use the magnetic charging functionality mostly while at my desk or sleeping. In both scenarios, the objective is not to charge the phone but utilize MagSafe — primarily for the iPhone’s StandBy mode. So, my requirements can be fulfilled by simply using a case, even without inherent MagSafe support on the iPhone 16e.', 'Despite its shortcomings in other areas, the iPhone 16e comes with an A18 processor from Apple. It isn’t identical to the eponymous chip that runs iPhone 16 and 16 Pro phones, but uses a slightly less powerful CPU. Despite that, the A18 is equipped to run Apple Intelligence and Visual Intelligence, and that is enough to get me hyped up for the phone.', 'It’s worth arguing that Apple Intelligence has been underwhelming — it’s current applications are limited to cleaning up your notes and emails and offering (wild) summaries of notifications. But I feel hopeful for its applications a few years later — assuming anyone who buys the iPhone 16e would keep it for a few years. I primarily envision Siri maturing into a truly intelligent assistant and future versions of iOS getting actually good at predicting your next steps and making the experience truly enhanced with AI — beyond regurgitating a sequence of words it learned from somewhere on the internet. It would be especially exciting to see how Apple Intelligence — or AI, in general — makes technology more personalized and useful for people who don’t truly enjoy fiddling with it.', 'As someone who gets to access the latest and the best technology — mostly for free — as part of my job, I have developed a general sense of aversion to gadgets that are short of the best. But I reckon these may not fit the broader audience.', 'While there’s no questing that the iPhone 16e is full of compromises, it sells the dream of making features like Apple Intelligence and the latest iOS experience accessible to plenty more people who just want a good and functional phone that lasts several years. Yes, it’s not the most compelling phone for $600 — you’ll find much better options such as the OnePlus 13R, which offers brilliant value, a brighter display, significantly better battery. But if you want an iPhone — one that you would want to stick with for years, the iPhone 16e is highly compelling.', 'If you want to buy your first iPhone to experiment, there’s probably no better phone than this one.', 'Visual Intelligence is one of the standout features that debuted with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro series last fall. This feature was widely believed to be limited to iPhones equipped with Camera Control (and Apple Intelligence), as no previous iPhone models had this capability. However, the newly announced iPhone 16e also supports Visual Intelligence despite lacking Camera Control.', '', 'The names of our smartphones matter. Too clunky and we forget, too wordy and we don’t remember, or too bizarre and we won’t say it. They don’t have to mean anything at all, but they need to fit. The new iPhone 16e’s name fits, far more so than the expected alternatives, and it was one of Apple’s best decisions with the phone. But there’s another name I would have preferred even more.\nYou’re family now', '', ""Apple announced the iPhone 16e earlier this week. As expected, the company's latest budget smartphone features its first custom-designed modem chip, known as the C1. However, this chip does not support ultra-fast mmWave 5G technology, indicating that another upcoming iPhone model may also lack this capability."", '', 'Upgrade your lifestyle\nDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

"", 'When we reviewed the iPhone 14 series in 2022, ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner and I found its newest features, such as the always-on display and switch to eSIM support, to be lacking. In some ways, the changes that the iPhone 14 had introduced at the time made it more difficult for consumers to decide if upgrading to the latest device was a sensible choice. ', 'Also: Industry analyst predicts iPhones to get 9% price hike amidst US tariffs - and I believe it', ""It didn't help that Apple retained the Lightning port, which was already beginning to be phased out across other devices like iPads and MacBooks.

The iPhone 16e settles it: Apple is no longer a luxury company,https://www.macworld.com/article/2614419/iphone-16e-confirmed-apple-no-longer-a-luxury-manufacturer.html,"[""When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence."", 'You’ll often hear people complain that Apple’s “luxury gadgets” are too expensive for them. If they’re talking about a $1,599 iPhone 16 Pro Max or a $2,299 iPad Pro, then this point of view is understandable. But strictly speaking, even the most expensive of Apple’s Pro devices are premium products, not luxury. There’s a big difference.', 'Want to see a real luxury product? How about an $8,900 Gucci jacket. Or a $10,000 Dior bag. Or a $17,000 Apple Watch. Real luxury is about exclusivity and as much about the number of people who don’t buy your product. But with more than 200 million iPhones sold per year, the luxury niche tag is simply no longer applicable to Apple.', 'Take the new $599 iPhone 16e. It’s a solid but spartanly equipped smartphone with an older design and only one camera (which doesn’t offer a real optical zoom, no matter how often Apple claims this). The 16e is not a luxury product. It’s part of a growing group of Apple devices that are meant to appeal to a mass market looking for a good-looking product at a decent price. It’s J. Crew, not Cartier.', 'Of all Apple’s products, only a handful—the iPad Pro, Mac Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max—can truly be described as premium. In addition to Apple’s brand image and good design, the iPhone Pro and iPad Pro offer exceptional performance and ease of use. And the video professional or app developer who spends big on a Mac Pro can be sure they will get high stability and first-class hardware in return. But it’s hard to find luxury in a product that essentially offers the same experience as one costing thousands less.', 'The iPad Pro and Mac Pro are some of the few premium products Apple still makes.', 'Thiago Trevisan/Foundry', 'Apple launches more and more affordable products every year. Although these are first-class products, they are aimed more at the mass market and are significantly cheaper than other Apple products.', 'Apple had to make a decision years ago. Should it remain a pure premium manufacturer, a kind of Porsche among consumer tech manufacturers, by offering only the best to people willing to pay for it? This would have been risky because it would mean the survival of the company hangs on the success of a very small number of high-priced products. (As an illustration of these risks, mistakes in product development are currently causing the aforementioned German sports car manufacturer serious difficulties.) So Apple chose a different path.', 'The iPhone 16e is another product aimed at a mass market, not a luxury one.', 'Foundry', 'Apple has evidently decided to become a mass manufacturer offering a wide range of products catering to all income brackets. Premium devices such as the iPhone 16 Pro Max may deliver the biggest profit margin, but less profitable devices such as the iPhone 16e ensure a large number of users. This in turn leads to strong revenue through services such as iCloud+, AppleCare+, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and, last but not least, the App Store. Even growth regions such as India cannot be conquered with premium devices alone.', 'A broad customer base brings another benefit: economies of scale. The larger the turnover, the higher the number of shipments, the more advantages you gain in areas such as development and marketing. It makes little economic sense to develop your own iPhone CPUs and operating systems for a few customers. But if you sell 230 million smartphones a year, you can negotiate completely different conditions with companies like TSMC.', 'It’s possible that this strategic shift will have consequences: Apple could find that the premium portion of its brand diminishes in the coming years as people choose value over premium.
