What are Ukraine’s critical minerals – and why does Trump want them?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/what-are-ukraines-critical-minerals-and-why-does-trump-want-them,"['Zelenskyy has rebuffed US’s initial attempt to take control of minerals as downpayment for its aid in war with Russia', 'Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has rebuffed an initial attempt by the US to corner his country’s critical minerals as a downpayment for continued military and economic aid for its war with Russia.', 'Three sources told the Reuters news agency that the US had proposed taking ownership of 50% of Ukraine’s critical minerals. Zelenskyy did not dismiss the offer out of hand, but said it did not yet contain the security provisions Kyiv needed.', 'Critical minerals are the metals and other raw materials needed for the production of hi-tech products, particularly those associated with the green energy transition, but also consumer electronics, artificial intelligence infrastructure and weapons.', 'The rush to tackle climate breakdown and move away from fossil fuels has triggered a rush for energy transition minerals such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which are useful for electrification of transport and the construction of wind turbines. The same minerals and others are also used for the manufacture of mobile phones, AI datacentres and arms such as F-35 fighter aircraft, placing them in high demand.', 'As the world’s economy and technology transforms, the value of critical minerals has soared and geopolitical competition for access to them is rising. In 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the market for energy transition minerals had reached £320bn in 2022, double its value five years earlier. And if countries fully implement their clean energy and climate pledges, demand is expected to more than double by 2030 and triple by 2040, the agency says.', 'The term critical minerals is not a scientific term so much as a political term, and different countries have different lists of critical minerals depending on their domestic and geopolitical objectives.', 'In 2022, the US Geological Survey (USGS) published a list of 50 minerals, from aluminium to zirconium, that it regarded as “play[ing] a significant role in our national security, economy, renewable energy development and infrastructure”. Notable inclusions were arsenic, for semiconductors; beryllium, used as an alloying agent in aerospace and defence industries; cobalt, lithium and graphite, crucial for manufacturing batteries; indium, which makes screens respond to a finger touch; and tellurium, which is used for solar power generation.', 'The US’s Energy Act stipulates that the list must be updated every three years, which means this year it will be up for review, and it will be interesting to see which minerals appear or disappear given the new political environment in the country.', 'Rare earth elements (REEs) are a subset of 17 critical minerals that are variously indispensable for mobile phones, electric vehicles, missile guidance systems and other electronics, industrial and energy applications.', 'Despite their name, most of the rare earth elements are not particularly rare, but their extraction and refining is fiendishly difficult – and environmentally highly destructive – meaning production is concentrated in very few places, mainly China.', 'REEs include europium, used in nuclear power station control rods; dysprosium, gandolinium and praseodymium, used in the magnets in your mobile phone; and gadolinium, holmium and ytterbium, used in lasers among other things.', 'A 2022 article by the chair of Ukraine’s Association of Geologists, Hanna Liventseva, claimed her country contained about 5% of the world’s mineral resources, despite covering only 0.4% of the globe’s surface, thanks to a complex geology that takes in all three of the main components of the earth’s crust.', 'According to Ukraine’s own data, cited by Reuters, the country has deposits of 22 of the 34 minerals identified as critical by the EU, including rare earths such as lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, erbium and yttrium.', 'Before the outbreak of war with Russia, Ukraine was a key supplier of titanium, producing about 7% of global output in 2019, according to European Commission research. It also claimed 500,000 tons of lithium reserves, and one-fifth of the world’s graphite, a crucial component of nuclear power stations.', 'However, with Russia controlling about one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory, much of these reserves have been lost. According to estimates by Ukrainian thinktanks cited by Reuters, up to 40% of Ukraine’s metal resources are under occupation. Russian troops also occupy at least two of Ukraine’s lithium deposits, one in Donetsk and another in Zaporizhzhia.', 'There is one big reason Trump is so keen to get his hands on Ukraine’s critical minerals: China. More than ever, the Asian superpower is the world’s factory and that means, wherever in the world critical minerals are torn from the ground, it remains a crucial staging point on the supply chain.', 'Most of the world’s processing capacity for critical minerals is in China. According to the IEA, China’s share of refining is about 35% for nickel, 50-70% for lithium and cobalt, and nearly 90% for REEs. Its dominance in the latter, especially, is overwhelming. According to USGS data, in 2024 China accounted for almost half the world’s REE reserves.', 'With Trump effectively instigating a trade war with China with his imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese goods, US access to critical minerals is potentially under threat. As mentioned earlier, the world is being gripped by an unseemly scramble for mineral wealth. They are the building blocks of the economy of the future, and if the US doesn’t get its hands on them, someone else will.']"
U.S.-Ukrainian Mineral Deal Getting Close To Fruition,https://www.twz.com/news-features/u-s-ukrainian-mineral-deal-getting-close-to-fruition,"['HOWARD ALTMAN', 'POSTED ON FEB 22, 2025', '(NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES OF UKRAINE)', 'Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky will soon sign a minerals agreement with the United States potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Friday. That move is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to end the war with Russia and a deal the American leader says will recoup billions in military aid provided to Kyiv.', '“Here’s the bottom line: President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,” Waltz said during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), according to The Guardian.', '', 'During his evening address on Friday, Zelensky hinted that a deal could be close.', '“Today, teams from Ukraine and the U.S. are working on a draft agreement between our governments,” he said. “This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome – a just result.”', '', 'An agreement could be signed as soon as Saturday, “although it is not yet complete, people briefed on the talks said,” The Wall Street Journal reported. The exact terms could not be learned. Asked if this would go through, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday: “I think they want it. They feel good about it.”', 'U.S. and Ukrainian officials negotiated all night into Friday morning to ink an agreement and end the souring Zelesnky-Trump relations, Axios reported, citing a U.S. official and a source with direct knowledge of the issue.', '', 'The pending deal would give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s deposits of critical minerals including aluminum, gallium and titanium, Waltz said.  As we previously reported, Ukraine possesses materials that are essential components of microchips and electric vehicle batteries and have significant military value. Trump has been touting this as a way to reduce the burden for supporting Ukraine, with Waltz claiming US aid to Kyiv has exceeded $175 billion, The Guardian reported.', 'That figure, as we have explained before, contradicts information compiled by the Kiel Institute For The World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker, which shows that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with a little less than $120 billion from the U.S. More than half – $66.5 billion – was for direct security assistance in the form of donated weapons, according to Pentagon figures.', 'Last week, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, presented Zelensky with the draft proposal for that plan, with Ukraine providing approximately $500 billion worth of rare earth elements to the U.S., The Guardian explained.', 'There were claims that Bessent told the Ukrainian president to sign the deal on the spot, but we can’t confirm that.', 'News about the looming mineral deal came as the war of words between Trump and Zelensky continues to escalate in the wake of peace talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Moscow that did not include Ukraine.', 'In comments to Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade on Friday, Trump blasted Zelensky as a poor negotiator, and called Bessent’s trip “dangerous” and “a waste of time.”', 'The pair “couldn’t even come close” to a deal, Trump told Kilmeade. Ukrainian officials, however, said that they had only a few hours to study it before it was presented to them.', 'Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was “very upset” with Zelensky over the deal, claiming the Ukrainian leader misrepresented the outcome of a meeting he had with Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance.', 'Zelensky said he wanted to make the deal but needed the approval of his legislature, Rubio said.', 'However, “I read two days later that Zelensky is out there saying ‘I rejected the deal. I told him, No way that we’re not doing that.’ Well, that’s not what happened in that meeting,” Rubio explained. “So you start to get upset by something. We’re trying to help these guys.”', '', 'As we previously noted, it’s one thing to strike a deal, but something else entirely to extract and process the resources.', 'A little more than half of Ukraine’s mineral resources are contained in the four regions Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed in September 2022, and of which his army occupies a considerable swathe, The Independent reported earlier this month. That includes Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though Kherson holds little value in terms of minerals, the publication added. The Crimean peninsula, annexed and occupied by Russian forces in 2014, also holds billions in mineral wealth, The Independent added.', 'Regardless of the difficulty though, it seems that both sides see value in a mineral deal. Signing it could go a long way to cooling the tensions between Trump and Zelensky that have erupted over the past week.', 'On the battlefield, the bulk of the fighting continues to rage in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, but despite strong Russian pressure, its forces are making few advances. Here are the key takeaways from the latest Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessment.', '', 'Representatives from the U.S. and Russia have been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding the future of the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Friday. That news comes as Zelensky has fumed over being cut out of a recent negotiation session between Washington and Moscow.', 'The informal meetings were described as “track two meetings,” a type of unofficial diplomacy meant to lower tension, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed sources.', '', 'Trump continued to blast Zelensky over the latter’s concerns about being left out of peace negotiations.', '“…he complains that he’s not in a meeting that we’re having with Saudi Arabia trying to intervene in peace,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade. “Well, he’s been at meetings for three years with …a president who didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He’s been at meetings for three years, and nothing got done. So I don’t think it’s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you, he’s been there for three years. He makes it very hard to make deals.”', 'Kilmeade repeatedly interrupted, trying to get the president to acknowledge that the war was started by Russia.', '“But you know who is to blame for that,” Kilmeade interjected. Russian President “…Vladimir Putin that did the invasion, unwarranted, to try to take back land he had no right to…”', '', 'Trump also asserted that Russia has the upper hand in any peace negotiations because of all the land it has captured in Ukraine, the BBC reported.', '“I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they’ve taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,” Trump told the BBC on Air Force One.', 'When asked if he trusts that Russia wants peace, Trump said “I do.”', '', 'Russia used the first round of the recently concluded negotiations with the U.S. over ending the war in Ukraine to demand the withdrawal of NATO forces from the alliance’s eastern flank, the Financial Times reported. That triggered concern in European capitals that the Trump administration “could acquiesce to seal a peace deal,” the publication suggested.', 'The Romanian president’s chief of staff and adviser for defense and national security said while the U.S. delegation had rejected Moscow’s demand, there were no guarantees that Washington would not eventually make this concession to Vladimir Putin.', '“’As far as I understand, the situation can change from hour to hour or from day to day,’”’ Cristian Diaconescu told Antena3 television,” FT noted. Diaconescu was referring to Trump’s scathing criticism of Zelensky as well as the American leader’s “concessions made to Russia even before talks began,” according to FT.', 'Diaconescu “stressed that the Russian delegation to the talks in Riyadh earlier this week ‘failed to convince the Americans’ on a NATO withdrawal and that further visits by the leaders of the UK and France to Washington next week would seek to persuade Trump not to give in to this demand,” FT wrote.', 'There is a growing list of U.S. legislators objecting to Trump’s harsh comments about Zelensky, including calling the Ukrainian leader a “dictator.”', 'Several Republican Senators broke ranks with the president about that assessment, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and John Thune of South Dakota.', '“I would certainly never refer to President Zelensky as a dictator,” Murkowski told reporters. “It is quite clear who started the war. It was absolutely Russia at Putin’s directive.” ', '', 'Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), another staunch Trump supporter, also questioned Trump’s support for Putin.', '“I believe his instincts are pretty good,” Tillis said of Trump. “But what I’m telling you, whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin in the future of a stable globe, better go to Ukraine. They better go to Europe. They better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer, and the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.”', '', 'Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona took a similar stance.', '“To call one of our allies ‘a dictator’ while they’re defending their country against an actual dictator is ridiculous,” Kelly Xed. “I’ve met with President Zelensky multiple times and understand how hard the people of Ukraine are fighting to defend their homeland.  I’ll continue to stand with them against Putin even if Trump won’t.”', '', 'Russia is preparing to announce a supposed “victory” in the war against Ukraine by the “round date” of February 24, 2025, the third anniversary of the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) claimed on Friday. “Moreover, the aforementioned plans may also include talk of ‘Russia’s victory over NATO,’ since Moscow’s propaganda has long described the war against Ukraine as a war with the Alliance.”', '', 'ISW produced a fact sheet it claimed counters several statements Trump has made about the war, U.S. support for it, and the ensuing negotiation process.', '', 'U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly expected to provide details about a potential Anglo-French peacekeeping force in Ukraine when he meets with Trump in Washington next week, according to The Telegraph.', 'The plan calls for fewer than 30,000 troops “deployed to Ukrainian cities, ports and other critical infrastructure sites, such as nuclear power stations, far away from the current front lines,” the publication reported.', 'Starmer will reportedly urge Trump “to have U.S. fighter jets and missiles on standby in Eastern Europe to respond with lethal force if Russia breaks the terms of any armistice,” The Telegraph noted, citing “Western officials briefed on the plans.”', '“Rather than stationing a much bigger force in the war-torn country, the mission will rely on ‘technical monitoring,’ including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, drones and satellites to provide a ‘complete picture of what is going on,” The Telegraph stated, citing a Western official. “The operation would be backed up by enough firepower to ‘monitor and shoot those attacks down,’” to reopen Ukraine’s airspace and enable commercial flights, the source added.', 'Naval patrol vessels would also be sent to the Black Sea to monitor Russian threats to commercial shipping routes.', '', 'French President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of increasing his nation’s military spending from 2.1% to 5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to the French France TV Info news outlet. The move comes out of concern that the U.S. will “no longer protect Europe via NATO,” the publication noted.', '“We are entering a time when we will have to […] reinvest even more, French and European, to strengthen our defense and our security,” Macron said, adding that he did not know “if 5% is the right figure for France, but in any case, we will have to go up.”', '', 'EU countries are preparing a military aid package worth at least €6 billion ($6.3 billion) for Ukraine, Politico reported, citing three EU diplomats. That aid was being gathered “to shore up Kyiv’s strategic position at the outset of U.S.-led talks with Russia, the news outlet explained.', 'The package, which should include everything from 1.5 million artillery shells to air defense systems, “would mark one of the EU’s largest military aid packages since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 and could be unveiled ahead of a highly symbolic visit by European commissioners to Kyiv on Feb. 24,” Politico noted.  ', 'Two of the diplomats said the package could be “increased to up to €10 billion ($10.5 billion) or more as countries dig into their inventories to see what they can send to Ukraine,” Politico posited. EU foreign ministers are expected to examine the package on Monday, during a regular gathering in Brussels next week.', '', 'ISW noted in a recent X thread that “Russia will likely face several materiel, manpower, and economic constraints in the coming months that will put pressure on the Kremlin’s ability to maintain its war effort in Ukraine in the medium- to long-term — if Russian forces’ loss rates in Ukraine continue at the current tempo.”', 'In addition, despite Putin’s efforts to paint the Russian economy as robust, inflation in that country has been rising due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,', '“Russia primarily recruits volunteer soldiers through large individual payments and has had to increase payments significantly to sustain recruitment. Russian lenders show signs of uncertainty about Russia’s economic future and the solvency of Kremlin coffers,” ISW stated. “Putin’s protracted war in Ukraine is destroying Russia’s national wealth through the steady erosion of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and growing inflation. The Kremlin has been trying in recent months to reduce state spending on benefits to military personnel, indicating that the Kremlin is aware that it cannot continue such high spending and must find ways to cut costs.”', 'These factors are contributing to Russia’s current force generation apparatus appearing to be “unable to recruit the manpower that the Russian military needs to sustain Russia’s current rate of offensive operations.” ISW posited.', 'To convince the Russian populous not to worry, the Kremlin “has been engaged in an information campaign in recent months that aims to posture the Russian economy as strong and stable to both domestic and international audiences, and the state of Russia’s economy is likely more strained than Kremlin officials publicly acknowledge,” ISW suggested.', '', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk “has called on the European Union to confiscate the assets of the Russian Central Bank, which are frozen due to sanctions, to finance future financial support for Ukraine,” Euronews reported.', '“So far, the bloc has only used the extraordinary revenues of the assets held in its territory, estimated to be worth €210 billion (about $220 billion), to deliver financial and military assistance to the war-torn nation,” the publication reported. “The option of asset confiscation remains a slippery slope, however, because the money is considered Russia’s sovereign property and is therefore protected by international law.”', '“Enough talking, it’s time to act” Donald Tusk posted on X on Thursday. “Let’s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets.”', '', 'Financial Times has produced a documentary claiming to show that Russia has a policy of executing Ukrainians who have surrendered.', 'The film “investigates the rise in cases of Russian soldiers executing Ukrainian POWs and reveals the likely identity of the Russian behind killings, FT reported Christopher Miller noted.', '', 'The onslaught of Russian missiles and drones against Ukraine has been so fierce that the nation has run out of interceptors, Zelensky said in an appeal for more.', '“We have nothing to shoot down missiles with,” the Ukrainian leader recently complained. “The commander calls me at 5 a.m. and says: “There are 8 targets approaching, but we have no missiles for the Patriot air defense system.”', 'Ukraine has received several Patriot batteries and a large number of missiles from the U.S. and allied nations, including the recent donation of about 90 interceptors provided by America from Israeli stocks.', '', 'It is no surprise that drones are playing a key role for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. A new study by RUSI shows just how effective they’ve been, causing the majority of damage to Russian equipment of any weapon in Ukraine’s arsenal.

Kyiv had only seen the draft agreement two days earlier. Finalising a strategic intergovernmental deal with major economic implications in just 48 hours was impossible. Ukraine had never planned to sign the document so soon. The negotiations had only just begun. So how could there be talk of a ""refusal""?', 'For Trump’s team, though, the word ""impossible"" doesn’t exist. Ukraine learned this firsthand in Munich.', 'A meeting between JD Vance and Zelenskyy was due to take place on Friday morning in the Commerzbank building designated for the American delegation. Everything was ready. Vance had arrived, Ukrainian officials were filtering in, security had even started letting in Ukrainian journalists. Then suddenly everyone was told that the meeting was postponed indefinitely.', 'Many assumed the delay was due to the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had been held up by technical problems during his flight.', 'But in reality, a high-stakes drama was unfolding between Ukraine and the US.', 'European Pravda has reconstructed the events based on Ukrainian and American sources.', 'Initially Kyiv did not take Washington’s insistence on signing the agreement in Munich seriously. The document needed work. After all, in international relations, no one signs the first draft of a strategic agreement.', 'But in Munich the US issued an ultimatum: if Ukraine wanted a meeting with Vance to discuss the framework for peace, it had to sign the deal. Immediately.', 'After some back-and-forth, the Americans agreed to push the meeting to the evening and gave Ukraine seven hours to finalise amendments. It quickly became clear that the US had no real intention of revising the document. When Ukraine submitted its revised version, the Americans responded by rejecting all the key Ukrainian amendments.', 'Zelenskyy had to either sign what Washington had drafted or forget about meeting Vance. The meeting was only possible ""as part of a package"", with the signing of the deal.', 'With Trump already showing a willingness to negotiate with Putin without consulting Ukraine, this pressure could only be seen as part of a broader peace deal strategy.', 'But Zelenskyy held firm and refused to sign the document on the White House’s terms.', 'What happened next was even more unexpected.', 'The harshness and pressure from US negotiators vanished as if by magic. The demand to sign the agreement was quietly dropped, and the meeting with Vance went ahead as if nothing had happened. In fact, it turned out to be quite successful.', 'This is how Ukraine got its first real insight into the negotiating style of the new US administration.', '', '', 'European Pravda does not have the full text of the agreement proposed by the US, but we do know its general outline.', 'The deal was structured as a memorandum that would split profits from Ukraine’s natural resources 50/50 – half for the Ukrainian government (with the understanding that if Kyiv wanted to share with Europeans, that would come out of its own share) and the other half for the US.', 'Crucially, the beneficiaries on the American side would not be the US government but private investors. The specific companies involved were not determined at this stage. Instead, the US proposed setting up a trust fund to which Ukraine would transfer the rights to develop its resources. This fund would then select the American companies who would extract – and profit from – Ukraine’s minerals.', 'Although US President Donald Trump has publicly stated that the deal was focused on rare earth metals (many of which are located in Russian-occupied territories), the proposed agreement was far broader, covering lithium, oil, gas, and other key resources as well.', 'The draft provided little clarity on how the deal would work with regard to resources in occupied areas. Washington showed no sign of being willing to fight for them.', 'What would Ukraine get in return? Almost nothing.', 'The agreement contained no security guarantees – the key reason why Zelenskyy ultimately refused to sign it.', '""We can talk about profit-sharing when the security guarantees are clear. I didn’t see them in this document,"" he later explained.', 'The US, however, saw things differently.', 'Their argument was that major American investments in Ukraine would serve as a security guarantee by default, as they would create incentives for Washington to defend Ukraine. The White House also claimed that US involvement would allow Ukraine to begin exploiting deposits it currently lacks the technical capacity to develop.', 'There is some truth to this. But there are also scenarios in which Ukraine would lose control over its resources without gaining any security benefits.', 'For instance, if American companies focused only on deposits in western Ukraine without making any investments in strengthening the Ukrainian military, the only real impact of the deal would be to cut Ukraine’s future resource revenues by 50%.', 'There is an even bigger problem, which we’ll come to shortly.', '', 'All the Ukrainian sources emphasised that Ukraine is not rejecting the deal outright and remains interested in further negotiations. Despite its flaws, the attraction of large-scale American investment could serve as a complementary security guarantee.', 'Zelenskyy and Vance have officially agreed to have legal teams from both governments work on revising the document.', 'Notably, the current draft does not appear to have been prepared by the US Department of Energy or the State Department but by Trump’s private legal team, which seemingly failed to distinguish between intergovernmental agreements and commercial contracts.', 'For instance, the US side wants the agreement to include binding obligations on Ukraine. This, however, would require ratification by the Ukrainian parliament. Is Ukraine’s parliament likely to approve a deal that would involve Ukraine surrendering a significant portion of its resources to a complex profit-sharing scheme with private American companies?', 'The answer is almost certainly no.', '', 'At least not without strong US government commitments on security to outweigh the deal’s drawbacks.', 'Another major issue is the staggering price tag Trump has publicly attached to the deal – $500 billion to $1 trillion.', 'The Ukrainian side has no idea where these numbers came from. US officials came up with them, not Kyiv. The US reportedly consulted at least one Ukrainian investment management fund, but there is no recent assessment of the country’s resource capacity. In some cases only outdated Soviet-era data is available, and it may be wildly inaccurate.', 'Another mystery is Trump’s true objective.', 'Does he simply want a PR victory, announcing a ""$500 billion deal"" to impress American voters?', 'Or is this a real attempt to extract money from Ukraine? If so, after signing the agreement, Ukraine would face even greater pressure from Washington demanding the ""promised"" funds.', 'Another political risk is that Trump, who favours quick wins, might expect the cash to start flowing within the next few years, which would require profits to be channelled to the private companies. In that case, the US president is in for a rude awakening, because these are long-term investments.', 'Finally, there is one fundamental issue that calls the entire deal into question.', 'The US publicly declared in Munich that revenues from the agreement should be used to ""pay the US back"" for the aid it has given Ukraine in recent years, citing figures that bore little resemblance to what Ukraine actually received.', 'This demand is completely absurd.', 'If the US insists on this condition, it could render the agreement completely unworkable.', 'To retroactively demand repayment for aid that was given as non-refundable support, and frequently included weapons Ukraine had not requested but was forced to accept, is a violation of the core principles of international relations.', 'It also opens up a Pandora’s box, as the EU has provided even more aid to Ukraine than the US.', 'Would it be politically possible for Washington to recoup its costs while also gaining control over Ukrainian resources, while the EU, which Ukraine plans to join, gets nothing?', 'The question is a rhetorical one.', 'There is good reason to suspect that Washington never actually expected this repayment demand to fly. The deal was structured to benefit private American businesses. How would they be responsible for reimbursing costs incurred by the US government?', 'Most likely this was a bargaining chip, not a firm demand.', 'The real uncertainty is whether Washington still wants this deal after Ukraine refused to sign the ""Trump version"".', 'On Saturday, US media outlets widely reported that ""Zelenskyy had rejected the deal"", surprising even some members of the Ukrainian delegation, who saw the situation as a renegotiation, not a refusal. By Sunday, Washington had issued an official statement criticising Zelenskyy’s ""short-sighted decision"".', 'Only time will tell if the US remains interested in further talks.', 'For now, though, it seems that the business wing of Trump’s administration was attempting to exploit Ukraine’s vulnerability to force it into an unfavourable deal.', 'When it became clear that Kyiv wouldn’t cave, they backed off.', '', 'The resource deal negotiations may have ended in failure, but the peace talks in Munich delivered more than anyone expected.', 'Before arriving in Munich, Zelenskyy’s team had low expectations. There had already been too many setbacks: Trump’s call with Putin, which Ukraine only learned about from the news; and the missteps by new US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who conceded key US positions on NATO and troop deployment even before formal negotiations began.', 'Trump’s administration had displayed a lack of understanding of the fundamentals. Zelenskyy’s main task in his talks with Vice President JD Vance was to explain Ukraine’s red lines, particularly the fact that a frozen conflict without real security guarantees is unacceptable, because Putin would use any pause to regroup and then attack again.', 'This is why Ukraine never calls for a ""ceasefire"". Instead, it insists on a ""just, sustainable and lasting peace"".', 'The Zelenskyy-Vance meeting took an unexpected turn from the very first minutes.', 'Vance himself outlined a position identical to Ukraine’s: ""We want the killing to stop, but we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that’s going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple of years down the road.""', 'Why did the US align with Ukraine’s view?', 'In reality, a lasting peace in Ukraine is just as crucial for the White House as it is for Zelenskyy. Hopefully Washington has finally grasped this reality.', 'It’s worth emphasising that neither Trump nor Vance care about Ukraine’s fate – that much is clear after the failed natural resources deal. But Trump has no interest in Russia launching another invasion during his presidency. This would be his peace deal, and he could no longer blame Biden or Obama for its failure.', 'Vance, on the other hand, is even more invested in ensuring stability, because he is personally negotiating these deals. It’s an open secret that Vance wants to be the next US president.', 'Despite this progress, securing a ceasefire remains the top US priority. The word ""victory"" has now vanished from American officials’ vocabulary. This means a difficult negotiation process lies ahead – one in which Ukraine will need to do a lot of explaining to its US partners.', 'Meanwhile, another process is unfolding which is of great benefit to Ukraine.', '', 'Europe is deeply alarmed about being sidelined from the Russia-US peace talks, and about the fracturing of its partnership with Washington, especially after Vance’s controversial Munich speech.', 'The depth of the crisis is now clear to everyone.', 'In response, an emergency summit took place in Paris on Monday, without Hungary or Slovakia, but with the UK present.', 'This gathering will effectively be a ""Coalition of Resolute States"" – those committed to real support for Ukraine.', '""It feels like Europe has finally woken up.

If they have been known about for decades, surely there would have been an attempt to exploit them in the decades ahead of Russia’s invasion.', 'It’s not enough for resources to exist if they are to have value. It has to be commercially viable to extract them. It takes a lot of capital – hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, and time, a decade or more – to develop a large-scale mine.', 'Then there need to be processing facilities to turn the resources into marketable commodities, which is again expensive and, for rare earths, environmentally challenging.

After the president deployed U.S. troops to Syria, Trump insisted that his administration actually did take and keep Syrian oil.', 'He was, of course, brazenly lying, but the false claims reflected a sentiment he appeared to take quite seriously: Foreign policy interventions, from Trump’s perspective, should be inherently transactional.

Assessing the Viability of a U.S.-Ukraine Minerals Deal,https://www.csis.org/analysis/assessing-viability-us-ukraine-minerals-deal,"['Photo: Manuel Augusto Moreno/Getty Images', 'Critical Questions by Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz', 'Published February 21, 2025', 'U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are in discussions regarding an agreement that would grant the United States access to Ukraine’s critical minerals and other valuable resources. While the specifics are still being finalized, the deal would allow the United States to obtain a portion of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in compensation for the financial aid provided to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia and potentially for future aid.', 'Q1: What is the proposed minerals deal between the United States and Ukraine?', 'A1: In Kyiv on February 12, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent presented President Zelensky with the first draft of a minerals cooperation agreement. The deal called for 50 percent of Ukraine’s resulting mineral and natural resources revenues to go to the United States as payment for previous military support for the war against Russia. This would include not only revenues from rare earth mining but the “entire economic value associated with resources in Ukraine” including uranium, lithium, oil, gas, and even some port revenues. The deal also specified that U.S. companies must hold 50 percent ownership of Ukraine’s rare earth elements deposits. The deal would override all of Ukraine’s other trade agreements.', 'Zelensky refused to sign the agreement as it included no security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump has said he wants $500 billion worth of Ukrainian minerals as compensation—but Zelensky claims that U.S. military aid has totaled nowhere close to $500 billion. Negotiations are currently ongoing, with a second, less binding memorandum of understanding presented days later by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Zelensky reportedly responded he could not sign the agreement without approval from Parliament. Zelensky’s team is reportedly working on a counter-proposal that includes explicit security guarantees.', 'Zelensky is not necessarily opposed to a minerals agreement with the United States in which Ukraine offers its strategic resources in exchange for continued military support and security guarantees. Ukrainian officials have confirmed that Zelensky has called the idea of exchanging “critical resources” as part of the “Victory Plan” he presented to Trump during a meeting last fall. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials are increasing pressure on the Ukrainian president to sign the current deal. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has called the co-investment deal “the best security guarantee they could ever hope for.” President Trump has begun issuing ultimatums, suggesting he may work towards a peace deal with Moscow instead if Zelensky does not cooperate.', 'Q2: How likely is the proposed U.S.-Ukraine deal to move the needle on U.S. minerals security?', 'A2: It’s unlikely to be consequential in the medium term given the barriers to investment. First, there is very limited data on whether Ukraine’s rare earth elements and other strategic materials are commercially viable to mine. According to the former director general of the Ukrainian Geological Survey, there is no modern assessment of rare earth reserves in Ukraine. Existing mapping was done 30–60 years ago by the Soviet Union and relies on old exploration methods. Considerations that impact the commercial feasibility of mining deposits include depth, ore grade, by-products, and location.', 'Second, the war has wiped out essential infrastructure. Mining is among the most energy-intensive industries worldwide. It accounts for approximately 38 percent of global industrial energy use and around 15 percent of total electricity consumption globally. Between 2022 and 2023, nearly half of Ukraine’s power generation capacity was either occupied by Russian forces, destroyed, or damaged, while about half of the country’s large network substations sustained damage from missile and drone strikes. As a result, Ukraine has been left with only about one-third of its prewar power capacity. There will need to be a significant buildout of energy infrastructure for mineral exploration or production can commence.', 'And finally, mining companies are hesitant to make long-term investments given the looming security risk in Ukraine. Mining is a long-term and capital-intensive investment. Globally, it takes an average of 18 years to develop a mine—and costs $500 million and $1 billion to build a mine and separation plant. A new mine can run for over 50 years. Confidence in the political and economic stability of a jurisdiction is critical given the size and longevity of the investment. While Trump, Putin, and Zelensky may reach a peace deal, the threat of further conflict and land expropriation will loom given the long-standing nature of the conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, started 11 years ago. After Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution, Russian forces took control of Crimea in early 2014. Russia later engaged in the conflict in the Donbas, leading to Russian and Russian-backed forces occupying parts of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.', 'Q3: What do these developments mean for U.S.-Ukraine relations under Trump, and what are the implications for the future of Ukraine and NATO security?', 'A3: Trump has consistently vocalized throughout his campaign run and first few weeks in office that he would be taking a different approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict compared to the Biden administration over the last three years. While the Biden administration aimed to isolate Russia on the international stage via tightening sanctions, Trump has opened diplomatic doors to Moscow with a 90-minute phone call weeks into his second term, high-level in-person talks with representatives from the administration, and a tentative meeting between President Trump and President Putin in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Additionally, while Biden consistently prioritized arming and aiding Ukraine, Trump has taken a more transactional approach and questioned the utility of continuing to financially and militarily bolster Ukraine.', 'Tensions have risen considerably between Trump and Zelensky, as critical mineral resource access is the latest arena for Trump to focus his transactional methods of diplomacy. But the viability of the deal remains to be seen as tensions continue to rise between the two world leaders. Trump seemingly blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia and called Zelensky a “dictator without elections.” Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has said U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of any security guarantees for the country.', 'Under the Trump administration, Ukraine, Europe, and NATO as a whole are likely to face a great decline in security guarantees from the United States without offering strategic resources or financial compensation in return.', 'Q4: Is there any precedent for a resource-for-aid swap?', 'A4: It’s an unprecedented move for the United States—but it’s a tried and tested tool out of China’s playbook. The Sino-Congolaise Des Mines (Sicomines) agreement, signed in 2007, is a prime example. This resource-for-infrastructure arrangement granted Chinese companies access to cobalt, copper, and other minerals in return for infrastructure development. China committed approximately $3 billion to infrastructure projects, securing mining rights to deposits near Kolwezi in the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), valued at an estimated $93 billion. At the time, it was the only way for the DRC to get the capital needed to build. However, in the long term, the DRC got shortchanged. The government recently revisited the resource for infrastructure deal with Chinese investors out of concern that some mining contracts are not sufficiently benefiting the country.', 'Gracelin Baskaran is the director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

""I told them that I want the equivalent of like $500 billion worth of rare earths, and they’ve essentially agreed to do that.”', ""President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he is ready to do a deal with Mr Trump that includes U.S. involvement in developing Ukraine's huge deposits of rare earths and other critical minerals."", 'The Kremlin jumped on the comments, saying it demonstrated the US is no longer willing to provide free aid to Kyiv, before adding, what it was against Mr Trump giving any help to Ukraine whatsoever.', 'Below, we look at where these resources are in Ukraine, and why Kyiv has struggled to mine these minerals.', 'Ukraine is sitting on one of Europe’s largest deposits of critical minerals, including lithium and titanium, much of which is untapped. According to the Institute of Geology, Ukraine possesses rare earth elements such as lanthanum and cerium, used in TVs and lighting; neodymium, used in wind turbines and EV batteries; and erbium and yttrium, whose applications range from nuclear power to lasers. The EU-funded research also indicates that Ukraine has scandium reserves but detailed data is classified.', 'Mr Zelensky has been trying to develop these resources, estimated to be worth more than £12 trillion, based on figures provided by Forbes Ukraine, for years.', 'In 2021, he offered outside investors tax breaks and investment rights to help mine these minerals. These efforts were suspended when the full-scale invasion started a year later.', 'Anticipating the notoriously transactional Mr Trump might take an interest in this, Mr Zelensky then placed the mining of these minerals into his victory plan, which was drawn up last year.', 'The minerals are vital for electric vehicles and other clean energy efforts, as well as defence production.', 'Estimates based on government documents suggest that Ukraine’s resources are also highly varied. Foreign Policy found that Ukraine held “commercially relevant deposits of 117 of the 120 most-used industrial minerals across more than 8,700 surveyed deposits”.', 'Included in that is half a million tonnes of lithium, none of which has been tapped. This makes Ukraine the largest lithium resource in Europe.', ""Ukraine's reserves of graphite, a key component in electric vehicle batteries and nuclear reactors, represent 20% of global resources. The deposits are in the centre and west."", 'It is not surprising that Mr Trump appears keen on benefiting from this, especially as China remains a key player in the mining of minerals such as titanium.', 'But Vladimir Putin’s invasion has not only delayed Ukraine’s plans to mine these minerals, it has also led to much of these resource-rich areas being destroyed and then occupied.', 'A little over £6 trillion of Ukraine’s mineral resources, which is around 53 per cent of the country’s total, are contained in the four regions Mr Putin illegally annexed in September 2022, and of which his army occupies a considerable swathe.', 'That includes Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though Kherson holds little value in terms of minerals.', 'The Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed and occupied by Mr Putin’s forces in 2014, also holds roughly £165 billion worth of minerals.', 'The region of Dnipropetrovsk, which borders the largely occupied regions of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, and sits in the face of an advancing Russian army, contains an additional £2.8 trillion in mineral resources.', 'Russian difficulties with major military operations seem likely to preclude a serious attempt to take the region but mining operations in the area would be perilous with Moscow’s soldiers so close.', 'Other ores are well within the sites of Russia’s forces. One lithium ore on the outskirts of a settlement called Shevchenko in Donetsk is less than 10 miles from the town of Velyka Novosilka, recently captured by Mr Putin’s troops.', 'However, while Ukraine has a highly qualified and relatively inexpensive labour force and developed infrastructure, investors highlight a number of barriers to investment.
