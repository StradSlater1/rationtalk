Meghan Markle and Harry 'very much in love' as expert points to 'evidence',https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-harry-very-much-982051,"['Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still ""very much in love and in harmony"" despite the swirling rumors about their relationship, according to an expert.', 'Throughout their union, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had to fend off speculation about their marriage. Recently, their individual public engagements have sparked conversations, while a biting piece pondered over whispers that Meghan was being courted to pen a ""post-divorce"" narrative.', 'However, speaking with the Mirror UK, former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond pointed out how the couple\'s recent appearance at the Invictus Games in Canada displayed them as affectionate as ever. ""I have seen absolutely no evidence that they are unhappy with one another. Indeed they have always seemed very much in love and in harmony,"" she said.', '""We never question the marriage status of Edward and Sophie, or Anne and Tim, or indeed Charles and Camilla when they pursue their different engagements and focus on separate interests. So why do we do it with Harry and Meghan?""', 'Throughout the Games, the couple clearly displayed their joy, with Meghan even delivering a heartfelt speech during the opening ceremony. ""At the Invictus Games I saw a couple very much united in celebrating a hugely worthwhile achievement. The many stories we heard, and which Harry and Meghan listened to, proved that the Games have made a massive difference to servicemen and women injured or scarred by their military experiences,"" Jennie told the Mirror.', '""I saw a wife who was justifiably proud of what her husband had helped create. And I saw a husband who was hugely grateful for his partner\'s support."" Ever since Meghan was spotted with Prince Harry at the 2017 games in Toronto, she has remained a steadfast supporter through all the subsequent Invictus Games.', 'Nevertheless, with their children - five-year-old Prince Archie and three-year-old Princess Lilibet - back home in California, Meghan decided to exit the competition early to reunite with them. ""Quite understandably, they felt their children shouldn\'t be left without them for too long. Toddlers miss their parents, and especially their mom,"" Jennie noted.', '""So it seemed a completely sensible decision for Meghan to fly back to California as planned after a series of extremely busy and high-profile days at the Games, leaving her husband to carry on supporting the participants until the end,"" she concluded. Yet even after departing midway, the Duchess of Sussex maintained her backing for her spouse.', 'On Valentine\'s Day, the mother-of-two commemorated the day by posting a black and white photo on Instagram showing her and Harry sharing a loving kiss. ""Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine, as he continues on at the Invictus Games, changing lives and reminding all of us of the power of healing and resilience through these incredible veterans and their families. Beyond proud of my husband and what he\'s created,"" she wrote alongside the image.', 'Meghan added, ""My love, I will eat burgers and fries and fish and chips with you forever. Thank you for you. #lovewins.""', 'Jennie said people should feel joy for the couple as they continue to advocate for causes close to their hearts and carve out successful careers from their Montecito residence. ""I\'m sure they would have loved to be together on Valentine\'s Day, but Meghan sent a sweet message to Harry and I bet this was reciprocated. Until, and unless, we see proof to the contrary, let\'s be happy for them and their little family,"" she commented.', ""While the Invictus Games holds a dear place in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's story, marking their initial public outing in 2017, their romance actually sparked off in 2016 after Harry stumbled upon the former Suits star online."", '""She was wearing a black sweater, jeans, heels. I knew nothing about clothes, but I knew she was chic. Then again, she could make anything look chic,"" Harry wrote in his memoir Spare, reflecting on their first encounter. ""I\'d seen so many photos of her from fashion shoots and TV sets, all glam and glossy, but here she was, in the flesh, no frills, no filter... and even more beautiful. Heart-attack beautiful.', '""I was trying to process this, struggling to understand what was happening to my circulatory and nervous systems, and as a result my brain couldn\'t handle any more data. Conversation, pleasantries, the Queen\'s English, all became a challenge."" The couple announced their engagement to the world in November 2017 after dating for a year and tied the knot at St George\'s Chapel in Windsor in May 2018.', 'Click here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.', 'DAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.', '']"

And what I was saying to people who ask, because people obviously do ask, [is that] his commitment is unparalleled,” he told Us. “I think what people need to understand is that it was his vision. He does drive that vision. I can’t remember how many board meetings I’ve been to, not only through the 2014 delivery process, but since then, I can think of one or two that he’s missed. He’s always been there.”', 'These days, Harry might attend more of those meetings by way of video, but that hasn’t changed his determination and his dedication to the event. “He once described [The Invictus Games] to being his second child,” Reed added. “This was before [his daughter] Lilibet was born, and then he quickly corrected himself, ‘my first child.’ It’s a very important thing to him.”', '“I think we’re all in this together,” Reed said. “You know, I made some remarks about my journey, and I wasn’t injured. I wasn’t deployed in combat, but this has been extraordinary for all of us. So, you know, he’s 100 percent committed. And he’s very good at work.”', 'Shannon has participated in several Invictus Games sports including snowboarding, seated volleyball, wheelchair basketball, rowing and swimming, and described his experience meeting Harry and Meghan Markle as “humbling.”', '“He’s a very kind gentleman,” said Shannon, a former member of the US Air Force. “[Harry] took a lot of time out of his life to come and spend a lot of time with us. I sat with them yesterday at the swimming pool.”', 'The royal couple “came and took some pictures with us [and] asked us how we’re doing,” Shannon told Us. “We had a meeting here at the DCC where he sat down with us, him and Meghan … It was nice. It was nice, you know, he was humbling.”', 'The UK military member, who participated in indoor rowing, alpine skier, novice skeleton and wheelchair basketball at the Games, gushed over the “fantastic” event. He added that Harry’s ability to bring “nations together” and allow people to “put politics aside for 10 days” is “just a fantastic, fantastic opportunity.”', 'British Royal Legion member Wren, who suffers from PTSD after a training exercise went wrong in 2020 and he was dragged underneath a warship, added that “anyone who’s a wounded, injured, sick veteran or serving needs to get on this to aid their recovery.”', 'Before connecting with Harry at the 2025 Games in Canada, Wren met with the prince at the 2023 event in Düsseldorf, Germany.', 'Murphy, who was injured while deployed in Greece in 2018, told Us this year’s Invictus Games gave him his second opportunity to spend time with the Duke of Sussex — but he almost missed the chance entirely.', 'Murphy’s fiancée was recording him snowboarding and “we were on the side of the mountain, and somebody comes up, there’s a bunch of people pull over, ‘Hey, you guys OK?’” he recalled. “And we were just like, ‘Yeah, we’re focusing on our video, trying to get it fine-tuned.’ And then we almost blew this person off, and then I can’t see, so they kind of tapped me and whispered. They said, ‘Hey, it’s Prince Harry.’”', '“And the cool part about the interactions is, he’s not just here for publicity,” Murphy continued. “He’s a down-to-earth, genuine person. So he’s sitting there making jokes [like], ‘You know why blind people don’t snowboard, right? It’s super difficult and terrifying.’ I was like, ‘Well, I’m here to break barriers, sir.’ So we kind of went back and forth, talked a little bit with him and his crew, went down the mountain, and then a couple runs later, right before I ended up going up to race, he came up behind me. He said, ‘Wow, you really do know how to snowboard. That was impressive. It was good to watch you.’”', 'Murphy also appreciated that Harry has plenty of military experience. “I think personally, from the military aspect of what makes me feel the most normal is people talking crap to you back and forth, just getting that friendship and having him share that moment to where he’s just one of the guys, it was super cool,” he added. “And then just having him out there, it was kind of just … that was definitely the highlight I’m getting out there. Snowboarding was cool. But having them, knowing the power that he has on everybody here is just huge.”', 'A first-time Invictus Games participant, Phelps met Harry when they were both deployed in 2012, according to his wife, Cynthia. “James and him have deployed together before, and their base was attacked while they were both there and so we have a high regard for him. I know James does, because there were two Marines that were killed in action at that attack and so knowing that shortly afterwards, the Invictus Foundation — it was, like, two years after that attack that the Invictus Games were founded — that doesn’t fall by the wayside,” Cynthia said.', 'James told Us he appreciates how Harry “truly understands” what his fellow veterans have experienced. “He’s been through situations like most of us here have, so just the genuine nature of him putting this together for people who have been through similar things is [special],” he explained.', 'Cynthia added, “We know he was putting this together, right, but he is the front man on this and every time that he and Meghan, both, like, have come together, I mean, they are hand in hand, like, you know, cheek to cheek, just telling us how much it means to them and like, I know that they weren’t, you know, the people that fully put this together, that there’s a huge team behind them as well, but just every time we’ve had any contact with them, it is so genuine.”', 'The athlete, who competed in the biathlon, wheelchair rugby and swimming, said he was part of a group who had breakfast with both Harry and Meghan. “And it was absolutely incredible,” he told Us. “He was incredibly funny and down to earth and very articulate, and Meghan was extremely polite, and they asked us what sports we were doing. They talked to us.”', 'Harry popped up again while Neczypor was competing in the wheelchair rugby event. “He gave us all high fives, congratulations, hugs. And he remembered us. And, ‘Oh, great job. I knew you were worried about this. Congrats on the bronze. You did such an amazing job. I loved this play that you did.’ It was real personal,” he added.', 'Harry was also “out there cheering just as hard for every single country, and that’s what makes this special. Prince Harry is an astounding figure for not only serving in the military, but after his experience, he took what he saw and made these Games,” Neczypor explained. “He’s a singular figure in that way, no one else. There’s a lot of people who serve in the military, a lot of people who have the opportunities to do amazing things, but without him this wouldn’t exist.”', 'An active member of the US military who was diagnosed with an inoperable cancer, Christman described Harry and Meghan as “incredible human beings, full of love, full of generosity, full of compassion.”', '“They have taken the time on multiple occasions to visit with us and come out and see us compete, and every time, they’ve been very approachable and just warming, you know, it just feels like they are also part of that family,” Christman said. “And he has a history of service as well, which is what inspired him to hold true to his brothers and sisters in arms with this organization and this opportunity with the Invictus Games, and it still feels like he is just one of my brothers, brothers in arms.”', 'Reporting by Justin Ravitz', '', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly', '', '', 'US WEEKLY HAS AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIPS SO WE MAY RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR SOME LINKS TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.', '', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly', 'Us Weekly is part of Part of the a360media Entertainment Group. © a360media 2025\nPowered by WordPress VIP', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry divorce rumours shut down by royal expert for one key reason,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/meghan-markle-prince-harry-divorce-34697564,"['Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are “very much in love and in harmony” despite rumours surrounding their relationship, an expert claims.', 'During their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have often been forced to navigate speculation regarding their romance. In recent months, the pair set tongues wagging over their increasingly separate public appearances while a scathing article speculated on rumours that Meghan had been approached to write a “post-divorce” book.', 'But speaking to the Mirror, former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond explained how the couple’s recent appearance at the Invictus Games in Canada showed them looking as loved-up as ever. “I have seen absolutely no evidence that they are unhappy with one another. Indeed they have always seemed very much in love and in harmony,” she said.', '“We never question the marriage status of Edward and Sophie, or Anne and Tim, or indeed Charles and Camilla when they pursue their different engagements and focus on separate interests. So why do we do it with Harry and Meghan?”', 'Throughout the games the pair were the picture of happiness, with Meghan even gushing over her husband in an impromptu speech during the opening ceremony. “At the Invictus Games I saw a couple very much united in celebrating a hugely worthwhile achievement. The many stories we heard, and which Harry and Meghan listened to, proved that the Games have made a massive difference to servicemen and women injured or scarred by their military experiences,” Jennie explained.', '“I saw a wife who was justifiably proud of what her husband had helped create. And I saw a husband who was hugely grateful for his partner’s support.” Meghan, who was first pictured with Prince Harry while at the 2017 games in Toronto, has supported him at every Invictus Games since.', 'However, with their children - Prince Archie, five, and Princess Lilibet, three - at home in California, Meghan left the competition early to return to them. “Quite understandably, they felt their children shouldn’t be left without them for too long. Toddlers miss their parents, and especially their mum,” Jennie said.', 'So it seemed a perfectly logical compromise for Meghan to return to California, as scheduled, after several very busy and high profile days at the Games - leaving her husband to support the participants till the very end.” But despite heading home partway through the games, the Duchess of Sussex continued to show her support for her husband.', ""On Valentine’s Day, the mum-of-two marked the occasion by sharing a black and white snap on Instagram of herself and Harry kissing. “Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine, as he continues on at the Invictus Games, changing lives and reminding all of us of the power of healing and resilience through these incredible veterans and their families. Beyond proud of my husband and what he's created,” she captioned the post."", '“My love, I will eat burgers & fries and fish & chips with you forever. Thank you for you. #lovewins.”', 'Following this, Jennie encouraged others to “be happy” for the loved-up couple as they continue to champion causes they’re passionate about while forging successful paths from their home in Montecito. “I’m sure they would have loved to be together on Valentine’s Day, but Meghan sent a sweet message to Harry and I bet this was reciprocated. Until, and unless, we see proof to the contrary, let’s be happy for them and their little family,” she said.', 'While the Invictus Games has a special place in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s hearts as it was the backdrop of their first public appearance in 2017, the pair actually began dating in 2016 after Harry came across the former Suits actress on social media.', '“She was wearing a black sweater, jeans, heels. I knew nothing about clothes, but I knew she was chic. Then again, she could make anything look chic,” Harry wrote in his book Spare when discussing their first date.', ""“I'd seen so many photos of her from fashion shoots and TV sets, all glam and glossy, but here she was, in the flesh, no frills, no filter… and even more beautiful. Heart-attack beautiful. I was trying to process this, struggling to understand what was happening to my circulatory and nervous systems, and as a result my brain couldn't handle any more data. Conversation, pleasantries, the Queen's English, all became a challenge.”"", 'After a year of dating, the pair announced their engagement in November 2017 before tying the knot in May 2018 at St George’s Chapel in Windsor.', 'Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inbox', '', 'At Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

When we sat down we shared stories about how we had met before — he signed my line badge and gave me a Prince Harry coin. There were no cameras. There was nothing, no publicity. It was just him and a bunch of guys.”', 'He added, “He’s amazing.
