Sunday's race begins at 3 p.m. ET on the 1.54-mile asphalt track, with drivers competing over 260 laps.

In fact, he's won twice at this track over his last six starts, and no driver in the 2025 Ambetter Health 400 field has more Atlanta victories.

Overall, he's been on a sensational run and has 10 top 10 finishes over his last 13 races at any track.

The cars have less horsepower and are easier to drive. The quest to gain vital track position has compelled teams to devise strategies to compensate, such as running at less than 100 percent throttle to preserve fuel and save precious seconds on pit road.', 'All of this has changed how superspeedway races unfold, creating the impression that no longer is it paramount to be a great driver with a great team but more about biding your time and capitalizing on others’ misfortune and/or mistakes.', '‘They should just make the race 65 laps,” driver Riley Herbst said after Sunday’s race. “We’re all just twiddling our thumbs for 450 miles, and then the crew chief says, ‘OK, you can race now.’ That’s it. And then you wreck.’”', 'Gluck on the new OEP: “NASCAR’s most controversial new rule turned out to be a non-factor this year. When the Open Exemption Provisional was put into the new charter agreement, apparently only Trackhouse Racing saw it or knew about it. So team owner Justin Marks requested a provisional for four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves, who used it to get the new 41st position in the race.', 'That upset both seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson and Martin Truex Jr. (who called it a “slap in the face”). They would have liked to use it themselves and figured they would be worthy contributors as opposed to a driver who had never made a NASCAR start before. Thankfully for NASCAR, both Johnson and Truex promptly qualified on speed. The final two spots were taken by the next-best stories as well; Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s JR Motorsports team made its Cup Series debut and finished in the top 10, and Corey LaJoie gambled his children’s college fund on securing a ride in the 500 (then found a sponsor after putting up the money).”', '', '(Photo by Alex Slitz / Getty Images)', 'Steven Louis Goldstein is a Staff Writer for The Athletic.

NASCAR DFS Picks and Best Bets: Ambetter Health 400,https://www.rotowire.com/racing/article/nascar-dfs-picks-and-best-bets-2025-ambetter-health-400-90372,"['This article is part of our NASCAR DFS series.', 'Location: Hampton, Ga.\nCourse: Atlanta Motor Speedway\nFormat: 1.5-mile quad-oval\nLaps: 260', ""The NASCAR Cup Series continues superspeedway racing this week in the Ambetter 400 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. While the track is a 1.5-mile quad-oval, the circuit's reprofiling before the 2022 season, along with the current rules package, makes it a pack-style race like Daytona or Talladega. While speed in the draft and the ability to make passes through the congested field remain the same goals, there are some key differences fantasy players should expect this week. Being shorter and more narrow, Atlanta's racing surface offers less room for the massive pack of cars to sort themselves out. The slightly less steep banking and having a mile less of lap distance makes average speeds slightly slower than last week, too. Despite the speeds being down, things still happen very quickly on the smaller track. A driver having to back off or lose momentum means a quick loss of track position, and the narrower lanes make contact between cars even more likely. Last year's race had 10 cautions, nine of which were for spins or contact, and there was a 16-car crash on lap 3. Mistakes on this track are punished hard, which puts extra pressure on teams and drivers to execute to perfection on track and on pit road."", '2024 fall - Joey Logano\n2024 spring - Daniel Suarez\n2023 fall - William Byron\n2023 spring - Joey Logano\n2022 fall - Chase Elliott\n2022 spring - William Byron\n2021 fall - Kurt Busch\n2021 spring - Ryan Blaney\n2020 - Kevin Harvick\n2019 - Brad Keselowski', ""The high-powered draft at Atlanta bunches the field together, but the smaller track and greater opportunity to lose momentum makes passing possible. The 1.5-mile oval's shorter lap distance and narrower racing lines when compared with Daytona or Talladega mean less margin of error and a greater chance of being involved in someone else's mistake, though. There just isn't as much room for cars to go when problems happen as at the larger superspeedways. Qualifying is still less of a factor, though. Teams will try to  set their cars up to handle well in turbulent air and allow their driver to make aggressive moves in traffic. Track position remains important at the end, though. While drivers may opt to play it safe at the back through as much of the race as possible, they must move forward in time to be at the front for stage and race finishes. Daniel Suarez won this race last season starting from the 23rd position. Pit strategy can be the easiest way to make up ground like we saw some teams do last week. Avoiding accidents, making no mistakes on pit road, and having a car that can work through the mass of traffic are keys to Atlanta success. "", 'NASCAR Lineup Optimizer', 'NASCAR Projections', 'DraftKings Tier 1 Values  ', 'Ryan Blaney - $9,800\nJoey Logano - $9,700\nChase Elliott - $9,500\nAustin Cindric - $9,000', 'DraftKings Tier 2 Values  ', 'Kyle Busch - $8,800\nChris Buescher - $8,600\nBubba Wallace - $8,300\nDaniel Suarez - $8,100', 'DraftKings Tier 3 Values', 'Tyler Reddick - $7,800\nRoss Chastain - $7,600\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. - $7,500\nTodd Gilliland - $7,000', 'DraftKings Long-Shot Values', 'AJ Allmendinger - $6,900\nErik Jones - $6,800\nJustin Haley - $6,700\nCorey Lajoie - $6,200', 'Ryan Blaney - $9,800\nAustin Cindric - $9,000\nKyle Busch - $8,800\nDaniel Suarez - $7,100\nTodd Gilliland - $7,000\nAJ Allmendinger - $6,900', ""Fantasy players have a plethora of options to set up a really compelling superspeedway roster this week at Atlanta. Not only are some of the likely contenders inexpensively priced, but some of the drivers to avoid are among the most expensive. Leading off our choices is Ryan Blaney (DK $9,800, FD $14,000). The Team Penske driver was not only consistently fast at Daytona last week, he hasn't finished lower than ninth at Atlanta since 2022. His only track win came on the old configuration, but that statistic seems destined to change soon. Teammate Austin Cindric (DK $9,00, FD $12,000) has also been really good here since the track changed. He hasn't finished lower than 12th since 2022 and enters this week's race having finished fourth and 10th with 124 laps led in the two Atlanta races last season. These two superspeedway standouts are not the most expensive drivers this week, which leaves plenty of salary cap space for even more bargains. Kyle Busch (DK $8,800, FD $13,000) is one of those. Busch's switch to RCR and Chevrolet in 2023 set him off on the right path at this track. He finished just 33rd and 20th at this version of Atlanta in a Toyota in 2022. Since switching to Chevrolet, he hasn't finished lower than 10th. The Richard Childress Racing driver was in contention for the win last week when bad luck bit, too. Another Chevrolet driver getting the job done at Atlanta is last year's winner of this race, Daniel Suarez (DK $7,100, FD $10,000). The Trackhouse Racing driver might be the biggest bargain on the board, too. Not only did he win NASCAR's closest three-way finish here last season, but he finished as the runner up in two of the last three, too. Since this track was reconfigured, Suarez only failed to finish inside of the top six on one occasion when he was involved in a crash."", ""There are still values to be had even deeper down the price list. Todd Gilliland (DK $7,000, FD $6,000) is one of those. Following post-race inspection, he was penalized 10 championship points for having unsecured ballast in last week's Daytona 500 and will be working hard to recover the lost ground in the championship this week. Atlanta is a good opportunity for him to make up ground, too. Gilliland started inside the top 10 at this track in the three most recent races, led 58 laps in this race last season, and has three finishes of 17th or better with two of those coming from starts outside of the top 20. We know Gilliland can race with the best at superspeedways, and with a little luck this week, he could be in store for a career-best finish. Fantasy players shouldn't sleep on AJ Allmendinger (DK $6,900, FD $4,800) either. An early engine issue ruled him out of the Daytona 500 before it barely got started, but he should be able to recover some lost ground this week, too. Allmendinger has 15 series starts at Atlanta with four top-10 finishes. His best finish at the track came on its current superspeedway iteration in 2023 when he started 19th and finished third. In four Xfinity races on this configuration, he finished no lower than 13th and an average of 7.25."", 'Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook as of 3:00 PM ET Friday', 'Race Winner - Austin Cindric +1300, Daniel Suarez +2500\nTop-10 Finish - Erik Jones +170, John Hunter Nemechek +360\nDriver Matchups - Daniel Suarez -120  vs. Kyle Larson', ""After Team Penske's showing a week ago at Daytona, wagerers should keep Austin Cindric high on their list of race-winner options for Atlanta. Cindric hasn't finished lower than 12th at the track since the fall race of 2022, and it seems likely that Penske Ford advantage he enjoyed last week will continue this Sunday. While any of the Penske drivers could be good options, Cindric offers the best odds without sacrificing any potential. A driver deeper in the odds to consider would be Daniel Suarez. With top-two finishes in his last three Atlanta starts, one might think his odds would be significantly less. However, Suarez has shown that he knows how to race well at this track and he delivers top Atlanta finishes consistently, which gives wagerers a big potential payoff this week."", ""Odds among drivers seeking a top-10 finish are much more narrow. However, given last week's race, we have a little insight as to who could pull off the surprise. Given both Erik Jones and John Hunter Nemechek's presence at the front of the field late at Daytona a week ago, it would not be shocking to see them with similar potential this week. Jones finished 12th and Nemechek was fifth in last week's 500. Both played the race smartly and used the equalizer of the draft to outperform expectations. It would not be unreasonable to envision either driver bagging a top-10 finish this week at Atlanta in mostly similar race conditions."", 'The final wager folks should consider is the head-to-head matchup between Daniel Suarez and Kyle Larson. At almost any other track, I might tell you to take Larson, but not this week. While Suarez has been racking up the accolades at Atlanta, Larson has been doing the opposite. Since the track was reconfigured to act like a superspeedway, Larson has earned a best finish of just 13th. His average Atlanta finish from 2022 through 2024 is 29.8. He also crashed out of five of those six races. In contrast, Suarez has a win, two runner-up finishes, and an average of 7.3 in the same period and just one DNF.', '']"

Best NASCAR Bets and Predictions for the Ambetter Health 400 in Atlanta,https://www.fanduel.com/research/best-nascar-bets-and-predictions-for-the-ambetter-health-400-in-atlanta,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Subscribe to our newsletter', ""Although both Atlanta and Daytona involve drafting, this week's stop for the NASCAR Cup Series does involve some key differences."", 'First, handling matters more, leading to more strung-out packs throughout the race.', ""Second -- which is partly attributable to the first point -- the incident rate is lower. While it's still higher than most tracks, drivers are less likely to be involved in a crash here than Daytona, leading to fewer long-shots threatening for a win."", ""In fact, in six races at the reconfigured Atlanta, only three different teams -- Hendrick, Penske, and Trackhouse -- have won. It's more top-heavy, meaning you'll see higher-end win probability numbers here than last week's opener."", ""Still, at least in FanDuel Sportsbook's NASCAR betting odds, I think there's value in some longshots."", ""Below, you can see my model's simulations of this race entering the weekend. Then, we'll dig into which bets I like this week based on those numbers."", ""(UPDATE: Bowman has since shortened to +2800. I'm still more than fine with that as a value, and he is currently the biggest value on the board by my numbers.)"", ""Alex Bowman's track record in the draft during the Next-Gen era is too good for his betting odds to be this long."", 'He has run 18 pack races since the start of 2022. In that time, Bowman has 4 top-5s and 8 top-10s. Two of those top-10s have come in Atlanta, including a fifth-place run last year.', ""In that one, Bowman ran up front all race, finished third in both stages, and had a fifth-place average running position. It was a new approach as the Hendrick cars don't tend to dominate drafting tracks, but it did work well there. He followed it up with a sixth-place finish last week in Daytona."", 'My model has Bowman at 4.8% to win, up from 3.2% implied. Although he has never won a pack race, he has been runner-up twice. I think he has the upside to break through here.', ""(UPDATE: Gilliland has since shortened to +3000 to win. I'm still showing value there -- his new implied odds are 3.2%, and I have him at 4.1% -- but I do prefer Bowman in the same range if you're picking just one outright to bet.)"", ""Todd Gilliland was the man to beat in this race last year. Thus, I'm showing value on him both to win and finish top five (+550), but the outright provides us a bigger edge."", 'In the 2024 spring race, Gilliland led a race-high 58 laps. His ninth-place average running position was third-best of all drivers, trailing only Ryan Blaney and Austin Cindric. He got caught up in a crash with 20 laps left, torpedoing his day.', ""That has been a theme for Gilliland at these tracks: run well, snag stage points, get caught up in someone's mess. This could mean Gilliland can't hang when the intensity ratchets up, but I don't think the sample on him in quality superspeedway equipment is large enough to say that yet."", ""Thus, I'm inclined to agree with the model that Gilliland is undervalued. I've got him at 4.1% to win, a healthy bit above his 2.4% implied odds."", '(UPDATE: Gragson has since shortened to +750 to finish top 5. I agree with this movement, but he has moved to a point where he is no longer a value for me. I have him at 9.4% versus 11.8% implied.)', ""Now that he's Gilliland's teammate, we know Noah Gragson will have a rocketship this weekend. I like snagging him as a longshot for a top five."", 'Even last year with Stewart-Haas Racing, Gragson was solid in the draft. He finished third in Talladega and ninth in Daytona early in the season. He was also 12th in Atlanta in 2023, a year where nothing went well for him.', 'This comes after Gragson was a threat in the draft in the Xfinity Series. He won Talladega in 2022 and Daytona in 2020 with handful of other top-fives inbetween. He led 37 and 38 laps in the two races he ran at the reconfigured Atlanta, as well.', ""Blend it all together, and my model has Gragson in the top five 9.4% of the time, up from 8.3% implied. That's a big enough edge for me to bite."", ""For this final outright slot, I was torn between Chris Buescher and William Byron (+2200). Buescher's the bigger value, by my numbers, but I think the model is lower on Byron than it should be. Thus, I don't mind if you want both. But with two mid-week outrights on the card for me already, I'll rock with just Buescher here, thus guaranteeing victory for Byron."", ""The case for Buescher -- in my eyes -- is strong. He's a good pack racer, highlighted by his win in Daytona in 2023. In 19 pack races during the Next-Gen era, he has two other top-fives in addition to that win with seven total top-10s. Two of those top-10 runs have come here in Atlanta."", ""The reason I wound up siding with Buescher over Byron is Ford's speed. They occupied nine of the top 10 slots in qualifying, a group that will include Buescher as he rolls off eighth. As we saw in the Truck and Xfinity races on Saturday, that raw power is tougher to overcome here than at Daytona, so I do think it matters at least to an extent."", ""My model has Buescher at 4.9% to win, up from 3.9% implied. He and Bowman are the only drivers on whom I'm a full percentage point above market as things stand."", 'New to FanDuel Sportsbook? You’ll receive $150 in Bonus Bets if your first $5+ bet wins!

It was an impressive showing for Penske with the Penske-aligned Wood Brothers Racing team in third with Josh Berry and reigning series champion Joey Logano in fourth (and with no webbed glove this time). "", ""But what made Saturday's qualifying session so stunning was the fact that Ford drivers earned ten of the first eleven spots on the grid.

Ford could potentially control a good portion of the race unchallenged, collecting piles of stage points.', 'Blaney is set up for an ideal start to Sunday\'s with a sea of Fords around him, including his teammates. He told media after his pole run, ""... It is reassuring when you have more Fords around you. You never know when someone is going to hang you out to dry, but that\'s racing.

You are going to get shuffled at some point. Pit strategy is going to come into play so I just need to react to that.

NASCAR Atlanta Picks and Predictions: Blaney Ready to Dominate After Daytona Survival,https://www.predictem.com/nascar/nascar-ambetter-health-400-picks-and-predictions-2025/,"['BY VIRGINIA VROOM | LAST UPDATED FEB 19, 2025 | NASCAR', '', 'Date: Sunday February 23, 2025', 'Track: Atlanta Motor Speedway', 'Time: 3pm ET', 'Channel: FOX', 'Good to see that Ryan Preece has a sense of humor! This poor guy has flipped in two of the last four Daytona races, which is obviously not ideal. Preece preached safety and brought NASCAR to attention calling out the need for the cars to stay grounded. He mentioned the fact that the hit didn’t seem like it warranted flipping the car and making it go airborne. I’ve always been curious about the plate on the bottom of these cars, which seems counterintuitive to keeping a car from catching air. Although he was a bit shaken up, as to be expected, he still gave us a good laugh by releasing a photo of him in a spacesuit. Preece was ready to go to the moon!', 'I’m fairly certain that wasn’t the end result that anyone wanted, but there was quite a bit of carnage throughout the day in this race, which was postponed for hours due to rain. Ultimately, one of the biggest wrecks of the race happened with just 4 laps remaining. Joey Logano made what Jeff Gordon called out as a “dumb move” causing Stenhouse Jr. to turn around and collect a total of 14 cars. Logano defended his move as a block, but if you look at the footage, it really was pretty stupid from a hindsight perspective. While he tried to say you don’t win a race from not making the move, taking out a third of the field is not a great move either. Cole Custer also tried to make a move on the last lap that resulted in Denny Hamlin being collected. Custer was enthusiastic about his opportunity and was just doing his best to possibly capture a win in the sport’s biggest race. Hamlin was surprisingly graceful at the end during his interview, recognizing the Custer’s move back to the Cup Series from Xfinity is an opportunity to gain experience. Superspeedways require a special skill set, with the best teacher being that of experience.', 'Luckily, the drivers and teams aren’t going to have to deal with the high stakes of a superspeedway this weekend, but they are still going to be dealing with quite a bit of speed. William Byron, who came home victorious at Daytona is going to try to see another checkered flag first on Sunday. Byron was one of only 6 drivers not involved in some sort of accident at Daytona, which was a feat in and of itself. For Byron, it wasn’t necessarily a win of sheer luck. Superspeedways require a level of skill to stay out of accidents and understand the pushes, runs, and drag on these cars to remain competitive. Atlanta won’t necessarily give us the same style of racing, but we will definitely see a high level of speed nonetheless. This track is a 1.54 mile quad-oval with 24 degrees of banking through the turns and 5 degrees on the straights. Because there is still a high degree of banking, the momentum coming off the turns is tremendous with little braking happening throughout the race. We see a lot of lap traffic at Atlanta and there is even a good amount of three-wide racing. Through the years, multiple grooves have developed allowing drivers to choose where their car does best.', 'When it comes to picking a winner at Atlanta, the strength that we saw at Daytona is pretty telling for some of these teams. In all honesty, though, we can’t take the results for truth because of the amount of carnage that occurred, taking out some of the strongest teams throughout the day. Other than Byron’s Chevrolet taking the top spot, the remainder of the top 5 drivers were Toyotas. Alex Bowman was the next best Chevrolet in 6th place followed by Blaney and Cindric in Fords to round out the top eight spots. At Atlanta last year, we didn’t see that many Toyotas in the top 10. Bubba Wallace was the best finishing ‘Yota driver in 5th position. Daniel Suarez won this race in a Chevy and was trailed by Ryan Blaney in a Ford. I think that Blaney is going to bring something to the track to win this year. He came home 7th at Daytona and was spared from the majority of the chaos. After a runner-up finish last year at Atlanta, he’s going to look to capitalize on previous success and get that checkered flag in 2025. Let’s take a look at your potential winners heading into Atlanta this weekend with odds provided by Bovada:', 'Winner: Ryan Blaney +800\nMid-Range Pick: Kyle Busch +1200\nDark Horse: Daniel Suarez +2000', 'Bet your Ambetter Health 400 predictions for FREE by scoring a massive 100% REAL CASH bonus on your first deposit of $100 to $500 when you enter bonus promo code PREDICTEM at Betnow!', 'Suarez has been hit or miss and didn’t have the best season last year outside of Atlanta. This was the one track that he was able to really soar at, bringing home a win early in the season. He will be a sleeper this weekend but certainly someone to watch. Kyle Busch, well, what can we say here? He’s fallen off the radar in recent races and is struggling to produce top-level results. Busch lacks execution and the level of assertiveness that we’re used to seeing from him. Will Atlanta bring that back to fruition? With a 7th best average finish in 6 starts, it’s possible that we can see the train turn around for this team. I’d really like to see Busch come back with some success this year after having such a rough season in 2024. Ultimately, though, Ryan Blaney comes in with the best average finish in the last 6 starts. While he doesn’t have any wins, he’s got 3 top 5s and 5 top 10s. He’s consistent, and his team knows how to bring the speed.', 'Blaney will have a lot of drivers to battle around, with guys like Chase Elliott and William Byron continuing to look for wins. The entire Hendrick garage is strong if we’re being honest. Notoriously, though, this is not the best track for that team, so who’s to say that HMS might struggle a touch this weekend? Atlanta is a fun track. Most of the drivers really love coming here following the chaos that is Daytona. This is a place where speed carries over, but the level of predictability is much higher. Will Blaney be able to hold off the HMS drivers and bring that Penske power to victory lane? Stay tuned for another great weekend of racing as these guys head to Atlanta Motor Speedway!']"

"NASCAR Cup Series at Atlanta odds, expert picks for Ambetter Health 400: Will we get another wild finish?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6149002/2025/02/22/nascar-cup-series-atlanta-odds-picks-ambetter-health-400/,"['Sports Betting', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'First, we have to ask about Daytona. We want your unvarnished takes. that NASCAR “has little incentive to try to address the fuel-mileage game because it looks spectacular on TV.” But then it’s also ridiculous watching a race where it’s smooth sailing for 499 miles, and then the last stretch is, as The Athletic’s own Chris Sprow said it, “like letting the Masters end in a knife fight on the 18th fairway.” Does NASCAR need to make changes to the superspeedway race? Is it a “good” race?', 'Jeff: Superspeedway racing has always been a bit of a game of chance. Sure, some drivers are better at it than others. But whenever you have 35 cars racing around in a giant pack, all it takes is one small mistake to wipe out half of the field. That said, I don’t think it’s good to have the Daytona 500 repeatedly decided this way. There were always “Big One” wrecks at some point, but with this car, the race format has encouraged drivers to push and shove until the pot boils over — often on the final lap. NASCAR needs the best superspeedway drivers to be able to show their skills en route to the win (i.e., a spectacular pass or ballsy block); otherwise, it feels too much like spinning the roulette wheel to determine the biggest race of the season.', 'Jordan: First off, what’s wrong with letting the Masters end with a knife fight? This sounds wildly entertaining. As for what, if any, changes NASCAR could make to alter the current nature of superspeedway racing, the league’s options are limited. The Next Gen car is here to stay. Fundamentally altering the track is completely off the table. And teams are always going to look for an edge to gain any possible advantage, which entails telling their drivers to go into fuel-saving mode to minimize time on pit road. Superspeedway racing continually evolves and takes on different forms, and right now, this is the era we’re in — which, to be honest, isn’t all that different from the previous era that routinely saw the Daytona 500 have late crashes, upset winners and drivers frequently lament superspeedway racing.', '', '', 'Jeff: Austin Cindric truly is an elite superspeedway racer. Unfortunately, he didn’t get the result to show for it — not his fault at all — but he displayed the patience and poise that is often required to win these things. Denny Hamlin was full of praise for Cindric on his podcast, and people are paying attention now.', 'Jordan: That it was William Byron who virtually locked himself into the playoff field is notable. Daytona is one of those tracks that affords a driver who’s unlikely to make the playoffs an opportunity to steal a bid. But with Byron punching his playoff ticket, this assures that the playoff field will include at least one driver who is viewed as a serious title contender.', '', 'Jeff: Well, it depends. Last year was so unique because they actually got to race it out instead of all crashing on the last lap. Suarez told us last week that Atlanta racing is like watching a video on 1.5 speed while Daytona is like normal speed; the runs happen so quickly at the mini superspeedway that drivers cannot throw crazy blocks as easily. That may be the secret ingredient to why Atlanta has raced so well since getting reconfigured.', 'Jordan: The potential is certainly there for another memorable finish, with Atlanta becoming one of NASCAR’s most entertaining tracks since it was reconfigured three years ago. But the one thing to be mindful of is that as the track continues to wear, it becomes less a mini version of Daytona/Talladega and more reminiscent of its previous configuration. This metamorphosis isn’t going to suddenly happen, but ever so gradually, and some drivers have said they’re already seeing the change. It will be interesting to see what the racing is like on Sunday.', '', 'Jeff: There’s one strategy that involves racing in the back for the entire race and letting others crash ahead of you, then trying to pick up positions at the end. Corey LaJoie, for example, raced toward the front at Daytona but then gave up stage points and dropped out of the running at the end of each stage; he’s not running full time, so why risk getting in a crash for the stage win? But for the most part, crash avoidance is pretty much luck. That’s why people felt Byron got lucky on Sunday at Daytona; he was seventh when the six cars crashed in front of him on the final lap, and a hole opened up, and he drove through it.', '', 'Jordan: There are some drivers who have a good sense for when a crash is about to develop and recognize they need to remove themselves from the position they’re currently in. You’ll often see this on a superspeedway where a driver will suddenly drop out of the pack thinking a wreck is about to occur. Denny Hamlin is one of the best at this, which is among the reasons he’s often so strong whenever the series visits Daytona and Talladega.', '', 'Jeff: Surprisingly, showed that 83.6 percent of NASCAR fans already have an Amazon Prime subscription. I was shocked by that. I’m not sure it will help NASCAR attract new viewers, but the extra money the sport brought in by selling off part of the season to Prime is something that will benefit everyone, from teams to racetracks.', 'Jordan: Partnering with a streaming service was a smart business decision by NASCAR, something that was long overdue. Talking with teams, most see the upside both in the immediate (additional revenue) and long term (future growth), even if it perhaps makes the sport less accessible — though, based on Jeff’s recent reporting, this seems to be a misnomer. The question that still needs to be answered is: Will partnering with Amazon help NASCAR attract new fans? All parties involved know this is imperative and believe they’re now well-positioned to do just this. We’ll see.', '', 'Jeff: I’ll go with Cindric, as mentioned earlier. He’s actually tied for the third-best odds, so people are onto his superspeedway prowess now. But let’s remember it’s still a superspeedway where upsets often occur (just look at Suarez last year), so there’s no need to stick to the favorites this week.', 'Jordan: Team Penske is the best when it comes to superspeedways, and this applies to Atlanta, too. Last year, Blaney nearly won this race, only to lose in a photo finish to Suarez. And in the fall, teammate Logano began his march to a third Cup Series title by winning the playoff opener here. This is a long way of saying you can’t go wrong with either Blaney or Logano, nor Penske’s third driver, Cindric, who led the most laps in the Daytona 500.', 'Who is a long shot you like?', 'Jeff: Erik Jones should have won Duel No. 2 last week at Daytona (except for an ill-timed caution flag less than 100 yards from the finish), and the Legacy Motor Club cars all finished in the top 11. Let’s see if that translates over, since he’s +4000 on BetMGM. And although for triggering the last two Big Ones at Daytona, let’s remember he was running toward the front in the first place; he’s +6000, so that might not be a bad driver to take a chance on.', 'Jordan: Todd Gilliland is one “long shot” that offers good value, as he’s listed at +4000 on some boards. Gilliland nearly won this race last year and often places himself in contention on superspeedways. Also consider Michael McDowell (+4000 on DraftKings), Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (+4500) and Noah Gragson (+7000). Seeing any of these three winning on Sunday would not be a surprise at all.', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
