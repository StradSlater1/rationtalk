In my opinion, Villa and City away are two very difficult games so you can drop points there.', '“We are in a good position but we also know how hard it is to play against Wolves. Now we play Newcastle on Wednesday, who we drew 3-3 with. In every other league, having a lead like this would be comfortable.', '“Three days ago we had a draw at Villa and people told me we weren’t in a good place and then three days later we win and it changes again.

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'Mind the gap. It looks unbridgeable now: 11 points to Arsenal, a barely credible 20 to Manchester City. A title race that began with City as red-hot favourites could be almost over before February is. The dominant team this season, Liverpool were vastly superior at the Etihad Stadium.', 'With Arne Slot borrowing from Pep Guardiola’s tactical blueprint to outwit the master with his twin false nines, with the magnificent Mohamed Salah underlining his credentials to win the individual awards, with Dominik Szoboszlai delivering perhaps the finest display of his Liverpool career, with Virgil van Dijk marshalling a defence that had conceded too often in the last two-and-a-half months to deliver a display of defiance, this felt like the victory that ended any doubt. A 20th league title is bound for Anfield.', 'Slot, needless to say, was too cautious to say as much. “What we do know is no one saw us a title contender at the start,” he claimed. Now they seem the only contender left. “In every other league, having a lead like this would be comfortable,” Slot argued. There was no hiding his pleasure at the result, though: “If you play away at the Etihad and win there it is always a big win, no matter what the league table looks like.”', 'Dramatically different after a weekend when Arsenal lost but Slot counselled: “It is only three days ago someone asked me if we had a dip.” But a team who wobbled at Everton and Aston Villa made a statement at the Etihad. There have been a few from Slot’s side this season, the first on the other side of Manchester, the majority at Anfield. A double over City signalled the shift in the balance of power: from blue to red, Manchester to Merseyside.', 'For Liverpool, it was a first league win at the Etihad since 2015, for Guardiola a first top-flight defeat at home to them. For City, it has been a chastening few days, run ragged first by Kylian Mbappe and now Salah. There was a time when City were Europe and England’s best. Now they have suffered comprehensive defeats to the Champions League holders and the Premier League leaders in a few days. “We are far away from them,” sighed Guardiola. “That is the reality.”', 'This has been a symbolic spell, showing the undignified decline from mighty to mediocre, the need for change and the difficulty in moving on. Guardiola said he picked: “A so, so young team that will be the future of this club.” He left out Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan, men he called “legends of the club”, looking for fresh legs. Instead, he got fresh problems.', 'And the familiar feeling of defeat. As Liverpool extended their unbeaten run to 23 league games, City suffered a 14th loss in 27 matches in all competitions. They have conceded 51 goals in that time. By coincidence, Salah’s personal haul now stands at 51 for the season: reaching 30 goals, he has 21 assists, too. For an 11th time in the top flight this season, he both scored and made a goal. On this occasion, so did Szoboszlai, granted more freedom to run as Guardiola emptied the centre of the pitch, his tactics backfiring. He tried trading control for chaos; leaving Nico Gonzalez alone in an undermanned midfield was a risk that did not pay off; no wonder the new signing was nowhere near Szoboszlai when he scored.', 'And the manager who revived the false-nine tactic saw Liverpool deploy a striker-less shape, unexpectedly but effectively. Guardiola was beaten by Guardiolaisation. For the first time, Slot fielded a side without a centre-forward, but with Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones advancing from midfield. “We played with two number 10s,” said the Hungarian.', 'Liverpool troubled City with runners from deep, balls behind their defence and the irresistible Salah. They scored first from a well-worked short corner, devised by the set-piece coach, and former City analyst, Aaron Briggs. “Someone came up with a brilliant plan and we knew that space could be there,” said Slot. It was practiced on the training ground on Saturday and brought a goal on Sunday. Alexis Mac Allister skimmed a pass across the turf to Szoboszlai, who laid it back for Salah. His shot was deflected in off Nathan Ake for a 21st goal in his last 20 league games. “The numbers speak for themselves,” added Slot.', 'In a tale of two Egyptians, both found the net but, fine as Omar Marmoush’s angled finish was, City’s recent signing was offside. Marmoush started as a striker for the first time, with Erling Haaland still absent. He was at least lively, denied by Alisson from another rasping shot. Jeremy Doku was bright while Abdukodir Khusanov made a trio of terrific blocks. Yet the positives for City ended there. Kevin De Bruyne had a traumatic time, almost hitting the corner flag with a particularly wayward shot.', 'Nor did Josko Gvardiol have much to relish as Liverpool exposed City’s defensive frailties on their left. It brought the second goal. Gvardiol, sent sliding in the wrong direction by Mbappe four days earlier, was turned inside out by Salah. He passed, Szoboszlai shot, Ederson going to his right as the ball went past him on his left. It was another indication of a team who have lost their way.', 'But Liverpool were clinical. Ederson made a spectacular save from Luis Diaz but was beaten by the first two shots on target he faced. City had plenty of possession but, minus Haaland, no incision. “We get to the byline a lot but then just from there we missed the magic,” lamented Guardiola. Liverpool were resilient. “If you play away against a Pep team it is almost impossible to have more ball possession,” said Slot. “We knew we had to defend a lot and that is what we did really well.”', 'They did. The week that began with Liverpool showing nerves against lowly Wolves finished with them displaying none as they saw off City. “""It is easier for us to not get excited,” said Slot. But it will be hard for anyone to peg them back.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

He has 30 goals for the campaign, but a broader goal has emerged. ""We need another title,” he said. “Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title.”', 'Salah has long used personal ambitions to fuel the collective good. His 241st Liverpool goal means he is now tied with Gordon Hodgson, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt in the all-time list. If the Ballon d’Or has long seemed a trophy on his wishlist, now he is looking for further success for the group of old-timers.', 'Perhaps they are Liverpool’s big five, the quintet who started the 2019 Champions League final and who, six years on, are still the core. Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson, Virgil van Dijk and Salah are the survivors of a sensational team.', 'They were fundamental in Liverpool 1.0, to adapt Jurgen Klopp’s phrase. He christened the team he bequeathed Arne Slot Liverpool 2.0. Now they are 11 points clear of Arsenal.', 'Slot, with his innate ability to downplay anything, countered: “I would hope the ones that haven’t won it yet - that you call not the big ones - that they would want to win something as well.” And so they surely do: Dominik Szoboszlai, the other scorer at the Etihad, didn’t hear the fans singing that they were going to win the league because, on the final whistle, he collapsed to the turf in exhaustion. He had run many a mile.', 'But, surely, they are going to win it. Arsenal have a game in hand but are only on course to get 77 points. That would mean Liverpool would only need another 14. They have seven remaining home games. Glory beckons.', 'And Salah’s unfulfilled ambition reflects two elements: that one Premier League title is an unflattering return considering Liverpool’s excellence over his seven years at Anfield. And that, for the old guard, this may be the last chance; certainly together. Famously, Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold are out of contract in the summer, with the right-back likeliest to leave and an impasse making it feel possible the top scorer goes, too. For Alisson, there is the spectre of Giorgi Mamardashvili, bought but parked at Valencia. For Robertson, it could be the end for another reason: age may be catching up with the valiant left-back and a successor sought.', 'They were pillars of a side that earned 97, 99 and 92 points in Premier League seasons. In two of them, though, they only came second. They hold the bittersweet distinction of the two highest points totals ever secured by runners-up.', 'There is an obvious reason why: the side they beat on Sunday, the club they are dethroning this season. Klopp was Pep Guardiola’s greatest rival and, no matter what Slot achieves, may forever remain that. The German has a winning record against the Catalan. Yet Guardiola won six Premier League titles, Klopp one. He left Liverpool saying he could have won more: but for City, and Real Madrid in their Champions League finals, he would have done.', 'He is one of the five greatest Premier League managers. But the other four – Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Guardiola – all won the division at least three times. Now Slot, at the first time of asking, is set to draw level with Klopp. Red Bull’s Head of Global Soccer could be forgiven for thinking he left a year too soon, before City spiralled into decline, Arsenal lost creativity and goals, forwards and discipline, in pivotal moments.', 'Slot may have demurred with Salah’s suggestion; or the implication, anyway, that the stalwarts needed the title more. For him, it would be an immediate way of proving himself a worthy successor to Klopp.', 'But there was a significance to Salah’s comments. The Saudi millions have been dangled in front of him before, and may be again. His motivations are not purely financial. Players can retire with memories, medals and money; in Salah’s case, probably all three. But a second Premier League title would elevate him a little further. His contribution is greater the second time around: in 2019-20, Salah got 19 goals and 10 assists in the league. Now, with 11 games to go, he has scored 25 and made a further 16. Five years ago, he only outscored Sadio Mane by one, while Alexander-Arnold and Robertson registered more assists. Now Salah is in a different league to everyone else: six clear in the division’s goal charts, six clear in the assists table.', 'He has scored and assisted in both games against City this season. He has helped take the title from them. It is one way in which it is the end of an era at City, as a title-winning teams break up. This season may be an end for Liverpool’s big five, the last before they are broken up. But if Salah, Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Robertson and Van Dijk go their separate ways, it will surely be with the title the Egyptian has in his sights.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

Liverpool defended their advantage with as much ludicrous ease as they established it at the formerly impenetrable home of their greatest modern rival, and their bottling title collapse ultimately consisted of two forgivable away draws and a sketchy win.', 'With half as many shots as Manchester City and a club-record low share of possession in a win, they administered exponentially more damage. Liverpool scored with two of their first three attempts at goal and proceeded with such serenity that from the 75th minute onwards they had three efforts to the one mustered by their impotent, game-chasing hosts.', 'If there is to be an extended title procession, this was a fitting performance. Liverpool didn’t even bother with the rigmarole of keeping the ball in the corner flag towards the end, instead electing in stoppage time to pass it between the shadows – both literal and figurative – giving vague chase, before still launching attacks in numbers at 2-0. In that moment especially, Manchester City were a flawless characterisation of the rest of the league: not nearly good enough.', ' ', '2) It was a stark contrast to Liverpool’s last Premier League victory at the Etihad, when Jurgen Klopp secured his second win as manager with what legal obligations still require to be called a swashbuckling, all-action attacking masterclass in November 2015.', 'For all the club has achieved and won since, their subsequent visits outside of cup competitions had resulted in frustration or disappointment over almost a decade.', 'In his first Etihad trip, Arne Slot conducted a display of unerring calm, control and efficiency as Liverpool became the first side ever to do the league double over a Pep Guardiola team while not conceding in either game.', 'Both were stunning statement victories played to the respective manager’s blueprint. That Slot achieved his en route to matching Klopp’s Premier League title haul in his first season is a remarkable feat which has been underplayed and normalised.', ' ', '3) It does help having one of the league’s greats operating at his irresistible peak. Mo Salah seems to struggle not breaking a record each time he plays nowadays but this match did seem particularly egregious for bar-raising brilliance.', 'He became – and thanks to Opta for a great deal of these – the first player to score or assist 40 or more goals in two different Premier League seasons; the first player older than 27 to score or assist 40 or more goals in a single Premier League season; the first player to score 25 goals and register 15 assists in a single Premier League season; the first player in Premier League history to score and assist in both games of a season against the reigning champions; Liverpool’s leading assist provider in a single Premier League season.', 'All that from one game – one half, even – and with 11 matches of the campaign remaining. This is probably already in the top five for greatest individuals seasons in Premier League history and Liverpool have still got Southampton, Leicester and Spurs to play.', 'Eleven players have scored 11 goals or more in the Premier League this season; Salah has scored and assisted in 11 different games. This is not normal and it needs calling out.', ' ', '4) Perhaps the most ludicrous statistic from this particular game was that less than a year separates Salah and Kevin de Bruyne: two Premier League legends whose paths could not have diverged more drastically.', 'As phenomenal as Salah was and is approaching his mid 30s, that age roadblock has caused an emergency stop to De Bruyne’s entire career. He was miserably poor, the first player substituted in what used to be a season-defining clash between two ultra-heavyweights.', 'While Salah still dominates these games as he always has, De Bruyne’s fade from prominence has been unthinkably stark. An anonymous first half ended with the Belgian cutting inside from the right, unleashing the least convincing dummy ever and then smashing a shot near and ultimately over the corner flag.', 'Liverpool will remain locked in delicate contract talks with Salah, who can commence in the knowledge he could have done nothing more to increase his value this season; if negotiations between Manchester City and De Bruyne had not already stalled over his own expiring deal, that act might have seen them break down as thoroughly as the man himself.', 'Content continues below', ' ', '5) De Bruyne misplaced a pass in the build-up to the opening goal but it was Rico Lewis who conceded the corner under pressure.', 'Manchester City had enjoyed the better start, played to the backdrop of Gary Neville’s new single “Good Spaces”, ft. Omar Marmoush, but they cannot have expected the league’s worst team at attacking set-pieces to unleash upon them a routine so wonderfully crafted that Nicolas Jover is reported to be considering legal action.', 'It was certainly weird to see Liverpool score from such a delightful move, with Alexis Mac Allister’s low delivery flicked into Salah’s path by Dominik Szoboszlai. It was stranger still that the cameras didn’t have a mysterious coach to cut to while the commentators freely aired passive-aggressive suspicions about The Modern Game. And worrying for Liverpool’s title contenders – are they in the room with us now? – if they are adding more feathers to an already crowded bow.', ' ', '6) The defending was suitably diabolical; Manchester City have not conceded more goals in all competitions (61) than any other Premier League side bar Leicester and Southampton this season by accident.', 'Leaving Salah unmarked in the penalty area seems like a mistake in any situation but the second goal came without the caveat of zonal marking or whatever Manchester City elected to do from that corner.', 'Twenty minutes later, Salah had the ball on the halfway line. He played it back to Trent Alexander-Arnold, waited briefly and then made the same run behind the defence as Szoboszlai, who noted he was offside and so instead drifted inside to wait for the pass. He actively jogged for about 20 yards without any suggestion an opponent might even notice him, before giving Ederson the eyes and placing his shot into the corner.', 'Content continues below', 'One simple ball over the top. No pressure applied to the player passing from deep – and few do that better than Alexander-Arnold. Josko Gvardiol’s weak and entirely ineffective handling of Salah. The absolute lack of responsibility in picking up either Szoboszlai or Curtis Jones, who was waiting behind after bursting forward with not a single player tracking him.', 'It was abysmal individually and collectively even before considering the six composite defensive parts which occupied the box when Szoboszlai scored cost about £240m. Manchester City can and often do spend what they want but it might require some coaching to extricate themselves from this hole.', 'MORE REACTION TO THE GAME FROM F365\n👉 Carragher identifies ‘three positions’ Liverpool must ‘improve’ despite title race being ‘done’\n👉 Liverpool ‘will be a laughing stock’ if Arsenal win Premier League title after Man City win – Keane\n👉 Premier League prize money calculated after Arsenal missed out on record payment in 2023/24', ' ', '7) “If anyone can do it, then it’s Pep,” said Roy Keane before the game of this Manchester City rebuild and the challenge of restoring them to their former glory.', 'It is a sentiment which has been echoed far and wide for months but it is once again worth asking: is it really true? Why does this belief persist that Guardiola can simply turn this around and just suddenly sort this?', 'Content continues below', 'There are fundamental coaching flaws in this team obvious to the layman and laughably exploitable for experts, issues which have been present for months. The idea Manchester City could throw money at the problem is undermined somewhat by three January signings starting at the Etihad and being dragged down levels rather than pulling the club up. This cannot all be Rodri but even if it is, one absence bringing about a historically poor season reflects dreadfully on everyone involved, damages that previous aura of invincibility and asks uncomfortable questions of the staff who have failed to solve the equation despite being given almost an entire season and a ludicrous amount of patience to do so.', 'We revert to the point made after the Spurs debacle in November: ‘This is territory so unfamiliar for the manager, coaches and squad that any opponent should face them without any semblance of fear and assumptions of recovery based on the past must be disregarded.’ Guardiola is probably the greatest manager ever, but never before has he faced a situation like this, never mind overcome it.', ' ', '8) Marmoush was actually decent. Khusanov, too. Perhaps it is unfair to suggest they didn’t improve anything, more that they alone could not hope to oversee the club’s revival.', 'Guardiola was furious with the former for having strayed offside before finishing brilliantly in the first half, and that frustration at an increasingly problematic tendency is understandable. But Marmoush was bright and easily the biggest threat in Erling Haaland’s absence.', 'Content continues below', 'Khusanov, thrown in at the deepest of ends, did remarkably well to stay afloat. He misplaced a single pass, made the most clearances and raced into one particular dumpster fire with a fine tackle after sprinting in from right-back to deny Szoboszlai. Since that nightmare start against Chelsea he has been quietly impressive.', ' ', '9) That came after Ruben Dias punted the ball into Mateo Kovacic’s back when trying to play the ball out to the wing. Gvardiol was so high up that the deflection immediately created a goalscoring situation as Salah had acres of space to sprint into, with the perennially-sprinting Szoboszlai on the underlap.', 'Kovacic, again, made no attempt to close Salah and Dias summarily failed to counter Szoboszlai’s movement. These are senior internationals, seasoned and incredibly experienced players, needing to be rescued by a 20-year-old with fewer than 100 senior first-team career appearances, who cannot speak the language in a new league and country. It’s not much short of a shambles.', ' ', '10) The totemic Ibrahima Konate celebrating conceding a corner was fun, being as it is one of football’s best examples of one of those malleable actions which can be interpreted in whichever way best suits.', 'In a team this magnificent it is a sign of the elite mentality and concentration required in every second of every game, a thing to be praised and admired. In a struggling and especially calamitous side it would be mocked and ridiculed.', 'Konate and Virgil van Dijk can do whatever they like, mind. Manchester City had two-thirds of the ball and it is difficult to recall a single even halfway meaningful chance they created.', 'Content continues below', ' ', '11) Only two times in Premier League history (Allan Saint Maximin v Leicester in December 2021 and Adama Traore v Watford in January 2020, both 14) has a player completed more dribbles than the 13 mustered by Jeremy Doku at the Etihad. They lost those games too; it is not necessarily the sort of feat which underpins victory.', 'The Belgian should take some heart from his display but he suffered the most for Haaland’s injury. On a handful of occasions Doku beat Alexander-Arnold or whoever else had the displeasure of being his man and reached the byline only to have a sea of red shirts to aim a final ball at. None of his five crosses found a teammate and looking at the teams, nor were they ever really going to.', ' ', '12) Liverpool had to work for that clean sheet but it was confirmed in the 74th minute rather than the 90th. With Wataru Endo’s introduction, the game was rendered finished.', 'His input was crucial, including a couple of tackles around the edge of the area when the hosts were trying to find a way through. Slot recently used “Wata’s mindset” as the example for players to follow in that “for the whole season he just keeps on going, keeps on going, keeps on going and whenever we need him, he’s ready.”', 'That niche role has been more defined in recent weeks. When Liverpool have a late lead – and they invariably do – Endo is brought on to solidify the scoreline and see it through. In 115 minutes across 12 appearances in the league this season, the midfielder has been on the pitch for just two goals: Diogo Jota making it 5-0 against West Ham in December; and Jacob Greaves scoring a consolation in a 4-1 win in January.', 'Content continues below', 'When Endo comes on, you might as well switch off.', 'READ MORE: Carragher says Arsenal, Liverpool title race ‘done’ as Reds really ‘only have one loss’ all season', ' ', '13) He was only continuing the fine work of his teammates. Every outfield Liverpool starter made at least one tackle. In fact, aside from Konate and Jones the rest made two or more. The Reds made exactly as many tackles as in their identical win over Manchester City at Anfield in December, which might ordinarily be passed off as a weird coincidence but cannot be put past Slot as a deliberate tactic.', 'Manchester City, by contrast, made five tackles between them. While some of that can be explained away by the possession percentages, it encapsulates the lack of resistance Liverpool met when they decided they wanted the ball.', ' ', '14) The two loudest Manchester City cheers were reserved for a Jones goal being disallowed – after the defence had been sliced open yet again – and forlorn appeals when Alisson handled a ball Kostas Tsimikas had inadvertently deflected high into the air and back to his keeper when trying to intercept a long pass.', 'It was a painfully nothing performance, not a single part of which will live in the memory beyond a single sleep.', ' ', '15) Even that disallowed Jones goal was amateurish from Manchester City, perhaps beyond Khusanov cleverly pulling his shoulder back to play Szoboszlai just offside.', 'The Hungarian had received the ball just past the halfway line before pausing on it, laying it off to Ryan Gravenberch and immediately sprinting to target the space behind a high defensive line. Nico Gonzalez actually looks over his shoulder at Szoboszlai and actively chooses to do nothing, neither tracking him nor telling Nathan Ake to watch him, and not even pressing the ball.', 'Gravenberch delayed a little too long after a poor touch and that alone rescued the hosts from conceding another basic give-and-go goal.', ' ', '16) It might be time to acknowledge that this season really could get so much worse for Manchester City. This week has crystallised their inferiority in comparison with the elite in Europe and domestically, and the genuine reality that they are left with is a ridiculous Champions League qualification battle involving Fulham and Brentford that they cannot afford to lose if this rebuild is to continue in earnest.', 'Spurs give up leads and are particularly terrible in one specific 15-minute period, while Amorim’s made Man Utd a whole lot worse.', 'Arsenal v Manchester United started in slow and cagey fashion, but certainly didn’t finish that way.', 'Trent Alexander-Arnold was atrocious for Liverpool and Bruno Fernandes frustrated yet again for Manchester United. Ruben Amorim is right to be ‘mad’.', 'Spurs are a failed experiment after a humbling defeat that shouldn’t be shrugged off just because champions-in-waiting Liverpool were excellent.', 'Manchester City looked set for a rare win.

If you play away from home against a Pep [Guardiola] team it is almost impossible to have more ball possession than his team has. We knew we had to defend a lot and that’s what we did really well and then some good moments in the counter-attack led to us winning the game.', 'The fans can sing whatever they want, I think they’ve sung it for quite long already, but we know as a team how hard we have to work for every single win. It was only three days ago, somebody asked me if we’d had a dip on Wednesday. I don’t believe that as well as I am calm now about this win.', 'On whether it’s fair to ask him if it’s Liverpool’s ‘title to throw away now’...', 'You can ask every single question you want, but I have said many times it is so hard to judge the league table before every single game is played because the person that asks me this asked me this after the [Aston] Villa game. In my opinion, Villa away and City away are two very, very, very difficult games so you can drop points over there. For example, Arsenal already played those two games, so it is hard to judge it but we are in a good position, but we also know how hard it was for us to win against Wolves.', 'Now we play against Newcastle [United] and we played a 3-3 over there which was, in my opinion, also a good result, although after 89 minutes we were 3-2 up, but we also experienced how difficult that one is. In every other league, I think a lead like this would be very comfortable – except for this one because in this league every single game gives you a lot of challenges, even Plymouth Argyle gave us a lot of challenges.', 'On whether he thought at the start of the season the Reds would be in this position…', 'No because you never think like that. If you start somewhere, you don’t think about where you are in terms of points at the end of the season. What we do know is that no-one saw us as a title contender when we started at the beginning of the season – and I think no-one in the world of football would have expected City not to be so close to the one that leads the league, if they are not the one that leads the league. We all know why, they had many injuries, they had a difficult period, but again today you could see – although the result maybe doesn’t show you that – how good they are as a team and how difficult they are to play against.', 'On whether he felt Liverpool could be title challengers when he arrived at the club...', 'I said many times already, I always felt we had a lot of quality. That’s why, except for Federico Chiesa, we didn’t bring another player in. I was curious to know, two years ago Liverpool played Champions League and wanted to compete for the league. That was difficult and then they ended up sixth. Last season, they were Europa League if I am correct, so they mostly rested their players then and they could play at the weekend and they were competing until five, six, seven, eight games before the end.', 'So, what I was curious about was can we do both, what this club has done, what Jürgen has done, for so many years. Until now, we are doing quite a good job in both competitions, but we also have quite a difficult draw in the Champions League.', 'On Salah’s opener coming from a clever corner routine and the credit that Aaron Briggs, first team individual development coach, should take for the set-piece…', 'He has done his work very, very, very well and you don’t always see the result of that during games because many times we were close to scoring. I always say, people might not know it over here yet, but if you go to Holland then people say, ‘There he is again about his set-pieces.’ But if you want to win a big game then you need to have a neutral balance in set-pieces or a positive one. So, if we go to Villa away and they score [from a set-piece] and we don’t, it is so hard to win against a Villa or a Chelsea or an Arsenal.', 'And today it was the opposite: we scored from a set-piece and that gives you such a boost for this game because, at that moment of time, it wasn’t that we were dominating the game. It wasn’t expected that we could score at any second, so yeah, set-pieces are vital. We started with a new group of people this season and we need to give them a bit of time because I think – that’s also what you see at Arsenal, when they started working it wasn’t immediate, it takes a bit of time before you see the result – and that’s what we’re hoping for in the upcoming 11 [games] as well.', 'SEASON 2024-25', 'On what words he can use to define Salah’s level this season…', 'That’s been asked many times and it is difficult. I think the numbers speak for themselves. What pleased me most today is that mostly we have – in every game apart from this one I think, and maybe the home game against City or Chelsea – more ball possession so that means we bring him many, many, many times in promising positions.', 'But today there wasn’t that many moments we could bring him in promising positions, but these seven, eight, nine or 10 moments that we gave him the ball in those positions he was every time a threat and that probably tells you even more the quality player he is, because it’s not so easy for an attacker if he has to defend, defend, defend. And then he gets the ball and does something special, that’s sometimes difficult but at the moment not many things seem difficult for Mo.', 'On how much the spirit within the dressing room has driven Liverpool this season…', 'If you ask, I would hope that if the ones that are maybe the ones who haven’t won it [the title] yet that they would want to win something this season as well [as previous champions such as Salah]. And looking at them, how hard they work, I think all of them want to achieve something this season. But we know how hard it is, this league has always gone until the end – except I think for one season when Liverpool won it, there was a 25-point gap. In all the other seasons it was so close, if it was Liverpool or later on it was Arsenal together with City. So, the boys have worked every single day really hard to be where they are now and I hope and assume that they will keep doing that for three more months and let’s see where we are then.', 'You have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site.', '', 'SHARE', 'Download the official LFC app', '© Copyright 2024 The Liverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited.

It was not a virtuoso display like the Frenchman's, but it was befitting of the way Salah has dominated this season, and City had no one who could stop him or compete with him, not least Kevin De Bruyne, who looked utterly out of place in a fixture of this level."", ""The writing was on the wall from the moment the starting XIs landed, with Erling Haaland not in the squad due to injury and Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan confined to the bench. The crowd were still up for the occasion, and Jeremy Doku's twisting runs down the left and Savinho's pace on the other flank gave them hope, but they were let down by their propensity to give the ball away too often, with the woeful De Bruyne the biggest culprit in that respect."", ""City were undone by Liverpool's quick-thinking as no one expected Alexis Mac Allister to find Szoboszlai with a floor pass from the corner and for the Hungarian to flick the ball to Salah, whose shot was deflected past Ederson by Nathan Ake.

Withstand pressure, get a goal up, then take control of the game, and go and win.”', '“The best thing about this Liverpool performance is that we’ve been conditioned for six or seven years that you need to play a certain way,” Neville added a little later. “This Liverpool team can adapt and play three or four ways in the same half.”', 'This has been a feature of Liverpool’s play not only in this game, but all season long.', 'Under Jurgen Klopp, the Reds were sometimes criticised for being a little one-dimensional in the way they approached matches.', 'Plan A worked so well, so often that they didn’t really need a plan B. If they did need one, at times they looked unsure of what to do.', 'With Arne Slot now at the helm, Liverpool look more capable of matching what their opponent throws at them on any given day.', 'That was evident at City, and it could be what leads the Reds to the title.']"
Liverpool extend lead at top to 11 points with statement win at Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/23/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,"['There has been talk in recent weeks about the rising levels of anxiety at Liverpool, a drop-off in their performance levels. Look at the number of draws, people have said. Is this a wobble? The club have won one league title since 1990 so a few nerves ought to come as standard.', 'And yet, at the home of the soon‑to‑be‑deposed champions, when Liverpool had to win the match to clamp one hand firmly on the Premier League trophy – to take advantage of Arsenal’s shock home defeat by West Ham on Saturday – there was only assurance; a never-in-doubt result.', 'A bit of context. Liverpool had entered the Etihad Stadium on an unbeaten league run of 22 matches. They have lost just once in the competition all season and not at all on their travels. They are not really wobbling. Perhaps their rivals just want to cling to something.', 'There was nothing for any of them here, certainly not Manchester City, who went with the kind of meekness that has been associated with them too often during this deep winter of discontent. The race feels run, Liverpool 11 points clear of Arsenal. Arne Slot’s team have simply been remorseless.', 'If one player symbolises the quality it is Mohamed Salah. The right-sided attacker gave his latest virtuoso display, scoring the opening goal and setting up Dominik Szoboszlai for the second, the game done and dusted by half-time.', 'Salah has 30 goals and 21 assists from 38 appearances in all competitions this season. Is there any doubt that the club must give Mo his dough to stop him leaving as a free agent?', 'The question for City had concerned whether a champion team had a haymaker left in them at the end of an era. They did not. After the Champions League drubbing at Real Madrid last Wednesday, this was another setback marked by the absence of surprise. “We’re gonna win the league,” the Liverpool fans chanted towards the end, no nerves from them now. Nobody felt ready to disagree.', 'It was a showpiece where the tactical nuances were pronounced, Pep Guardiola reacting to the absence of Erling Haaland because of knee trouble by giving Phil Foden and Omar Marmoush central attacking roles. Slot did the same with Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones. It was a battle of the false 9s, albeit Marmoush is probably a purer version. It was 4-2-4 against 4-2-4, albeit the systems were not straightforward, partly because Rico Lewis stepped up and inside from right-back for City.', 'The breakthrough goal was a tactical triumph for Slot. City had started brightly, Jérémy Doku showing his twinkle toes on the left wing, but they were undone by a corner routine that was straight from the Liverpool training ground.', 'Alexis Mac Allister drove it in low for Szoboszlai, who had sprinted towards the near post, and he flicked it back for Salah, who had drifted into space close to the penalty spot. Szoboszlai’s first-time touch was deft; Salah’s first-time finish flew home with the aid of a deflection off Nathan Aké. Liverpool had won the corner after they brought a high press to rob Lewis.', 'Salah was in highlights-reel mood. There was the moment in the first half when he blazed away from Aké and was stopped only by a decent block by Abdukodir Khusanov. There was another one when Salah released the overlapping Trent Alexander‑Arnold with a lovely pass; the City defenders had stood off him, afraid of what he might do.', 'City tried to work their patterns and Marmoush had the ball in the net on the half-hour from a Foden pass only to be pulled up for offside. It was all too predictable from them and Liverpool were comfortable, Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk towers of strength at the back.', 'Sign up to Football Daily', ""Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football"", '', 'Liverpool’s second goal was too easy from a City point of view. Szoboszlai looked offside when Alexander-Arnold whipped a high ball up the inside right and so he stopped, briefly, but Salah, who was onside, most assuredly did not. He raced on to the pass and when he squared for Szoboszlai – active in the second phase – the midfielder flashed a low shot past Ederson.', 'The City fans had wanted to make a couple of points with their pre-match tifos. “City won four in a row,” went the wording on one, even if they know there will be no fifth straight league title this season. “This means four,” read another. They have their history. Liverpool are preoccupied with the here and now.', 'Slot was unruffled on the sideline; it was Guardiola in danger of overheating. He seemed particularly keen to explain what he wanted from Marmoush in terms of pressing. The Liverpool players stuck to the plan. They have so much faith in it.', 'They got runners in behind City’s high line after the break and only a tight offside decision from the video assistant referee denied Jones a goal for 3-0. The lines came out to show that Szoboszlai had moved too early on to a Ryan Gravenberch pass before teeing up the tap‑in. A little earlier, Khusanov had got back to tackle Luis Díaz, while the Liverpool winger would also work Ederson.', 'For City, Marmoush drew a fine save out of Alisson but there was not much else. Liverpool might have scored again only for Khusanov to make a big block to thwart Szoboszlai. Who had played the pass? Salah, of course.']"

If you want to you win a big game, you need a neutral set piece balance or score one and not concede. If you come here you have to defend, and we defended really well.', 'Set-piece goal taken from Bournemouth? “We as a group of people look at how to set up and in this situation someone came up with a brilliant plan, it wasn’t me. We knew that space could be there. We trained it yesterday and now because of a deflection it went in and that’s helpful because it’s not like we were dominating the game.”', 'What was the difference today? “First half played out better for them than us besides the score. They were dominating the game but in the first half it felt like they could score at any moment. We could set up at halftime a little better what we wanted from the players and that helped because in the second half I can’t remember the chances.”', '“Ideally we could have the ball more than the other team, but City does it better than anyone. I told them before the game the only, only, only chance you have to win here is to defend because they are so good here.”', 'Will this weekend stand as the one they sealed title control? “Three days ago we had a draw at Villa and people told me we were not in a good place. Three days later it’s the exact opposite. There are 11 games to go and if these players can keep working this hard, we have a chance. We work every day so hard to achieve this. Now three months of very hard work to hopefully continue.”', '“There’s not such a big secret. We’re 11 points clear but Arsenal have one game in hand. What we did today — work as hard as we can. The best attack we had didn’t end up in the goal. You always have to adjust to the task at hand. Man City away is a lot different than Plymouth Argyle away.”', 'Is your job to stay calm while fans, media get excited? “It’s easier for us not to get excited because we know what we have to put in. The fans look at the two goals we scored and say, ‘Wow’ but we know the work we did to defend. It’s up to us know why we are where we are and these boys know it well.”', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

No way was that a back-pass. Small crumbs now for City’s support. Time to recall the good times.', '83 min: Szoboszlai denied by the sliding Khusanov after another brilliant pass by Mohamed Salah. The Uzbek has been the pick of City’s defenders.', '82 min: City’s reinforcements are still piling onwards but rather haplessly. They’ve been picked off by a team far more in concert with each other.', '80 min: Quiz question from Steve Hudson: Did Salah and De Bruyne play together at Chelsea?', '79 min: More changes: Gakpo on for Diaz for Liverpool. Not much time for anyone to make a further impression.', '77 min: Three changes made by a very wet Guardiola: Marmoush for Gundogan, Ake for Dias and Gonzales for Kovacic. The new Rodri struggled today,', '75 min: An exchange of shots: Marmoush slides into the side-netting then Salah shoots. Neither trouble the opposing keeper.', '73 min: Changes: Tsimikas for Robertson, Jones for Endo. The Japanese player is the closer. Can City score in a team where Endo has come on as a sub? Nobody has done so yet.', '71 min: So much noise from the Liverpool fans. The home end emptying.', '70 min: City have been full of effort, and full of possession, but with nothing like the penetration. Doku has the latest attempt, the ball spinning up and making it hard to get any purchase on the shot.', '68 min: By the way, Kevin De Bruyne’s painful race is run. James McAtee has replaced him. That was sad to see.', '67 min: Doku is fouled. The ball is zipped towards Marmoush and – just – cleared. Then, Diaz shields the ball from four City defenders.', '65 min: Ian Magilton: “Re: minute 60, isn’t Salah older than De Bruyne?', 'Answer: no.', '64 min: Mac Allister zings in a corner, and it’s cleared. De Bruyne wins the ball in midfield, determined to show it’s not yet over. There will be new champions if it stays like this.', '62 min: Kristof gets in touch: “Regarding City´s exceptional crumbling, has anyone yet come out with the theory that the players maybe just really resent Pep? They famously dipped in form once he signed his new contract extension, and I could totally see the dressing room be like “Shit, he STAYIN?!”. JUST A THEORY!”', 'Andy Flintoff: “One link from that Bournemouth game and today is that Nathan Aké (who scored the stoppage-time winner in 2016) is in City’s back line this afternoon.”', 'Maybe, just maybe?', '61 min: Liverpool want a third. Salah is buzzing all over the place. He wants this done, so he can get the contract he wants. Perhaps that’s a bit of projection but much to be decided beyond the pitch at the club.', '60 min: As Salah glides and glitters, poor KDB slips and slides and concedes a corner. Poor Kev. Age and nature are the cruellest.', '59 min: Liverpool were celebrating as if the title was won, but now have to right themselves.', '58 min: City – reprieved – almost score immediately as Doku and Marmoush threaten. The ball is cleared. It almost became 1-2 from 3-0 down.', 'But…Szoboszlai sent away, and Jones scores….City cut to ribbons but the Hungarian was offside….', '56 min: Almost a beautiful move. Alisson sends off Salah, down the centre, and his ball almost finds Diaz. Khusanov – somehow – clears….', '54 min: Foden – also well, well, off it – loses the ball and Liverpool spring into action. Though instead of the wildcat attack they choose patience. Salah and Szoboszlai attempt a switch-back but it’s cleared. Poor Khusanov is being thrown from the deepest of ends.', '52 min: City continue to dominate the ball. But it’s sterile, powderpuff stuff. Liverpool set off at speed. Salah attempts to shoot with the outside of his boot. He scored like that at Bournemouth. Was it a cross? Robertson hoiks it back over and City eventually clear.']"

Enjoyment might be too strong, but Liverpool are not feeling too sorry for a rival that has pipped them to two league titles suffering a difficult campaign.', '', '', 'Lee: Maybe, although Klopp’s departure has taken some of the spice out of it. City’s decline means there is much less riding on these matches. If City return to their old selves next season, we are likely to see something like ‘the good old days’, because that was all about perhaps the two best teams in the world battling it out for trophies.', '', 'Jones: Will we ever see another 98-97 points title race, as we did in 2018-19? Probably not. The rivalry had already been building, largely through the Champions League before that, too. There were rifts off the pitch from boardroom level down to supporters, while on the field, it was the two best teams in Europe going head to head, led by the game’s two leading managers.', '', 'Lee: Guardiola said that that ruled him out against Madrid, but if he starts, he can certainly give Virgil van Dijk a tough time. The defender has generally done well against Haaland but City now have Omar Marmoush and with two players keen to make runs in behind, it will give the Liverpool defence more to think about. That can help Haaland.', 'Jones: This debate transports me back to that moment at Anfield last season when . The entire ground was transfixed as the former ran at the latter. Two world-class players going head to head. Van Dijk just about won that duel.', '', 'Lee: Avoid mistakes, keep up the energy for 90 minutes, keep the ball, win it back… all the things they have not really been doing. Guardiola says the issues stem from rushing in possession, which spreads out the team and exposes their lack of mobility in midfield. That, he says, exacerbates their lack of physicality.', '', '', 'Jones: This is not the ‘great’ City of recent years. Yes, they deserve respect, but not too much.', '', '', 'Lee: Probably a Liverpool victory although they are not at their best. The positivity from the 4-0 win against Newcastle United quickly evaporated in Madrid. City have their best chance if they can play to Haaland, but they have many well-documented weaknesses.', 'Jones: Welcome back to pessimistic predictions with Andy Jones! Liverpool should win — they are a better team and should expose City’s weaknesses. The problem is Slot’s free-scoring side have also become easier to score against, as mentioned earlier. That is pointing me towards another high-scoring draw: 2-2.', 'Lee: City should get back to much more like their old selves next season. We always expect Liverpool to be up there challenging but that was not always the case under Klopp — as much as they were arguably the best team around at times, they did also drop off. Whatever happens this season it will be a challenge for Slot to keep them at a high level year after year.', '', 'Jones: It’s still difficult to know what Liverpool team we will be getting on the first day of next season because of the uncertainty surrounding the contract situations of Van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. They will be expecting to challenge, although that will be a tough test for Slot if there is a significant turnover of players.', '', '', '']"

Eleven points clear with 12 games left for their nearest rivals, Liverpool aren't going to let this slip now. On the basis of this authoritative 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium, it will be a matter of when not if they reach the unmatchable 90 points."", ""Certainly, if Mohamed Salah keeps this up, the title will be won in time for Arsenal to give them a guard of honor at Anfield in May. For the 11th time this season, the presumptive Ballon d'Or winner graced a game with a goal and assist. The previous high watermark in a Premier League campaign was 11. It is February."", ""This was not one of those games where everything flowed through Mohamed Salah. Indeed, in the 10 minutes before he opened the scoring -- a shot deflected off Nathan Ake after a cute low Alexis Mac Allister corner had been flicked around the corner by Dominik Szoboszlai -- Liverpool's danger man had had four touches, no completed passes and nothing else of note. On this season's form, he only needs one opening."", 'Give him two then and Liverpool would have a cushion. More than 20 minutes without a shot for the visitors but one moment of lax defending for Jeremy Doku gave Trent Alexander-Arnold time to look up and pick a pass. Whenever that happens the opponent is always on the back foot. Salah glided away from Josko Gvardiol. Both he and Ake were intent on sending Salah to the byline, a precise touch with the right foot and they were out of the game. Szoboszlai was then on hand to sweep home.', 'From there on, not a lot for either side. VAR intervened to deny both sides offside goals, Omar Marmoush for City in the first, Curtis Jones denied what would have been the indisputable match-winner in the second. Even without that headroom, Liverpool never felt threatened by a team that has turned so many of their dreams into nightmares.', ""In that sense, this was not just the Salah show. The absence of one big star in Erling Haaland was certainly felt. For two and a half seasons City have built an attack to funnel chances towards the best No. 9 in the world. Without him, it really didn't matter what they got right. Doku ended this game with 13 successful take-ons down the left, the most in a Premier League game this season, and yet without the big guy to hit in the middle, those darts to the byline resulted in just two chances created."", ""Nearly two-thirds of the possession was City's. Their center back Abdukhodir Khusanov had as many final third touches as Luis Diaz. Look at those sort of metrics and you would convince yourself this was a familiar meeting between these two at the Etihad, the sort that Pep Guardiola never really loses. This time, however, their attack was toothless. Sixteen shots worth 0.63 xG -- nearly a third of which came from one Rico Lewis effort -- is as bad a shooting display as City have had in years. Only when Marmoush was a yard or more offside could they craft a really good shot."", ""Liverpool weren't much better but, well, they had Salah."", ""City may have been the chief architects of their problems in front of goal, but Liverpool were only too willing to help them out. Ryan Gravenberch and Mac Allister were composure personified in front of the back four. Nothing got down the middle. Everyone in a red shirt was prepared to drop back and do a shift. Salah's most outstanding moments might have been his goal contributions but the diligence he showed in the 82nd minute to steal possession back for his side and drive through bodies to get out."", 'When such diligence is being shown across the side, the credit belongs on the touchline. Before too long Arne Slot will enter a select club of five coaches who have won the Premier League in their first season in England. Salah will be garlanded with every award and rightly so; his manager will certainly feel that he put his best players in the best positions to earn the big honor. That in itself is a coaching triumph.', ""From the outset, this has had the look of an ego-free triumph. Slot has felt no compunction to rip up Jurgen Klopp's XI or to demand his own players. A degree more caution, a tweak to the midfield to add solidity, and this side are back as something around the best side in Europe. For the first time in the 20 years the statistic has been tracked, they can win a top-flight game with 34 percent possession. "", ""Not that this is all simplistic. Slot judged his system to a tee, Jones and Szoboszlai deployed centrally to block off City's early build-up, to fly up and down the pitch and attack the box while the bulk of the build-up went down the flanks. What approximated an opposition midfield -- mostly Nico Gonzalez, occasionally Lewis and Kevin De Bruyne -- was overwhelmed."", ""So often it has been City who were the architects of Liverpool's pain. Salah and company have been great, it's just the guys in sky blue have been that scintilla better. How sweet then, that the moment when it all became inevitable came at the Etihad. A champions performance for a champion in waiting."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.', 'CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Liverpool have embarrassed the Premier League - only one thing stands in way of dominance,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/guardiola-slot-liverpool-premier-league-34734785,"['They may as well start engraving the trophy and getting the red ribbons ready.', 'Liverpool were simply too good for Manchester City in the same way they have embarrassed the rest of the Premier League all season. It was fitting that Mo Salah scored and got another assist, as he has been the best player for the best team which is now frighteningly 11 points clear at the top.', 'Arne Slot’s men have only got 11 games left and - even though their closest challengers Arsenal have a game in hand - it is impossible to believe Liverpool will blow it from here.', 'Especially when the most telling aspect of the game was that this used to be a pressure cooker and a title decider between the best two cubs. But it was all too easy for Liverpool.', 'Liverpool were slick, ruthless and clinical. They have been on a different level to the rest all season and, even when they have dropped points, Arsenal and Co have been nowhere near good enough to step up.', 'It is not as if Liverpool have had to blow everyone away. They have just done it efficiently with brilliant ease. Jurgen Klopp’s heavy metal football has been replaced by Slot’s style which is less about full throttle and more about moments.', 'No other player has produced as many moments as Salah who created a quirky but revealing piece of history at the Etihad. The Egyptian king became the first player to score and assist in both games against the reigning champions in a season. That just highlights that Salah has been the difference maker in the big games.', 'Salah has now got 30 goals in all competitions, he has scored in eight consecutive games in all competitions and, at this rate, Liverpool could add the Carabao Cup and Champions League trophies to their league title.', 'Let’s be clear. It’s not Liverpool’s fault they are so much better than the rest. But it is a pretty damning indictment on the rest that it has been so easy.', 'City’s drop off has been alarming and must raise question marks whether Pep Guardiola can get the fallen champions back to their former glories. The January spending spree - £180m on new talent - has delivered some optimism but even Omar Marmoush was shackled relatively easily. Realistically, City’s season is now all about a battle to get into the top four. Five if they are lucky.', 'If you contrast that to Slot’s new regime at Anfield, if they can get Salah and Virgil van Dijk to stay beyond this summer, this could be just the start of a new era of domination. Incredibly, it was the first time Liverpool have won at the Etihad in the Premier League since 2015/16 and doing the double over City also shows there has been a changing of the guard.', 'Liverpool are the new kings. Slot likes to exert control but, unlike other coach’s playbook, his style also produces excitement and scintillating quality. Just like the first goal. Alexis Mac Allister’s corner was flicked on by the outstanding Dominik Szobozlai to Salah who was left unmarked and his shot deflected in off Nathan Ake’s attempt to block it.', 'Marmoush had a go but got caught offside after a VAR offside check. Other than that, it was one-way traffic. The second goal was a beauty. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s ball forward was perfect for Salah to turn provider for Szobozlai and his low shot wrong-footed City keeper Ederson and flew into the bottom corner.', 'City tried in the second half but never looked like turning it around. Instead, Luis Diaz went close and Curtis Jones had one ruled out for offside.', 'There was a hug of mutual respect between Guardiola and Slot at the final whistle. The baton has been passed. And no wonder the travelling fans were singing about winning the league.', ""Join our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Genius-level Salah enters his imperial phase to guide Liverpool to win at City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/23/genius-level-salah-enters-his-imperial-phase-to-guide-liverpool-to-win-at-city,"['Arguably the best attacking player in the world this season did three startlingly high-grade things to ensure victory', 'If you’re going to win it in February, win it in February right. On a rain-sodden day in Manchester, the kind of afternoon when the wind chases you around, lifting up the hem of your coat and firing a draught of ice-cold water up your spine, Liverpool didn’t so much overwhelm Manchester City as stroll politely past, all controlled aggression and strength in reserve.', 'A 2-0 scoreline seemed fair enough by the end. But then, by half-time this already felt like a victory lap. Albeit, an apposite one. If this really is to be the moment Liverpool took a decisive lead down the back straight, it happened in a way that reflects perfectly the calm, still centre of their season, both goals arriving in a 23-minute spell when Mohamed Salah decided it was time to bend the day to his will.', 'From August to the fag end of winter, Salah has played with a kind of light around him this season. Perhaps in time this will come to be seen as his imperial phase, a perfectly ripe footballer in a team perfectly set up to feed his cutting edge. In the first half he did three startlingly high‑grade things.', 'The first was scoring Liverpool’s opening goal. A low corner form the right was pea-rolled into the centre and funnelled on by a fine touch from Dominik Szoboszlai to Salah unmarked by the penalty spot. The first-time shot was hard, low and deflected past Ederson.', 'The second moment of High Salah was both breathtaking and the genesis of Liverpool’s second goal. Again he took the ball in the left channel as City’s players just seemed to melt away, drowning in aura, not wanting to look directly at this thing. From there Salah produced the most delightful stunned reverse no-look nudge into the run of Trent Alexander-Arnold, one of those moments where you get a sense of a footballer operating with his footballing third eye wide open, just rearranging the other parts around him.', 'It came to nothing, but moments later Salah set up the second goal. Again he was given a kind of presidential motorcade escort down the City left, before passing inside for Szoboszlai to roll a shot into the corner. As the ball hit the net Salah was already clenching his fists like a man about to set fire to his air guitar, the look of a footballer who knows this game is done.', 'You can sometimes get a little too used to extraordinary things happening. The goal and the assist here made it 25 and 16 in the league, and nine in his last eight games in all competitions as the season narrows to a point.', 'Just as striking, all of this has been enacted with that weirdly carefree air of ruthlessness, the certainty of the player who takes penalties like he’s trying to destroy something behind the goal (no visualisation, no breathing exercises here) and just seems to be having the time of his life out in the middle of all that noise and heat.', 'It is still slightly baffling that Kylian Mbappé or Vinícius Júnior are talked up so often as the best attacking footballers in the world. Mbappé in particular has an impressively powerful multi‑platform celebrity machine at his back. But Salah has been top gun, the best attacking player in the world this season; and arguably the most decisive presence in any elite European team for much of the past five years.', 'Not that those higher registers were needed here. On a day when the task for City was simply to look like a functioning entity, Pep Guardiola picked an end‑of‑term kind of team, all fun attacking angles.', 'Sign up to Football Daily', ""Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football"", '', 'Arne Slot’s Liverpool team was also notable. Once again every player was inherited from his predecessor. At least five of them are now playing in slightly altered roles. And Liverpool’s manager deserves his slice of credit for Salah’s extraordinary bloom. Slot may have the air of a friendly neighbourhood greengrocer who juggles apples on his forearm, but he has also been sharp and confident enough to fix only the parts that need fixing. Salah has been asked to deliver more of the same, but also freed up by Liverpool’s increased patience on the ball to become more of an actively creative influence.', 'Salah-dependence is clearly a thing. How could it not be? He has either made or scored more than half of Liverpool’s goals this season. And Salah has also carried Slot, has imbued every managerial call with an air of righteousness. You don’t need to possess a fearless dead-eye super-ripped genius-level finisher to build a reputation as a brilliant manager. But it does kind of help.', 'Liverpool will surely go on to win the league from here. And if it seems a little ominous still that the best attacking player in Europe is yet to sign a new contract, this is perhaps just a time to live for the present, to drink in that age of imperial Salah.']"

Mikel Arteta's Gunners would have been five points behind with a game in hand and a trip to Anfield to come in May."", ""Instead, Arsenal lost to West Ham, Liverpool won at the Etihad and the gap at the top of the table has widened to 11 points. From here, it's difficult to see anyone other than Liverpool being crowned champions at the end of the season."", ""Arsenal once overturned a 13-point deficit to beat Manchester United to the title in the 1997-98 campaign. But that was in December with more than half the season left to play. Arne Slot's Liverpool have only 11 games remaining, and nine more wins would guarantee the title, regardless of any winning run Arsenal can put together."", 'Liverpool have games against Newcastle, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal to negotiate, but they can afford to lose two and still finish top. In stoppage time, the Liverpool fans began singing, ""We\'re going to win the league."" It\'s hard to argue with their assessment. -- Rob Dawson', ""Manchester City are no longer the team for the big occasion, but this defeat against Liverpool wasn't the definitive proof of that, merely the latest example of how Pep Guardiola's team has lost the ability to win when it matters."", ""If you look back through City's results since the end of the 2022-23 season, when they won the treble, they haven't won a single game when the pressure was on. Not since beating Inter Milan in the 2023 Champions League final, in fact."", ""Last season, City failed to beat Liverpool or Arsenal in the Premier League, and it has been the same this time around. As for the Champions League, City have had four games against Real Madrid since winning the competition and not won any of them. And in last season's FA Cup final against Manchester United, despite being overwhelming favourites to beat their neighbours and clinch a league and cup double, Guardiola's team lost."", ""So, when Liverpool arrived at the Etihad looking for their first win at the Etihad in seven years, Slot's side would have regarded City with far less fear and trepidation as before. City have been woeful this season and have lost 14 of their past 27 games in all competitions, but it is their failure to compete against the biggest and best sides that has been an issue for a while now."", ""Guardiola's teams were always the ones that won when it mattered, but they haven't done that now for almost two years. -- Mark Ogden"", ""In his first season leading Liverpool, Slot is already on course to match Jurgen Klopp's title haul, and has already ticked off something his predecessor never managed."", ""Klopp's rivalry with Guardiola characterised a Premier League era, but the German never recorded a league win over Guardiola's City at the Etihad Stadium. Slot has done it at his first attempt. Klopp would probably argue that he never faced a Guardiola team that was languishing 20 points off the top of the table, though."", ""It's remarkable that Klopp led Liverpool to 97 points in 2018-19 and 92 points in 2021-22 and finished second on both occasions. Slot, though, can beat only what's in front of him. Liverpool were comfortable winners here, just as they were over City at Anfield in December."", 'It says everything about where these two teams are this season that Liverpool were able to cruise past Real Madrid in the Champions League group phase in November. City, on the other hand, were well beaten at the Bernabeu on Wednesday as they made their exit from Europe.', 'Slot has Liverpool chasing three trophies in what could end up being a dream season. Guardiola, meanwhile, is left facing the prospect of a summer rebuild. -- Dawson', 'With the experience of Rúben Dias, Mateo Kovacic, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan left on the bench, Guardiola fielded a young team. They got a lesson from Liverpool, who produced the perfect big-game performance away from home.', 'Disciplined and clinical, Liverpool were the better team and could have scored more. After the chastening trip to Madrid, Guardiola decided he needed the legs and energy of youth and picked a starting XI with an average age of 24.7. Seven members of the team were 24 or under. Guardiola also picked three 20-year-olds in Rico Lewis, Savinho and Abdukodir Khusanov and his first substitution was to replace 33-year-old Kevin De Bruyne with 22-year-old James McAtee.', ""There's plenty of talent in City's core of young players, but there is naturally going to be an element of naivety. In particular, Guardiola will be furious with Liverpool's first goal. It came from a well-worked corner routine with Alexis Mac Allister rolling a pass into the near post and Szoboszlai flicking it on and Salah finding acres of space in the penalty area to score via a deflection from Nathan Aké."", ""It was a crucial moment in the game and one where City's relative lack of experience was telling. -- Dawson"", ""Kevin De Bruyne will go down as a blue-chip Premier League legend thanks to his incredible 10 years at Manchester City, but we are watching the final days of the midfielder's time at the Etihad, and it is becoming a sad farewell for the 33-year-old."", ""De Bruyne, who has won 14 major honours including six Premier League titles with City, was substituted halfway through the second half by Guardiola after a nightmare performance against Liverpool. The Belgium international was wayward with his passes and couldn't keep pace with Liverpool's dynamic midfield of Ryan Gravenberch and Mac Allister."", ""When he was replaced by James McAtee it was inevitable, and his disconsolate walk to the touchline summed up De Bruyne's frustration. Four days before this game, De Bruyne was named as a substitute in City's must-win -- they lost -- Champions League playoff second leg against Real Madrid, and he has been a peripheral figure throughout this season."", 'With his contract due to expire in the summer and no new deal on the table, De Bruyne is fading fast. City have lots of problems to address, but replacing one of their best-ever players will be close to the top of the list. -- Ogden', ""Salah took his goal tally for the season to 30 with the opener for Liverpool at the Etihad, and he also became the first player in Europe's big five leagues to register 50 goal involvements this term by creating the second for Szoboszlai. Even though we still have three months of the season to play, Salah is now just two goal involvements away from breaking Luis Suárez's club record of 43 in the Premier League."", ""There are no more superlatives left to describe Salah and his importance to Liverpool, who are cruising to the title. The Egypt international seems a certainty to win the individual Player of the Year awards and he will rival all of Real Madrid's star players for this year's Ballon d'Or."", ""But with Erling Haaland missing this game for Manchester City due to a knee injury, Salah's contribution showed how he is as important to Liverpool as Haaland is to City. Guardiola's side lacks a threat without Haaland, but because Salah rarely misses a game, we don't really know how Liverpool would cope without him."", ""With Salah's contract due to expire this summer, Liverpool really need to sort a new deal with the forward to delay having to find out what life without him could be like. -- Ogden""]"
