The AfD’s ascent has come amid a spate of attacks across Germany, some of them by people with a migrant background. Also on the agenda has been Germany’s stagnant economy and the war in Ukraine.', 'AfD leader Alice Weidel called the result a “glorious” success in a television speech following the exit poll.

He broke my confidence too many times,” the chancellor said of Lindner.', 'For his part, Lindner said the chancellor had tried to strong-arm him into breaking a constitutionally enshrined spending limit, known as the debt brake, a move that the fiscal hawk refused to support.', 'In December, a confidence vote was held in parliament, which Scholz lost, paving the way for the February 23 parliamentary election.', 'The country has two centrist party groups; Scholz’s SPD and the conservative alliance, which includes the CDU and CSU.', 'In recent years, these parties have been losing support, while smaller parties from both sides of the political spectrum, including the Greens and the far-right AfD, have gained support.', 'Besides these players, the FDP, a pro-market, neoliberal centre-right political party, the far-left Linke, and the left-leaning populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) are also running in the election.', 'Scholz, 66, the current German chancellor, is running again in the upcoming election after he was sworn in by the Bundestag in December 2021 after running as a continuity candidate following the departure of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was chancellor for 16 years.', 'During Scholz’s term as chancellor, he has led the country through several domestic and European issues, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.', 'However, as disputes between members of his three-way coalition over the national budget have intensified, Scholz’s popularity has waned. As of January, only 31 percent of people said they approved of Scholz as the country’s leader, according to polling group Statista.', 'Friedrich Merz, 69, the leader of the CDU, is a familiar face within the conservative bloc as he joined the youth arm of the party as a young man and worked his way up the ranks.', 'From 2000 to 2002, Merz served as party leader but lost the position to Merkel, who later went on to become the first female chancellor in Germany’s history and to have the longest time in office.', 'But Merz was often critical of Merkel and offered what many saw as a more conservative and business-friendly approach than the former German leader, who had more centrist views and opened Germany’s borders to refugees in 2015. That move was praised by some but condemned by others, mainly on the right of the political spectrum. It has also become less popular over recent years.', 'So far, Merz has promised to stop what he called illegal migration, pledged “zero tolerance” on crime and said he will reverse marijuana legalisation.', 'With the CDU currently ahead in the polls, Merz is tipped to win the election.', 'But in late January, Merz drew controversy when he put a non-binding motion to Germany’s parliament to strengthen border controls and accelerate deportations. The motion passed with the support of the AfD, breaking a longstanding firewall that previously prevented mainstream parties from cooperating with the far right, and prompting Merkel to publicly criticise Merz. It marked the first time the far-right party has been relied on to pass legislation in Germany.', 'Despite the far-right’s help, Merz told a CDU convention earlier this month that he would not cooperate with the AfD and would “make the party as small as possible”.', 'But Borbath, the professor, said that breaking the firewall had helped the AfD achieve some kind of “normalisation” within German politics. It was a “warning sign”, he said.', '“I think it might also reflect some kind of deliberate strategy in the sense of testing out the kind of societal climate, testing out the discursive climate, and seeing what would happen, should there be some kind of coordination with the AfD, or should the AfD be taken as a normal political party.”', 'A general election is called every four years, with this one originally scheduled for September 2025.', 'On Sunday, German citizens will vote twice: once for a local member of parliament and, secondly, for a party.', 'This system means that alongside the winning local MP, each party also sends a number of MPs to the federal parliament (Bundestag) based on the vote share they secured in the second vote.', 'The second vote is considered the most important and is most widely reported on election night, as it determines the number of seats a party will receive overall in the Bundestag and the party’s strength within government.', 'There are 630 parliamentary seats up for grabs, which will be distributed proportionally on the second votes.', 'A coalition government will likely be formed as it is rare for one party to win an absolute majority. The only time a single party secured a majority was for the parliamentary term of 1957 to 1961 when the CDU/CSU won the election in West Germany.', 'Whichever party secures the most votes will nominate a candidate as chancellor, and the new Bundestag will vote.

He told a televised debate with Scholz last week: “I have always said that you can discuss this, but definitely not at first.', '“First comes the savings potential, growth and also the budget reallocations that are urgently needed,” he said.', 'The AfD and the FDP are staunch defenders of the limit on public borrowing.', 'The AfD also wants Germany to stop using the euro, reintroduce the Deutschmark, the national currency last used in 2002, and potentially leave the European Union.', 'Nearly all parties have called for stricter measures on migration following a number of attacks on crowds, such as an incident in December in which a Saudi-born psychiatrist drove into a Christmas market, killing five people.', 'Borbath said, however, that after an Afghan asylum seeker drove a car into a crowd in Munich on Thursday, most parties are likely to toughen their stance on immigration.', '“There’s just no party that says ‘yes, migration is needed’ and that ‘migration is good’ … So I think, in that sense, the effect of the AfD is much more visible than in the policy-making process … this normalisation of AfD, of immigration critical voices that were previously mostly linked to the AfD, [is] becoming much more widespread and normalised and taken over also by centre-left or left-wing forces,” he said.', '', '', '', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

No major party will likely ask it to join a coalition, nor for its help in passing legislation.', 'This is the German “firewall.” Every other major German party refuses to work with the AfD because it is widely seen as an extremist right-wing party. And all indications suggest that this firewall will hold. But Sunday’s election could mark its sternest test yet.', 'Germany has built its postwar democracy specifically to repel the forces of populism now sweeping the West. That makes its elections Sunday a test of whether this bulwark can – and should – hold.', 'Germany’s history has given rise to a democracy uniquely tasked with resisting the populist wave sweeping the West. The government has powers to clamp down on free speech that it sees as dangerous to democracy. It can even ban parties, as it did to a communist party and an openly neo-Nazi party during the Soviet era. The AfD is under surveillance by the domestic intelligence service.  ', 'Yet the forces that are pushing Western democracies toward populism are here, too – and in some respects, even stronger. The economy is stagnant, with few prospects for a quick turnaround. Inflation is rampant, and includes the highest energy costs in Europe. And immigration is seen as out of control, punctuated by a string of violent attacks by asylum-seekers.', 'That makes this election something of a battleground for how far populism can spread. Germany is perhaps the West’s last and most difficult beachhead.', 'Frustrated by these features of German democracy, United States Vice President JD Vance last week pointed the finger at German politicians, saying “there is no room for firewalls.” But here in Germany, there is a sense that something much deeper is at work.', 'The firewall has always been a product of German voters’ desire for order and stability – a trust in the government’s competence. Its rupture would signal a fundamental breach in that core post-World War II political contract. Sunday’s elections will offer an indication of how many German voters feel driven to that extreme.  ', '“I have lost my faith,” says Holger Rousseau, sitting at a café on Berlin’s Alexanderplatz.', 'He rattles off a series of strong German leaders from the past and wonders where they have gone. It seems to him that Germany’s leaders of today don’t care about the people the way they once did. “They are not there for the voters.”', '“The country has lost the values that it stood for,” adds his wife, Britta.', 'She won’t reveal the party she supports, but she says parts of the AfD platform are good, including its get-tough stance on immigration. And she does not dismiss the fact that 20% of the population wants the AfD to be in government. She doesn’t see the danger some others do.', '“The German people are clever enough not to repeat the past,” she says.', 'Since the end of World War II, the deep, motivating fear here has been a repeat of 1933, when the National Socialists were invited to form a government. While few experts see the AfD as a reprise of the Nazis, the party’s willingness to evoke Nazi-era slogans and to endorse virulent anti-immigrant rhetoric have so far made them untouchable.', 'But the Rousseaus show how that view is shifting. And even among those who are strongly against the AfD, there is an understanding of why the AfD is growing.', '“I’ve never before witnessed people being so unsure about who to vote for,” says Philipp M., a Berliner who asked that his last name not be used for privacy reasons. “There’s a sense that, no matter who you vote for, nothing will change.”', '“I don’t think 20% of the people are Nazis,” he adds. “Half of that vote are probably people who are just unsatisfied.”', 'This trend has defined recent politics in the West, with populist parties and leaders from the U.S. to France to Britain capitalizing on a loss of faith in politics.', '“The AfD has effectively positioned itself as, ‘We’re the only alternative to the politics of today,’” says Eric Langenbacher, a professor and Germany expert at Georgetown University.', 'The actual threat presented by the AfD is open to wide interpretation. Elon Musk has been campaigning on AfD’s behalf, rejecting the idea that AfD is even right wing. The AfD remains splintered between moderate and radical wings, with both maintaining significant influence. The leader of the radical wing, Björn Höcke, has repeatedly used a phrase – “Everything for Germany” – that has been banned because of its connection to Nazi stormtroopers.', 'More generally, the party represents a reversal of much of what modern Germany has been built on. That is both its appeal and why the demand for the firewall endures. While Germans strongly support new immigration measures, the AfD’s rhetoric about massive deportations is seen by many as having a worryingly racial element. Its anti-European Union stance is in contrast to Germany’s defining role in building a unified Europe since World War II. And its desire to more fully embrace German history goes against deep revulsion toward the Nazi past.', '“The majority of Germans still don’t feel comfortable being nationalistic,” says Hope Harrison, a history professor and Germany expert at George Washington University.  ', 'Germany’s status as a bulwark against populism will likely be determined not Sunday, but in the years to come. It’s possible that the AfD could become more mainstream, as parties like the Greens have in the past.', '“A party evolves,” says Jackson Janes of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. “It’s possible that it becomes a more acceptable coalition partner.”', 'It’s also possible that the AfD becomes more appealing if Germany’s new government cannot come to grips with the challenges facing the country.

[+]', 'Voters in Germany elected their next parliament—which in Germany is known as the Bundestag—but did not directly elect the next German chancellor, as one is chosen, rather, based on which party has the highest share of votes.', 'Early exit polls cited by multiple outlets project the CDU—the party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel—is expected to get the highest share of votes in this election, likely positioning its leader Friedrich Merz to be the next chancellor.', 'Merz declared victory shortly after the polls closed Sunday, proclaiming CDU has “won the Bundestag election” and he is “aware of the responsibility that now lies ahead,” as quoted by BBC News.', 'AfD is projected to receive the second-highest vote share, as the right-wing party has grown in popularity among young voters and attracted support from Musk and Vice President JD Vance—its performance is expected to be the best of any far-right party in Germany since World War II, with leader Alice Weidel hailing a “historic result.”', 'Early exit polls show CDU with approximately 30% support while AfD has approximtely 20% of the vote, according to polls cited by The Guardian and The New York Times.', 'The Bundestag is now led by the center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) and leader Olaf Scholz, who conceded defeat Sunday after exit polls showed the SDP running in third place behind CDU and AfD with approximately 16.5% of votes.', 'Germany’s elections are seen as particularly important in Europe, as the country has the largest population in the European Union and the highest GDP.', 'Results are now rolling in, and it will likely become clear in the coming hours how the final results match up with the exit polls. Determining who will lead as chancellor will take longer, as it first has to be determined which parties will control the Bundestag, and then the leader is chosen by its members.', 'When Germans vote Sunday, it will only determine who’s elected to parliament and how the Bundestag will be divided between the parties based on the popular vote. Germany has a variety of political parties and it’s unlikely that any single party will win an outright majority, so different parties have to band together and form a coalition that has majority support to make decisions in the legislature. Once a coalition is formed, the German president—different from the chancellor—will propose a chancellor to lead the government, which is then voted on by parliament. The entire process can take weeks or months, Euronews notes.', 'Merz, the anticipated next chancellor of Germany, is a conservative figure who returned to politics after previously leaving to pursue a corporate career in the 2000s. He’s a longtime rival of Merkel who had left politics after she ascended to power in Germany, and previously lost two votes to lead the CDU in 2018 and 2021. He holds more conservative views than Merkel and represents a further-right faction of the party, particularly on immigration. Merz garnered widespread backlash in January when he got an anti-immigration resolution passed in the Bundestag with help from some AfD politicians, which was viewed as breaking the longtime “firewall” of major parties not working with the far-right party. He has since reiterated his vows not to work with AfD.', 'AfD is Germany’s furthest right major party, though the leadership itself has insisted it’s not far-right but rather a “libertarian, conservative” party. It has also denounced associations with Nazism. The party was formed in 2013 as an anti-European Union party but has broadened to embrace a variety of right-wing positions, most notably a hardline stance on immigration after Germany accepted a particularly high number of migrants from countries like Syria. The party is putting forth its first candidate for chancellor in this election, Weidel, a former Goldman Sachs analyst who Al Jazeera notes has been with the party since its formation in 2013. The party has gained popularity more recently among younger voters as it has made inroads via TikTok, BBC News notes, with younger men particularly backing the party. Anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany has also been fueled by a string of violent attacks that were allegedly committed by immigrants, with the BBC reporting five such attacks have taken place since May, most recently a stabbing Friday at Berlin’s Holocaust memorial.', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', 'While AfD is poised to get the second-highest share of votes in Germany’s elections, other leaders in the German government, including Merz, have vowed not to work with the party. That means that even though AfD is poised to get a significant number of seats in the Bundestag, CDU is expected not to form a coalition with it, and instead work only with other political parties. AfD co-chair Tino Chrupalla on Sunday called on other parties to work with AfD, however, saying the party has been “given a mandate to bring about political change.” “We have received the confidence of the voters and that should be something everybody else accepts as well,” Chrupalla said, as quoted by the BBC.', 'Musk has repeatedly boosted AfD, including by appearing by video at a rally, hosting a conversation with Weidel and authoring an op-ed in a German newspaper praising the party. He continued praising AfD on X ahead of Sunday’s election, pinning a post to the top of his profile that says “AfD!” with a string of German flags and responding “Yes” on Sunday to a post saying German voters should vote for the party because their “life depends on it.” Vance also drew controversy from other German leaders when he met with Weidel in February and chastised European leaders in a speech for not working with far-right parties like AfD. President Donald Trump hailed CDU’s victory in a Truth Social post Sunday, claiming the conservative party had prevailed after Germans “GOT TIRED OF THE NO COMMON SENSE AGENDA.” “THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR GERMANY, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,” Trump wrote.', 'The head of Germany’s leading Jewish organization expressed concern Sunday about the AfD’s strong showing. “It must concern us all that a fifth of German voters are giving their vote to a party that is at least partly right-wing extremist, that openly seeks linguistic and ideological links to right-wing radicalism and neo-Nazism, that plays on people’s fears and only offers them ostensible solutions,” Josef Schuster, who leads the Central Council of Jews, told newspaper Die Welt, as quoted by the AP.', 'Germany is holding its election sooner than scheduled, after Scholz’s three-party coalition government in the Bundestag fell apart late last year when the chancellor fired then-Finance Minister Christian Lindner amid growing infighting. Scholz then faced a vote of no-confidence from the Bundestag in December, which The Guardian reports he deliberately called and lost in order to force a new election.

The far right rising,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2025/02/german-election-afd-far-right-rising,"['New Times,\nNew Thinking.', 'Ahead of a historic German election, the AfD is courting the global right – and threatening to upend European politics.', 'By Annette Dittert', 'It is time to say goodbye to Germany as an oasis of stability. Like many in Britain, I have long looked to it as a bastion of good, sensible, borderline-boring politics – especially during the Brexit chaos of the post-referendum years. Not any more.', 'As the country goes to the polls on 23 February, there is a real danger that its position as a lynchpin of liberal democracy in Europe might suffer lasting, if not irreparable damage. The election will also have an immeasurable impact on how Europe reacts to Donald Trump’s apparent willingness to surrender Ukraine – which will affect the security of the whole continent. In this situation, it is crucial to have a stable German government playing a leading role in Brussels.', 'Yet, such a government is by no means certain. On the contrary, there is a real possibility that the Federal Republic will emerge from these Bundestag elections ungovernable. Neither of the two main centrist blocs – the Social Democratic Party (SPD) or the centre-right alliance of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) – are polling anywhere near high enough to look as if they will form a government on their own. And, as the political landscape fractures, even a majority for a two-party coalition is looking unlikely. Meanwhile, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) is at above 20 per cent – the highest it has ever polled and in second place behind the CDU/CSU.', 'Germany is now preparing for weeks or months of wrangling before something approaching a functioning government can be installed – if at all. Despite its size, the AfD will not be part of the next government: every other centrist party has expressly excluded the prospect of entering a coalition with it. The CDU leader Friedrich Merz – who will, barring a real upset, head Germany’s next government – has staked his political future on a categorical refusal.', 'But while the political centre has ruled out coalitions with the AfD, that doesn’t mean it is equipped to resist the draw of its politics. Whatever kind of coalition Merz might be able to form after the election, the AfD will be governing from the sidelines, destabilising his administration and undermining his political authority. In a way, the CDU leader only has himself to blame. Having made a habit of nabbing the far-right party’s issues and parroting its patterns of speech – particularly when it comes to issues such as immigration – he has drawn the AfD into the centre of the election campaign. In late January, he even used AfD votes to obtain a majority for a parliamentary motion – in breach of a long-standing taboo in German politics known as the “firewall” by which no centrist party should ever cooperate with the far right.', 'After an Afghan asylum seeker stabbed two people to death in an unmotivated criminal attack in the city of Aschaffenburg on 22 January, Germany’s smouldering debate around immigration was reignited. In an effort to secure his strongman image, Merz not only declared Germany to be an “unsafe country” – rhetoric that up until then was used by the AfD – he also proposed a series of measures to tighten the country’s borders, which would practically end free movement within the EU on a permanent basis.', 'In a weak attempt to protect the “firewall”, Merz garnished his draft motion with condemnations of the AfD in the hope the party would not back it – and that the SPD and the Greens would be swayed to vote with him. Yet the AfD leadership voted with Merz and the CDU, while the SPD and Greens voted against the proposed legislation on the grounds that it was incompatible with EU law. The motion passed (though, this close to the election, it will not be implemented). The firewall had cracked: it was the first time a German centrist democratic party had pushed through a piece of legislature on a national level with the support of a far-right extremist party.', 'Moreover, having previously promised not to cooperate with the AfD, Merz severely damaged his own credibility. In an effort to restore the firewall, he has reiterated that he will not form a coalition with the AfD following the election. However, who’s to say that he won’t, having broken one taboo in January, break the next? If coalition talks with other parties fail, could he try to lead a minority government, which would occasionally need further support from the far right to pass legislation?', 'Something that has been considered inconceivable in Germany since 1945 has now become a distinct possibility: a far-right party shaping, however indirectly, the nation’s government. The AfD isn’t just any right-wing populist outfit, either. It was founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party but has become increasingly radical with each passing year. Today it is one of the continent’s most extreme far-right groups: still anti-EU, but also pro-Vladimir Putin, and determined to destroy the democratic foundations of postwar Germany. It has proved too toxic for France’s Marine Le Pen, who booted it out of her “Patriots for Europe” grouping in the European Parliament in 2024 for being too extreme. German courts have even ruled that one of the AfD’s leaders, Björn Höcke, may officially be referred to as a “fascist” without constituting defamation. And in parts of former East Germany, local AfD groups are cooperating with neo-Nazi groups.', 'The AfD has sought to make migration the core issue of every electoral campaign – and Merz has helped the far-right party do just that. His error in January was to tie a single horrifying attack to wider problems in immigration policy, playing right into the AfD’s rhetoric instead of pursuing workable solutions. Indeed, the policy proposals he has now passed with AfD support will be almost impossible to implement. Merz, in a distinctly Trumpian fashion, has said that when he is in power, he will close Germany’s borders and refuse entry to all “illegal” immigrants on a permanent basis. This neglects how it is simply not possible to close the Federal Republic’s 4,000-kilometre-long border – German police unions estimate that such an endeavour would require at least another 10,000 new officers to guard the border – and ignores the inconvenient truth that German chancellors do not have the same executive power as US presidents. What’s more, his CDU/CSU is polling at 30 per cent, meaning he would need the SPD and probably one other party to form a government – partners who will not support permanent border closures that might be refused in European courts.', 'The predictable result of those negotiations is that Merz will be forced to scale down his rhetoric – leading, in turn, to further frustration among voters while the AfD triumphantly wields proof of its enduring criticism that the mainstream parties simply cannot deliver when it comes to stemming migration. He’ll leave the AfD looking like the only real opposition to what will likely be an unstable three-party coalition government.', 'Perhaps even more significantly, Merz’s policies are incompatible with European law. They contravene one of the pillars of the common market: the Schengen Agreement on freedom of movement. This also plays into the AfD’s agenda, as it wants to extricate Germany from the EU. While Schengen does allow border closures in exceptional circumstances, they must be time-limited, and several European legal experts doubt whether the attack in Aschaffenburg or even similar attacks constitute a national emergency of the kind required to justify such measures – all the more so because the number of refugees arriving in Germany is actually declining.', 'It is true that the country is struggling with way more than its fair share of asylum seekers, and that the joint European asylum system is in urgent need of reform. Yet giving national legislation precedence over European law would, in the medium term, likely weaken Germany’s position by provoking retaliatory measures from neighbouring countries who have already expressed their displeasure at Merz’s campaign proposals. Austria, for instance, has made it very clear that it would not take back any asylum seekers from Germany; Poland has adopted a similar stance.', 'In the summer of 2024, EU member states agreed on reforming the Common European Asylum System, adopting stronger entry checks at external EU borders with a view to spreading the load of asylum seekers across the bloc more equitably. Admittedly, this is a tedious, slow process not due to be implemented until 2026, but it is the only way to get a grip on migration without undermining the entire European project.', 'Merz knows all of this. Several members of his party have tried to explain away his pandering to the far right as a deliberate, calculated provocation during the election campaign meant to burnish the CDU’s right-wing credentials. After the election, they insist, he’ll moderate his position again. Yet this is a dangerously naive underestimation of the extent to which normalising far-right narratives undermines conservative positions and can, over time, destroy right-of-centre parties.', 'This is already happening. In late January, the CDU deputy leader Carsten Linnemann defended Merz’s strategy by saying that voters “have had enough of the AfD being branded Nazis and all the prattling on about the ‘firewall’”; another member of the party told the weekly Die Zeit that he was fed up with hearing “that some f***ing court order means we can’t do this or the Geneva Convention says we can’t do that”. This is the speed at which parts of the centrist conservative CDU have embraced AfD positions – and Merz may soon find that, in his efforts to position the CDU more firmly right of centre after the Angela Merkel years, he has gone much further than he meant to. If coalition talks with other centrist parties fail following the election, he will be under increased pressure from some quarters of his own party to form a minority government tolerated by the AfD.', 'Especially now the AfD has been given the official seal of approval from the very country that returned Germany to democracy after the Second World War. The Trump administration is openly supporting a far-right party with extremist members who consistently seek to minimise Nazi crimes. After having hailed the AfD as “Germany’s future” repeatedly on X, Elon Musk held an online talk with AfD leader Alice Weidel on 9 January, when he called on Germans to stop focusing on their historical guilt. At the Munich Security Conference on 14 February, the US vice-president JD Vance demanded that German centrist politicians should tear down the firewall against the AfD, before later meeting with Weidel.', 'The Trump administration is hardly ignorant of history. To the contrary: its support for the AfD is an attack on Germany’s historical conscience. This is because the firewall is the practical-political result of Germany’s memory of the totalitarian horrors of Nazi rule, a hard line drawn around the dangers of extremism. When Musk and Vance call for its destruction, they know exactly what they are doing. Supporting the AfD and normalising it for the German mainstream is an attack on historical conscience as an inoculation against authoritarian nationalism. The erosion of the firewall also has implications far beyond German borders. If Germany’s immunity to totalitarianism is lost, then it will be not just the EU’s largest country which has fallen, but the political and moral foundation of the EU itself. It’s notable that Hungary’s illiberal prime minister Viktor Orbán, who has long railed against the EU from within, hosted Weidel earlier this month.

In this way, Vance may have inadvertently pushed Merz’s CDU away from the AfD – and potentially galvanised Berlin’s political centre into installing a functioning government without excessive delay.', 'It’s a critical moment for Europe. The likelihood of a Russian attack on eastern Europe or the Baltic states has risen sharply, and a new German government will need to reassume its leading role in Brussels as soon as possible while rekindling its close alliance with France and Poland.', 'In this sense, the Bundestag election is not just a watershed moment for Germany, it’s one for global politics as well.

Vance said he “happen[s] to agree” with voters worried about “out-of-control migration.” But he was aghast at the idea that governments would try to silence their citizens, whatever their views. “There is no room for firewalls,” he said. “You either uphold the principle of democracy or you do not.”', 'Germany’s establishment leaders have long accepted a different binary: Either you put up a “firewall” (Brandmauer) against far-right extremists, or you risk losing your democracy to literal Nazis.

However, this coalition, unlike past grand coalitions, will have none of the splendor or dynamism: In fact, we might best consider it a grim coalition, more with the energy of a funeral that everyone has to go to but no one wants to be there.""', 'The efficacy of that coalition remains unclear for two reasons: First, that Sholz is likely out as leader of SPD, having given his ""swan song"" speech, as Doran called it, meaning the party will need to pick a new leader and direction; Second, that Merz has argued to take the party further to the right in an effort to pick up disaffected voters who switched to AfD.', '""He\'s identified immigration and the economy as the two main drivers of voter dissatisfaction with the previous governments, plural, and he\'s positioned his party to answer those frustrations,"" Doran said.', ""One policy that is likely to cause waves is Merz's desire to increase Germany and Europe's independence from the U.S."", '""I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of E.U. states, and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US, step by step,"" Merz said after polls closed on Sunday, according to German outlet DW.', 'Carsten Linnemann, the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union party, told the ARD broadcaster: ""One thing is clear: the Union has won the election ... The new chancellor will be called Friedrich Merz.""', 'Matthias Miersch, the secretary-general of the Social Democrats, called the election results ""a historic defeat.""', '""It\'s clear that this election wasn\'t lost in the last eight weeks,"" he said. ""The coalition has been in stormy waters for a couple of years and now it\'s been voted out. What sort of government is now formed, the extent to which the SPD can or should take on governmental responsibility, we simply can\'t say for now. Merz has the mandate to govern, and we\'ll have to wait and see what constellations are possible.""', 'Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD, said her party had achieved ""a historic result,"" adding that it was now ""firmly anchored"" in the political landscape.', '""We are the only party to double our position over the last election -— double,"" she said.', 'Alexander Dobrindt of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of the CDU, told ARD: ""We\'ve made clear what we consider a political change to be, and we\'ve made it clear that that cannot include the Green Party... I can\'t imagine a coalition with them. On the contrary: we\'ll do everything we can to build a coalition, and the Greens won\'t be needed.""', 'President Donald Trump on Truth Social wrote: ""LOOKS LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN GERMANY HAS WON THE VERY BIG AND HIGHLY ANTICIPATED ELECTION.

Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/22/g-s1-50098/germany-election-chancellor-parliament-afd,"['Rob Schmitz', 'People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21.', ""BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election."", ""The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election."", ""The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%)."", ""The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government."", '""I\'m just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form,"" says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break.""', ""The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table."", ""Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world."", 'Merz\'s longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany\'s parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: ""Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people,"" says Röttgen. ""And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist.""', ""Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies."", 'The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says.

He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population.""', 'After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says.', ""Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic."", 'Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz\'s potential leadership.

She has reported on war, genocide and political chaos in a career that has taken her around the world.', 'Germans delivered a major election win to conservatives Sunday — but the likely incoming chancellor may face trouble sooner than he’d like, for reasons foreign and domestic.', 'Friedrich Merz — the leader of the victorious Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union alliance — is a U.S.-loving former lawyer but he may clash with President Donald Trump, as Merz is a fierce defender of Europe and NATO.', 'Meanwhile, Merz faces rising pressure on his right: Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party with anti-migration and pro-Russian views, came in second place, amid voters’ growing concern over migration and the economy. It was the best showing ever for the party, but it likely won’t serve in a governing coalition; the other leading parties have refused to partner with AfD because they consider it too extreme. That means Merz will have to weave together a potentially fragile governing coalition, in part perhaps with the current ruling center-left Social Democrats, which landed third.', 'So how can Merz keep AfD at bay? Simple: He has to deliver, according to Gordon Repinski, the executive editor of POLITICO Germany and one of the savviest observers of the nation’s politics.', '“The only way to reduce the votes for AfD is to form and lead a successful government,” Repinski said in an interview. “He has to work in a very smart way and solve the problems that he wants to solve and keep his promises. That’s the only way to keep the AfD down.”', 'Key figures in the United States may not be rooting for him. Tech mogul Elon Musk, a close partner of Trump, was a vocal supporter of the AfD, and Vice President JD Vance recently met its leader. Trump, for his part, appeared to take solace Sunday that Merz’s winning alliance was conservative, posting on social media: “THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR GERMANY.”', 'Depending on how the Trump-Merz relationship unfolds, he may soon think differently.', 'This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.', 'What is your biggest takeaway from the results we’ve seen?', 'Friedrich Merz is the winner, and he will likely be the next chancellor, but by far not with the results he would have wished for. He likely has to build a coalition with either the Social Democrats or even additionally, with the Green Party. That means that he would have to build a coalition with one or two parties that rather belong to the left wing. So all the reforms that he wants to push through in terms of migration and economic reform will be a lot more difficult than he would have wished for.', 'Who is Merz and what is he like? With Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz, we had figures who seemed somewhat wooden in public, but perhaps were more dynamic in person. How does Merz differ?', 'Friedrich Merz is kind of the opposite figure in terms of rhetoric and approach to politics as Angela Merkel. They have quite a specific relationship with each other. Friedrich was rising in the Conservative Party in the ‘90s, and was in a powerful position of head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the early 2000s when Angela Merkel had her rise in parallel. At some point, Angela Merkel sort of kicked out Friedrich Merz from his position as head of the caucus, and Friedrich Merz, in a very frustrated situation, left politics and sort of followed Angela Merkel’s chancellery from the sidelines. He was very critical of what she was doing. When he was running for the head of the party, after Angela Merkel resigned, he really stood for the opposite approach to politics as Angela Merkel.', 'That means more of the traditional conservative approach, a bit tougher, whereas Merkel was somebody who really integrated into the middle, who was very understanding to also her political competitors. Merkel was a politician who was not vain, who was not looking for useless fights, whereas Friedrich Merz is one of these people who likes to fight and likes to give a sharp speech, but also says some things that might not be beneficial for him in the long run. Olaf Scholz is also a person who’s not very charismatic, just like Angela Merkel. He’s also a person who always tried to integrate to the other political side. In that regard, they were quite similar. The difference was that Angela Merkel was humble in her approach and in her uncharismatic appearance, and Olaf Scholz was rather arrogant in his uncharismatic appearance.', 'In short, what we will see is a major change in terms of political communication after two decades of very shy and very defensive communication that we have seen with Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz.', 'So Merz is more pugnacious and less willing to compromise?', 'It’s even literally a sentence that he said when we were discussing migration policies in Germany. He literally said “the time of compromise has ended.” And then went into a parliamentary debate where, at the end, he voted together with the AfD, which was one of the very controversial moments. I sometimes am not sure if the strategy of Merz is really thoughtful, or is thinking toward the end result, because he seems to be sometimes guided by his impulses, and that seems to be one of his greatest weaknesses. He sometimes needs to stop himself, or he needs to have someone around him that stops him from doing stupid things.', 'Ultimately, why did Merz’s party outperform Scholz’s party? What were the essential ideological and personal factors behind this?', 'The Conservative Party, structurally, is a bit stronger in Germany than the Social Democratic Party. If you look at history, most of the years were with conservative chancellors, and in very particular times or with very particular candidates, you had a Social Democratic majority. So there’s a structural advantage for the conservative party among the population.', 'But also, Olaf Scholz had a very difficult time during government. He was working in a complicated coalition with two partners, so it was three partners in total, who were very different in their policy approaches. And then this happened during very difficult times, obviously — war and an energy crisis. The energy crisis hit Germany very hard, because the prices for gas were rising so heavily, and Germany obviously was so dependent on Russian gas. We saw a lot of inflation. We saw a lot of economic turmoil. That obviously ended in the population losing trust in the government itself, in total, and also in the chancellor, Olaf Scholz.', 'I do think there’s a shift in terms of the political debate in Germany that goes toward tougher migration, that goes a bit more against “woke” policies. All these things that you see in the U.S. you also see in Germany. In this regard, Friedrich Merz is much more a candidate that can also please these wishes or tendencies in the population. We have seen a lot of attacks carried out by migrants in the last 12 months in Germany, and the population really wishes for changes.', 'The extreme right AfD still performed well. How do you think Elon Musk and JD Vance’s efforts to boost that party affected the results?', 'I don’t think it affected it very much, very directly. The AfD benefits from a failing government, and that’s what we have seen in Germany. The roughly 20 percent that the AfD obtained is a good result, but there are also voices within the AfD who were saying it could have been more.', 'So did the Musk and Vance effort to boost AfD fail?', 'I also don’t think it failed. Obviously it gives [the party] a bit of credibility in public, because all of a sudden you had this rich guy, the richest person in the world, supporting AfD, and obviously the U.S. government sympathizing with AfD. The core AfD voter is an Eastern German person — older, male, if you want to have a typical person — and that is a person who is leaning toward Russia. In Eastern Germany, you have a lot of people who think that actually the U.S. is evil and Russia is not that bad. The success of the AfD is built on that notion. The AFD at its core is a Russia-friendly party, and now all of a sudden, an American entrepreneur supports AfD.', 'There’s also a lot of contradiction within the AfD program toward global policies, because they fundamentally haven’t decided whether they want to be close to Russia or to the U.S. now, and in that regard, I don’t think this typical Eastern German AfD voter is very impressed by Elon Musk supporting AfD.', 'How is Merz going to handle the AfD, which still grabbed a significant chunk of seats? What is ahead for Germany’s nationalist ultra right?', 'The only way to reduce the votes for AfD is to form and lead a successful government. That is what Friedrich Meriz has to do now. First of all, he has to build a coalition. He has to work in a very smart way and solve the problems that he wants to solve and keep his promises. That’s the only way to keep the AfD down.', 'Merz pushed back on Vance’s lecture to Europeans in Munich about free speech. How do you think Merz will relate to President Trump?', 'Merz is a very transatlantic person. His English is fluent, and he spent a lot of time in the United States, and he has a lot of friends and a lot of political contacts there. But at the same time, he’s a European leader, and the idea of Europe and the European Union is challenged by Donald Trump. That is why Merz, at an early stage, decided to opt for the European values and also the values in terms of the approach to Ukraine. He formulated sentences that can be understood as tough toward Trump.', 'I do believe that he knows that only strength can be convincing in a direct conversation with the U.S. president. This will probably also be his approach. I do think he’s more likely to be successful in that regard just because of his appearance. Olaf Schwartz is this careful, rather shy person. Trump would never have taken him seriously. I think with Friedrich Merz that’s a different story.', 'On the issue of Ukraine — how do you expect Merz will approach Washington and Moscow, as well as Kyiv and Brussels? He seems like a confident type of guy.', 'He’s aware that Europe needs to do more on Ukraine, and he knows that Germany needs to spend more on defense, and this is also fundamentally a European issue. He will still do everything to promote the core values of the transatlantic alliance. He will demand support from the United States and do the same that the European countries were doing by supporting the U.S. in Afghanistan. I think he will also try to convince Donald Trump that it’s not only European values that are defended in Ukraine but also Western values, and that it is not in the U.S. and President Trump’s favor to see a dictator like Russia’s Vladimir Putin win on Ukraine and fundamentally change the geopolitical order of the world.', 'How much did anxiety about migration and “woke” cultural rules affect the race and what lesson does that offer other Western democracies?', 'It affected it a lot — particularly migration and the several attacks that were blamed on migrants. We saw an attack from a person running into a group of people in Munich just a day before the Munich Security Forum. The debate of woke-ism or anti-woke-ism was there but not so predominant. It’s very difficult to draw a conclusion from the migration debate in Germany for other countries because it was so tied to the attacks by migrants.', 'Merz has experience in the business and legal worlds. How wealthy is he, and how will he approach trade and tariff issues in particular when it comes to the Trump administration? Although I understand that the European Union generally handles trade issues.', 'I don’t have visibility on his bank account, but I know he has a private plane that he uses sometimes to fly from his place in North-Rhine Westphalia to Berlin. I was asking him just this week whether he would feel “unfree” if he wasn’t allowed to use this anymore when he’s a chancellor. He said, “Yes, I would feel ‘unfree’ if I’m not allowed to use this anymore.” But that’s a side story. He’s a wealthy man. I don’t know his exact numbers. I don’t think he’s a billionaire. I mean, he made some money being a lobbyist, but he was never an entrepreneur in that regard.', 'On trade, I think his approach will be to find as equivalent as possible answers on what Trump is doing and threatening towards Europe. The thing that he always tells me is the answer, and it is a European answer, is to say, “How can we punish the United States? Is it jeans? Is it whiskey? Is it Harley-Davidson?” Then raise the tariffs on that. Then hopefully come to a point where, after a couple of weeks, you negotiate that it’s better to have no tariffs on anything. This is what he says. He would much prefer a world with low tariffs between the United States and Europe, Germany — but trade is a European thing — than to have high tariffs.', 'What are some other issues where Merz will blaze a different path than his predecessors?', 'There’s common ground with the U.S. on China. Merz is aware that there needs to be a tougher approach on China — he’s very open to that. In terms of Africa or Latin America, I would say that probably Merz has a much more utilitarian approach, so a lot closer to probably what the U.S. would do.', 'How will Merz deal with Russian leader Vladimir Putin?', 'He will certainly have a tougher approach than Sholz. Scholz always had in mind that he wanted to be a careful supporter of Ukraine. He didn’t want to provoke Putin. He didn’t want to cross red lines. There’s probably a fair percentage of things that Scholz could have done more. We can expect Merz to do these couple percent more toward Ukraine. The typical conservative Western German approach toward Russia is tough, and that’s where Merz comes from.', '', '© 2025 POLITICO LLC']"

The AfD’s victory in the state in elections last year made it the first far right party to win any sort of election since the Nazi era.', 'Yet the trend of young voters choosing the AfD for their politics is a phenomenon that is a rising across Germany.', 'Polls for the upcoming election on Sunday, and the AfD’s success in regional elections last year, show the party has transformed from regional to national force.', 'If European election results last year - which saw an 18% increase in 16–34-year-olds voting for the AfD - are a barometer, the rise nationally among the same group could form a significant part of the AfD’s likely climb into second place.', 'The AfD in Thuringia is designated an extremist organization by German domestic intelligence and Höcke is its leader.', 'But many of the young people we spoke to didn’t attempt to hide their admiration for Höcke, with some saying they came specifically to listen to him.', 'Dante Reidel, a 26-year-old student, standing next to a stall selling the German far-right magazine “Compact,” said he is also a designated extremist.', 'For Reidel, Höcke is an idol, “it’s also about the personalities… who embody certain values.

', ""The neo-liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), whose withdrawal from the coalition triggered the snap elections, also suffered heavy losses. The party won't enter the Bundestag after failing to meet the 5% threshhold."", ""When Germans go to the polls, they have two votes: one for a candidate to represent their constituency and the second for a party's state list. The first vote is for a direct candidate running in the respective electoral district and determines half of the parliament's total composition, ensuring each district is represented. The second vote decides the strength of the parties in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag and thereby establishes how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the Bundestag."", 'There are 630 seats in the Bundestag. The number of seats a party has is determined by their vote share. A party must receive at least 5% of votes to enter parliament. However, an exception is granted to parties that field winning candidates in at least three electoral districts: winning three individual mandates lifts the 5% threshold for the respective party. ', 'While the CDU/CSU have won the largest share of votes, they don\'t an absolute majority. The party is set to gain 208 seats in the Bundestag. They will need to enter a coalition with another party to secure 316 seats in the Bundestag, the minimum for a majority, and form the next government. The CDU has ruled out a coalition with the AfD, insisting that it is the ""firewall"" to the far-right. That leaves a two-way grand coalition with the SPD or three-way coalition including the Greens as the most likely options, depending on the final seat distribution. The coalition calculator shows possible coalition outcomes.', ""Sunday's election saw voters switching affiliations and moving across the party spectrum. One of the most significant migrations was away from the center-left SPD to the conservative CDU/CSU, which picked up roughly 2 million votes from the Social Democrats. The Left Party benefitted from voter migration from both the SPD and the Greens, adding 560,000 and 700,000 votes respectively."", 'Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 leaned to the extremes, casting their ballot more often for the far-right AfD and the Left Party. The more traditional parties of SPD and CDU received their lowest voter returns from younger voters. The Greens, long a favorite with the youth vote, had one of their lowest percentage of votes in this age group. Voters over 60 were more likely to vote SPD and CDU.', 'Men tended to vote more conservatively than women, casting their ballots more often for the CDU and the AfD, whereas women tended to vote more for the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party.', 'The difference in votes according to gender was only a few percentage points, except when it came to voting for the AfD.', 'The gender gap between men and women voting for the AfD was 7%. The difference between the genders for the other parties was only 2-3%.', 'Voters without a college education were more likely to vote conservative, with the CDU and AfD being their favored parties, followed by the SPD. People with a basic education level were twice as likely to vote AfD as those with higher education. German voters with higher degrees were more than twice as likely to vote for the Greens and the Left Party compared to those with basic education levels.', 'Nationally, the AfD achieved roughly 20% of the vote. But results differ significantly from region to region. The AfD, which is classified in part as right-wing extremist, is now the strongest force in eastern Germany. In the states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, the far-right party is clearly in the lead, with many constituencies reporting over 30% of the second vote going to the AfD, while the CDU and SPD trailed far behind. ', 'In the state of Thuringia, home to Björn Höcke, who was convicted for using banned Nazi slogans, the party received more than 38% of the vote, nearly double the number of votes for the CDU. Berlin is the exception in Germany’s former East, where the Left Party won the most votes in the capital.', 'For the first time in an election, the AfD won the majority of the second votes in two constituencies in the western part of the country, Gelsenkirchen and Kaiserslautern. However, in both cities SPD candidates won the majority of the first votes.', 'The East-West divide is mirrored in the distribution of votes for the CDU and SPD. The CDU together with the CSU received a higher percentage of the vote in the south, west and north.

From my perch here in the US—where I arrived decades ago, thinking that having grown up in a country that experienced fascism was never going to be relevant again—here are a couple of thoughts on what we might learn from the German election. ', '1: Multiparty democracy is a mess, but it has one big plus: It creates options for people who are mad at the status quo. The German campaign echoed a lot of Trump v. Harris 2024: Immigration and inflation were the drivers, and underneath that was the discontent with “those in charge” that has been a theme in virtually every recent election in the West. But unlike Americans, Germans who wanted to send a message to a government they didn’t like had options.', '2: One of those options—but only one—was the AfD. Call them the Make Germany Great Again movement, but unlike MAGA they were not able to take over one of the dominant parties. They had to create their own. The AfD is where you’ll find traditional conservatives who’ve been radicalized, people who were always radical but couldn’t say so in polite society, and people who are simply mad as hell. It’s not a Nazi party: That would be illegal in Germany, and politically nonviable too, at least for now. But the AfD absolutely has created a space for fascist-adjacent politics and ideas, from forced “remigration” of immigrants including those with German citizenship, to rehabbing Third Reich slogans and questioning whether SS members were criminals. ', '3: Twenty percent for the AfD is about exactly what the polls predicted; they’d hoped for 25 percent, which would have been seismic. I can’t help thinking of my dad, who used to say that in any country, 20 percent of voters will vote for the nutbags, if nutbags are on offer. The big problem is when they sweep in a bunch of other folks.', '4: But again, those other folks had options. The left-wing party (which has pretty thoroughly repudiated its roots in East Germany’s Communist Party) looks to be landing at close to 9 percent, up from just over 5. The libertarian party was punished for having been part of the unpopular governing coalition, but the new left-populist party BSW—anti-immigration, anti-aid to Ukraine, anti-pronoun, but pro-labor, pro-welfare state, and decidedly anti-Nazi—looks close to making it past the 5-percent threshold that would get it seats in Parliament. Think of BSW as if the Obama-Trump voters had made their own party. It’s a fascinating development and one we might see replicated elsewhere at some point.', '5: More parties means more options for forming a non-fascist government. The “firewall” that Germany’s democratic parties have erected against the far right, pledging never to let them govern, has eroded, but it will hold. For now. ', 'So what’s next? To be sure, being the strongest opposition party is the ideal scenario for the far right: They get to demagogue everything the government does and everything it can be blamed for, such as the soaring energy prices caused by AfD pal Putin and his war in Ukraine. That posture is where the far right is most comfortable (other than complete control). But in a country that is divided not along a single line, but along a spectrum, others, especially the emboldened left party, will compete with the AfD as the voices of protest. ', 'And here’s who else turned out to be less popular than feared: Putin and Elon Musk. Musk, as my colleague Julianne McShane reported, campaigned hard for the AfD, and Putin’s courtship of them may have extended to paying one of their officials. But being the puppet of either an American billionaire or a Russian dictator is not a great look anywhere in Europe.', 'What should we take away from this for US politics? For one, that people vote in protest for lots of different reasons. It’s a mistake to assume (as Trump and Musk seem to believe, and some in the media too) that a MAGA victory means a MAGA country. America’s two-party system does a lot to mask the differences between voters, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there.', 'And just as importantly, small-d democrats were an overwhelming majority in Germany—and they might be here, too. Eighty percent voted for parties that vowed not to make common cause with the far right. That can’t happen in the US in quite the same way because of the far right’s takeover of the GOP. But America’s small-d democratic coalition still exists, and capital-D Democrats might capitalize on that by showing that their tent is big enough. Disagreement is healthy, if you can agree on the most important part—that democracy is about agreeing to disagree. ', 'The next few years will be hard on small-d democrats everywhere. Bad things will continue to happen—maybe another pandemic, almost certainly an economic slowdown, quite possibly more armed conflicts. Demagogues and authoritarians will exploit those things as hard as they can. But 20 percent might be about their ceiling, unless they get extraordinarily lucky or democratic forces cave.', 'So let’s dust ourselves off and get to work.

However, it faces exclusion from government by other parties, due to what is known as a “firewall” arrangement.', 'Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) took just 16.4% of the vote following the collapse of its “traffic light coalition” government – a dramatic turnaround in the party’s fortunes since the 2021 election, when it won 25.7%.', 'Merz, 69, now faces an enormous task following Sunday’s snap election that was dominated by concerns over immigration, the economy and the return of US President Donald Trump.', '“My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” he said at a roundtable event later on Sunday.', '“I would never have believed that I would have to say something like that on television. But at the very least, after Donald Trump’s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans - at least this part of the Americans in this administration - are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe,” he added.', 'Sunday’s preliminary results cap off an eventful election period that drew extraordinary involvement from White House officials and has once again seen debate rage around Germany’s immigration policies.', 'Trump sent shockwaves across Europe after he pushed ahead with peace talks on Ukraine with Russia, excluding both Kyiv and European leaders – prompting European leaders to hold emergency talks to discuss its unified response on the crisis.', 'Merz also referenced Elon Musk’s “intervention in the German election campaign” in recent days. “The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow,” he said at the televised event.', '“We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my top priority is to create unity in Europe.”', 'The CDU’s party headquarters were filled with cheers and applause on Sunday evening as the exit polls were revealed and it became clear that the opposition party was set to become the largest group. Outside the building, a small group of protesters had gathered to demonstrate against what they perceive as party leader Friedrich Merz’s hard line on immigration.', 'The mood at the AfD election party, meanwhile, was ecstatic as it emerged that the party had almost doubled its support, with people cheering and waving Germany flags.

Another potential coalition partner is the environmental Greens, which served in Scholz’s coalition government.', 'The “traffic light” coalition brought together an uneasy alliance of three ideologically different parties and its collapse triggered Sunday’s snap vote, a relative rarity in a country which has long had one of the most stable political systems in Europe.', 'Also notable in the exit polls was a successful outcome for the socialist Die Linke party, which won 8.8% – comfortably pushing it over the 5% threshold needed to enter parliament.', 'It remains unclear at this stage whether Merz will need one or two partners to form a majority.
