Kathy Hochul of New York that aired on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on Feb. 23, 2025.', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Trump's clash with Democratic governors. Joining us now from Albany, New York, is the governor, Kathy Hochul, good morning to you, Governor. "", 'GOV. KATHY HOCHUL: Good morning. ', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were just here in Washington and you met privately with President Trump. In the past, you've said the relationship doesn't have to be adversarial. Was your meeting with him adversarial? And what was your top message?"", ""GOV. HOCHUL: It wasn't an adversarial meeting, but I was very clear, especially after I found that the Trump administration had ended a program that was put in place, congestion pricing, by the duly elected members of our legislature representing the voice of the people, and with a tweet, he claims that he is the king, and therefore he has the power to destroy it. And I have a problem with that characterization, because we labored under a king 250 years ago, and as I said, we're not going back there. So I wanted to take my case to him directly and let him see the benefits of this program, because our city is paralyzed with gridlock, and we had a path forward to be able to make the city move again, and it's working. I wanted to just have that opportunity to convey that, but I don't know that we're very persuasive on that front, but that's okay. The people in my state need to know I'm willing to take the fight wherever I have to."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: So just to explain for our audience, congestion pricing, you're talking about this $9 toll you put on people driving into lower Manhattan, below 60th Street. Your fellow Democrat, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, says he doesn't like this policy, actually asked President Trump to stop it. President Trump's office says this is discriminatory against working class people. How do you respond to that?"", ""GOV. HOCHUL: I respond this way with all due respect to the state of New Jersey. They do not tell us in New York what to do, nor does Washington when it comes to policies that we believe are going to reduce congestion. Move along vehicles, emergency vehicles are moving faster. Air quality is improving. So I have arguments that are important, but no one else should be able to second guess us, because that's not how our system of laws and states was set up. I'm the Governor of New York. I will deal with the internal issues before me without interference from New Jersey or indeed, the federal government."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is going to the courts.', ""GOV. HOCHUL: Oh yes, it's going to the courts, and I believe we will be victorious in the courts, and this program will continue."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, this is not the only standoff between the state and federal government, and the tension here, I know you were in Washington with other governors who were meeting with the President this week. Federal funds account for about 40% of your state's budget. President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds to governors in order to force compliance with his agenda. Here's what he said to the governor of Maine. Take a listen."", '[VO SOT] ', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Is Maine here, the Governor of Maine?', ""ME GOV JANET MILLS: Yeah, I'm here."", 'PRESIDENT TRUMP: Are you not going to comply with it?', ""ME GOV JANET MILLS: I'll comply with the state and federal law."", ""PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well I'm -- we are the federal law. Well you better do it. You better do it. Because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't. "", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: That was about transgender athletes on girls sports teams. Are you Democratic governors going to start to work together on this? Is there legal pushback?', ""GOV. HOCHUL: What he is doing is they've described it as flooding the zone. They're attacking California when it comes to FEMA dollars. They're filing lawsuits in Illinois. They're going after Maine on this, and they're coming after programs that have been duly put in place in the state- What they're trying to do is create this theater of all kinds of activity that is trying to be a distraction to us. And when someone floods the zone in a football game, what you need to have is the defenders be very disciplined, smart, but also stand their ground. And that's exactly what New York governors, the governor of New York will do in cooperation with our governors. We're not going to sit idly by and let our rights be attacked. We'll work with you when there's common ground, no doubt about it, let's build great projects and infrastructure. There's areas where we're going to work with you on immigration and getting the violent criminals off our streets. We do not dispute that, but don't think that you can just come in and bully us around and not expect a reaction from governors."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: You know that when it comes to your state, there's been a lot of focus on Manhattan and the Department of Justice because of Eric Adams and the ongoing legal issues he has. In the past week, four deputy mayors resigned. Seven federal prosecutors resigned after the Trump justice department moved to dismiss those five counts of federal corruption indictments against- against Mayor Adams. You know, the allegation is that the dismissal of the charges was in- related to a quid pro quo around immigration compliance. Did you discuss this case at all with the President when you were in the room with him one on one?"", ""GOV. HOCHUL: No, I did not. In fact, it's- we're waiting for the decision by a judge on whether he's going to accept those recommendation for a dismissal. So that's still in litigation. But I will say this, we are not allowing the Trump administration to interfere in the operations of our city, and the legal problems that the mayor is facing because of the Trump administration, and the phrasing they have used, and indeed, an interview that was done by one of his representatives on national television saying that he's basically got the mayor under his control. That's concerning, and I have to be able to put in safeguards. Of course, everyone says I had the option to remove him. I still hold that option to remove him. It is an extraordinary power. And I know there's a lot of people disappointed and angry and want something done immediately, but I will always stand on the fact that we are a nation of laws, and one individual, the governor of New York, should not use her voice and her will to override the will of the voters. We have an election in a few months for- in a primary, I'm going to let the voters decide, but I'm also going to be very cognizant. I need to keep an eye on this situation, especially the way the Trump administration has telegraphed that they want to get into our operations, and I have to be the firewall to stop that. "", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So having said that, does that mean you do believe there was a quid pro quo understanding with Eric Adams?', ""GOV. HOCHUL: I am going by what the perception could be. I cannot let the integrity of the administration in the city of New York be undermined by perception that the Trump administration actually created, they created this perception, the reality I will never know, but as long as there's the faith of New Yorkers that has been undermined by what the Trump administration doing is trying to give the appearance of holding the city hostage, those are what-  that's exactly what they're trying to do. Again, they're trying to create chaos. But we have to be smart as Democrats and as leaders and parse through all this and just go do what's right. That will always be my North Star."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Hochul, thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in one minute.

There’s a response that’s required when someone comes after you – someone just came after my state.”', 'Hochul said she is still willing to talk with Trump and try to find common ground. But she said that this time, the president crossed a line. “You went too far because you came after New Yorkers,” she said.', 'The new move from the Trump administration comes just one week after the U.S. Department of Justice sued New York (and Hochul herself) over a state law that permits undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses and shields DMV data from immigration officials. At the time, Hochul cancelled a meeting with the president that was scheduled for the next day and released a fairly strong statement taking aim at the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and billionaire Elon Musk.

Are you going to slap handcuffs on my goddamn hands?’” Hochul next plans to meet with Trump when she is in Washington later this week for the National Governors Association winter meeting."", ""Hochul even made use of a prop during the Wednesday press conference, holding up a mock cover of Time magazine featuring Trump in a crown and the word “TRUMP” at the top. “Next time you're stuck in traffic, the next time your train is delayed, the next time you're in a flooded station because infrastructure carries are not made – I want you to think of this,” she said, pointing to the fake magazine cover.

Kathy Hochul (D) is under increasing political pressure as she faces a likely competitive reelection fight and legal battles with President Trump.', 'Hochul’s approval rating has been underwater for months as she surpasses the midpoint of her first full term in office and seems likely to have a serious primary battle on the horizon from Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), who has become one of her sharpest critics. Presuming she gets past Torres, popular GOP Rep. Mike Lawler (N.Y.) seems equally likely to run and could give Republicans their best shot at winning New York’s gubernatorial race in years.', 'Meanwhile, Hochul may be set to take on an increasingly national profile as she faces off with Trump on key issues to her constituents.', '“It is certainly something that New Yorkers have been looking for, and have been looking for, particularly from Washington, in the past two and a half months,” one New York Democratic strategist said. “But that was one flash. Can she sustain that type of war footing? I think is a serious question.”', 'Hochul rose to become the first female governor of New York in 2021 under unusual circumstances, following the resignation of her predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who left office amid multiple controversies surrounding him and his administration.', 'Hochul was Cuomo’s choice to serve as lieutenant governor in 2014 and was in her second term when he stepped down. She ascended to the governorship through the line of succession.', 'She is the first New York governor not from New York City or its outskirts in many decades, as candidates from the city have historically dominated gubernatorial races.', 'Yet despite winning a full term in her own right in 2022, she has struggled with her popularity among New Yorkers while in office.', 'Some Democrats see a mix of reasons as to why.', '“I think part of it is she never introduced herself, and the other part of it is just the reality that she is not a New York City person. She’s the first governor that’s been from upstate … in a significantly long period of time,” the strategist said.', 'Hochul only defeated former Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) in the race by about 6 percentage points, the closest gubernatorial race in the state in decades, as New York Democrats performed poorly overall. And her favorability rating has been underwhelming.', 'The most recent Siena College poll conducted at the end of last month showed that 39 percent of registered voters viewed her favorably, while 44 percent approved of her job performance and 48 percent disapproved.', 'She hasn’t had a positive favorability rating in Siena’s polling since January of last year.', 'A Morning Consult poll from the last quarter of 2024 found her approval rating above water, with 48 percent approving and 42 percent disapproving, but only three governors up for reelection in 2026 had worse net approval ratings and only one Democratic governor was less popular among their party’s voters.', 'As her numbers have been middling, speculation has grown that Hochul may face a primary challenge from an increasingly vocal critic in Torres, who has served in the House since 2021 and said he is considering a run for governor.', 'Hochul spokesperson Jen Goodman told The Hill that the governor will continue to focus on delivering results for New Yorkers as she plans for her reelection bid, making streets and subways safer, helping lower costs for taxpayers and pushing back against “federal overreach.”', '“With a strong record of tackling the state’s toughest challenges, the Governor is prepared to bring together a winning coalition to keep moving New York forward, no matter who enters the race,” Goodman said.', 'Torres slammed Hochul after the 2024 presidential election as the “new Joe Biden,” nodding to pushback Biden faced to drop out of the race.', '“A Democratic incumbent who is less popular in New York than Donald Trump is in grave danger of losing to a Republican in 2026 — an outcome not seen in 30 years,” he posted on the social platform X. “Waiting until it’s too late gave us a Republican President in 2024 and could give us a Republican Governor in 2026.”', 'Democrats said a primary challenge from Torres could make for a serious race, as he has increasingly taken on a higher profile. He has been a particularly strong voice in favor of Israel amid its war against Hamas since 2023.', 'But he will likely still have an uphill battle if he challenges Hochul.', '“Congressman Torres is a very talented up-and-coming political star,” Democratic strategist Jake Dilemani said. “For a junior congressman, he has a very large profile, can raise a lot of money, is clearly very intelligent, talented. It’s still very tough, though to dislodge an incumbent.”', 'Dilemani noted Hochul has strong infrastructure in place, noting her significant fundraising prowess, as she raised more than $50 million for her 2022 race.', 'That strength has continued to today, as she raised more than $10 million in January between her political operation and the state Democratic Party, totaling $32.5 million raised off-cycle.', 'Torres has also faced some criticism over his past more left-leaning positions as he has moderated more recently, having called for “defunding the police” in 2020 and shifting on immigration. He responded to the criticism, telling Politico that he is working to reorient the party to a “rational center on public safety.”', 'Hochul also has a significant name recognition advantage, as a December Siena poll found almost 70 percent didn’t know Torres or had no opinion of him.', '“I don’t necessarily know how Ritchie plays in the rest of the state,” another New York Democrat said. “There are Democratic primary voters outside of the island of Manhattan, and I think they will have a say on this.”', 'On the horizon beyond the primary, Hochul could be up for an even more competitive general election against Lawler, who has established a reputation as a more bipartisan member of the House in a highly polarized Congress. He has been well-liked and won reelection by 6 points in a district Democrats eyed to flip.', 'Democrats said Lawler could be a strong candidate for the general election, with one calling him “the best type of candidate” that the GOP could put forward. But the reality of New York could position Hochul still as the favorite and Lawler, or another nominee, in an uphill battle.', 'The Democrat noted that Lawler has managed to develop a bipartisan reputation but may need to take difficult votes in a narrow GOP House majority while eyeing statewide office in a blue-leaning state.', '“How often is Mike Lawler not going to vote with [House Speaker] Mike Johnson?” they said.', 'And Hochul’s most recent standoffs with Trump could have political benefits in addition to policy ones, Democrats said.', 'Hochul was initially among the more conciliatory Democrats as Trump took office, saying she would look for places to work with him.', 'Over the past 10 days, Hochul has taken a more combative stance. She reportedly postponed a planned meeting with Trump after Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a lawsuit against New York and Hochul over immigration policies.', 'And she came out even harder after Trump rescinded Biden-era approval of the controversial congestion pricing program, which has charged drivers $9 to enter Manhattan. Hochul has said the program reduces traffic congestion and pollution.', '“We’ll see you in court,” Hochul said in response to the decision, also going after Trump’s Truth Social statement about congestion pricing in which he said in all capital letters, “Long live the king!”', '“I’m here to say, New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years and we sure as hell are not going to start now,” she said to applause.', 'Analysts said congestion pricing is a difficult issue with strong feelings on both sides, with Dilemani calling it a “hot potato.” But standing up to Trump could be an opportunity to frame it in better terms for Hochul in addition to fighting for an issue she believes in, they added.', 'A Morning Consult poll found 6 in 10 New Yorkers say Trump should allow the program to continue, but a plurality said they oppose the congestion tax, suggesting the framing of the question could drive the difference.', 'She also has the benefit that many of her recent policy proposals appear to be widely popular.', '“I do think there’s currency in standing up to Trump, whoever the president would be,” Dilemani said. “There’s currency in looking like you’re a strong executive who doesn’t let people from out of state bully what’s going on in the state.”', 'Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Freshly Spineless New York Governor Kathy Hochul Throws Lifeline to Corrupt NYC Mayor Eric Adams,https://www.pajiba.com/news/freshly-spineless-new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-throws-lifeline-to-corrupt-nyc-mayor-eric-adams.php,"['By Andrew Sanford | News | February 21, 2025 |', 'Democrats have been scrambling to deal with Donald Trump’s new Presidential term. By scrambling, I mean they’ve done little besides voicing their strong displeasure. Some Dems, like New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are taking the fight to Trump and his Boss, Elon Musk, by calling out their destructive behavior and attempting to help those affected while being threatened with jail time. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has also been making the right kind of noise, rightfully comparing Trump and Musk to the Nazis. For a brief moment, it seemed like New York Governor Kathy Hochul had joined the ranks of “Democrats Who Give A S***.”', 'This year saw the beginning of Congestion Pricing in NYC. The program established a new toll for driving into Midtown Manhattan to lower traffic, get people into the city more easily, and provide much-needed funds for the MTA. Despite heavy opposition from rich people who don’t live in the city, the program has been working as intended! Traffic is down, visitation is up, and Broadway Theaters have seen an increase in revenue in the millions. I can confirm the latter as someone who bartended a very busy Valentine’s Day weekend in a theater. The program has been a success, so of course, Trump wants to kill it.', 'The President declared that he was killing congestion pricing and declared himself a king in the process. It would be laughable if he didn’t behave as though he was actual royalty. He is making no bones about what he wants and it caught the attention of New York Governor Kathy Hochul. Hochul eventually supported the program despite fighting tooth and nail to block it. With Trump at the door, she grew a spine and decided to fight back against his monarchal ways to the surprise of many. She said the state would be suing the administration and that they would bow to no king. Hell yeah, Kathy! You’re going to keep that goodwill going, right? … Right?', 'Nope! If you’ve visited this site, perused my social media, or wondered what that strange screaming is just West of Manhattan, you know I am no fan of the disgraceful NYC Mayor Eric Adams. You’ll also know that I started doing backflips when it looked like Adams would finally suffer consequences for his rampant, sloppy, laughably corrupt behavior. That all changed when Trump was elected and his DOJ sought (poorly) to see with charges against Adams dropped. It hasn’t happened yet, because several people resigned instead of signing their names to such a nonsense dismissal.', 'Not only will the charges be dropped without prejudice, meaning the DOJ can bring them back when they see fit (like, for instance, if their good little boy doesn’t stay in line), but they are dropping them specifically so Adams can help carry out Trump’s attempts at mass deportation. Adams will assist the President with his dirty work to avoid the prison sentence he deserves. It is a quid pro quo even my tiny children would understand. New Yorkers are rightfully furious and scared that the Mayor is essentially in the President’s pocket, but wait! There may be hope in the form of our newly spined Governor! … Right?!', 'Wrong again!!! Despite numerous calls from citizens and officials to remove Adams from office, Hochul has announced that she will not remove Adams from office even though she can. “My strong belief is that the will of the voters and the supremacy and sanctity of democratic elections preclude me from any other action,” Hochul explained. “I cannot deny the people of this great city the power to make this decision for themselves.” Here’s the thing, I don’t disagree that voters should have their say, but it’s impossible to deny that we are in an unprecedented situation.', 'Adams certainly ran his campaign on fear-mongering and appeals to Upper West/East Siders who spend seven months out of the year in Florida, and those aspects of his Mayoralship have not changed. But his corruption while in office is new information. The indictment brought against him isn’t even six months old. He was just on Fox News with Trump’s Border Czar like some sycophantic bootlicker within the last two weeks. This is all new and needs to be dealt with appropriately. Yes, there is a Mayoral election in NYC this year, but the longer Adams is allowed to stay in office, the more harm he will cause.', 'Hochul’s lack of action here is disappointing but not surprising. It is the kind of thing I’ve come to expect from Hochul since she was sworn in in 2021 and tried to end remote work within her first few months, then had to turn on her heels and reinstate a mask mandate because COVID-19 was still very much a problem. If anything, I thought Hochul had grown a spine and actually begun making a stand for the working people of New York City. Maybe she would be a Democrat who stands loudly and forcefully against the current President. But, she isn’t standing against him if she’s leaving his puppet in charge.']"

What New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she has learned about taking on Trump,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/23/politics/kathy-hochul-new-york-trump/index.html,"['', 'Looking right at Donald Trump on Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, Gov. Kathy Hochul tried a different approach from telling him he was acting like a king for his attempt to end New York’s pay-for-entry congesting pricing system.', 'Just before heading to the White House, the Democratic governor laid out in an interview with CNN how she had been talking to Trump officials: This is about money — the $15 billion into public transit the plan is supposed to generate with tolls — and this is about the way she’s warning to try to turn the tide against the president.', '“You can’t strangle the lifeblood of our city, because I’m going to make you guys own this. When the trains are late if this goes down, a signal doesn’t work, stations flooded and not fixed for weeks and shut down, I’m pointing it back at you,” Hochul said her message to Trump was. “Just giving you fair notice.”', 'Inside the Oval Office, Trump showed off the decor, including some of the paintings. Then, according to one person familiar with the conversation, they went at it in a spirited but not mean-spirited way. That back-and-forth followed their earlier flare-up in which Trump announced he was trying to kill congestion pricing with a surprise post that ended with “LONG LIVE THE KING” before Hochul fired back, saying kings don’t exist in America.', 'Before his first presidential campaign, Trump had eyed running for governor of New York but didn’t see a way to win. And though he moved to Mar-a-Lago in Florida, he’s still obsessed with the city that gave him his accent and where he first started building up his gold-plated real estate business.', 'To Hochul, who had a conciliatory chat with Trump during the presidential transition about why he should look out for New York, that looked like an opportunity. As the first president from New York since Franklin Roosevelt, “he should care about making sure that our subway system works. He should care that I have enough money to police our subways properly as I do. He should care that I have enough money to make Penn Station beautiful again.”', 'Hochul’s whirlwind week also makes her the first in this new Trump term of what many political insiders expect will be a long list of Democrats who try to make nice with Trump but have him turn on them anyway. She’s also the first to have other Democrats side with Trump when their interests align, as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy did as he praised the administration’s move against the congestion pricing tolls hitting commuters from his state. (A spokesperson for Murphy declined comment, and Hochul said, “Since when do I have to be listening to what people in New Jersey want?”)', 'Hochul had been scheduled to talk congestion pricing with Trump a week earlier until she found out from seeing news on television that Attorney General Pam Bondi was planning to sue New York over its immigration policies. She canceled. Especially with the drama surrounding New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has denied any quid pro quo with the Trump administration to boost its immigration agenda in exchange for getting his corruption indictments dismissed, she didn’t want to look like she was interested in a trade-off.', '“I was just making the point that I’m not going to have this happen to me and then all of a sudden run down to talk to you with the perception, ‘Oh, can you make that go away?’” she said.', 'Instead, Hochul made two trips to the White House on Friday while in town for the National Governors Association meeting — the first in the morning for a session with all the governors, several of whom were half-joking when they talked about protecting her if Bondi tried to serve her a subpoena on the spot, and the second on short notice in the late afternoon, where it was just her with Trump and a few other administration officials in the Oval Office.', 'Hochul pushed back on any suggestion that she had read Trump wrong, or been surprised to have him turn on her, so completely and so quickly.', '“It’s not being naive. It’s just saying, ‘I will exhaust my options.’ And when this is a dead end then I’m going” to the more confrontational approach. “I don’t need to start here, even though some Democrats did.”', 'Hochul left without any commitment from Trump to change his position on congestion pricing, which Republican allies in the state — including some considering running against Hochul next year — have pushed him toward. But she did leave him with what an aide said was “a booklet on the early success of congestion pricing.”', 'White House aides did not respond to request for comment about the meeting.', 'Hochul has talked with the president more recently than she has spoken with the mayor, whom she announced on Thursday she would not flex her statutory power to remove from office. She is, however, putting in place “guardrails” to ensure he won’t go too far in giving in to the president.', 'Hochul didn’t answer directly when asked whether New Yorkers should have confidence in the mayor’s ability to do the job, but she smiled slyly when reminded that she said in announcing her decision that she was not removing him “at this time.”', '“I’d be a fool to give up all my options in this position, given what it is,” she said.', 'Similarly to how Hochul is dealing with Trump, whom she left in the Oval Office with material trying to make a data-driven case for keeping congestion pricing, every move she makes with Adams is being seen through the prism of how it might tear at her politics if she runs for a second full term next year.', 'Hochul dismissed any suggestion that is what’s driving her.', '“I piss off half of everybody no matter what I do,” she said of her decision on Adams. “How does this help me?', '© 2025 Cable News Network.
