It’s not so much that the company isn’t innovating; there isn’t a penalty for Samsung not doing so. I expected more from the Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,300, and I’m not alone.', 'The smartphone landscape is not ripe with companies that could challenge Samsung. Google is doing its own thing, and Motorola is focused on midrange phones and fashionable flips. OnePlus has the best chance of giving Samsung any competition in carrier stores — it just has to get back into them.', 'A straight-B student', 'When a company comes out with its flagship lineup, I expect a bit of boasting. I want to see what the phones do better than their competitors and how the company feels it stacks up with its unique software features and hardware innovations. I didn’t get any of that from Samsung on the Galaxy S25. The company felt content to compare its new lineup to its three-year-old flagships, a massive disappointment. I hope a new $1,300 phone in 2025 will be a decent upgrade from a phone released in 2022, but Samsung made it seem like that’s all it needed to do.', 'It’s harder for enthusiasts like us to understand that most smartphone buyers don’t want to insert their SIM cards or set up a device for the first time.', 'The OnePlus 13 compares favorably to the Galaxy S25 Ultra for less money. The company is in its best shape in years, with fantastic hardware and a better software experience than in previous years. OxygenOS 15 is ready for primetime, and it’s disappointing that we aren’t getting the matchup we deserve in carrier stores. Samsung is running unopposed, and it’s starting to show with the company’s complacency and lack of innovation. People need to see the OnePlus 13 hands-on alongside the Galaxy phones to drive the competition we need.', 'People enjoy convenience. It’s harder for enthusiasts like us to understand that most smartphone buyers don’t want to insert their SIM cards or set up a device for the first time. They want to walk into a carrier store and walk out with a functioning device they’ll use for the next three years without the typical hassles you’d deal with buying a phone online. Several people approached me last week and told me they are upgrading to a Galaxy S25+ because that’s what their Verizon salesperson said to do. It had nothing to do with specs or price. It’s merely the next phone, and it’s simple for them to switch.', 'OnePlus must be part of that conversation in carrier stores. I can rail for as many column inches as I want about the price gap between the OnePlus 13 and Galaxy S25 Ultra, but most customers will never feel that. The S25 Ultra is expensive at $1,300, but most users only focus on the monthly payment. They know they were paying $30 a month for their old phone, and here’s a shiny new model with some new features and better specs for the same payment — how could they say no? OnePlus needs to be in front of more customers with attractive monthly payments, and the only way to do that is through carrier support.', ""Samsung is comforting for casual users. They can walk into their local carrier store and find answers if something goes wrong. You don’t get peace of mind from buying a OnePlus 13 online, and it makes a difference. People’s phones are their lifelines, and the prospect of going without or significant downtime rightfully scares many casual users. Even if it's not a carrier store, Samsung offers in-person support through its Samsung Experience locations, something that other manufacturers do not match."", 'OnePlus wouldn’t put the resources into stores in the US, but I think being seen in your local AT&T and Verizon stores would be enough to comfort users. Every time I show someone my OnePlus 13, they’re amazed at what it can do for the price, but their first question isn’t about the chipset or amount of RAM; it’s where they can buy one. And once I tell them online, the conversation usually fades.', 'It’s not something most users feel comfortable handling on their own, and OnePlus needs to pick itself up from the failed T-Mobile deal and get back into stores. The company’s T-Mobile deal came at an unfortunate time, with OnePlus going through an awkward phase with phones like the OnePlus 10 Pro. Things are much different with the OnePlus 13 — it’s time for another chance.', ""The OnePlus 13 is a fantastic smartphone worthy of more attention from US consumers than it's getting. However, OnePlus will never see any real traction stateside until it returns to carrier stores in numbers, giving users an alternative they can see and touch. Until then, Samsung will do the bare minimum, knowing there isn’t a viable alternative for users of older Galaxy phones who want an upgrade after three years. Competition matters and Samsung doesn’t have any in carrier stores. OnePlus can do the job, but it has to be willing to make the effort."", 'We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.', '', '', ""To push Samsung, it won't be OnePlus that does it. It will be Apple. As good as OnePlus phones seem, a Chinese based phone is swimming upstream in the United States right now even if they are a better product."", 'Not really. I just got the 1+13, from the s22+.', '', ""Until I read your comment, I had no idea it was Chinese... I'd have to have a pretty myopic view of the world to not/buy something purely based on its origin."", '', ""Ultimately what I wanted, which Samsung hasn't bothered to innovate, was a battery life that in 3 years won't last me half a day (AND WEARING DOWN EXPONENTIALLY FASTER THE LOWER THE BATTERY)."", '', ""The 1+3 has some new carbon battery or something that lasts 2 days. And as an Android user, I'm comfortable not following a prescribed path (iPhone users wouldn't dream of switching brands)."", '', 'Consequently... When other companies announce how many devices they sold, Samsung will hopefully see that as loss.', '', ""Maybe don't hate on China?"", '', ""Apple has a world market share of 24%. If you are an Android user, you aren't going to just drop it to go to Apple's universe, which would be like starting over. Most Americans aren't doing that. They would just stick with the annoying Samsung at that point."", ""Babsk...I don't hate China. Chinese tech doesn't have the best reputation in the U.S rightly or wrongly. Tariffs are being threatened on Chinese imports as well. Your experience is anecdotal. It doesn't reflect the larger picture. OnePlus may very well have a better phone, but the brand doesn't sell well as a whole in the U.S. right now."", '', ""I find it interesting that EV's like Tesla have a lot of Chinese involvement with a large battery factory in Shanghai. While President Trump rattles his economic saber at China, Elon Musk quietly disagrees with him. You can argue that Chinese trade helps the U.S. economy, but politics trumps benefits."", '', ""Anyway, I'm not sure any major carrier will sell a OnePlus phone right now. Maybe they will again. Will see."", ""I don't think so bud."", ""Stephen actually is hitting it right on the money . OnePlus is currently in the best position it's ever found itself in to put two feet forward and challenge Samsung . They've been on fire and they've been consistent. OnePlus Open, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus 13, OnePlus 13R all consecutive bangers . The OnePlus Open alone put a lot of manufacturers on notice and no one expected OnePlus to come out swinging with that phone like they did . So Stephen is hella correct . The time has never been better than now with the current momentum they have it would be the perfect storm . With as much praise that the OnePlus has received it it was sitting on a T-Mobile shelf right now I can almost guarantee that they'd be selling very well and once the customers finally had it in their hands you would start to see a change in quite a bit all around especially forcefully lighting a fire up under Samsungs ass to get their shit together . Stepehen , since you're in the industry why don't you try and reach out to the right people at OnePlus and see if you can possibly pull of some type of interview and let them know . I mean it may not change anything but at least you voiced your opinion .bfor all we know it may give them something to think about especially right now . Also, put up a poll the S25 ultra and the OnePlus 13 but ask all your readers knowing the price difference between the two and spec for spec if the OnePlus 13 was carrier available would they get the praised OnePlus 13 and save themselves quite a bit of money or would they settle for the S25 ultra regardless of whT Samsung isn't doing . I'm actually interested in seeing the outcome of that ."", ""A Chinese company in a U.S carrier store.....not smart at all given the current political climate. OnePlus is safe offering it through Amazon and BB. Hopefully that keeps it under the radar. I honestly don't want them to blow up because it would draw unnecessary attention."", ""WTH? You sound like you work for our government. For the record not everyone in China is involved with the political side and are innocents just like I and others aren't involved with what my country does so I don't understand the hate . That was just unnecessary smh"", 'OnePlus has been at US carriers for years. You just chose not to notice or purchase one.', ""I won't buy another Samsung after switching to one plus. For me Samsung is not durable enough. Last one I had was in a case drop it maybe 2 ft and screen cracks."", '', ""Now one plus 9 pro have had for 4 years dropped it too many times to count with and without a case and guess what not one broken screen. I've dropped on edges , corners, face down and all I have are a few small scratches on the screen after 4 years. For me that alone is enough to never buy another Samsung."", ""I had a OnePlus 2,6 and 8, I broke the screens on all of them. I've had an S23u for a year and it's still mint after taking some nasty falls in a thin case."", 'Needs SD Card and all the features we used to expect from Samsung otherwise its refurb phones for me. I hear Sony is doing some good stuff. Ignoring the trends of removing features we need and expecting us to go along. Might have to give Sony a try', 'Right you are absolutely correct. Now do another about apple that has the same design from 10 years ago', ""I was able to get the OnePlus 12 I bought from Best Buy a year ago activated on T-Mobile with no drama. Service works fine on it, the only issue I have ever noticed is that the visual voicemail doesn't work. It's been a great phone though. Super quick, long battery life, fast charging, and really good cameras. And it was quite a bit cheaper from an equivalent Samsung."", ""That has nothing to do with the phone. It's T-mobile's horrible voicemail app that's the problem and they refuse to fix it."", 'I wish OnePlus would move to monthly security patches. If they could match Samsung security wise I would switch over next time they have a sale', 'Id rather have redmagic in carrier shops', 'Samsung is trash oneplus is much better and superior in every aspect I traded s22 ultra for op10 and never looked back now I have 13 and its not even remotely close Samsung needs new UI and new design', ""Stop it. One Plus will not challenge Samsung even being in stores. When people find out where it's from and hear the name, it's going to be another niche product."", ""I love my OnePlus 12 pro. It has insane fast charging, great resolution, great for gaming, and takes great pictures. One plus is definitely underrated and I find it way better than my girlfriend's iPhone 13 pro Max which came out at the same time as my phone and better than the Samsung cause of the faster charging."", 'What carriers does the newest OnePlus phone work on? I have Verizon. Will it support all Verizon bands and features? And does it have an app like SmartSwitch to move data from a Samsung phone to a OnePlus? These will be important points for most people not savvy enough to search the internet. One more reason for OnePlus to get themselves into stores if they want to catch on. Samsung may have signed exclusivity agreements with the carriers to keep OnePlus out of the stores as well.', ""I was able to get the OnePlus 12 I bought from Best Buy a year ago activated on T-Mobile with no drama.

So with that in mind, I pitted the latest release from Samsung against two of Huawei's newest products to see which one would come out on top."", ""Without pointing out the obvious, that Huawei still doesn't have access to Google's apps, it still runs a version of Android and isn't too dissimilar to Samsung's OS."", 'So with that in mind, I tried the Samsung S25+ as well as the Huawei Nova 13 Pro and the Max X6 foldable.', ""I have always had an issue with Samsung when it comes to its devices, purely because of the bloatware it tends to pre-load onto them. However, for the first time in years, I'm actually not bothered by it because the S25+ is of such high quality that I had forgotten all about it. The S25+ is the mid-range phone of Samsung's latest generation, and although it's priced at £999, it packs a punch for the price."", 'The 6.7inch screen is a thing of beauty, and the cameras – always a selling point for Samsung – outshine the other two phones I tested alongside it.', 'It comes with a 12mp ultra wide, a 50mp wide-angle and a 10mp telephoto. All of which provide crisp, clear and as natural of a smartphone photo as you could wish to capture.', 'I was a little disappointed with the batter life, however, as it only packs a 4,900mAh battery. This left me needing to recharge before the evening most days, which was a little bit of a downer considering competitors at the same price – hello, OnePlus 13 – have 6,000mAh batteries and last more than a full day at power use.', ""However, you know with Samsung you're buying quality built to last, and a phone which will give you everything you need and more."", ""So while it loses a few points on battery, it was almost faultless everywhere else. I'm giving it an 8.5 out of 10."", 'The Huawei Nova 13 Pro is an intriguing device.

This is something Huawei will forever be tarnished with, yet its devices are excellent.', ""It has barnstorming features, like 12gb ram, a 5,000MaH batter and 100w charging, A stunning LTPO OLED 1b colours HDR 120hz screen, and three excellent cameras. It's ability to last all day without charging despite a battery not far off the Samsung is impressive, and I'll give credit where credit is due, it's Android-like Harmony OS is actually pretty good – I guess I'm just a creature of habit."", ""You can buy the phone directly from Huawei, as not many shops or carriers sell them directly these days, but it's worth the investment if you want something different that also looks stunning."", ""I'm giving this an 8/10"", ""Ahhh, another foldable. I have tried many of these, and am yet to be bowled over by it – but this one was pretty close. I'll get the obvious big talking point out of the way first: Yes, there is a crease and yes you can see it."", ""That pretty much comes with the foldable territory these days, so it's something we should all probably get over. However, the device is so well made and well thought out. The pearlised back panel is subtle yet stylish, and the camera module – while big – does fit with the look overall."", 'It folds up to be roughly the same thickness as any leading non-foldable smartphone, and when open measures 7.93inches.', 'It has a 2440x2240 resolution, which might not mean much to the non-techy readers among you, but it looks out of this world with very dark blacks and very bright colours. Watching a film on this was actually a job, especially with 1,800 nits of peak brightness.', ""It also had a 3D liquid-cooling module and I found that no matter how much I put it through its paces, it didn't get hot, although a little warm at times."", 'It has a bigger batter than the previous two phones mentioned, but at 5,110mAh, it still lasted roughly the same time as the Nova Pro because it is powering two screens. Where I found the biggest win for this compared to other foldables was the camera.', ""It has a 48mp telephoto macro, a 40mp ultra-wide and a 50pm ultra aperture camera – all of which combine to give you the best photos of any smartphone I've tried recently."", ""This surprised me, as I'm used to foldables not really giving you much by way of camera quality.

This year it was changed to feature a silhouette of the device rather than the more realistic depictions shown on previous boxes.', 'The box is made out of 100% recycled paper as before and its contents are fairly simple: the S25 Ultra itself, the new Bluetooth-less S Pen, a USB C-to-C cable, a SIM ejector and a brief manual.', 'The Ultra models tend to be available in mostly grayish colors and the 2025 model is no exception. In addition to the four widely available colors, there are three that are exclusive to Samsung.com. Here they are for side-by-side comparison.', 'Previous Ultras had rectangular designs with sharp corners – they looked cool but weren’t particularly ergonomic. This year Samsung rounded off the corners, but it also changed the profile of the sides – instead of rounded, they are now flat. This gives the S25 trio a more consistent look (the vanilla and Plus models already had rounded corners and flat sides).', 'Another change to the design is that Samsung managed to slim down the bezels by 0.2mm, so they now measure just 1.32mm. This allowed the company to bump up the screen diagonal by 0.1” (to 6.9”). The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass Armor 2, a glass ceramic material that is more drop resistant than the previous version. And it has an anti-reflective feature that is unique to the Ultra.', 'It wasn’t just the corners, previous Ultras were fairly heavy and thick. The Galaxy S25 Ultra loses 14g of weight and slims down by 0.4mm compared to its predecessor. It weighs 218g and measures 8.2mm thick.', 'Then there are the camera rings that became infamous. Samsung says that going for a black trim instead of a silver one allows the lenses to blend in better, while the thicker camera rings improve durability.', 'You can check out our Galaxy S25 Ultra review for our thoughts on the new design (and don’t miss our video review). We also have articles comparing the S25 Ultra against its predecessor and versus the Pixel 9 Pro XL.', 'Finally, check out the A Guided Demo of Performance video by Samsung.

,https://www.androidpolice.com/galaxy-s25-ultra-oneplus-13-personal-experience/,"['For the past several years, my routine has remained the same. I’ll enjoy using the latest OnePlus flagship. I love the performance and value for money the company is known for, and the OnePlus 11 and 12 have been legitimately good smartphones. Still, a part of me is always glad to get back to the warm embrace of the Samsung Galaxy series once the review period is over.', 'I’m an old-school Galaxy Note fan, and even though we’re a long way from that era, the Galaxy Ultra phones do enough to keep me hooked. Samsung offers excellent devices with great software and powerful hardware to match. However, 2025 is turning out differently than in previous years, and OnePlus has stepped up its game with the OnePlus 13. Let’s find out if it did enough to make me forget about the Galaxy S25 Ultra and keep my SIM exactly where it is.', 'A true daily driver candidate', 'The OnePlus mission statement always sounded good. The company offered the latest flagship processor and premium materials for less than the competition, allowing US customers to experience something different with a device featuring impressive power without the Samsung price tag. But something would always hold me back from thoroughly enjoying the phones.', 'That’s not the case this year, as OnePlus did a fantastic job making the OnePlus 13 a complete flagship experience. I’ll start with the design. When you pick up the OnePlus 13, you can immediately tell the engineers put time and effort into the device’s feel. Despite the larger camera array, it’s balanced, and I love the thin aluminum band around the edge. It’s actually a thicker phone than the Galaxy S25 Ultra but feels thinner because of the design — it’s a fantastic device to hold.', 'I also love that OnePlus gives us a 16GB RAM variant. You’ll pay an additional $100, but it’s still significantly cheaper than a base Galaxy S25 Ultra. It gives added peace of mind that my OnePlus 13 will be snappy for years, even with whatever AI advancements are in store. With the Snapdragon 8 Elite, my OnePlus 13 is a performance monster with a fantastic gaming experience. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset delivers as advertised, and I’m excited to see what powerful applications will eventually take full advantage of it.', 'OnePlus already had an advantage over Samsung regarding charging speeds, but the company took things further with the battery for 2025. You should believe everything you’ve heard about the OnePlus 13’s 6,000mAh silicon-carbide battery — it’s fantastic. I get a full two days of battery life, whereas, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I’m searching for a charger after lunchtime on the second day. You might not think that’s a big deal, as you always remember to plug your phone in overnight. However, it’s an excellent safety blanket when you don’t, and whenever I forget, I don’t worry about getting through my day.', 'Even if you forget, faster charging speeds ensure you can top off quickly. The OnePlus 13 supports 80 and 100W wired recharging with the proper adapters. Those are massive figures, considering Samsung is stuck at 45W again. OnePlus uses a dual-cell design to help with long-term battery health, which is a concern people have with faster charging speeds. All told, the OnePlus 13 comes out ahead on battery.', 'The hardware on OnePlus devices has always been fantastic, but the software has prevented me from truly enjoying them. I don’t think OxygenOS 15 is better than One UI 7. However, OxygenOS 15 is in a much-improved position compared to previous years, and it’s no longer a negative for OnePlus phones. It may not be a reason I’d buy a OnePlus 13, but it’s not a reason I’d avoid picking one up.', 'OnePlus 13 camera samples', 'Camera performance is another reason I’ve previously avoided OnePlus phones. Photos appear a step below those of Samsung, Google, and Apple, and while I’m not a shutterbug, I want to know that my flagship phone will take a decent point-and-shoot image when needed. Whatever OnePlus and Hasselblad did for the OnePlus 13 is working, as the photos are excellent. Nighttime photography is improved, and while it’s all a personal preference, there are instances when I prefer the output from my OnePlus 13 over the Galaxy S25 Ultra — something I wouldn’t have been able to say in previous years.', 'Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra photo samples', 'I’m not going to rehash my misgivings about the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It didn’t include the innovations I hoped for on the hardware side, as Samsung seems content appealing to previous Galaxy owners trading in older phones. If you’re coming from a Galaxy S21 Ultra, you’ll notice meaningful upgrades, and it’s hard to say anything bad about the phone. It’s an excellent performer in a sleek (albeit non-descript) package. If you’re a long-time Samsung fan, and the newest battery and camera hardware don’t excite you, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is fantastic.', ""However, I’d be fooling myself if I said Samsung still didn't hold significant advantages over OnePlus. One UI 7 is a phenomenal piece of software, and it’s silky smooth on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s vital to differentiate One UI 7 from Galaxy AI, as the latter is in an awkward spot. Samsung touted AI as a reason you’d buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the features aren’t ready for primetime. It’s not the transformative experience the company hoped for, but it doesn’t mean all is lost. One UI 7 is solid, and Samsung offers 7 One UI version upgrades and 7 years of software support. There are plenty of reasons you’d choose a Galaxy S25 Ultra over a OnePlus 13; its software is at the top of the list."", ""Another reason you’d buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra is the display. I understand it’s not the newest display technology, but it’s a gorgeous panel — the best I’ve seen on a smartphone in a long time. I don’t know how many phone screens I stare at yearly, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s display dazzles me every time I pick it up. I’m glad Samsung moved away from the natural color tones on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, returning to the vibrant hues it's known for. You can still dial back the saturation if needed, but I love having the option. We stare at our smartphone displays for hours a day, so a good panel is essential. I understand some users will struggle with PWM dimming on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it’s an incredible smartphone display that will please most of us."", 'I’m disappointed that Samsung removed some S pen functions, but I’m glad it’s there. I use it to scroll through social media and scribble notes on documents. It’s fantastic for cropping GIFs to send to friends and write down a number quickly. I hate to see the S pen’s role diminished, and I hope it’s not a sign that Samsung plans to remove it entirely.', 'I prefer the OnePlus 13 over the Galaxy S25 Ultra this year, but I understand it’s difficult for most people to switch. There aren’t OnePlus stores in the US you can walk into when something goes wrong, and you can’t finance one through your carrier. A smartphone is a lifeline for people, and the thought of going without when something goes wrong frightens many consumers.', 'In most years, I wouldn’t mention carrier store financing, but Samsung targeted upgrade cycles to sell new flagships, banking on users coming from an older Galaxy model. If you’re an enthusiast like myself, pick up a OnePlus 13. If you’ve never removed a SIM card from a phone, buy the Galaxy S25 Ultra.', ""The OnePlus 13 is a beast of a phone. With a refreshed design, a mostly curveless display, and a massive 6,000mAh battery capable of getting you through a day without breaking a sweat, this could be the Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered smartphone to beat in 2025. And hey, it's got a pretty great camera system, too."", ""Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra leaves the Note-like design behind for the very first time. With flat edges, curved corners, and a massive 6.9-inch display, this is a modern flagship through and through — and yes, that S Pen is still here too."", 'We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.', '', '', 'I almost went with the Oneplus 13 but the Samsung pre order deals were too good to pass on. Oneplus needs to offer better deals and a way to finance their phones.', 'OnePlus 13 for the win easily not even close', 'Except for it missing a lot of bands for Verizon making it not a viable phone to use in the states.', 'A bigger battery, IP69, and so much more', 'OnePlus 13 gets a lot of things right', 'It drops the ball in some areas', 'OnePlus 13 may fall short without these key features', 'Not all AI features are useful', 'Skip the upgrade and maintain your phone', '']"

It's a bit boring compared to previous years, but there's no denying that it's still one of the best Android phones thanks to flagship performance, a beautiful display, amazing software support, and versatile cameras."", 'The OnePlus 13 is one of those devices that feels like it was designed to push the competition to the limits. It matches or exceeds the specs of most flagship devices while retaining a very attractive price point. It may just be the best Android phone of the year.', 'With incremental improvements, similar design philosophies, and a lack of risk-taking, it’s hard to argue that smartphones have reached full maturity. Samsung, once the darling of the Android space, has become too comfortable with iterative updates that lack that special wow factor. I find the latest Galaxy S25 Ultra nearly identical to the Galaxy S24 Ultra a bit disappointing and, to be frank, a bit boring, but it’s an excellent phone.', 'OnePlus, on the other hand, hit its stride with last year’s OnePlus 12 and the newest OnePlus 13 generated a buzz in the industry that recent phones have been sorely lacking. Both devices are well-built and make great gaming phones, but can the OnePlus 13 stand up to the juggernaut that is the Galaxy S25 Ultra? Let’s break it down and find out.', 'Top-tier smartphones with distinct capabilities', 'Both phones had a global launch in 2025: January for the OnePlus 13 and February for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung offers the S25 Ultra with 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage, all of which come with 12GB of RAM. It retails for $1,300, $1,420, and $1,660, respectively, and comes in seven titanium colors: Black, Gray, Silverblue, Whitesilver, Jadegreen, Jetblack, and Pinkgold, with the last three being exclusive to Samsung. You can find the S25 Ultra through most carriers, Samsung, or retailers like Amazon or Best Buy.', 'With either 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage or 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, buying the OnePlus 13 is a bit more straightforward. The base model is available for $900 and comes in the Black Eclipse colorway, while the one with more RAM and storage retails for $1,000 and is available in Black Eclipse, Midnight Ocean, and Arctic Dawn. The OnePlus 13 isn’t available from a carrier and can only be purchased from OnePlus or unlocked from a retailer like Amazon or Best Buy.', 'A straight-B student', 'A true daily driver candidate', 'If you’ve been following the last couple of generations of either device, the design for both phones will be instantly recognizable. Samsung and OnePlus haven’t reinvented the wheel for this generation, and while I find the design of the OnePlus 13 more of a standout in a world where unique designs are harder to find, I’ll admit that it’s not for everyone.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13 are almost identically sized and must be used with both hands. The OnePlus 13 is a touch lighter than the S25 Ultra. The OnePlus 13 features an IP68/IP69 rating against water and dust ingress, while the S25 Ultra carries a more standard IP68 rating.', 'Both phones have an aluminum frame sandwiched between two pieces of glass, except for the Midnight Ocean variant of the OnePlus 13, which has an eco-leather back. The biggest difference between these two devices can be found in the rear camera design. Samsung stuck with its usual camera setup, with each lens set independently in the upper-left corner, while OnePlus went with its usual large circular camera housing. They both have flat displays this year, so no need to worry about curved edges this year.', 'You get an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on both devices and each has power and volume buttons along the right edge. OnePlus includes an alert slide on the left side, which is a convenient and quick way to set your phone to vibrate. If you’re a fan of using a stylus, the S25 Ultra includes a built-in S Pen for all your writing and drawing needs.', 'If you’re after large, bright, and vibrant displays, you’re looking at two of the best in the industry. Samsung equipped the Galaxy S25 Ultra with a massive 6.9-inch dynamic LTPO AMOLED display with a 3,120 x 1,440 resolution. It boasts a peak brightness of 2,600 nits and has a refresh rate that goes from 1 to 120Hz.', 'The OnePlus 13 has a slightly smaller 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display but has a slightly sharper 3,168 x 1,440 resolution. It has a refresh rate that can go from 1 to 120Hz and ups the brightness to a peak of 4,500 nits.', 'You won’t be able to discern the difference between these specs in the real world. Both Samsung and OnePlus have gone with amazing displays, and you’ll be happy with either one.', 'The OnePlus 13 and Galaxy S25 Ultra come with Android 15 and a custom UI on top, OxygenOS 15 for OnePlus, and OneUI 7 for Samsung. For a while, OxygenOS trailed OneUI, but that gap has been removed with OxygenOS 15. Both offer extensive customization options and give you plenty of choices. Samsung places more focus on AI than OnePlus, but the software is about equal if you ignore AI capabilities, and you probably should. Samsung includes DeX, which allows you to hook your phone to a hub to provide a desktop-like software experience.', 'With seven years of Android OS upgrades and security updates, Samsung offers better software support. OnePlus has improved in this area but still falls behind with its promise of four years of Android OS upgrades and six years of security updates.', 'The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the most powerful chipset available for Android devices and is capable of some serious performance. Regardless of which device you end up with, both are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. The processor in the Galaxy S25 Ultra has been slightly modified by Samsung to eke out a bit of extra performance but it’s not something you’ll notice in real-world use.', 'For most people, the performance of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is overkill. Routine tasks won’t tax this processor, and it’ll happily chew through intensive tasks like gaming or video editing. These powerful chipsets can generate a lot of heat and require serious cooling. Samsung went with a 40% larger vapor chamber than previous generations, and OnePlus went with a dual vapor chamber, resulting in impressive cooling performance. The OnePlus will stay cooler longer, but both will remain cool under pressure. If you’re after a performance monster, you can’t go wrong with either phone.', 'Samsung is starting to fall behind in battery performance and charging tech. The Galaxy S25 Ultra can make it through an entire day of heavy use on a single charge thanks to its 5,000mAh battery, but it’s something you’ll want to recharge each night. It can be charged up to 45W wired, 15W wireless, and can do 4.5W reverse wireless. Charging speeds have improved compared to previous years, but it still pales compared to the OnePlus 13.', 'OnePlus has gone with a dual-cell battery that has a massive capacity of 6,000mAh. The OnePlus 13 can reach up to 10 hours of screen-on time before it calls it quits. When it needs to be charged, it takes 34 minutes to go from 1% to 100% using a 100W wired charger. It can also be charged up to 50W using a wireless charger and offers 10W reverse wireless and 5W reverse wired charging.', 'When it comes to camera performance, both devices are easily two of the best camera phones on the market. They each have strengths and weaknesses but get stunning photos, thanks to their versatility.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra comes with a 200MP, f/1.7 primary lens with OIS, a 50MP, f/1.9 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, a 50MP, f/3.4 periscope telephoto lens with OIS and 5x optical zoom, and a 10MP, f/2.4 telephoto lens with OIS and a 3x optical zoom. You also get a 12MP, f/2.2 front-facing camera for your selfie needs.', 'OnePlus went with a triple-camera setup consisting of a 50MP, f/1.6 primary lens with OIS, a 50MP, f/2.0 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, and a 50MP, f/2.6 periscope telephoto lens with OIS and 3x optical zoom. Its selfie camera has a 32MP, f/2.4 lens. Both devices record 8K video at 30fps and 4K video at up to 60fps.', 'Picking a winner between two phenomenal devices is a tough task, and you’ll be happy with either one. Choosing which is best for you comes down to a few key factors, such as ecosystem lock-in or where and how you prefer to buy your devices.', 'Ignoring availability and your preferred ecosystem, the OnePlus 13 is the winner in this comparison. It matches the Galaxy’s stellar display, strong performance, great camera versatility, and flagship design and even exceeds the Galaxy in battery life while costing hundreds of dollars less.', 'It has no real shortcomings', ""The OnePlus 13 is an amazing device that brings powerful performance, an amazing display, great cameras, and stunning battery life while retaining a very attractive price point. It's the type of phone that may just wake Samsung up, forcing it to provide more than an iterative update next year."", 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is also a fantastic option. While it may cost more than the OnePlus 13, it can be purchased through your favorite carrier with monthly payments. Samsung may be playing it safe with the S25 Ultra, but this is a beautiful and capable device that doesn’t leave much to be desired.', ""It may be boring, but it's still fantastic"", ""The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra may not be as buzz-worthy as in past years, but it's still an excellent Android phone thanks to its amazing capabilities.

An iPhone user's honest thoughts on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra,https://www.nine.com.au/product-reviews/tech/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-pros-cons-honest-thoughts-from-iphone-user/d9cb264d-6364-4286-ab60-8790788efaa9,"[""This content is reviewed by 9Product Reviews' team of writers. Nine may receive a commission when you buy from links on our site."", ""Like many people, I've been an Apple iPhone user for most of my life. It started with one of my mum's old models, passed down to me at age 14, and I've stuck with the same ever since."", ""Currently, I have a second-hand iPhone 13. Far from the newer models, it's held mostly together by a ratty case that desperately needs replacing. So, when I was offered the opportunity to play with a brand-new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for a few weeks, I couldn't wait."", ""However, switching from an iPhone to a Samsung presented its unique challenges which I think live in the heads of most Apple users as they consider the switch. So, I've\ufeff taken copious notes to share with you on how to manage the changeover, and whether life as an Android person is better."", 'NOTE: Prices are accurate at time of publishing.', 'Holding both the iPhone and the Samsung in front of me, I was immediately overwhelmed by how to even start transferring my data from one to the other. Thankfully, I found Smart Switch pretty quickly.', ""Smart Switch is a Samsung app that comes pre-installed on Galaxy devices, and it's genius. It saved me when switching from iOS to Samsung, even though I had to enact the process twice."", ""I learned about the Smart Switch app via Google and downloaded it to my iPhone to get started. Initially, I used Wi-Fi, but the transfer wasn't as successful as I'd hoped. I had none of my contacts, texts or WhatsApp messages, and none of the apps I'd originally had on my iPhone. Sure, I'm shifting entire ecosystems here, but the idea of doing an inventory of my apps and re-downloading them on Google Play had me shuddering."", ""Thankfully, a chat with a Samsung product trainer made me realise that my first transfer attempt hadn't worked properly. If you're using Smart Switch, he (and now I) recommend using a cord rather than Wi-Fi. Once the cord transfer was complete, the Samsung basically became my iPhone. Not only did I have my apps, I had my app categories, my screensaver, my contacts, my notes, my texts, and my Candy Crush scores – it was all there. The phone was so much easier to navigate, and made me more curious to explore what worked differently to iOS, given I could return to my regular home screen whenever I needed to."", ""Another recommendation is to enable swipe gestures. If you have a more recent iPhone model, it won't have a 'back button', but a screen you can swipe to navigate. While the Galaxy's 'back button' sat on the screen, I'd still find myself trying to swipe to navigate around the phone. To do this, go through Settings to Display to Navigation Bar, then choose 'Swipe gestures' instead of 'Buttons'. It'll make a world of difference!"", 'READ MORE: Everything to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25', ""There are so many features on the Samsung Galaxy S25 that even after a week and a bit of use, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. However, I've picked out two features that I kept returning to, which would have me investing in the phone."", 'When it came to trialling a Samsung, I was most excited about the camera. The S25 Ultra has a 200-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide shooter, and dual telephoto cameras with various optical zoom options. The images I took were crystal-clear and were able to fit so much in the frame. There was no frustration regarding contrast when I was taking photos of a sunset, and the many, many filters meant I could make the images even more beautiful. ', ""The photo editing capacity is also amazing. After testing out portrait mode on my partner's cat, I was able to use object erasure to get rid of a glass visible in the background. I simply drew around it and clicked to get rid of it, leaving me with just the cat in the foreground. You can also edit images using Generative AI, but note that instead of deleting your selection, it sometimes replaces it by generating something else."", ""The Best Face feature is another game-changer, especially with group shots. Using AI, the Galaxy S25 can identify up to five faces in a Motion Photo picture (Samsung's version of Apple's Live Photo), and then identify different expressions pulled while the photo was taken. It allows you to select a face, and then choose from the series of expressions made across the few seconds taken to capture it, so you can ensure everyone in the photo is smiling and looking happy, instead of looking in different directions or blinking. "", 'READ MORE: Our honest thoughts on the Fujifilm X-M5 camera', 'There were two aspects of this feature that I found revolutionary.', ""The first is in Samsung's Voice Recorder app. As a journalist, I voice-record a lot when interviewing people (more on that later), but I also use it to make the occasional memo for myself. Recently, I injured my knee and was finding it difficult to remember all the details I needed to share between my different doctors. With auto-transcribing, I could make little recordings about each appointment and how my knee was feeling each day, and with the press of a button, have them transcribed instantly. And then, I could click to have the voice note summarised into dot points – crazy helpful!"", ""The phone can also transcribe much more than just my voice. A standout feature of the S25 range is the ability to record calls (with a prompt that lets everyone on the call know they're being recorded, obviously). After recording a call, you can go into your call log to have it made into a transcript, and also a summary if needed. While this has been recommended as a game-changer for professionals who have to make a lot of calls for their work, and might often forget things, this is a great perk for a journalist who has to do regular interviews and transcribe them manually."", ""The transition from iOS familiarity to Samsung is still difficult. Although I've evolved past googling 'Samsung notes app equivalent', I'm still navigating the best way forward in many areas. A lack of AirDrop means I now send photos over WhatsApp because they often lose their quality on text. I'm still deciding the best way to message my iPhone-using friends. However, all of this is navigable."", ""My only other issue is the phone's size, which I still find slightly too big. While taking pictures is fine, it's difficult to hold the phone in my hand and take a good selfie. While that may seem conceited, I'd expect that all iPhone to Samsung users should make the most of the excellent camera upgrade."", ""I'm also slow to type given I need to hold it with two hands, and I honestly had trouble fitting the phone in my favourite purse (although a new purse might not be the worst idea). While these were things I struggled with, I deem them as navigable given the many great features of the phone."", ""I'm a bit of a photography nerd, so if it came down to choosing between buying a new iPhone or a new Samsung Galaxy, I'd choose the phone with the better camera. A camera as good as the one on the Samsung makes buying an actual camera redundant in my opinion. And not only is it a great camera, it's your phone. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything using an Android, only gaining more benefits."", 'READ MORE:\ufeff All the accessories you need for your new Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphone', 'Auto news: What changes to child seat safety rules mean for you.', '© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co.']"

If you have a hard time choosing between the Samsung Galaxy S25 and the Samsung Galaxy S24, we are here to help."", ""Despite the rather modest hardware upgrades that the Galaxy S25 brings over the Galaxy S24, it is asking for around €200 more than its predecessor. We take a deeper dive into these two top-end compact flagships from 2024 and 2025 to see whether the price difference is justified or you will be better off with last year's S24."", ""For starters, you can compare the complete specs sheets or directly continue with our editor's assessment in the following text."", ""When it comes to dimensions and build quality, both devices are pretty much identical. The only difference is that the newer Galaxy is 0.4 mm thinner now. It may not sound much, but it's noticeable in the hand feel."", ""The thinner profile makes the S25 feel slightly smaller, but it's definitely not something your decision should be based upon."", ""There's absolutely no change in the display department. The Galaxy S25 and S24 share identical OLED panels with the same features and maximum brightness, so there's nothing to dissect here."", ""Even though there's no change in the battery capacity either, the newer Galaxy S25 shows a small improvement in the overall Active Use Score, mainly due to the higher talk and game runtimes. The web browsing and video playback scores are near-identical."", 'At the end of the day, if you choose to go for the S25, you will be getting marginally longer battery endurance thanks to the more power-efficient chipset.', ""Since there's no change in the charging capabilities, we weren't expecting a different result in our charging test. The differences you see are minor and within the margin of error for this sort of test. Either way, the 25W wired charging rate replenishes the battery's full charge for around 1 hour and 15 minutes, regardless of the device."", ""Samsung didn't highlight any upgrades to the loudspeaker, but we found them to be tuned better on the Galaxy S25 compared to the S24. The bass is slightly more prominent, giving music tracks much-needed fullness because small handsets struggle to deliver loud and full sound."", ""However, according to our tests, the S24's speakers are slightly louder, but we doubt you could spot the difference even if you listen to them side by side."", ""Unlike last year, this year's Galaxy S25 comes with Qualcomm's latest and greatest for all regions. The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is present on all Galaxy S25 members, while the Galaxy S24 has either Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Exynos 2400."", 'In either case, the Galaxy S25 delivers considerably higher raw performance.', ""There's no change in the memory variants except that the Galaxy S25 runs 12GB of RAM, regardless of the storage version.

In combined scenarios like AnTuTu, the S25 outpaces the S24 by almost 30%, while in CPU-heavy benchmarks, the SD 8 Elite for Galaxy pulls ahead of the Exynos 2400 by almost 50%. The gap widens in the GPU', 'The Galaxy S25 and S24 feature identical camera hardware - 50MP main camera joined by a 10MP telephoto shooter with 3x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide without autofocus. The front holds a 12MP selfie cam with autofocus.', 'This means differences are likely due to tuning or the ISPs, as the two devices have different chipsets.', ""Even though the camera samples we took are taken at different days, it's obvious that the two phones deliver near-identical stills with comparable quality.

It's considerably more powerful than before and seems nominally more efficient in certain aspects, judging by the small battery life gains. You also get slightly better-tuned loudspeakers and a 0.4 mm thinner profile, but those are unlikely to tip the scales."", ""On the other hand, you have the cheaper Galaxy S24 that delivers about 99% of the user experience the S25 offers, and it's bound to get major software upgrades for years to come.

If you want a compact Android flagship, there aren’t many choices out there. With all due respect to the Xiaomi 14, Samsung’s Galaxy S series is the only mainstream option. Of course, you could go for an iPhone 15 or 16, but if you specifically want an Android flagship, the Galaxy S25 is your best bet.', 'So, should you buy it? Here are four reasons why the Galaxy S25 is a great choice and one reason why you might want to reconsider.', '', 'Snapdragon 8 Elite + larger vapour chamber cooling', '', 'The biggest upgrade this year is the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which delivers a noticeable boost in performance over last year’s chip. Compared to the Exynos 2400 inside the Galaxy S24, the jump in performance is even bigger. Samsung has also increased the size of the vapour chamber cooling system by 15 per cent, helping to keep temperatures in check. Everything on this phone runs incredibly smoothly — whether you’re gaming, multitasking, or simply juggling between apps. The phone stays cool even during demanding tasks, and overheating issues from previous models, like when using Android Auto, seem to be much less of a problem.', '12GB RAM as standard', 'Samsung has finally made 12GB RAM the standard across the entire S25 series, which is a big deal. The Galaxy S24 only came with 8GB RAM, and while that’s fine for everyday use, 12GB makes a real difference in performance. With more RAM, you can keep multiple apps open without them reloading, experience better gaming performance, and enjoy smoother multitasking. It also helps with things like faster camera processing and overall system stability. If you’re someone who wants a phone that feels fast for years to come, 12GB RAM is a welcome upgrade.', '', 'More camera features', 'On paper, the Galaxy S25’s camera hardware looks very similar to last year’s model, but thanks to a better image signal processor (ISP), the actual results are improved. Photos are sharper, colours look more natural — especially skin tones — and the overall experience feels refined. Samsung has also added new software features, including smoother lens switching while recording video and a redesigned zoom slider. Pro users will appreciate the upgraded Expert RAW mode, which now includes exposure monitoring tools, ND filter strength options, and virtual aperture control for adjusting background blur in real time.', 'Subtle design changes', 'While not a drastic redesign, the Galaxy S25 has a few noticeable refinements. It comes in new colours like Navy and Icy Blue, with the latter looking especially nice. The blacked-out camera rings give the phone a sleeker appearance, and the front bezels are slightly slimmer. One small but important change is the thickness — now 7.2mm instead of 7.6mm of the S24. It might not sound like a big difference, but in hand, the S25 feels even more comfortable and ergonomic than the already well-designed Galaxy S24.', '', 'Battery life isn’t its strong suit', 'Samsung has stuck with a 4,000mAh battery, which is a bit of a letdown. The good news is that, thanks to the more efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, battery life is better than the Galaxy S24 — you can get through a full day on a single charge. However, if you need a phone that lasts significantly longer, you might want to consider a larger device. A bigger battery or newer battery technology like silicon-carbon cells would have helped, but for now, the improvements come mainly from software optimisation.', '']"

It's still not enough."", ""Simply put, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is just too big. It's so wide that reaching across the screen is nearly impossible, and stretching to the top is just as difficult.

That said, I had the S21 Ultra with a crazy telephoto zoom, and it was more of a party trick than anything. It's cool but not wildly useful day-to-day. The S25 Ultra's dedicated 5x zoom camera certainly takes better photos when you zoom in from 30x to 100x, but the results quickly lose quality to the point they're not super usable.

It’s also almost guaranteed to be one of the best camera phones around, like the Galaxy S series does every year.', 'This handset makes no compromises. It’s also quite expensive, though. The $1,299.99 starting price is quite hard to justify, but you might feel more comfortable paying this much if you get a $200 gift card.', 'We found the Galaxy S25 Ultra to be an amazing device. It features a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and 12GB of RAM. It can also be upgraded to 16GB of RAM in some markets. The performance is amazing, and it should handle any task with ease.', 'This phone is great elsewhere, too.

That boxy, professional-looking design of the Ultra models, reminiscent of the Galax Note lineup, was great visually, but it was a nightmare in actual use.

Single Take is a mode that automatically captures up to 14 types of photos and videos (such as slow motion, boomerangs, and portraits) for up to 15 seconds when you tap the shutter button, and on the Galaxy S25 series, Single Take mode also records a few seconds of footage before you tap the shutter button.', '', 'Samsung has also added support for shooting in the log video format. Videos shot in this format have a wider dynamic range and capture more detail, but they have flat and desaturated colors that need to be edited in post production to achieve the desired tone or style.', 'If you want to instantly convert a log video to a normal one, Samsung offers an option to correct the colors in the Gallery app. In the video below, you can see a short clip captured in log format followed by the same video with its colors corrected using the Gallery app.', '', ""Another advanced feature is virtual aperture. Available in the Expert RAW app, virtual aperture emulates the ability of dedicated cameras to switch between different aperture values. It's great for when you want to adjust the amount of background blur in a photo, though I didn't find much difference between it and the standard Portrait mode in terms of how much bokeh is applied."", 'Finally, below you can find some selfies (normal pics and portraits) from the 12MP front camera. Selfie quality is similar to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the S25 Ultra captures more accurate skin tones. Indoors and in low-light conditions, selfies can look soft, which is yet another issue on flagship Galaxy phones that Samsung has failed to address.', '', ""Every new Galaxy S Ultra smartphone is more powerful than the last, and it's no different for this year's model. This is the fastest and smoothest flagship phone from Samsung yet."", 'Samsung has worked hard on improving animations with One UI 7, and that effort is on full display here', 'Animations and transitions across the user interface are particularly fluid. Samsung has worked hard on improving animations with One UI 7, and that effort is on full display here. (These animations are also coming to older devices, though perhaps not all of them will perform on the same level as the S25 series.)', ""Can we give a bit of credit to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip? Well, not really. On paper, Samsung's flagships have always had more horsepower than is necessary for a smooth UI on a mobile phone. Samsung's optimization, or the lack thereof, was the problem, something the company realized only a couple of years back."", '', ""The Snapdragon 8 Elite does bring speed improvements. But you will only really notice them in computationally heavy tasks such as video editing and benchmark apps, at least if you're comparing with the Galaxy S23 Ultra or Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Snapdragon 8 Elite also offers the kind of power you need to perform some AI tasks on the device itself, such as erasing audio from videos."", 'Those upgrading from a Galaxy S22 Ultra or an older device will better appreciate just how fast the S25 Ultra is. They will also like how the Galaxy S25 Ultra stays cooler when pushed to the limit.', 'Thanks to a larger vapor chamber, the Galaxy S25 Ultra manages heat efficiently', ""The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a beast of a chip even compared to the S24 Ultra's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but thanks to a larger vapor chamber, the Galaxy S25 Ultra manages heat efficiently. If you're recording long videos or playing demanding games, the phone can get noticeably hot, but that's unavoidable on such a powerful device."", ""The S25 Ultra's gaming performance is as good as it gets. I tried a new game with console-quality graphics called GRID Legends, and the game looks great and runs extremely well. Frame rates can dip after a while when the temperature gets too high, but then again, this game is pushing console-level visuals and that's bound to turn any phone into a furnace and result in performance throttling."", '', 'The Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra are the first Samsung smartphones running One UI 7.0 (Android 15 ) out of the box. One UI 7 was made available in beta to the Galaxy S24 series in December 2024, and for the most part, the software is the same on the S25 series, so I will refer you to the video below for the nitty gritty.', '', 'One UI 7 is essentially a massive visual overhaul, as massive as the first version was back in 2018. Things are more colorful, Samsung apps have received new icons, the quick panel has become more customizable, and animations have been improved. Some long-requested features, like a vertical app drawer, have been introduced as well.', '', ""Now Bar, a notification feature inspired by Apple's iOS, is one of the more interesting new features. It displays ongoing activities, such as music or video playback, timers, Google Maps navigation, and voice recording, as a pill in the top left corner of the screen and, as a larger pill, at the bottom of the lock screen."", '', ""When multiple activities are ongoing, Now Bar stacks the pills on top of each other, letting you swipe up or down to switch between them. In case you're wondering, yes, these are the usual live activity widgets Android has had forever, only Now Bar makes them aesthetically more pleasing."", '', ""Now Bar is also linked to Now Brief, a feature that's exclusive to the Galaxy S25 series at the time of writing. As the name suggests, it provides you a brief/summary of everything you have planned for the day, news, tasks, and more. It shows up three or four times every day as a Now Bar notification on the lock screen – in the morning, mid-day, evening, and late night."", ""It can remind you of upcoming events and trips, the weather, traffic conditions, and upcoming routines made using One UI's Modes and Routines feature. Now Brief will also suggest breathing exercises before bedtime. It even adds a shortcut to YouTube Shorts, though this is something I never used because the only app I waste time on watching shorts (reels) is Instagram, which isn't supported."", '', ""Now Brief also provides a recap of everything that transpired during the day. Like calls you missed or photos you took, though the latter is another thing I didn't care for as I don't typically need reminders of photos captured just a few hours earlier. I also didn't see any news show up despite having the option enabled. This is likely because it only supports Samsung Free, an app I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole, not Google Discover."", 'Now Brief is technically a neat feature. But how much use you get out of it depends on your daily routine. If you work from home, you may start ignoring it after a few days.', ""Now Brief also needs to work across more apps, and perhaps pull info from notifications even if they come from an unsupported app. For example, I booked a movie ticket and received multiple reminders from the app I used, but Now Brief couldn't pick anything up."", 'Samsung will probably improve Now Brief via software updates, which the Galaxy S25 series will get for seven years. I just hope major Android and One UI updates will come out faster than Android 15 and One UI 7 for the Galaxy S24 lineup.', '', ""Samsung's marketing strategy for the Galaxy S25 series is based almost entirely on Galaxy AI. However, Google has provided the backend for a lot of Galaxy AI features since day one, and that's even more the case this time around."", ""Google Gemini is such an important part of the experience that it is now the default digital assistant when you long press the power button. That's not a bad thing, but the problem is that none of these Gemini features are going to remain exclusive to the S25 lineup. Older Galaxy devices will get them, and so will devices from other manufacturers."", '', 'Gemini does have extensions that plug into some Samsung apps so you can perform tasks in and get information from those apps. For example, you can add and view events in Samsung Calendar and Reminder, add notes to Samsung Notes, and send messages through the Samsung Messages app.', ""But none of that is something you couldn't already do through Bixby, and again, none of that is exclusive to the Galaxy S25 series. And if you weren't already in the habit of talking to digital assistants, Gemini likely won't change your mind."", 'I found myself loving the improvements to existing Galaxy AI features', 'Surprisingly, I found myself loving the improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Before I talk about them, I suggest reading our Galaxy AI overview, where we detail many of those existing AI features and what they do.', ""Alright, so let's start with Sketch to Image. This has easily been one of the most fun Galaxy AI features since day one, and with One UI 7, Samsung has made it better in various ways. For one, it can now create images from completely new sketches instead of only sketches made on existing images."", '', 'Two, you can now describe in words what you want Sketch to Image to create and let it work its magic. Samsung has also added the option to adjust the strength of the AI results and how closely they match your original sketch/drawing. Setting it to low lets the AI be more creative, which is great if your sketching skills are extremely rudimentary like mine.', ""Galaxy AI's summarization, text organization, grammar, and message composition features have also received a big boost in usability. You can now summarize, organize, format and translate text by simply selecting a piece of text inside various apps, including the Samsung Internet browser, and tapping the Galaxy AI button next to the copy and paste options."", ""Generative Edit, a feature that lets you remove, resize, and move objects and people in photos, has also received big improvements, particularly to the object eraser function. It's almost eerie how well Galaxy AI fills in the scene when you remove something from an image."", 'The object eraser is now considerably better at creating artificial data to replace the erased object. For example, in the image you see below, the Galaxy S25 series recreated the hand when I asked it to erase the phone. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 added what looks like a bandage and rendered the photo completely unusable.', '', ""The object eraser isn't perfect, and you may have to run it twice in some instances for the best result (in the example above, the first attempt resulted in the phone being replaced by what looked like a lanyard, so I went back into the object eraser and got rid of it). But none of that negates the fact that the object eraser is fantastic."", '', 'As far as new AI features are concerned, Audio Eraser is clearly the biggest attraction. And if you shoot a lot of videos or are a content creator, you will probably love it. It lets you remove voices, music, and other sounds from any video recording, and it works as well as something like it can work on a mobile device.', 'Audio Eraser is pretty impressive, especially for a feature in its first iteration', ""The premise is simple: it uses AI to detect different types of sound in a video and then lets you reduce or increase the volume for each of them. It separates sounds by voices, music, wind, and noise, with the last one essentially including anything the AI doesn't classify as falling in the first three categories."", 'To test it, I recorded myself singing in my car with the windows down to let in as much wind and traffic noise as possible. Then, I fired up Audio Eraser and reduced wind and noise volume to zero.', ""As you can hear in the video below, there's a nice bump in clarity whenever I switch from the original to the edited video. (Apologies for the amateur singing.)"", '', ""There are some downsides. Reducing the volume of one of the detected sounds can sometimes accentuate other unwanted sounds that the AI couldn't detect or erase, and the audio quality can take a hit. Still, Audio Eraser is pretty impressive, especially for a feature that is in its first iteration."", ""Overall, the Galaxy AI experience is better than ever on the Galaxy S25 series. But the question remains: will you use any of the AI features? Most customers will likely use just one or two features at most, and all the AI stuff, as good as it is, shouldn't be a major factor in your purchase decision."", '', 'Samsung has been on a mission to make its Ultra smartphones last as long as possible since 2023. Every Ultra model starting with the Galaxy S20 Ultra has featured a 5,000 mAh battery, but we didn’t see battery life matching the physical capacity until the Galaxy S23 Ultra.', 'Samsung’s decision to go with a Snapdragon chip has been crucial in this mission, and we saw notable battery life gains on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I didn’t think it could get any better, especially with the increase in power we have seen with each Snapdragon chip the last couple of years. But the Galaxy S25 Ultra proved me wrong.', 'This phone refused to die in a single day', 'This phone refused to die in a single day with my typical usage pattern, which involved plenty of YouTube videos, checking Slack for work and WhatsApp for chatting with friends and family, web browsing, and taking pictures and videos with the camera for at least half an hour. 8+ hours of screen on time is consistently achievable. With light use and the Always On Display feature turned off, so is two days of battery life.', 'When the phone is actively used, battery life is similar to the S24 Ultra. It’s when the phone is idle that makes the difference. Samsung has also fixed a major issue Galaxy phones have had in recent years: their tendency of almost instantly shutting down when battery charge falls to 1%. For the first time in years on a flagship Galaxy phone, I didn’t have to scramble to get to a charger when the battery was on its last leg.', ""Speaking of charging, Samsung hasn't improved anything. That doesn’t mean charging speeds are bad, of course. If you use a 45W charger, the S25 Ultra goes from 0-100% in around 65 minutes."", 'With half an hour of charging, the S25 Ultra charges up to anywhere between 60-70%', ""With half an hour of charging, the S25 Ultra charges up to anywhere between 60-70% depending on whether or not the phone was fully shut down during the charging process. Wireless charging speeds remain the same as other Samsung flagships, topping out at 15W. There's support for Qi2 wireless charging, but only with a magnetic/MagSafe case."", ""A note about Samsung finally adding information on battery health and charge cycles to One UI: that appears to be market dependent. On my Indian review unit, that info isn't provided. However, Samsung may add it later. Our Australian unit didn't have it initially but got the health info out of nowhere a few days later."", '', ""No one can deny the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't a huge upgrade over the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and that it is still behind the curve in some regards, at least on paper. Even Galaxy S23 Ultra owners will not find the Galaxy S25 Ultra to be a substantial upgrade unless they find a fantastic trade-in deal."", ""But that's the thing: this device isn't designed with customers who buy a new phone every year or two in mind. It's for folks who are using a Samsung flagship that launched three or more years ago. It's also a great choice for anyone buying their first flagship or upgrading from a mid-range or budget phone."", ""The Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't exciting. But it's still a fantastic premium phone that does almost everything extremely well and is worth the price of admission.

It takes fabulous pictures, features some of the crispest AI-enhanced software on the market, and has a brilliantly crisp and accurate screen."", ""The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a compromise-free flagship smartphone, but what happens if you want something a little smaller? The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a great phone, but it's no Galaxy S25 Ultra Mini."", ""Thankfully, Google makes the closest thing you're going to get to such a device in the form of the Google Pixel 9 Pro. For the first time ever, Google has crammed all of its best features into a relatively compact form factor, with virtually no compromises. That's the sales pitch, anyway."", ""So, does the Google Pixel 9 Pro actually match up to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra? Is it really as simple a case of choosing your preferred screen size? We've reviewed both phones, awarding them a stellar 4.5 out of 5 score in our Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review and Google Pixel 9 Pro review, respectively. But to declare a winner, we're going to have to break things down into a point-by-point comparison."", ""Before we dive into a direct comparison, let's run through the key specifications of both phones.

US customers alone get the option of a 1TB model for $1,449."", 'Comparing like-for-like storage options, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a not-inconsiderable $200 / £150 / AU$300 more expensive. First blood, Google.', ""Samsung has switched up its design language with the Galaxy S25 Ultra to bring it more in line with the rest of the Galaxy range. It's all flat edges now, albeit with much pointier corners than the regular Galaxy S25."", 'Google has also taken things a turn for the flatter with the Pixel 9 Pro, though it looks more like the standard Galaxy S25 than the Ultra – and thus, inevitably, a lot more like an iPhone.', ""Both look and feel like the premium devices they are, though the Galaxy S25 Ultra is undoubtedly the higher-end piece of kit. Its frame is made of titanium rather than the Pixel 9 Pro's aluminum. Both phones are IP68 certified, so are similarly water and dust-resistant."", ""From the rear, the Pixel 9 Pro is arguably the more interesting phone of the two. It all comes down to Google's classy camera module, which stands loud and proud, and covers most of the width of the phone. The Galaxy S25 Ultra's discrete camera lenses simply don't have the same wow factor."", 'Of course, the biggest difference here relates to the size of these two phones. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is huge, measuring 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm and weighing a hefty 218g. The Pixel 9 Pro is much more pocketable, measuring 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm and weighing 199g.', ""Samsung's phone gets an additional point of interest in the form of an integrated S Pen stylus housed in the bottom edge of the phone. Samsung may have robbed it of Bluetooth connectivity this year, but it still offers an input method that the Pixel 9 Pro (along with most other phones) wholly lacks."", 'That difference in size informs the size of the two displays on offer here. The Galaxy S25 Ultra packs a vast 6.9-inch AMOLED display, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a much smaller 6.3-inch variant.', 'Both are LTPO panels, so can adjust between 1 and 120Hz refresh rates depending on the task at hand. The Galaxy S25 Ultra technically packs in more pixels – 1440 x 3120 vs 1280 x 2856 – but the difference in size means that the pixel density is similar.', ""Indeed, you'll need to dive into the settings to activate the full QHD+ resolution on the Samsung phone in the first place, which feels like a weird decision."", ""Where the Pixel 9 Pro wins points is for its superior brightness. It can attain a 3000 nits peak in HDR content, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra only hits 2600 nits. Both are strong, but Google's phone takes the edge on sunnier days."", ""There's also the fact that the Pixel 9 Pro's display is a little more natural-looking, while Samsung has ramped up the vibrant colors with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's certainly a look, but it's not the most technically accurate out there."", 'Both phones employ ultrasonic fingerprint sensors underneath their displays, which are fast and secure. Our reviewer did encounter more read errors with the Samsung than the Google, but these things tend to vary from person to person.', 'Both of these phones take phenomenal pictures, and are right up near the top of the camera phone tree – albeit for different reasons.', 'Samsung continues to be the zoom king, having equipped the Galaxy S25 Ultra with two telephoto cameras – one 10MP 3x and one 50MP 5x periscope camera. The Pixel 9 Pro, by contrast, only has the one 48MP 5x unit.', ""This means that the Galaxy S25 Ultra takes sharper pictures across a wider range of focal lengths, including those hybrid shots that crop in on the sensors for a deeper zoom. It also benefits from a 200MP main sensor that captures more detail than the Pixel 9 Pro's 50MP main sensor."", ""Both manufacturers offer a heavily processed look, but Samsung's color science is perhaps a little less natural and more over-saturated than Google's.

Both Samsung and Google have a strong low-light algorithm game."", ""Both phones also employ powerful AI features to help you make some creepily effective AI adjustments, including removing background objects and even inserting elements that weren't there in the first place. It might not be pure photography, but it sure is impressive."", ""Google's phone wins out with a phenomenal 42MP selfie camera, which is arguably the best in the business. It also takes the W on video recording, especially with a Video Boost mode that improves sharpness, exposure, and stability at the small cost of longer processing times."", 'There are two elements to this section: performance and software. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra clearly wins the first one, while the Google Pixel 9 Pro mops up with the second.', ""Taking performance first, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra uses Qualcomm's blazing Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. It's already faster than pretty much any other mobile processor on the market – including from Apple – and this is a slightly overclocked version of that chip too."", ""In the opposite corner, the Pixel 9 Pro is one of the weakest-performing flagship phones on the market. It would be unfair to label Google's home-brewed Tensor G4 chip a dud, but it seems to be more than a generation behind the Snapdragon 8 Elite when you take a look at the usual CPU and GPU benchmark numbers. Last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra handily beats it, let alone the current model."", ""Google would argue that this is an outdated way to view performance these days, and that its AI performance is where it's at. It's certainly true that the Pixel 9 Pro runs some very clever AI tools, and the phone's 16GB of RAM makes the 12GB of the Galaxy S25 Ultra seem stingy to that end."", ""There's no getting away from the fact that the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels much snappier in the hands, however. The Pixel 9 Pro isn't slow, but there were definitely moments when it stuttered and paused during our review period, such as when we had multiple apps running together. We had no such issues with the Galaxy S25 Ultra."", 'This could be particularly problematic going forward. Both manufacturers offer generous seven-year software update promises, but only the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels as if it might be sufficiently snappy to still be running well towards the end of its lifespan.', ""However, when it comes to the experience of actually using that software, the Pixel 9 Pro wins hands down. Google's stock UI is simply much cleaner and less cluttered than Samsung's. There's no duplicate web browser, virtual assistant, or payment app, and the app tray and notification center are both far more intuitive."", ""Both Samsung and Google go big on AI, and indeed Samsung has adopted many of Google's tricks, including making Gemini its primary assistant. We'll go with Google's more cohesive implementation, but the truth is both phones have a similarly sporadic hit rate when it comes to AI software."", ""You'd expect the larger phone to feature superior stamina, and that tallies with our experience. Not only does the Galaxy S25 Ultra have a larger 5,000mAh battery (vs 4,700mAh in the Pixel 9 Pro), but it also has the more efficient processor of the two."", ""Both phones will last a full day of fairly heavy usage without making you sweat, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra scored much better in our Future Labs tests. While Samsung's phone lasted more than 17 hours, the Pixel 9 Pro lasted about four hours less."", ""This isn't a criticism of the Pixel. It holds up to its fellow small flagships pretty well. It's just in a different class to the hulking Galaxy S25 Ultra."", ""Neither phone is hugely impressive when it comes time to recharge times. The Galaxy S25 Ultra supports 45W charging, while the Pixel 9 Pro supports 27W. While the Samsung phone is quoted as being able to get from empty to 65% in 30 minutes, the Pixel 9 Pro will only get to 55% in the same time. It's not a hugely significant difference, but it's a win for Samsung nonetheless."", ""The Galaxy S25 Ultra supports 15W Qi wireless charging to the Pixel 9 Pro's 12W, though Google wins the wireless round by supporting a faster bespoke wireless solution of 21W, provided you invest in the Pixel Stand."", '', ""The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro are two of our favorite phones, and they're also sufficiently different to make a straight-up winner very tough to call."", ""If you're a media hound who likes your screens large and your battery life epic, the massive Galaxy S25 Ultra is clearly the best pick. Elsewhere, its S Pen function makes it uniquely suited to scrawling notes and ideas."", 'For those after a more compact phone, whether due to having small hands or tiny pockets, the Pixel 9 Pro is for you. It gives you a largely compromise-free flagship experience in a much smaller bundle, and it costs less to boot.', ""The tit-for-tat continues: Samsung's phone is much faster, and thus arguably a little more future-proof. Conversely, Google's software is much cleaner and nicer to use, and buying a Pixel means you're signing up for the latest and greatest AI features as they arrive. Google makes both the hardware and the software here, which counts for a lot – just ask Apple fans."", ""Ultimately, you're not going to be sorry with whichever of these two phones you buy.

Additionally, Micron is now shipping its most power-efficient LPDDR5X memory ever to the market for the first time, offering users more than 10% power improvement.1 With its One UI 7 update, the Galaxy S25 series is a true AI companion that provides personalized experiences tailored to users’ unique needs, powered by multimodal AI agents that seamlessly interpret text, speech, images and videos.', 'As smartphone AI capabilities grow in sophistication, processing is increasingly executed directly on edge devices rather than relying only on the cloud. This demands more high-performance memory and storage than ever to accommodate AI models and datasets on the devices. Power efficiency is also critical, with over 70% of smartphone users stating that battery life is the most important feature they consider when purchasing a phone.', '“We’ve optimized Micron’s mobile portfolio to deliver the power efficiency, high performance and large capacity needed to propel the next wave of AI innovation in flagship smartphones,” said Mark Montierth, corporate vice president and general manager of Micron’s Mobile Business Unit. “Samsung is setting a new standard for AI phones, enabling them to be true AI companions with context-aware and personalized mobile experiences powered by Micron’s leadership memory and storage.”', 'Micron’s high-bandwidth LPDDR5X memory and advanced UFS 4.0 storage are embedded into select Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 devices, accelerating real-time AI processing at consumers’ fingertips. Micron’s UFS 4.0 storage is available in high capacities, allowing data to be stored locally instead of the cloud, providing greater security for personal data.

Here’s how it works.', 'If last year’s introduction of Galaxy AI features with the Galaxy S24 was a taste of the future, then today’s Galaxy S25 offers a full-scale culinary feast. A full meal with dessert rather than just a snack, the new S25 Galaxy AI features are not just for the basics like transcribing and summarizing conversations — although that’s included — but for supporting a fuller more interactive relationship with your phone.', 'Go ahead, ask what restaurant has the best thin crust pizza or what’s needed to repair your car’s squeaking brakes. That’s because the S25 focuses as much on widening the scope of its AI menu as easing its use. Shifting AI into high gear with a wide variety of new and improved tasks is likely just the start as AI becomes part of a phone’s every task, ability and feature.', ""There's definitely a lot to absorb if you're just getting acquainted with your new Galaxy S25. That's why I'm going to tell you exactly the features you need to try first on the Galaxy S25, along with a handful tips and tricks to help you along the way. And yes, these also work for the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra, as they share the same set of features."", 'All in all, the S25’s new hardware takes a back seat to software and AI processing of your every whim.

My choices include everything from asking for dining recommendations to reading Web sites to fine-tuning photos.', '', 'The Galaxy S25 goes all in on artificial intelligence with the Google Gemini preloaded and integrated with Samsung’s Calendar, Notes and Reminder apps that can turn the phone into a companion and friend. Gemini’s options are minimal and available from a link in the app’s upper right, starting with giving the AI app the ability to listen without unlocking the phone. After selecting “Gemini on lock screen” I was set for quick questions and trivia night cheating.', 'I started by typing questions and moved on to talking to Gemini with a long press of the phone’s side button. It took a couple seconds to recommend the best current movies but when I asked for “vegan ramen noodles in my area,” it included several that touted meat dishes.', '', 'Gemini Advanced takes AI to a higher level with links to Gmail and Google Docs as well as 2TB of online storage that normally costs $20 per month; the S25 comes with a six month free trial. Later, the system delivered a surprisingly cogent explanation about the material properties of Roman concrete, an essay I wish I had when I was a student.', 'Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.', '', 'The S25’s One UI 7 brings a new and tighter look to the phone’s lock screen with widgets for a variety of items. They can be customized in the “Wallpaper and style” section.', 'It’s easy to add a widget to surface the language translator, news, weather or other rapidly changing items. Personally, I’m more interested in the battery’s charge level and the Device Care optimization that can free up gobs of system memory.', '', 'The Galaxy S25’s new Now Bar is a big step forward for those who don’t want to unlock their phones to see some basic information. Similar in scope to the iPhone’s Dynamic Island, the small oval bar mixes entertainment control buttons with items that range from the weather to time to news.', 'Aside from the “Good Morning” message, it’s useful and serious. Open the “Lock Screen and AOD” (Always On Display) and tap the link for Now Bar in the middle. Pick the items you want included and make sure that the “Now brief” toggle is enabled when done.', '', 'The home screen dynamics on the S25 are a mixed bag with lots of flexibility but missing some S24 options, like the 4 x 5 and 5 x 5 grid options; only the 4 x 6 and 5 x 6 are shown. Still, it’s easy to add active elements by pressing on an empty part of the screen and tapping Widgets below.', 'There’re several choices, including design details like resizing the app icons and adding widget labels. I went a few steps further by adding the Daily Activity widget to track my walking and calories burned for the previous week. I finished by locking the Home Screen.', '', 'The other day I was on a crosstown bus so bumpy that I could not keep the phone stable enough to read my favorite site. So, I let the phone read the pages to me.', 'To hear all about it, I put my ear buds in and went to Galaxy AI’s browsing assist. After firing up the read highlights aloud option, I made sure it would read in English; there are a variety of downloadable language packs available. The reading voice is generally fluid and understandable although some of the cadence is off and it only works with Samsung’s Internet Browser and sites without pay walls.', '', 'In addition to sharper and less grainy night photography, the S25 brings an array of AI-based photo tools. My favorite is the camera’s adjustable virtual aperture that rather than manipulating the optics, digitally mimics changing the lens’s aperture. With the phone’s camera app open go to More, then Expert Raw. If it’s your first use, download Samsung’s 500MB Expert Raw app. At the app’s Expert Raw Labs section and turn on all the controls to allow the new software to take over.', 'Back at the camera screen, tap the yellow F stop area to open the vertical slider on the right for changing the aperture’s setting. The results are nothing short of amazing with the ability to get the foreground (like a piece of fruit) in focus, while the background is out of focus at low F stop numbers or get a sharp shot of a house with a high F stop.', '', 'Regardless of whether you’re removing a shadow or an annoying beachgoer in the background, whenever you use Samsung Generative AI image editing, the result has an “AI-Generated content” watermark in the lower left corner.', 'This was the case when I removed a passing car from my street scene, but like a temporary tattoo, the watermark can disappear. Begin by tapping on the interface’s editing pencil, opening on the 4 circle More menu and going to the Object eraser. After circling the watermark tap Erase and presto, it’s gone.', '', 'Since its inception, Samsung’s Knox security software has protected a phone’s sensitive data in a secure encrypted folder that’s great for stashing photos, videos, IDs and anything private. It’s now easier to set it up by going to the Secure Folder that’s in the More portion of the “Security and privacy” Settings section.', 'Once the folder is set up, pick a method for opening it, like fingerprint, PIN or pattern. I set it up to secure the folder when my phone’s lock screen starts up, but if you have the tendency to forget passwords, make sure the bottom switch is enabled so that you can recover data access via your Samsung account.', '', 'When you’re battling aliens or lapping at Le Mans, squeezing every last ounce of phone performance can be the difference between winning and losing.', 'To make the S25 game-friendly, go to the Gaming Hub app and tap the three dot link in the upper right to get to the Game Booster page. It’s a cornucopia of gaming enhancements, starting with the “Gaming motion smoothness” setting; boost it to 120Hz refresh rate. Then, hit the “Customizations for individual games” to tailor the settings for each game you’ve installed. Start by resetting the “Game optimization” level to Performance and then double the frame rate because I need every advantage I can get. Watch out, these changes can sap the phone’s battery.', '', 'The good news is that the S25 Ultra can charge its 5,000 mAh battery in a little over an hour using a 45W power adapter. If you’re charging from the lock screen, One UI 6’s circular battery level indicator has been replaced by One UI 7’s larger pill at the screen’s bottom to show the charge level and how much time remains until a full charge. When charging from the Home Screen, a green icon momentarily pops up in the upper right followed by a trilling sound.', '', ""A good tip is that to get the most out of fast charging, you’ll want to turn battery protection off at Settings, Battery, Battery Protection, but this can shorten its lifespan. There are three levels of battery protection available: Basic, Adaptive and Maximum. Either way, the phone can feel like a hot potato after a quick charge. It's a risk you take, but it might be helpful when used sparringly."", '', 'Using your finger to unlock a Galaxy phone can be a time-consuming task, but there’s a trick to speeding up the analysis of your finger’s pattern and — hopefully — opening the phone.', 'Go to the “Security and privacy” section and open “Screen lock and biometrics” followed by entering your PIN. After opening Fingerprints, turn off the “Show animation when unlocking."" It’s there to divert your attention while the phone processes the data. Without the animation overhead, the unlocking process is streamlined, but before you leave the page, enable “Fingerprint always on.”', '', 'Samsung’s Wallet app does more than consolidate all your plastic money, IDs, and digital payments into one screen by incorporating Samsung Pay.', 'The combination is protected with the phone’s Knox security but adds flexible payment options available for got-have things (like a Galaxy S25) you want but can’t afford at the moment.', 'At this point, you’ll need to enter personal information, but all the fees are spelled out. More than instant digital gratification, think of it as a way to leave the cards at home yet still shop freely.', '', 'Other than the larger screen, the S25 Ultra model has the S25 and S25 Plus beat by including the latest S Pen stylus for drawing, writing and tapping. The new design is a step back by lacking Bluetooth radio, forget about using it as a remote camera shutter release.', 'It can still do lots of helpful things, so start at the Settings’ Advanced Features and tap on the S Pen section to get to all its major options. In addition to turning handwriting into digital text and taking notes with the screen turned off it’s a great way to doodle or air draw when bored. A nice trick is set the phone to open the Notes app to have it ready for writing whenever the pen is removed.', 'Brian Nadel is a freelance writer and editor who specializes in technology reporting and reviewing.

I used the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13 side-by-side; here’s why this year is different,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/used-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-123610809.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'For the past several years, my routine has remained the same. I’ll enjoy using the latest OnePlus flagship. I love the performance and value for money the company is known for, and the OnePlus 11 and 12 have been legitimately good smartphones. Still, a part of me is always glad to get back to the warm embrace of the Samsung Galaxy series once the review period is over.', 'I’m an old-school Galaxy Note fan, and even though we’re a long way from that era, the Galaxy Ultra phones do enough to keep me hooked. Samsung offers excellent devices with great software and powerful hardware to match. However, 2025 is turning out differently than in previous years, and OnePlus has stepped up its game with the OnePlus 13. Let’s find out if it did enough to make me forget about the Galaxy S25 Ultra and keep my SIM exactly where it is.', 'The OnePlus mission statement always sounded good. The company offered the latest flagship processor and premium materials for less than the competition, allowing US customers to experience something different with a device featuring impressive power without the Samsung price tag. But something would always hold me back from thoroughly enjoying the phones.', 'That’s not the case this year, as OnePlus did a fantastic job making the OnePlus 13 a complete flagship experience. I’ll start with the design. When you pick up the OnePlus 13, you can immediately tell the engineers put time and effort into the device’s feel. Despite the larger camera array, it’s balanced, and I love the thin aluminum band around the edge. It’s actually a thicker phone than the Galaxy S25 Ultra but feels thinner because of the design — it’s a fantastic device to hold.', 'I also love that OnePlus gives us a 16GB RAM variant. You’ll pay an additional $100, but it’s still significantly cheaper than a base Galaxy S25 Ultra. It gives added peace of mind that my OnePlus 13 will be snappy for years, even with whatever AI advancements are in store. With the Snapdragon 8 Elite, my OnePlus 13 is a performance monster with a fantastic gaming experience. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset delivers as advertised, and I’m excited to see what powerful applications will eventually take full advantage of it.', 'OnePlus already had an advantage over Samsung regarding charging speeds, but the company took things further with the battery for 2025. You should believe everything you’ve heard about the OnePlus 13’s 6,000mAh silicon-carbide battery — it’s fantastic. I get a full two days of battery life, whereas, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I’m searching for a charger after lunchtime on the second day. You might not think that’s a big deal, as you always remember to plug your phone in overnight. However, it’s an excellent safety blanket when you don’t, and whenever I forget, I don’t worry about getting through my day.', 'Even if you forget, faster charging speeds ensure you can top off quickly. The OnePlus 13 supports 80 and 100W wired recharging with the proper adapters. Those are massive figures, considering Samsung is stuck at 45W again. OnePlus uses a dual-cell design to help with long-term battery health, which is a concern people have with faster charging speeds. All told, the OnePlus 13 comes out ahead on battery.', 'The hardware on OnePlus devices has always been fantastic, but the software has prevented me from truly enjoying them. I don’t think OxygenOS 15 is better than One UI 7. However, OxygenOS 15 is in a much-improved position compared to previous years, and it’s no longer a negative for OnePlus phones. It may not be a reason I’d buy a OnePlus 13, but it’s not a reason I’d avoid picking one up.', 'OnePlus 13 camera samples', 'Camera performance is another reason I’ve previously avoided OnePlus phones. Photos appear a step below those of Samsung, Google, and Apple, and while I’m not a shutterbug, I want to know that my flagship phone will take a decent point-and-shoot image when needed. Whatever OnePlus and Hasselblad did for the OnePlus 13 is working, as the photos are excellent. Nighttime photography is improved, and while it’s all a personal preference, there are instances when I prefer the output from my OnePlus 13 over the Galaxy S25 Ultra — something I wouldn’t have been able to say in previous years.', 'Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra photo samples', 'I’m not going to rehash my misgivings about the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It didn’t include the innovations I hoped for on the hardware side, as Samsung seems content appealing to previous Galaxy owners trading in older phones. If you’re coming from a Galaxy S21 Ultra, you’ll notice meaningful upgrades, and it’s hard to say anything bad about the phone. It’s an excellent performer in a sleek (albeit non-descript) package. If you’re a long-time Samsung fan, and the newest battery and camera hardware don’t excite you, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is fantastic.', ""However, I’d be fooling myself if I said Samsung still didn't hold significant advantages over OnePlus. One UI 7 is a phenomenal piece of software, and it’s silky smooth on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s vital to differentiate One UI 7 from Galaxy AI, as the latter is in an awkward spot. Samsung touted AI as a reason you’d buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the features aren’t ready for primetime. It’s not the transformative experience the company hoped for, but it doesn’t mean all is lost. One UI 7 is solid, and Samsung offers 7 One UI version upgrades and 7 years of software support. There are plenty of reasons you’d choose a Galaxy S25 Ultra over a OnePlus 13; its software is at the top of the list."", ""Another reason you’d buy a Galaxy S25 Ultra is the display. I understand it’s not the newest display technology, but it’s a gorgeous panel — the best I’ve seen on a smartphone in a long time. I don’t know how many phone screens I stare at yearly, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s display dazzles me every time I pick it up. I’m glad Samsung moved away from the natural color tones on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, returning to the vibrant hues it's known for. You can still dial back the saturation if needed, but I love having the option. We stare at our smartphone displays for hours a day, so a good panel is essential. I understand some users will struggle with PWM dimming on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it’s an incredible smartphone display that will please most of us."", 'I’m disappointed that Samsung removed some S pen functions, but I’m glad it’s there. I use it to scroll through social media and scribble notes on documents. It’s fantastic for cropping GIFs to send to friends and write down a number quickly. I hate to see the S pen’s role diminished, and I hope it’s not a sign that Samsung plans to remove it entirely.', 'I prefer the OnePlus 13 over the Galaxy S25 Ultra this year, but I understand it’s difficult for most people to switch. There aren’t OnePlus stores in the US you can walk into when something goes wrong, and you can’t finance one through your carrier. A smartphone is a lifeline for people, and the thought of going without when something goes wrong frightens many consumers.', 'In most years, I wouldn’t mention carrier store financing, but Samsung targeted upgrade cycles to sell new flagships, banking on users coming from an older Galaxy model. If you’re an enthusiast like myself, pick up a OnePlus 13. If you’ve never removed a SIM card from a phone, buy the Galaxy S25 Ultra.', ""The OnePlus 13 is a beast of a phone. With a refreshed design, a mostly curveless display, and a massive 6,000mAh battery capable of getting you through a day without breaking a sweat, this could be the Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered smartphone to beat in 2025. And hey, it's got a pretty great camera system, too."", ""Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra leaves the Note-like design behind for the very first time. With flat edges, curved corners, and a massive 6.9-inch display, this is a modern flagship through and through — and yes, that S Pen is still here too.""]"

Samsung Galaxy S25 review: the smallest top-tier Android left,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/21/samsung-galaxy-s25-review-smallest-top-tier-android-ai,"['Compact phone has flagship chip and buckets of AI, but hasn’t changed much from predecessors', 'T\nhe smallest and cheapest of Samsung’s new Galaxy S25 line might be the one to buy, offering top performance and the very latest AI features for less and proving that smaller-sized Androids can still be great.', 'Unlike previous generations of Samsung’s smaller models sold in the UK and Europe, the regular S25 has the same top-flight chip as the enormous and pricey Ultra model, offering a lot of performance while costing £799 (€919/$800/A$1,399).', 'The rest of the S25 hasn’t changed materially since last year. It still has a great 6.2in screen, three cameras on the back, flat aluminium sides and glass front and back. That makes it the most compact of high-end Android phones available, competing with Apple’s iPhone on size where others including Google’s Pixel 9 have grown steadily larger.', 'With its small size comes a smaller battery than most modern Androids, although Samsung does well to squeeze a solid 37 hours out of the S25. In general use on a mix of 5G and wifi, and actively using the screen for more than six hours, I had to charge the phone every other day. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip makes the S25 one of the fastest phones available and is great for games, but playing them significantly dents the battery life.', 'The big changes for the S25 are all software and AI-based. It runs the same latest version of One UI 7 (Android 15) as the S25 Ultra, including various new AI tools that expand on writing, summarisation and drawing tools introduced last year.', 'Most of the new tools are designed to either anticipate what you want to do to find information you might need ahead of time or to perform multiple complex tasks on your phone via text or voice commands.', 'Google’s next-generation Gemini assistant is the biggest upgrade, able to interact with information from the web and apps on your phone to get things done without you having to manually tap buttons. Ask it to put the date into your calendar from a party invitation flyer that has been texted to you and it can do so. It can find restaurant recommendations and send them to a friend as a suggestion for dinner with a simple voice command. It can also understand what is on your screen from text, photos and videos to answer questions, find out more information or perform actions.', 'It can be almost magical when it works. But it can’t be relied on to get things right every time. Sometimes it trips up on trivial things such as different spellings of names, and it can confidently hallucinate information that looks good on first glance but is in fact totally wrong. Neither Google nor Samsung has solved these fundamental problems that plague all AI bots at the moment.', 'Samsung’s new “Now” bar at the bottom of the lock screen is more successful as a useful place where timely information widgets, timers, media-playing controls and other handy bits appear. You can swipe through a stack of them to see what’s happening or quickly change track.', 'Samsung will support the S25 with software and security updates for seven years from release, which matches the best from Google and Apple.', 'Main screen: 6.2in FHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X 120Hz', 'Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy', 'RAM: 12GB', 'Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB', 'Operating system: One UI 7 (Android 15)', 'Camera: 50MP + 12MP 0.6x + 10MP 3x; 12MP front-facing', 'Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, UWB and GNSS', 'Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins)', 'Dimensions: 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm', 'Weight: 162g', 'Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.', 'The phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost £149 by authorised service centres and include a battery replacement. Samsung also offers a self-repair programme.', 'The phone contains multiple recycled materials including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare earth elements and steel. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports and impact assessments for some individual products.', 'Sign up to TechScape', 'A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives', '', 'The S25 has a triple camera setup on the back with a 50-megapixel main, 12MP ultrawide and 10MP 3x telephoto, which is a combination that hasn’t really changed since the S22 in 2022 and is exactly the same as last year’s model.', 'That means it shoots generally very good photos across the three cameras. The main is the best and can produce some great shots, although it has a tendency to over-brighten some scenes, causing highlights to be blown out, such as bright direct light washing out shots of people. The 2x zoom is improved on the S24 with slightly more detail, while the 3x zoom is solid, although short on reach compared with the 5x cameras common on slightly more expensive rivals. The ultrawide is equally solid and rounds out a good but not groundbreaking package.', 'The S25 shoots equally good video, excellent portraits and has plenty of modes with one exception: no macrophotography mode, which is disappointing. Overall, the S25 has a good camera system. It won’t trouble a Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro but it’s great for the size and money.', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 costs from £799 (€919/$799.99/A$1,399).', 'For comparison, the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249, the S25+ costs £999, the Google Pixel 9 costs £649, the OnePlus 13 costs £899 and the iPhone 16 costs £799.', 'The Galaxy S25 is the last really good small Android phone standing. Where competitors have grown ever bigger, the Samsung feels refreshingly light, thin and narrow in the hand without having a tiny screen.', 'As with its supersized sibling, the design feels like the endpoint for standard high-end phones, which means barely anything has changed in the last few years. The switch to Qualcomm’s new top chip makes for a significant performance boost. But the rest is down to software introducing more advanced AI tools, which can be spectacular when they work but frequently can’t be trusted. They will also make their way to older Samsung S-series phones over the next couple of months, which makes last year’s S24 more tempting.', 'But if you’re after the smallest flagship Android going that’s actually good, the S25 is it.', 'Pros: compact size, good 6.2in screen, decent camera, good software with seven years’ support, top Android chip, access to the latest AI features, cheapest Samsung flagship model.', 'Cons: iterative design, no 5x zoom, battery life short of larger models, AI capabilities overhyped for now.']"

Here’s how it works.', 'There’s plenty to love about the Galaxy S25: it’s compact, and powerful, the display is great, Samsung offers 7 years of OS support, and surprisingly, the battery impressed too. The move from Exynos to Snapdragon levels up the experience in countless ways, but there’s no getting around to the fact that the camera system is getting tired, and apart from the welcome addition of LOG video, it struggles to iterate meaningfully. A great phone with a good enough camera system.', 'Thin, light, compact, and premium design', 'Excellent display quality', 'Cool, powerful performance', 'Seven years of OS & security updates', 'No major camera upgrades over S22, S23 and S24', 'Photo processing can miss the mark', 'Weak telephoto camera', 'New AI features currently add limited value', 'Why you can trust Digital Camera World Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out how we test.', 'Samsung’s Galaxy S25 is the baby bear of the series, with the larger S25 Plus and S25 Ultra launching alongside to offer big phone fans something to wrap their hands around. With a drought of compact phones outside the Apple camp, though, the S25 will likely be the most compelling of the three for many.', 'This year, Samsung’s putting a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor – typically reserved for the Ultra – in all three S25 phones in the EU and the US. So, it’s safe to expect a performance boost and generally a more stable experience across heat management and battery life.', 'The Galaxy S25 also boasts a great-looking display, slim bezels, all Samsung’s new AI smarts and seven years of operating system updates. All those things lay the foundation for greatness, but when a phone is so slim and so light, cameras typically take a hit.', 'With the same camera rear spec as the S24, S23 and S22 before it, I’m going into this review with tempered expectations. Sure, the new phone will benefit from some 2025 photo processing and AI smarts, but you can only do so much with midrange camera hardware.', '', 'In the S25’s favor, it costs the same as the competition, specifically the Google Pixel 9 and iPhone 16, but that’s for the 128GB storage model. When you start adding storage, the 256GB version takes on the more specced-out OnePlus 13, or you could pick up the less powerful but Leica co-engineered Xiaomi 14T Pro for considerably less. Alternatively, for anyone who wants a smaller device, the Xiaomi 15 is expected to launch imminently in the West at a similar price to the Galaxy S25.', 'With all this competition, does Samsung’s premium, pocketable flagship deserve a place in your palm, or would you be better off opting for alternatives that arguably offer more for less?', 'The Galaxy S25 looks a bit like a smartphone by numbers – the kind of design that pops up when you type “smartphone” into a stock image library search bar, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The compact size makes it comfortable to hold, the flat sides make it easy to grip, and the rounded corners nuzzle comfortably into a palm.', '', 'Made of aluminum around the frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back with IP68 water and dust resistance, despite being so thin and light, there’s a degree of durability assurance here too. That said, it misses out on the titanium and anti-reflective display of the S25 Ultra.', 'At just 7.2mm thin, it’s one of the slimmest phones on the market, and weighing 162g, it feels almost featherweight after using chunky smartphones like the Honor Magic 7 RSR and iPhone 16 Pro Max.', 'While its design is safe, the Galaxy S25 still looks good, with standard color options including Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, and Silver Shadow, and more available online. Each sports a matte finish that does a great job of keeping fingerprints at bay, and the matte frame is color-matched for a cohesive look.', '', 'Ultimately, while Samsung isn’t shaking things up, the Galaxy S25’s compact design, premium feel, and tasteful finish ensure it’s comfortable to use, feels like a flagship, and looks the part too.', 'Part of the Galaxy S25’s charm is its compact display, which is matched with an ultra-thin bezel (introduced on the S24), making the front of the phone look wonderfully immersive.', 'At 6.2 inches, there’s plenty of room to type on the S25’s screen comfortably with one hand or two, without anything feeling like a stretch. The flat sides also help ensure it’s comfortable to use in both portrait or landscape when gaming for example, so the ergonomics of the screen are a win off the bat.', '', 'Samsung’s AMOLED screens are typically some of the best out there, and the S25 displays vibrant, rich colors, impressive contrast, and ample brightness for comfortable outdoor use. It’s also sharp with impressive viewing angles, making it a bit of a home run despite no huge upgrades over the S24.', 'Getting into some numbers, the 2340 x 1080 resolution means the S25 showcases around 416 pixels in every inch of screen, while the 2600 nits peak brightness is class-leading at the size. With a smooth 1-120Hz refresh rate, content glides, and when watching content back, Netflix HDR10 certification means it’s easy to take full advantage of the quality on offer.', '', 'The Galaxy S25 has three cameras around the back and one on the front, with the same sensor and lens specs as the Galaxy S24, S23, and S22 around the back:', '24mm wide camera: 50MP, 1/1.56-inch sensor with an f/1.8 lens and OIS.', '67mm telephoto camera: 10MP, 1/3.94-inch sensor with an f/2.4 lens and OIS.', '13mm ultra-wide camera: 12MP, 1/2.55-inch sensor with an f.2,2 lens.', '26mm front camera: 12MP, 1/3.2-inch sensor with an f/2.2, fixed-focus lens.', 'Samsung’s shooting modes are comprehensive, with fun options and more advanced features. This year, Samsung introduces LOG video, which captures up to 8K resolution, 30fps from the main camera, and 4K resolution, 60fps from the secondary cameras.', 'The Galaxy S25 also supports Expert RAW, which is like Pro mode, so it offers full manual control but takes advantage of the phone’s power to composite RAW images with greater dynamic range for even more flexibility in the edit.', '', 'Samsung has also improved the nighttime video capture on the S25, with each frame in the video being a composite of exposures made possible by the power in the Snapdragon 8 Elite.', '', 'The first point to get out of the way when it comes to S25 picture quality is that the primary camera is the clear champion, with both the ultra-wide and telephoto cameras being weaker.', 'As we enter an era of flagship phones with secondary cameras not dropping the ball, each holding its own when needed, the Galaxy S25 shows the series’ camera hardware hasn’t evolved to rival phones like the Google Pixel 9, Oppo Find X8, Vivo X200, and even Vivo’s upper midrange V Series, with the V40 Pro doing a solid job across its rear camera mix.', 'Despite secondary camera limitations, between 0.6-5x zoom, in bright environments, all three pull up a usable shot. Samsung’s photo processing has improved, and while it isn’t our favorite, it’s reliably good enough when the light is right, with healthy of shadow and highlight detail.', 'Samsung likes saturation and sharpening, but this can also detract from photos captured in low light, with artificial color introduced in a bid to zing up the shot. Specifically, the S25 tended to create purple tints in brightened shadows.', 'When zooming at 3x or beyond, the S25 will likely just be cropping into the primary camera. Samsung knows the 10MP, 3x zoom camera is very weak in all but the best lighting, so an in-sensor main camera crop is better most of the time. Indoors, therefore, we wouldn’t go beyond 3-4x zoom if we wanted shareable shots. Outdoors, however, AI kicks in to clean things up.', 'Galaxy S25 ultra-wide camera', '', '', '', 'It’s a shame the ultra-wide doesn’t feature autofocus. However, it does capture with a very wide field of view, and distortion isn’t excessive, which is handy.', 'At night, the S25 benefits from a powerful auto night mode. However, it can create muddy-looking shots when there’s mixed lighting or artificial light to contend with, though the main camera does the best job of countering this.', ""We were also underwhelmed with the portrait mode on the S25, which typically benefits from a quality zoom which is lacking on Samsung's phone. While results look respectable on first impression, with great edge detection, compared to portraits we took on some Oppo, OnePlus, Vivo, and Xiaomi phones, the S25 is weak when you pinch into shots, with mediocre lowlight results and weaker detail."", '', 'One highlight is video, especially from the main camera. In bright environments, footage looks great, and at night, exposure is significantly boosted, generating a fair amount of noise, but pulling out detail where other phones struggle. For enthusiasts, it’s easy to override this with the new LOG capture, giving video enthusiasts a great tool when they need more control over their footage.', 'While the camera of the Pixel 9 edges ahead of that of the S25, one area we can’t fault Samsung’s flagship is performance. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, it delivers notable performance improvements over last year’s chip, which translate into meaningful day-to-day benefits including less heat buildup, much better gaming performance and a longer-lasting battery. It’s head and shoulders above the Galaxy S24 in this respect, and the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro as well.', '', ""The S25 also gets 12GB RAM, just like the S25 Ultra, with storage options including 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. We wish Samsung started at 256GB without bumping up the starting price as 128GB isn’t enough for most users today – and that would make the phone more competitive – however, Apple and Google are also starting at 128GB, so let's see who makes the leap first."", 'Gaming performance on the S25 is noteworthy, just because of how thin and light the phone is. Yes, it gets warm, but you can play top-tier titles at high graphics settings without excessive frames being dropped. This is also likely down to the vapour chamber cooling the S25 gets over the S24, and with its flat sides and screen, it’s also very comfortable to hold in landscape orientation and game on.', 'The S25 runs Android 15 with One UI 7 and promises seven years of OS and security updates, matching Google’s Pixel 9 and 9 Pro. This is a great reason to buy the S25; however, the new Galaxy AI features probably aren’t.', '', 'Now Brief creates personalized AI-generated summaries of the weather, news, and notifications that get to know you more over time. In the two weeks we spent using the phone, the summaries didn’t go beyond recommending songs or playlists on Spotify or videos on YouTube.', 'Live translation and text-to-image drawing assist also join the party, along with all of Samsung’s existing AI features introduced on the Galaxy S24, including recording transcription and summary, image editing tools, plus Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini.', 'Thankfully, the core Samsung experience is smooth, customizable, and doesn’t rely on AI to sell the phone, given it’s nice to have more than a necessity at the moment.', 'One thing that isn’t just nice to have is great battery life, and the Galaxy S24’s modest 4000mAh cell surprised us with its excellent performance. Lasting a very comfortable day with 15-20% remaining by the end of a long day, this is one of a handful of compact powerhousees that won’t let you down.', '', 'While charging could be quicker at just 25W wired and 15W wireless because the battery isn’t huge, the phone powers up fully in around 75 minutes, which isn’t great, but it isn’t a dealbreaker. Samsung also offers a Qi2-style magnetic charging case for wireless power-ups. However, it’s a shame it doesn’t ship with one out of the box or, better still, include magnetic charging without a case.', 'While the camera is mostly good, seldom great, and occasionally bad, the rest of the Galaxy S25 experience is exceptional, helped in no small part by the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset', 'Day-to-day use, battery life, gaming performance, and heat management are improved, and the impressive display, customizable interface, and long-term future-proofing only help the S25’s case.', ""So, while on-paper upgrades may seem immaterial, for anyone looking for a compact, thin phone, you’ll be hard-pressed to find better than the S25. However, if you're happy compromising on slimness, you can get a better camera and more storage for the same or less than Samsung's charging."", '', 'The Google Pixel 9 is the obvious alternative to the S25. It’s the same price, has a better camera, and shares a similar compact form, though is chunkier. While its camera wins out for us, though, performance falls way behind for gaming, and with its weaker chipset, it’s also likely less future-proofed from a hardware point of view, even if the software promise matches that of Samsung.', 'If you don’t mind a bigger phone, the OnePlus 13’s cameras are much more competitive, its charging is much faster, and its also better for gaming given the extra room for heat dissipation. That said, OnePlus won’t match Samsung’s software support.', 'Alternatively, the Xiaomi 14 and upcoming Xiaomi 15 could be great options. More compact than the OnePlus 13, both phones feature Leica co-engineered cameras and a much better telephoto system.

Here’s how it works.', 'One phone that’s surprised me most this year is the OnePlus 13. The cameras are much improved, which allows it to ditch that stigma about OnePlus phones often underperforming. Yet, it faces its toughest challenge to date with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.', 'That’s why a 200 photo shootout with the Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13 is necessary in order to definitively say which is the best camera phone you can buy right now. In my previous 200 photo shootout between the Galaxy S24 Ultra and OnePlus 12, it was a one-sided affair win for Samsung.', 'Things have changed between the two, as they both get their usual year-over-year upgrades. For the OnePlus 13, it’s fashioned with a 50MP main shooter, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 32MP selfie cam. Two of its biggest areas of improvement are low light and telephoto, so it’ll be interesting to see how it stacks up against the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung’s flagship features a 200MP main camera, 50MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto, 50MP 5x telephoto, and a 12MP selfie.', 'In standard fashion, I take all the same photos with the two phones in hand and then go back to my computer to inspect their side-by-side differences on a monitor. That way, I can really pixel peep to see which of these best Android phone contenders produce the better photos.', 'Honestly, you can’t go wrong with either phone when you’re snapping up pics with their main cameras. There’s a lot to like about them in the first set of shots with the colorful sculpture by the train station.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s brighter, overall picture certainly stands out looking at the two side-by-side — more so when I look closer at the shadowed parts behind the sculpture as the bushes behind it are more exposed. However, you can argue that it looks a tad overexposed. In contrast, I’ll give the OnePlus 13 credit for matching it in the details department and having more contrast that makes the colors look more vibrant.', 'Due to its balanced exposure and deeper colors, I’ll give this one to the OnePlus 13.', 'Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.', 'Winner: OnePlus 13', 'Both ultrawide cameras have a field of view of 120-degrees. In more pictures than one, however, the Galaxy S25 Ultra appears to capture more of the scene. Regardless, they’re very close to one another in the first shots down by Bryant Park overlooking 6 Avenue.', 'When I zoom into parts of the photos, I can see there’s a little more definition to the details with the OnePlus 13. You can see it in the Whole Food Market sign and the brickwork with the building on the left. It’s a close call in my opinion, but it can go either way.', 'Winner: tie', 'Judging the photos above solely on their dynamic range performance, I notice that both phones do an exceptional job of boosting the shadows. However, the Galaxy S25 Ultra handles the highlights a smidge better by toning down the exposure to preserve the details there. You can see it in the first two sets of photos overlooking the frozen pond, as the sun peeking through the trees isn’t as blown out.', 'The OnePlus 13’s dynamic range is still really good, and in some cases, the stronger contrast look of its photos make them appealing to the eye. However, it struggles in neutralizing bright spots.', 'Winner: Galaxy S25 Ultra', 'Both phones clearly have an affinity for saturated colors. All colors of the produce in the first set prove this without a doubt, as they reproduce colors with deep saturation. I will admit that they make the photos pop to get my attention, but the thing that strikes me most is the red peppers on the top right shelf.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra has this odd purple hue to them, which is more apparent when I look at what the OnePlus 13 delivers with its shot. Apart from that, all the colors in the shot appear identical.', 'Winner: OnePlus 13', 'Considering how the OnePlus 13’s ultrawide camera caught my attention for getting a little more detail in the shot of 6th Avenue earlier, it really has a more profound effect when capturing macro photos.', 'In my experience, I can get a tiny bit closer to subjects with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but I much prefer the OnePlus 13’s better definition. If you look closely at the everything bagel I snapped in the first set of shots above, Samsung applies an over-sharpening effect that makes it look too overprocessed — whereas the OnePlus 13 delivers excellent details and definition without the need to over-sharpen.', 'Winner: OnePlus 13', 'Even though the OnePlus 13 has the wider selfie camera, it doesn’t come close to matching the richer, more detailed selfies from the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I shot the first set of selfies in a pretty shaded area in between two buildings, but while both phones overexpose the highlights to some degree, the OnePlus 13’s shot is much softer looking.', 'There’s substantially more definition from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, from my facial features down to the textures all around my jacket.', 'Winner: Galaxy S25 Ultra', 'I shot a bunch of portrait photos of my colleague above at 1x, 2x, and 3x zoom with their respective portrait modes. The nice thing about them is that I can shoot the shot first, then adjust the intensity of the background blur later on.', 'Each phone has its pros and cons, like how the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s shots are sharper with more definition in the details — but it struggles in handling strong light sources that result in the sign behind him coming out overexposed. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13 has softer looking results, which often looks smudgy in some areas, but its stronger contrast and balanced exposure make for pleasant shots.', 'Winner: tie', 'This is where it all gets interesting because on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra should have an advantage with its 3x and 5x optical zoom cameras — while the OnePlus 13 only has a single 3x telephoto. All of the zoom photos above were captured at 3x, 5x, and 30x to give you an idea of how they process images at each level.', 'I think the first three sets of images represent how each phone processes zoom photos. Starting with the 3x zoom shots of the water fountain, the Galaxy S25 Ultra shoots the shot at a slower shutter speed resulting in motion blur with the water splashes. The OnePlus 13 shoots at a faster shutter speed and really draws out a lot of detail.', 'Moving onto 5x zoom, this is where the OnePlus 13 begins to really process the image to best expose as much detail, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom shows its superiority in retaining more definition. However, it gets strange when moving up to 30x zoom. At first glance, it looks like the Galaxy S25 Ultra captures more definition in the stone, but zooming in more reveals an over-sharpening effect.', 'In other zoom shots, I notice that the OnePlus 13’s photos at 30x zoom hold up nicely — including words, which seem to get treated to more definition. Due to the fact that the OnePlus 13 has a 3x optical zoom, it’s quite impressive that it doesn’t lose out much detail against the Galaxy S25 Ultra.', 'Winner: OnePlus 13', 'Panoramas can be captured on either the main or ultrawide cameras with both phones, so that gives you the extra flexibility. One thing I notice shooting is that both phones tell me to slow down a lot when panning for these shots, so you want to do that to prevent patches from looking a bit blurred.', 'In general, I prefer the panoramas from the Galaxy S25 Ultra mainly because of how it casts a very even exposure throughout the shot. If you look towards the tree on the right that’s in front of the sun in the first set of shots, this area appears overblown with the OnePlus 13 — whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra fares a bit better. There’s also a stronger contrast throughout the scene with the Samsung.', 'Winner: Galaxy S25 Ultra', 'And finally, we come to my favorite part of any photo shoot out comparison — low light. Historically speaking, OnePlus phones have trailed Samsung in this particular area, but the worst part about it was how there was such a wide gap between them. This time it’s been narrowed by OnePlus.', 'I’m happy to report that the low light performance of the OnePlus 13 is the best I’ve seen in any OnePlus phone to date, but it’s still not good enough to overcome Samsung. While I do like how the OnePlus 13 produces a bright picture in the first set of shots of the street side scene, it’s afflicted with this strange greenish hue. It’s prevalent in just about every shot, too.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra does a much better job at reproducing the colors of the scene accurately. Furthermore, the over-sharpening effect does help to draw out some of the details — which make the signs on the building appear sharper.', 'Although, I will say that the OnePlus 13’s ultrawide camera delivers shockingly better details capture than the S25 Ultra. It’s especially noticeable with the shot of the tree in the middle of my backyard, as the details on the branches are much more visible.', 'Winner: Galaxy S25 Ultra', '', 'In my years of reviewing Samsung and OnePlus phones, this is the closest it’s ever been with their camera performances. Technically it comes out to a tie between these two best Android phone contenders, with each having their own strengths and weaknesses.', 'One thing I’ve learned in this Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus photo shootout is how image processing can make a difference. The OnePlus 13’s telephoto camera performance proves this because despite having a 3x optical zoom, the image processing is able to analyze the image so that details are drawn out.

Under heavy usage, I'd still end the day with 15 to 20 percent battery. The phone also supports 25W wireless charging with Qi 2.1 support."", ""The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a really good all-rounder Android flagship that you should buy if you're coming from a Galaxy S22 Ultra or an older iPhone. If you're someone with an S23 or S24 Ultra, I'd say you should hold on a bit longer. The phone delivers excellent performance, offers a beautiful display, a versatile set of cameras, a better design, and some usable AI features. It could definitely be a contender for the best smartphone of the year. And no, the new Galaxy AI features aren't enough to justify an upgrade."", ""In terms of alternatives, you could look at the OnePlus 13 (Review), iQOO 13 (Review), the Vivo X200 Pro (Review), Oppo Find X8 Pro (Review), or the Pixel 9 Pro XL (Review) from the Android stable. You'll get better performance and overall value from most of these phones, except the Google Pixel. The Vivo is also a better camera phone. All of these phones are also cheaper. On the Apple side, there's the iPhone 16 Pro Max (Review), which will offer more or less the same performance across the system and cameras. You could also get yourself a Galaxy S24 Ultra, which will now be cheaper."", '', '', ""For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.
