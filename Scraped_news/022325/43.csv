‘Captain America: Brave New World’ is a Step in the Right Direction for the MCU – Review,https://www.cinelinx.com/movie-news/movie-reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction-for-the-mcu-review/,"['We went to see the first big MCU film of the year, Captain America: Brave New World, and we have thoughts about it.', '*warning: minor plot spoilers below for Captain America: Brave New World', 'Things in the MCU haven’t exactly been smooth as of late, with more misses than hits depending on who you ask. However, Captain America: Brave New World looked like it had the potential to be at least a partial return to form for a cinematic universe that at one point could do very little wrong, or at least a step in the right direction.', 'Captain America: Brave New World', 'Director: Julius Onah', 'Studio: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures', 'Starring: Anthony Mackie, Danny Ramirez, Carl Lumbly, Xosha Roquemore, Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler, Tim Blake Nelson, Harrison Ford', 'Release Date: February 14, 2025', 'Captain America: Brave New World is set after the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and sees General Thaddeus Ross (now portrayed by Harrison Ford) assume the presidency of the United States. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) is firmly entrenched as the new Captain America with Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez) as his new wingman and would-be Falcon. Despite the reservations of many about someone of Ross’s temperament being in charge, things seem to be going well as a treaty about the ownership of Celestial Island (that big Celestial from Eternals) about to be signed.', 'But this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe; it’s never that easy.', 'First, let’s discuss the positives of this film, of which I found more than a few. The political thriller element of this story is well one. A large part of what makes this work is Harrison Ford’s performance as an older Ross who is trying desperately hard to bury his past missteps and move forward as a changed man. It could almost be argued that Ross has the makings of a tragic figure, as he is initially so blind to the consequences of his own actions that it nearly costs him everything. Ford’s acting helps sell the high stakes of what is going on, I’m not sure this part would’ve worked nearly so well without him.', 'Then there’s Celestial Island. I am happy beyond words that the MCU is finally acknowledging that a giant Celestial head and arm is now sticking up out of the Earth. It genuinely bothered me that none of the other MCU films were doing anything with this and I was afraid that this meant the events of the film were being swept under the rug. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case as not only does this new island take center stage in the film’s plot, it also introduces into MCU canon the very important element of adamantium. This is an addition to canon that was a long time coming and will surely come into play whenever the X-Men properly enter into the MCU as a whole (or at least that’s what I hope).', 'Another detail I enjoyed very much was the fight sequences with Sam as Captain America. Of course it was always awesome to see the vibranium shield used to great effect, but seeing how Sam combines the shield with his wings and his own fighting skills is just incredible. As much as Sam frets about not being a super soldier like Steve Rodgers was, I think this film more than proves that Sam is selling himself short and is more than up to the task.', 'Then there are the parts of the film that didn’t connect so well. These aren’t necessarily deal breakers, as hardly any films can be called “perfect,” but these things could certainly have been done better.', 'The biggest issue with I have with Captain America: Brave New World is how the last act is structured. Well, it might be better to say what initially feels like the last act. Because at one point everything comes together and it feels like an event teased for the entire film is finally about to happen and bring the plot to a head. And then it just….stops. Were it not for the teasers making it absolutely clear that the Red Hulk makes an appearance, I would’ve thought the film was ending. And maybe that was the intention of the filmmakers, but in that case they shouldn’t have marketed the Red Hulk so heavily and saved that moment as a total surprise.', 'Because of how it actually plays out, the actual final act comes across as somewhat uneven and not quite as impactful as it could’ve been. The fight scene that results is still impressive, but it could’ve been better.', '', 'Then there’s the film’s connections to The Incredible Hulk. Technically I know there’s nothing wrong in tying back to this film as it is also part of the MCU. That being said, the film also came out seventeen years ago and I think this unintentionally creates a problem as if you haven’t seen that film at all, or haven’t seen it recently, then some of this film’s reveals aren’t going to land particularly well. Maybe that’s a danger of having a sprawling story as long running as the MCU, it starts to become impossible to keep track of all the characters that might show up.', 'Despite these flaws, I found Captain America: Brave New World to be completely enjoyable. Some of the political elements are a bit too on the nose given current real-life circumstances, but the rest of the story makes up for that. Sometimes it’s nice to have a Marvel film that just focuses on investigation and straight out fighting the bad guys. If you go in with an open mind, you’ll find plenty to enjoy in this story.']"

On its ninth day, the film collected Rs 1.20 crore, bringing its total earnings to Rs 21.20 crore. While the weekend boost helped improve Friday numbers (Rs 0.80 crore), the film’s overall trajectory remains disappointing due to a lack of word of mouth and sluggish momentum.', 'A key reason for the film’s lackluster response has been the absence of Chris Evans, whose portrayal of Steve Rogers played a crucial role in shaping the Captain America franchise. Anthony Mackie’s transition into the titular role as Sam Wilson has not generated the same level of excitement, leaving longtime fans hesitant. Additionally, superhero fatigue appears to be setting in among Indian audiences, with recent Marvel releases struggling to make an impact at the box office.', 'Adding to its struggles, Brave New World continues to face tough competition from Chhaava, the historical drama that has resonated deeply with Indian audiences.

The aforementioned “Deadpool,” “Black Panther” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” are examples of record-setting movies in normally sleepy February.', '“We tend to focus on records a little too much at times, just because that was the norm pre-pandemic,” Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder and owner of Box Office Theory, told CNN. “But at the same time, I think we’re seeing a year-to-year increase in terms of Presidents’ Day weekends.”', 'Hollywood usually starts the year off slowly as studios usually wait until May to release their most commercially viable movies. The overall box office is up 22% compared to last year, due in part to the SAG-AFTRA strike that disrupted the 2024 release calendar, according to Dergarabedian.', '“Captain America” is one of two major releases slated to debut in the first quarter, Loria noted. The other is Disney’s “Snow White,” which is set for March 21.', '“We’ve seen a lot of family movies in particular do well lately, and that’s a very important sign of health for movie theaters and for the box office,” Robbins said.', 'Robbins noted that Disney will release three Marvel films in 2025, which could improve the brand’s reputation and give a boost to theaters. Along with “Captain America,” “Thunderbolts” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” are set to open in May and July, respectively.', '“When you have a robust slate of films from Disney, particularly Marvel movies, that is money in the bank for the theatrical industry,” Dergarabedian said.', 'The overall domestic box office reached $8.7 billion in 2024, down 3.4% from 2023. Loria projects full-year ticket sales in 2025 could reach at least $9.3 billion or as much as $9.7 billion, the highest post-pandemic total.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Though it did earn a lot less than the more-beloved Iron Man at $585 million worldwide.

Here’s how it works.', 'I love the Captain America movies. In fact, some may view this next statement as blasphemy (Batsphemy?), but I honestly think the Captain America trilogy is better than the Dark Knight trilogy.', 'I know, I know. Like I said, blasphemy. But, I’ve always just felt that these movies were always the strongest films in the entire MCU catalogue. Now, with Captain America: Brave New World currently in theaters (which our very own Eric Eisenberg had a thing or two to say about in his review), I thought that this was as good a time as any to re-evaluate the films and rank them.', 'Because honestly, what’s more American than hopping online and ranking things so that people can get upset and call you an idiot? It’s right up there with apple pie, baseball, and being in credit card debt. So, without further ado, here are all four Captain America movies, ranked.', '', 'Captain America: The First Avenger was the perfect Cap movie…for its time! Now, don’t get me wrong. I greatly admire the first MCU Captain America flick, and it was a bold choice to make it a period piece.', 'However, as my colleague, Alexandra Ramos, said when she rewatched every phase of the MCU, she determined that Phase 1 was the weakest of the bunch, and I tend to agree (even though, I do have a soft spot for the first Thor movie).', 'The issue is that it really does feel dated when compared with the later Captain America films. In this movie, we see Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) go from a weakling with a big heart, to a big man with an even bigger heart (because of the Super Soldier Serum, you see).', 'We also get introduced to fan favorite character Bucky Barnes BEFORE he becomes the Winter Soldier, and through a fun series of scenes, we see Cap become the hero that the country needed during World War II.', 'Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News', 'Not only that, but we also get an excellent villain in Hugo Weaving’s portrayal of Red Skull. In every way, The First Avenger is a great set-up for what would eventually come later.', 'But, that’s just it. It’s impossible to rewatch this movie and not think about all of the greatness that is still yet to come in the MCU. So, it’s a phenomenal entry point for the character, but one that feels a bit modest in comparison to what would come later.', '', 'Yes, I’m well aware. Captain America: Brave New World is the lowest rated film in the Captain America series, receiving an outright “rotten score” on the aggregate site, Rotten Tomatoes. I also know that the film went through some big reshoots over the long course of its production, and that what we got may not have been the movie that we were supposed to get.', 'BE THAT AS IT MAY, I still really enjoyed my time watching Brave New World, and I think it’s a great addition to the franchise, in the same way that I think Toy Story 4 is a great addition to that franchise.', 'In other words, did this movie truly need to be made? Maybe, maybe not. Would it have been better if the series had just ended as a trilogy? I’m going to say almost definitely. But, for what it’s worth, Brave New World still feels like a welcome addition to a series of films that were already pretty damn excellent. And you know what? That ain’t bad.', ""In this fourth entry, which follows the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, we get Sam Wilson with the new title of Captain America.

Maybe I’m a bit biased since I just like the fact that Cap chose Sam over Bucky, but, as a whole, this is my third favorite Captain America movie, which is no small feat given how much I like the first film.', '', 'Often glibly referred to as Avengers 2.5, Captain America: Civil War truly is as bombastic as you could possibly get.', 'In this film, Cap defends his friend, Bucky, who is still seen as an international threat, and forms an alliance with other superheroes to essentially remain independent contractors. Tony Stark, on the other hand, understands the dangers that might occur due to their powers, and decides to align with the government. This forms a rift between the two sides, and thus, the eponymous “Civil War” begins.', 'Though it might seem small today, this was the movie that first introduced both Black Panther and Spider-Man to the MCU. While The First Avenger feels old now in 2025, Civil War still manages to feel fresh with just how they introduced those aforementioned characters.', 'Also, the subject matter still feels as relevant now as ever. Do you side with Cap and believe that those with power should be allowed to use it however they see fit, as long as they are fighting for the common good?', 'Or, do you side with Iron Man and think that utmost power should be kept in check, especially given the collateral damage that could occur whenever these super-powered beings throw down? Honestly, whichever side you pick, it probably also aligns with your political beliefs, which is an interesting litmus test to be sure. Either way, Civil War is a smart, energetic, emotional movie, and it would be the best Cap flick if not for one other film.', '', 'Come on now. You knew this had to be number one.', 'Often considered one of the best (if not the best) MCU movies of all time, Captain America: The Winter Soldier pretty much flipped the script on superhero films much in the same way that The Dark Knight did.', 'That’s because this is a movie that feels more like an espionage film with superheroes, rather than a superhero movie with some espionage thrown in (which is kind of what the latest movie feels like, but beggars for fun Marvel movies can’t be choosers).', 'In this film, Captain America is hunted by a new villain, only for him to learn that it’s his best friend, Bucky, back from the dead, and brainwashed. Most of the film is Cap trying to figure out why this has occurred, only to learn that the nefarious organization Hydra has its tentacles everywhere.', 'This, for me, was the film that truly made me fall in love with the MCU and its limitless possibilities. In fact, this was a great one-two punch, as Guardians of the Galaxy, which also expanded what the MCU could be, was released after this.', 'But, in every way, The Winter Soldier just feels like the perfect Captain America film. Cap is at the very center of it, so it’s not held up by its period piece setting, nor does it act as a centerpiece for all of the other Avengers. It’s deeply personal since it deals with his thought-to-be-dead best friend, Bucky, and the action is just so brutally intense, it gives me goosebumps. Not only that, but the political intrigue is done right, and it just all comes together immaculately. Yep, The Winter Soldier is the best Cap movie, and I’m pretty sure nothing will ever surpass it.', 'But, those are just my picks for the best Captain America movies. What are yours?', 'Rich is a Jersey boy, through and through. He graduated from Rutgers University (Go, R.U.!), and thinks the Garden State is the best state in the country.

But alas, money needs to be made, and Disney chose the opposite for its little cash-printing machine. It over-saturated the market with spinoffs and shoehorned television shows onto its streaming service that nobody asked for, leading less to “superhero burnout” and more to just bad storytelling. ', 'Buckling under its own swollen carcass, every Marvel movie now needs a 10-minute intro to catch up on all the exposition. It eats into the first acts like a parasite, leaving “Captain America: Brave New World” rotten at its core. It is the antithesis of what made the early-era Marvel films so fantastic, that despite the grandiose action, there was deep grounding that made these heroes human.', 'Marvel built its reputation on empowering young, hot, upcoming directors to use their superheroes as the vessel to tell their stories. Now, the films feel like they are written, directed, and acted by 11th graders. Even pretentious college film students would have at least tried to put fresh creative ideas in there, as trite as they may have been. They’re throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks; casting Harrison Ford as Red Hulk feels like an especially desperate grasp. It’s just so … inconsequential. Ford will never appear in another Marvel movie, and his appearance here is just another ploy in the new tactic of attacking the international markets. ', 'Never have I seen an American film that is so nakedly made for the international box office. It’s a script without a three-syllable word, and the humor that used to be charming is now cringe-worthy. But I think that’s the point. It’s not supposed to be funny; replacing the quippy one-liners of yesteryear’s “Iron Man” franchise are easily digestible lines designed to fit neatly into subtitles on the bottom of the screen.', 'About halfway through this two-legged dog of a film, as I tried to figure out how anybody could put their name on something so disgustingly generic, it dawned on me that this couldn’t be some sort of accident. It is meant to be formulaic; it is directed to be as easy to follow as possible. Banal offerings such as these may underwhelm American audiences but rake in massive amounts of money overseas.

Sound familiar? It’s reminiscent of Captain America: Civil War, where peace deals orchestrated by Ross also fall apart, resulting in global conflict.

This doesn’t make Captain America: Brave New World a bad movie, but it does raise the question of why it exists if the film was going to play it safe with plot devices audiences have seen before.

Perhaps this was deliberate on the part of director Julius Onah, as many people (myself included) are “superheroed out,” and this was the perfect way to slowly reel those of us in this category back in.', ""You only see Captain America in his suit a handful of times, and the action scenes are quite minimal compared to other Marvel films, which is certainly a departure from what I'm used to. What surprised me the most, however, was the depth of the acting showcased in this film. I know some comic/MCU enthusiasts might disagree with me here, but Brave New World has a serious case for being the most well-acted in the entire universe."", 'I’m not kidding, this is a brilliantly acted film, which should come as no surprise when you see the names involved: Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito, Carl Lumbly and, of course, Anthony Mackie, who plays the titular Sam Wilson, aka Captain America. There’s plenty of drama, twists and turns and even tears (genuinely believable tears, at that) as Captain America investigates a global conspiracy surrounding President Thaddeus Ross (Ford) in the attempt to clear the name of his longterm mentor who gets caught in the middle.', 'If you’ve been wondering whether or not you should go to the theater to see Brave New World, I highly recommend doing so. You may find yourself enjoying it way more than you expected.', 'YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE OSCARS', 'Stay up-to-date on every entertainment story by subscribing to our mailing list here.', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
