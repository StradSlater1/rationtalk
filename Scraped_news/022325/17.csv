Their Time Is Up,https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/bibas-children-israel-gaza,"['', '', 'ABED RAHIM KHATIB/PICTURE-ALLIANCE/DPA/AP IMAGES', 'Grief means little. Rage matters even less. All that we have now are the cold, unfeeling facts: Kfir Bibas, the baby smiling sweetly at us in the photograph, holding his pink elephant, was taken violently from his home, together with his mother Shiri and his four-year-old brother, Ariel. They were held in Gaza and eventually murdered. We may never know the details of their ordeal, but we know plenty about their tormentors. For nearly eighteen months, we’ve been collecting forensic evidence about the specimens who live in Gaza. What do we know about them? The question matters. A lot. In fact, no other does, particularly as Israel and the United States are trying to ascertain how to proceed now that the first round of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas is nearing its end.', 'What do we know, then?', 'We know the numbers: A large-scale survey of Gazans, conducted by researchers from Oxford University and published in Foreign Affairs just last week, showed that whereas only 36% of Gazans supported Hamas prior to October 7, 2023, the number spiked to well over a half in March 2024, and began to decline only when Israel successfully eliminated Yahya Sinwar in October of last year. Which should come as no surprise considering the fact that 98% of those surveyed described themselves as religious, and nearly as many said they saw the conflict with Israel in religious, not political terms: The Jews were usurpers who must be banished. How? When asked, 47% said they wanted to see Israel destroyed and replaced with a strict Islamic state governed by Sharia law, and 20% said they would settle merely for the forced removal of all Jews and their transfer to wherever it was their ancestors had lived prior to immigrating to Israel. The moderates, 17% of them, said they would be alright merely with embracing the Palestinian right of return, a kinder, gentler way to end the Jewish state.', 'Justice meant not only reversing Haman’s evil decree but forcing all those who were only too eager to partake in the slaughter to face the consequences of their actions.', 'And we know the stories: Many of the Israeli hostages who return tell variations of the same tale, of being held captive by ordinary families, abused and tormented not by bearded zealots with guns but by mothers and fathers and daughters and sons. Liri Albag, for example, the brave IDF soldier who was released in January, was enslaved by one such family, which did not allow her to shower for 37 days and, witnessing her growing faint with hunger, ridiculed her and refused to let her eat any of the food she was forced to cook for her captors.', 'Such gleeful cruelty has no parallel in the civilized world. Sure, war is hell, and combat rarely concludes without a handful of shocking aberrations. A soldier may crack and do the unthinkable. A rocket might miss its mark, snuffing out innocent lives. That is all too regrettable, and all but unavoidable. But that is not what is happening in Gaza. The footage of a dead Jewish baby returning home to Israel for burial compels us to tell the truth: The assertion that most, or even many, Gazans are innocents hijacked by their tyrannical leaders is a polite fiction. There are certainly some somewhere in the strip, the very young and the very frail included, who neither partook in nor condone the atrocities of the past 18 months, but they should no more redeem Gaza’s genocidal enterprise than the hypothetical ten good men of Sodom and Gomorrah could the cities of the plain.', 'Like Abraham, our shared Patriarch, we, too, struggled to find the righteous among the wicked. We hoped that the Palestinians of Gaza will show something of the courage we had seen in Syria, Tunisia, or Libya and stand up to their maniacal overlords. No protest materialized, and support for the tyrants grew the more adept they proved at slaughtering the Jews. We hoped for a Palestinian Oskar Schindler, one righteous man or woman who would stand up to Hamas as righteous men and women stood up to the far mightier Nazis and say that no cause or ideology justified the brutal murder of an infant. None came forth. We offered large monetary rewards and safe passage to anyone delivering any information about our hostages; hatred spoke louder than self-interest and cash. Israel’s neighbors to the south had all the opportunities anyone could reasonably ask for to resist, repent, recalculate course. And at every turn, they returned to the singular idea that gives them life and meaning: Kill the Jews, all of them, gleefully.', 'If we didn’t understand all of this before, we ought to now that we are burying two dead children. And the lesson we must learn is simple. It comes down to one word: enough.', 'Enough with the sophistry about international laws and human rights. The crucibles in which these ideas were forged, raging with the fires of century-old conflicts, have now cooled down and crumbled. To pretend as if we must now take seriously a torrent of treaties long after the framework guaranteeing their efficacy—if such a framework ever existed in earnest—is sheer lunacy. We’ve seen the United Nations. We’ve seen the International Court of Justice. We’ve seen the Red Cross. To take any of these decrepit and callous concubines of evildoers seriously is not an option any morally or intellectually serious person should ever entertain.', 'Enough also with the insufferable ululations about Jewish morality and its arc which somehow always bends towards having mercy on the monsters who devour our children. As my dear friend and teacher Rabbi Meir Soloveichik noted in a celebrated article more than two decades ago, hate, too, is a Jewish virtue. The very next holiday on the Jewish calendar, in fact, Purim, is a celebration of the time, long ago, when Jews arose and dispensed with 75,000 of their pursuers, realizing that justice meant not only reversing Haman’s evil decree but forcing all those who were only too eager to partake in the slaughter to face the consequences of their actions. Like them, we, too, are fighting millions of little Hamans, murderous marauders who will grow emboldened the more we offer them mercy.', 'Which brings us back to earth, to the realm of the real, the practical, and the political. President Trump’s proposal to empty Gaza of its inhabitants is, if we’re honest, more merciful than any Gazan deserves, offering the savages who heard Kfir Bibas sob without showing a shred of basic human decency the one thing that precious baby will never have—a chance of a good and peaceful life elsewhere. Nevertheless, we must embrace this proposal, because at its heart is the one true and inescapable sentiment: Israelis can no longer be expected to live in proximity to those who desire nothing more than their death.', 'Negotiating with some other Palestinian group won’t do: The PLO, the PFLP, et al are merely a different shade of murderous. Nor is there much value to the fantasy that the same patient reeducation that cleansed so many Germans of the Nazi inflammation might work in Gaza, too. Gazans aren’t, as some Pollyannish accounts would have us believe, long-suffering innocents who had the misfortune of living through decades of Hamas indoctrination; they’re faithful adherents of a stern interpretation of a still-young religion who believe there is glory in putting the enemies of God to the sword. We can, and should, respect their fierce heart. We can, and must, insist that their hands be nowhere near our necks.', 'Sadly, Israel is showing a growing lack of resolve which is no longer possible to ignore or explain away as some clever bit of tactical genius. Is it possible that Bibi Netanyahu is playing a very long game of five-dimensional chess with the world, holding out on the real prize, which is smiting the regime in Iran? Maybe! But meanwhile, closer to home, nothing is done. A few days ago, a very wise friend wrote to share this startling thought: for the past 18 months, we’ve all listened to Israel’s best and brightest, including Netanyahu himself, go on the sort of podcasts beloved by the self-appointed best and brightest of the American Jewish community, saying that if only they had the proper American support, they would’ve waged a very different war against Hamas.', 'Now, American support is manifest. Now, an American president possessing uncommon moral clarity and candor is advocating for the opening of the gates of hell. And rather than live up to a year of tough talk, Israel equivocates, looking weak, wounded, and confused. Those exploding beepers were a marvel. The killing of Nasrallah was a thing of beauty. But you don’t win wars and secure the peace with a sprinkling of daring commando acts or a dash of excellent air raids. You win wars and secure the peace by making your enemy realize that they had lost, and in the Middle East, as anyone who has ever consulted a history book could tell you, that means only one thing: seizing land.', 'Israel, then, must annex Judea and Samaria right now, if only to appear as certain of its right to its ancestral homeland as, say, Senator Tom Cotton. It must enthusiastically advocate for Trump’s plan, or some other arrangement that leaves Gaza empty of Gazans. It must take one long look at Kfir Bibas’ coffin and realize precisely what happens when evil is met with too many clever arguments and not enough swift deeds.', 'Liel Leibovitz is editor-at-large for Tablet Magazine and the host of its weekly podcast, Rootless, and its daily Talmud podcast Take One.', '']"

We call on our organizational partners in the fight for a more just world to stand with us in condemning Hamas — because in a moment that demands moral clarity, silence is not an option.', '“The refusal of so many to call Hamas what it is — a terrorist organization — or to hold them accountable for their atrocities is a profound moral disgrace. If we cannot see this through the suffering of the Bibas family, then we have lost any claim to moral clarity.', '“After the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012 where 20 elementary-aged children were killed, someone tweeted about gun violence in America, saying, ‘Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.’', '“That sentiment — that a society’s response to the slaughter of its most vulnerable reveals its moral collapse — feels painfully relevant again.', '“Kfir Bibas was just 8 ½ months old, a baby who loved to laugh. His big brother, Ariel, was four, a redheaded child who adored Batman. They were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 and held hostage — and ultimately killed — by Hamas for the crime of being Jewish. Their murder, the parading of their coffins in Gaza alongside cheers, and the psychological torture of their mother’s body not being returned as negotiated, has been met with excuses, justifications, and silence instead of the unequivocal condemnation Hamas deserves. This signals something chilling — that the world has once again decided Jewish lives are bearable losses. ', '“If your first thought is, ‘but what about…’ then you’ve missed the point. As a historically marginalized people, facing antisemitism at levels not seen in generations, Jews must be able to speak about being targeted by a terrorist organization that seeks to murder all of us — without being told to center someone else’s pain. Our hearts are big enough to hold multiple truths. We know that suffering is intertwined. We know that the pursuit of justice for one oppressed group strengthens justice for all. But in this moment of profound loss, we must be allowed to grieve, to name what is happening to our people, and to demand the world see it too.', '“Yesterday was a tragic day for Israelis and Jewish people everywhere. It should have been a tragic day for the world.', '“National Council of Jewish Women exists to build a world where all women, children, and families can thrive. We will not be deterred in our efforts. ', '“We mourn Kfir Bibas, Ariel Bibas, and Oded Lifshitz. We mourn for the nameless Palestinian woman that was returned instead of Shiri Bibas. We mourn all Israelis and Palestinians killed since October 7th.', '“We unequivocally condemn Hamas for its unspeakable acts of violence and psychological warfare, which continue to haunt the Jewish people every day. We unequivocally condemn those making excuses for a terrorist organization whose sole mission is to eradicate Jews around the world. We demand the return of Shiri Bibas immediately. ', '“With the actions taken this week, Hamas has violated the terms of the negotiated hostage and ceasefire deal. We hope all those who called for a ceasefire — and all those who engage internationally — will now both call out Hamas specifically for standing in the way of a future with peace, and share their profound sadness for the murder of Jewish children in their hands.', '“May the memories of Kfir Bibas, Ariel Bibas, and Oded Lifshitz be for a blessing. May Shiri Bibas and all the hostages be returned immediately.”', '###', 'National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) is the oldest Jewish feminist civil rights organization working for equity and justice for women, children, and families in the United States and Israel.

But integrity compels us to say what is true anyway.', 'Hamas’s lies about the Bibas family were shocking even by Hamas standards. Shiri and her two sons Ariel and Kfir were taken from their homes on Oct. 7, 2023 when Ariel was 4 and Kfir was less than a year old. Throughout the war, Hamas claimed they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Yarden, Shiri’s husband and the kids’ father, was also taken hostage but held separately from his family. Hamas taunted him repeatedly, once even on camera for a propaganda video, about his family’s fate. Yarden was released this month.', 'Yesterday, Hamas returned the bodies of Ariel and Kfir and a third hostage, Oded Lifshitz, as well as a body they claimed was Shiri but turned out to have been a random unidentified Palestinian woman.', 'That wasn’t the only surprise revealed during Israel’s forensic examination of the bodies. The boys were not killed in an Israeli airstrike; they were murdered by their Palestinian captors, who strangled the children with their bare hands and then mutilated their bodies in order to try and obfuscate their cause of death.', 'The claim that the Bibases were killed in an IDF airstrike was believable enough—and therefore was widely believed. Even if that had been true, it wouldn’t have mitigated Hamas’s responsibility one iota. But since much of the world, from media to governments to activist organizations, was looking for any excuse to absolve Hamas and the Palestinians and to cast Israel’s counteroffensive as overly aggressive and counterproductive to boot, its underlying assumptions were accepted and repeated and shaped debate over the war even within Israel itself. And since Israel and the U.S. are democracies, public debate shapes war policy and outcomes as well.', 'In this way, Hamas has stage managed the war to an unprecedented degree.', 'It’s not as though we hadn’t caught Hamas in lies throughout the war, of course. After all, there are two kinds of Hamas statements: lies that have been exposed and lies that have yet to be exposed.', 'There are the big lies worth briefly recounting but which are by no means all of them. Hamas managed to get pretty much every major newspaper and network to double the actual numbers of civilian casualties (there were about 25,000 all considered) and inflated the overall casualty figures. Not only was there no genocide in Gaza, there wasn’t even disproportionate collateral damage.', 'Hamas and its NGO mouthpieces got the world to repeat the threat of looming famine, and the International Criminal Court put out a warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrest on conclusively debunked charges of intentional starvation. (It turned out that Hamas, however, was intentionally starving Israeli hostages.)', 'Early on, Hamas blamed Israel for an explosion at a hospital in Gaza and claimed hundreds were killed. By the time it became clear that a Palestinian rocket was to blame, mob protests against Israel and the U.S. broke out across the world and President Biden’s meetings with Arab leaders were canceled.', 'Hamas has also lied about hostages, announcing the deaths of captives who were still alive. In one case, the terror group forced a female captive to participate in the staging of her own death.', 'Those big lies spawned a thousand little lies. But the point is that reporting on the conflict, which led to weapons embargoes by allies against Israel, was based on lies every step of the way. If you got your news from the New York Times or the Washington Post or the BBC or any number of others, you followed an entirely different war—one that didn’t happen.', 'The only way to have your outlet publish a factual accounting of the conflict is by assuming every statement by Hamas is a lie until definitively proved otherwise.

Our examination found no evidence of injuries caused by (a) bombing,” Chen Kugel, director of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine said in a video statement.\nShiri Bibas and her sons were seized by militants on October 7, 2023 during the attack by Hamas on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.\nShiri’s husband and the father of the two boys, Yarden Bibas, had also been abducted but was released alive earlier this month.\nSince their abduction, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel who was then aged four, and Kfir, then only nine months, had become symbols of Israel’s hostage ordeal.\nOn Thursday, Hamas handed over four bodies, saying they were of Shiri Bibas, her two young sons, and an elderly hostage.\nWhile the remains of her two sons and the elderly hostage were identified positively, Israeli authorities said the fourth body was not that of Shiri Bibas, sparking anger and grief across the country.\nBut on Friday, Hamas — which blamed a possible “mix-up” of bodies — handed over new remains to the Red Cross, which were later identified to be that of Shiri Bibas.\nHamas has long insisted that an Israeli air strike killed Bibas and her sons early in the war.\nHowever, the Israeli military asserts instead that they were killed by militants and even said that the two children were killed in “cold blood.”\n“Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood. The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys — they killed them with their bare hands,” military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement on Friday.\n“Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities,” he added.\nThe Bibas family described the deaths of the three hostages as murder, but asked that the manner of the death not be shared publicly.\n“The family has not received any such details from official sources,” it said in a statement earlier on Saturday.\n“The family requests to cease adding details regarding the fact that Shiri and the children were murdered by their captors.\n“Yarden and the family want the world to know this was murder, without delving into any specifics,” it said.\nOn Saturday, Hamas reiterated that the

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convenes a security consultation later on Saturday.\n“Once the security consultation concludes, a decision will be made regarding the next steps” of the

The group has been fighting the country’s military for about two years.\nThe ministry said in a statement the disease killed 58 people and sickened 1,293 others between Thursday and Saturday in Kosti, 420 kilometers (261 miles) south of the capital, Khartoum.\nThe ministry said it has taken a series of measures to fight the outbreak, including launching a vaccination campaign against cholera in the city, which lies on the west bank of the White Nile River, opposite Rabak, the capital of White Nile province.\nThe ministry said it also expanded the capacity of an isolation center in cooperation with the United Nations and other international medical groups.\nDoctors without Borders said its cholera treatment center in the Kosti hospital has been overwhelmed, prompting health authorities to use adult and pediatric emergency rooms to provide additional space to treat stricken patients.\n“The situation is really alarming and is about to get out of control,” said Dr. Francis Layoo Ocan, the group’s medical coordinator in Kosti. “We’ve run out of space, and we are now admitting patients in an open area and treating them on the floor because there are not enough beds.”\nThe group said the White Nile River is the most likely source of infection in the city, as many families have been bringing water from it using donkey carts following a major power outage in the area.\nLocal authorities banned residents from collecting water from the river and reinforced chlorination in the water distribution system, said MSF, the abbreviation for the French name of the group, Medecins Sans Frontieres.\nThe disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others in Sudan between July and October last year, mostly in the country’s eastern areas where millions of people displaced by the conflict were located. Another major outbreak in 2017 left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months.\nCholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and can be fatal if not immediately treated, according to the World Health Organization. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.\nSudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country.\nThe fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. They amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.\nThe war in Sudan has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people — about 30 percent of the population — from their homes, according to the UN An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"
