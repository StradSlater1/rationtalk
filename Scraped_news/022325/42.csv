That being said, there are some similarities between the two.', 'The spinoff series — which premiered on Sunday, February 23 — introduced fans to Stephen Amell’s Ted Black, a hotshot lawyer who has his own firm in Los Angeles and, apparently, some secrets that have yet to be revealed.', 'Bryan Greenberg also stars as Rick Dodsen, who appears to be Amell’s right-hand man at first glance. However, a little deeper into the premiere, a (spoiler alert) betrayal reveals that Lex Scott Davis, playing the role of Erica Rollins, is No. 2 in the firm.', 'Sunday’s episode also revealed that, before relocating to L.A., Amell’s character had a law career in New York City. This, coincidentally, is where one major Suits connection comes in, by the name of Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht).', '', '“You’ll notice behind my desk that there’s a picture of a young Ted Black with what can only be a young Harvey Specter so there’s clearly a history between the characters,” Amell teased to Entertainment Weekly in December 2024. “We came up together in the D.A.’s office.”', 'While Macht isn’t reprising his role as Harvey just yet, there’s something to look forward to. In the meantime, keep scrolling for a breakdown of similarities between Suits and Suits LA:', 'The original Suits had Patrick J. Adams and Macht starring as Mike and Harvey, respectively. They created a powerhouse legal team (even though one wasn’t really a lawyer, which isn’t quite relevant here.)', 'Initially, Suits LA seems like it’s gearing up to make Amell’s Ted and Greenberg’s Rick take over in the male dynamic duo department. However, after said aforementioned betrayal, the coworker relationship to watch out for is clearly between Ted and Davis’ Erica. She even alluded to it in the episode by saying that she’s picking Ted’s side “seven days a week and twice on Sunday.”', 'No character in TV history will ever, repeat: ever, replace Sarah Rafferty’s spitfire secretary character of Donna Paulsen from the original Suits. However, Azita Ghanizada does come in at a close second as Ted’s secretary, Roslyn.', 'While not many details about Roslyn were shared in the premiere, it seems she’s been around for a while, especially when she alludes to having knowledge of Ted’s family drama.', 'It’s no secret to Suits viewers that Harvey has basketballs signed by NBA players in his office. While it doesn’t seem like Ted has any sports memorabilia in his office, the character does appear to have an affinity for the New York Yankees.', 'Not to mention, there’s also that Patrick Mahomes reference in the premiere. (“It’s the fourth quarter and you need a touchdown. You go with Kirk Cousins or Patrick Mahomes, who’s it gonna be?”)', 'It’s apparent early on in the premiere that Rachelle Goulding would be making multiple appearances as Ted’s past love interest Samantha. While it’s unclear what went down between them (something major, it seems) there should be more scenes of them together in the coming episodes.', 'When it comes to past love interests who keep coming back, the obvious comparison is Abigail Spencer, who made several appearances as Dana Scott in the original Suits.', 'Ted’s dad is dying in the premiere, but he’s having none of it. He does go visit his ailing father (Matt Letscher), but there’s no warm and fuzzy reunion.', 'There are still a lot of questions to be answered, of course, but it seems a lot of their tension stems from the relationship Ted’s father had with his late son (Ted’s older brother), Eddie (Carson A. Egan). Not to mention, Ted drops that his dad was “convicted,” so it seems like he wasn’t around too much.', 'Similarly, in the original Suits, Harvey had some family issues that needed tons of unpacking as well.

There’s little doubt that nature fans will deservedly eat it up. (An entire series could be made about those resilient raccoons living in Central Park on the outskirts of a metropolis.)', 'An animal of an even more familiar variety — species: spinoff — anchors NBC’s new lineup, with the heavily promoted premiere of Suits LA, which owes its existence to the original USA Network series’ unexpected renaissance on Netflix (with the added zing of a cast member marrying into a certain royal family). The tailored wardrobe is as spiffy as ever in the “blue sky” setting of Los Angeles and the corporate towers of Century City, where entertainment lawyers and other slick attorneys ply their trade. It’s the storytelling that feels a bit threadbare and second-hand.', 'Stephen Amell (Arrow) makes his overdue major-network leading-man debut, swaggering in style as Ted Black, a former New York federal prosecutor who left under a cloud of tragedy and has spent the last 15 years building a lucrative business with his boutique Black Lane firm, repping (so we’re told) high-profile Hollywood types. He woos a prospective client described as Warner Bros. newest action star by boasting, “I took on the worst mobs in New York. I beat all of them, I did it without batting an eye.” He goes on to declare, “I can walk away from any deal at any time — which is where the power in this world comes from.”', 'Sounds like someone who needs to be taken down a peg or three, no? Which is exactly what happens in a pilot episode filled with betrayals and back-stabbings, all of which might have had more impact if we had a better idea of the people inhabiting these designer duds. (Flashbacks, which quickly become a staple of the series, help flesh out Ted’s and others’ backstories, which tend to be more compelling than the present-day intrigue.)', 'As his best friend/criminal lawyer Stuart and earnest protégé Rick, The Walking Dead‘s Josh McDermitt and One Tree Hill alum Bryan Greenberg are sidelined too soon by a major plot twist that turns Ted from L.A.’s top dog to underdog. Lex Scott Davis embodies the least enviable role, as Erica, Rick’s competition for head of the firm’s entertainment department, despite the absurd fact that she has no apparent grasp of film or TV history. It’s revealed she is even clueless about Cheers. On an NBC series? For shame.', 'Lacking the fake-lawyer hook that made the original Suits stand out, Suits LA tries to conjure drama by depicting Ted making a reluctant pivot to a type of law he despises, with Kevin Weisman (Alias) his exasperatingly sketchy client. Effective cameos by real-life celebs, including the late John Amos (in a poignant cameo) and The Office‘s Brian Baumgartner as versions of themselves, suggest the series might have been better suited, so to speak, if it had stayed true to the creator’s original intent of building a series around Hollywood agents.', 'SEEDS OF INTRIGUE: Green thumbs are muddied by the sticky fingers of scandal in Grosse Pointe Garden Society, an enjoyably seriocomic melodrama that gives off Big Little Lies vibes from the opening scene, when four members of a hoity-toity Michigan garden club frantically bury a body under the moonlight. But whose is it?', 'That’s the sudsy premise, as the baroque plotting seeded with gardening metaphors gives each of the main characters an adversary worth putting six feet under. The newcomer to the group, wacky and narcissistic Birdie (Brooklyn Nine-Nine‘s Melissa Fumero), is a camp bouquet of ridiculous excess, upsetting the natural balance established by winsome schoolteacher Alice (AnnaSophia Robb), her divorced best friend Brett (Ben Rappaport), and high-end realtor Catherine (Aja Naomi King).', 'They’re unlikely conspirators in a messy cover-up that, if exposed, could cause them ruin in their snooty suburb.

The show made a comeback when it was added to Netflix in 2023 (especially since it starred Meghan Markle), which prompted creator Aaron Korsch to develop a new legal drama set in the same universe, Suits L.A. ', 'Well, the brand-new NBC series has finally arrived, and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by the first episode. Not only did Suits L.A. pay tribute to the original series, but it also offered a fresh perspective and new twists that will surely please fans.', 'There are three reasons why I loved the first episode of Suits L.A. First of all, it has the same feel as the original Suits. There’s fast-paced dialogue that requires 100 percent of your attention. Each episode focuses on a multitude of cases, in addition to the personal and professional relationships between each attorney. ', 'Secondly, the characters are different, but they’re kinda the same. There’s a Harvey Specter-like male lead, Ted Black (Stephen Amell), along with a Mike Ross-like underdog, Rick Dodsen (Bryan Greenberg). There’s a badass Scottie-inspired attorney, Erica Rollins (Lex Scott Davis). And of course, there’s a quirky yet intimidating lawyer named Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt) who is awfully similar to Louis Litt.', 'And lastly, Suits L.A. builds upon the original premise with new twists that make it feel exciting. I won’t give too much away, but the first episode has multiple surprises I didn’t see coming. Plus, the flashbacks provide a mystery element that leaves me wanting more. (Don’t even get me started on that twist at the end of the first episode.)', 'It’s safe to say I’ll be tuning into every episode of Suits L.A. when they air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.

Only this time, it’s on broadcast television.', 'Aaron Korsh, creator of the original “Suits” as well as spinoffs “Pearson” and “Suits LA,” knew that this new iteration not only had to surpass sky-high expectations from fans, it also faced adjusting its tone and storytelling approach for its new home at NBC.', '“Broadcast is a different approach to making television. It definitely has some advantages in that you get a wider audience,” the showrunner told TheWrap. “The cons are that we can’t use the language that we used to use… We’re limited on the number of iconic ‘Suits’ goddamns we can have.”', 'Korsh said that, after some back and forth with standards and practices, he got to keep three goddamns for Episode 1 — “but if we had a ‘Jesus Christ’ then that counted as a goddamn.” But a win is a win for the Los Angeles-set spinoff series, which centers around Ted Black (Stephen Amell) and his team of lawyers mixing elements of entertainment and criminal law.', 'The first episode introduced a clash of titans between Ted and his longtime partner Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt) who, as a merger loomed with another firm run by Ted’s ex Samantha (Rachelle Goulding), decided leave Ted out of the deal and take most of the firm with him instead. That included Ted’s mentee Rick Dodsen (Bryan Greenberg), who surprised Ted by joining the other side after he rejected Rick’s request to be promoted to head of entertainment law.', 'But Ted was not left completely alone. Rick’s rival Erica Rollins (Lex Scott Davis) chose to stay loyal to her boss and landed the coveted promotion. Concurrently, Ted was haunted by a troubled past in New York, where he worked as a criminal prosecutor.', 'The chaos gave Korsh and the creative team the chance to push the boundaries even further, when in a moment of frustration Ted talked about his desire to bring down the “mother—” who betrayed him.', '“The way the rules work is he has to stop himself, he cannot form the F with his mouth, even if you take the sound out,” Korsh said. “It’s a new set of rules.”', 'Though fans know “Suits LA” will welcome original series star Gabriel Macht to reprise his role as Harvey Specter sometime in Season 1, the pilot episode let the show stand on its own by keeping the focus on Ted and the Southern California lawyers in his orbit. But Korsh and team did sneak a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment alluding to the show’s connection to the overall “Suits” franchise.', 'Midway through the episode, Ted holds a meeting in his office at the firm. As the scene plays out, the background is blurred, hinting at the vast view of the city. But atop a table behind Ted’s desk sat a framed photo that was noticeably not blurred. We don’t get a close-up of the photo, but it does look like one featured on the “Suits LA” trailer, which shows Ted and Harvey together as Ted talks about how they were longtime friends back in New York.', '“If you pay attention, you’ll see it, and if you don’t, you won’t,” Korsh said. “I was positive that if you put something like that in, fans are going to find it… they pour over this stuff.', '“But now that they’ve been running the promos and actually holding the picture and showing it, I think fans are going to see it all the more,” he added.', 'Korsh wouldn’t share details on when Macht will begin his three episode recurring arc, but teased that Harvey is not the only original series character who will make an appearance for a crossover.', '“I don’t want it to just be a parade of old ‘Suits’ stars.

As the series premieres, its reception highlights a contrast between the new show and its predecessor.', 'Suits LA has received mostly negative reviews from critics, indicating a poor reception.', 'Many critics raised concerns about the show’s lack of originality, with Matt Roush (TV Insider) stating, “The tailored wardrobe is as spiffy as ever in the ‘blue sky’ setting of Los Angeles… It’s the storytelling that feels a bit threadbare and second-hand.” Lyvie Scott (TV Guide) further noted, “Suits LA can’t reconcile the new, lowered expectations of the TV medium with the show it wants to be, and that sabotages any genuine attempts to keep the franchise alive.”', 'Several other critics also pointed out issues with the show’s structure and execution. Cristina Escobar (RogerEbert.com) remarked, “This is a show that asks you to please turn off your brain before viewing and let the whole thing wash over you like a warm bath.”', 'Adrian Horton (Guardian) compared it unfavorably to other spin-offs, stating, “Like Frasier, How I Met Your Father, and the Gossip Girl 2.0 before it, the new Suits is an echo of the original that neither embodies enough of its ethos to satisfy nor sufficiently differentiates itself to stand alone.”', 'Even critics who acknowledged some positive aspects of the show had reservations.

‘Suits LA’ Review: Stephen Amell’s West Coast Spinoff Gets Lost in a Rough Start,https://www.thewrap.com/suits-la-review-stephen-amell-nbc/,"['Creator Aaron Korsh follows the cable and streaming sensation with a legal drama that overpacks on plot and sidelines humor', 'Hot off the heels of the unexpected “Suits” resurgence of summer 2023, the latest spinoff of the 2011 USA Network series is upon us, forcing us to remember what it was that we liked about “Suits” in the first place.', 'Unfortunately, the answer to that question is not found in the first episode of “Suits LA.” It’s also not found in the other two episodes sent to critics for review, though they do get closer to the feeling of the original show. “Suits” creator Aaron Korsh spent the past year and a half riding the original’s streaming success right into “Suits LA,” which he also created — and maybe he rode a little too far and got lost in the plot along the way, giving us a show that’s both too much and not enough at the same time.', 'Born from a pilot originally unrelated to the “Suits” universe,“Suits LA” stars Stephen Amell as a Los Angeles lawyer dealing with too many things for one pilot to handle. He’s considering a merger alongside his best friend who might also be a rival, which means he also has to second guess all of his employees and their loyalties. He’s also having nightmares about an old case that ended in an explosion that killed a man named Billy and somehow relates to his lawyer father, whom he hates and who is dying and who did something that endangered Ted’s brother Eddie. In the present day, Ted is trying to sign a young action movie star and has to represent a producer who may or may not have killed his business partner. There are assistants wanting to be promoted and Ted’s ex who works at a rival firm and entertainment lawyers who don’t know anything about entertainment, and all of this is explored in Episode 1.', 'At least half a season of plot twists, betrayals and flashbacks happen in just the pilot and by the time it ends, there are a million answers to questions viewers haven’t had time to ask, but nothing to really hang on to other than the show’s own confidence that it’s doing something great.', 'In Episodes 2 and 3, there are glimmers of what “Suits LA” could become. The problem is that it insists on holding on to Ted’s past traumas to the detriment of what’s actually going on with the suits. We’ve seen daddy issues before. We’ve seen Stephen Amell act out daddy issues before as Oliver Queen. We don’t know this daddy well enough to care about him, but maybe we could if the show would just slow down for a second and not try to force feed us a tragic backstory that explains why the lead jerk is such a jerk.', 'Amell, who spent years on “Arrow” as a brooding recovering bad boy with too much weight on his shoulders, makes complete sense for Ted, an ambitious man with buried emotions who acts quick and doesn’t mince words. The problem is that the show is asking him to conjure some unearned pain right off the bat, before there’s anything else to know about his character. Couldn’t we have seen this guy in action for at least an episode before digging into why he hates his father? Couldn’t we have seen him and his best friend be best friends before ripping them apart? Couldn’t Amell have been given better dialogue than, “You play a badass in the movies. I’m a badass in real life?”', 'The original “Suits” also moved fast, but there was more to it than that. There was a simple-ish premise that allowed the show to thrive in the fast lane: a successful and charming attorney hires a conman college dropout with a photographic memory but no law degree, and they both have to work cases while also keeping that secret. “Suits LA” doesn’t have that driving force. There’s no built in bromance or established community because most of the relationships get blown up in the pilot. These are just lawyers in Los Angeles, and they talk and move real fast with no real place to go other than to therapy.', 'There are glimmers of something here, beyond the flashbacks and beyond Ted in general. Lex Scott Davis plays Erica Rollins, an associate who we are told has a prickly personality but who appears to just be a good lawyer navigating an irritating workplace. The standout scenes in the first three episodes involve her and her assistant Leah (Alice Lee). Erica has now been put in charge of the firm’s entertainment division, and while she knows actors and writers and producers, she doesn’t really watch movies or TV. Leah, however, is a fan of everything, and they’re able to put their heads together to satisfy clients like Brian Baumgartner, who plays himself.', 'These scenes, which also feature Patton Oswalt playing himself, are sort of a strange experiment in “Entourage”-style fake reality and take you out of the world of the show immediately, but it’s fun to watch Erica and Leah try to deal with the sort of problems that plague working actors. It’s like a window into what the show could be once it sheds all the backstory weighing it down and figures out its version of Hollywood. Entertainment lawyers have to deal with enough surrealism in their daily cases that there’s already a show there, all the extra fluff is unnecessary. Just say Ted is a former justice department attorney who now negotiates nudity clauses and billing orders, all the other drama could have come later.', 'Of course, “Suits” was a one-of-a-kind cultural phenomenon for many reasons, including some beyond anyone’s control. It was a product of USA Network’s blue skies era, when quick-witted problem solvers quickly and wittily solved problems on cable every weeknight from 2005 to 2016. It was the time of “Monk,” “Psych,” “White Collar,” “Burn Notice” and crown jewel “Suits,” which outlasted all the rest and didn’t end until 2019. USA then pivoted to wrestling and reality shows, and TV generally seemed to get a lot more cynical as more and more main characters needed tragedy to justify their personalities.', '“Suits” also gained notoriety in 2016 when Meghan Markle, who played paralegal Rachel Zane, suddenly found herself in every headline as Prince Harry’s new and serious girlfriend. She got attention, the show got attention and Rachel’s onscreen love story with Mike (Patrick J. Adams) became a much bigger deal. Markle left the show at the end of the seventh season when Rachel and Mike got married, which meant Mike had to leave too. Every future appearance of Mike or mention of Rachel got headlines through the end of the series, allowing the show to remain popular despite its flagging quality.

"‘Suits LA’ Review: Stephen Amell Flounders in NBC’s Tonally Confused, Narratively Jumbled Legal Drama",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/suits-la-review-stephen-amell-nbc-1236142299/,"['', '', ""Billed as a spinoff of the beloved USA Network dramedy, the series centers on a former federal prosecutor from New York who's pivoted to practicing entertainment law in California."", 'BY ANGIE HAN', '', 'By its third episode, NBC’s Suits LA has gotten itself somewhere in the ballpark of what you’d expect from a series called Suits LA. There’s a blandly attractive ensemble trading dutifully quippy banter. There are storylines about professional rivals and potential office couples, maneuvering around difficult clients and unsympathetic judges. There are many establishing shots of the CAA building in Century City, recognizable to anyone in Los Angeles adjacent to “the industry.”  ', 'Sure, it might not be fun or fizzy enough yet to replace Original Flavor Suits in anyone’s heart. And no, no one from Suits has appeared yet to explain what one show has to do with the other. But you can see how it’s trying to get there, and even how it eventually might. All in all, there are worse ways for a spinoff to start.', '', 'The problem, of course, is that it’s not the start. It is, as I said, the third episode. This might seem like a nitpicky distinction for a series that NBC is clearly hoping will run for years to come. But it matters because the actual premiere is so awful, and in such baffling ways, that it’s hard to imagine a lot of would-be fans sticking around to find out if it gets better.', 'When I say the pilot is bad, I don’t just mean on the usual grounds, like bland dialogue or underwritten characters. I mean it’s misguided in respects that make you wonder how any of this came to be. Its single most laughable choice is a high-key bonkers, low-key offensive twist that I am forbidden to reveal here. But there’s plenty of stuff I can talk about that doesn’t work, either.', 'Let’s start with the protagonist. Ted (an uncharacteristically flat Stephen Amell) is an entertainment lawyer who spends all his time screaming at friends and colleagues, treating his clients like idiot pawns and generally coming across like a walking, talking tantrum. In Ted’s defense, he has tragic psychological reasons for being this way, as painstakingly detailed over way too many flashbacks to 2010, when he was a federal prosecutor taking down mobsters in New York. Not in Ted’s defense, those explanations do not make him any more interesting. Suffice it to say that some men would rather blow up their careers, alienate all their loved ones and move across the country than go to therapy about their daddy issues.', '', 'In any case, none of the other characters seem much to mind. To the contrary, everyone in the pilot treats him like the sun they must all orbit around — whether it’s the sweet younger brother (Carson A. Egan) who has no inner life beyond worshipping Ted, the less senior lawyers jockeying for his approval, or actor John Amos, playing himself as a client who’s unhappy with the firm’s services but nevertheless very happy to offer Ted sage counsel about his dad problems. It’s one thing for a show to center itself around a prickly, arrogant, self-centered antihero. It’s another, far more frustrating thing for it to insist that said antihero is really a great guy worthy of your reflexive adoration.', 'That the pilot does include a few moments of recognizably Suits-ian levity — like some flirty repartee between Ted and a cheeky pro bono attorney played by Maggie Grace — only makes it feel more perplexing, and more overstuffed. It’s as if creator Aaron Korsh turned in a gritty drama about a hotshot lawyer trying to take down the East Coast mafia, and NBC decided at the very last minute to tack on a few extra scenes to repackage it as a Suits spinoff.', 'Thankfully, the next two outings represent significant improvements, assuming the goal actually is to deliver a plausible extension of the Suits-iverse. The second hour is still heavy on Ted, who is very conflicted about taking up a criminal defense case when his ex-prosecutor instinct is to assume anyone who needs a criminal defense attorney is inherently guilty. But the B-plot, about rival lawyers Rick (Bryan Greenberg) and Erica (Lex Scott Davis) competing for the business of an on-the-rise starlet (Victoria Justice), displays a welcome lightness of spirit. If the experience of watching the episode feels like channel-flipping between two totally unrelated programs, it’s still nice to get the occasional break from Ted’s glowering.', '', 'The third — the one mentioned at the top of this review, and the last sent to critics — shifts the balance even further. Now it’s mostly a breezy dramedy about showbiz-centric legal wrangling, which only occasionally dips into a leaden drama about Ted’s past and present angst. It still has lots of room for improvement. Aside from hotheaded Ted and maybe Davis’ coolly ambitious Erica, almost none of the characters have distinctive personalities. Some don’t even have their own look; Ted’s ex Samantha (Rachelle Goulding), his assistant Roslyn (Azita Ghavizada) and district attorney Elizabeth (Sofia Pernas) are all interchangeably gorgeous brunettes with a taste for body-con office wear and a soft spot for Ted.', 'But of the three totally different versions of this show presented thus far, this one is the most broadly appealing. We get the beginnings of what looks like a cute odd-couple friendship between elegant Erica and quirky junior lawyer Leah (Alice Lee), and even some intriguing insight into Ted’s complicated history with his best frenemy, the gloriously bearded Stuart (Josh McDermitt). The storylines also become more playful, and more entertainment-specific — one involves Brian Baumgartner, best known for playing Kevin Malone on The Office, deciding he’s tired of being best known for playing Kevin Malone on The Office and demanding his lawyers introduce him to other celebrity clients who can help.', 'Again, had this been Suits LA’s first episode, I’d have deemed it rough but not unappealing. I’d have said there were sparks of potential in the cast, that a Hollywood-based Suits extension sounded like a slam-dunk idea, that it certainly deserved more time to keep growing into the best version of itself.', '', 'But this wasn’t a fresh start. It was a slightly more successful third try, from a show whose first two indicated a serious identity crisis. And while Ted may have an uncanny knack for getting people to give him another chance, I’m inclined to think I’ve given him enough already. Maybe this series will break free of Ted’s gloom eventually, and find its way toward the clear blue skies that its title suggests it should have been chasing all along. But by then, I can’t imagine I’ll still be watching.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"

‘Suits: L.A.’ Review: NBC Spinoff Is a Bad Fit for Fans and Newcomers,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/suits-la-review-suits-spinoff-bad-1235097637/,"['', 'Despite the above photograph, Ted Black is not a happy man. The lead of “Suits L.A.,” played by former “Arrow” and “Heels” star Stephen Amell, isn’t where he wants to be in his career. He isn’t where he wants to be on this planet, either, and he’s lost just about every person he loves. One of the few remaining positives in his life is upended before the pilot comes to a close, pushing poor Ted that much further into misery.', 'To be clear, Ted is not poor. He’s very well-off, if not outright wealthy, considering he’s a formidable attorney operating out of L.A.’s ‘luxe Culver City neighborhood. At the very least, he’s got enough money to feel comfortable, and that comfort should be indulged from time to time. Tell a few jokes. Go out for a couple of beers. Catch a Lakers game. Perhaps Ted isn’t enjoying what he can out of life because, when we’re first introduced, he’s thrust into crisis management mode. But even after the overcooked pilot finishes burning bridges, Ted can’t be bothered to build them back up.', '', 'This angry lone wolf routine stands in stark contrast to the original “Suits,” a product of USA Network’s “blue sky” era, where shows like “White Collar” and “Burn Notice” kept the mood light and the good times rolling. Problems would arise, sure, but they tended to be nuisances more often than nightmares, and the melodrama, while rooted in characters and their relationships, was also exactly that: mellow.', '“Suits” fit the mold. Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) and Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) are paired up in the pilot, via a platonic meet-cute where the former accidentally lands a job at the latter’s elite law firm, despite lacking a law degree. The two strangers become tied at the hip by their shared secret — Mike needs a job to support his grandmother’s medical bills, and Harvey needs Mike because he’s impressed with his moxie or something. It doesn’t really matter, because “Suits” isn’t meant to be realistic or serious or even all that dramatic; it’s meant to be fun.', '“Suits L.A.” is not fun. It’s not realistic either, but that doesn’t stop it from being superfluously dramatic and super-duper serious. For reasons I’m prohibited from disclosing at this time, its central dynamic — and the only one with clear potential moving forward — turns “Suits L.A.” into a bizarro version of “Suits,” which is kind of intriguing from the outside looking in. (Why would NBC commission this spinoff of “Suits”?) But in practice, “Suits L.A.” proves as alienating as the original series was inviting.', '', 'Mainly, I blame Ted. Yes, the dialogue is stilted and almost exclusively exposition. Sure, the supporting cast is as bland as a Dodger Dog and the stages as prosaic as Dodger Stadium. But a solid central character can get you to look past all that, and Ted is too one-note, too unpleasant, and too damn angry to encourage our investment.', '“Suits L.A.” tries to balance Ted’s anger by occasionally casting him as a sad boi — evoking our pity by adding to his adversities. After getting blindsided and nearly losing all his clients, Ted is forced to become what must feel unthinkable to a former federal prosecutor: a defense attorney. Tack that onto a painful break-up and more spoiler-y misfortunes, and it makes sense why Ted might not be the sunniest guy in the city.', '(The clearest sign of just how messed up Ted is arrives by accident. Midway through the second episode, it’s revealed the born-and-bred New York Knicks fan has convinced himself to root for the Lakers. And no, he’s not doing it for business reasons. He’s not sitting courtside to woo clients. He claims Kobe Bryant converted him and, with all due respect to Black Mamba, that’s the stupidest reason I’ve ever heard. Tell me: Do New Yorkers tend to switch sides when their team is routinely bested by an archrival’s elite talent? They do? Oh, great. In that case, I can’t wait to see Madison Square Garden filled with Jayson Tatum jerseys.)', '', 'Clearly, this man is unwell, but he’s not unwell in a way that sparks curiosity. Ted is unwell in a way that can’t be fixed by a steady stream of flashbacks. His past isn’t all that interesting, even if it portrays the life he prefers, and even if that life eventually becomes the one he bothers to build in his new city. That would be a different show, with a different Ted, on a different network, at a different time. It might be the one you want, and it might even be the one you felt like you were promised in the title, but despite L.A.’s perpetually sunny skies, “Suits L.A.” can’t escape Ted’s pitch-black clouds.', '“Suits: L.A.” premieres Sunday, February 23 at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.

"‘Suits LA’ Review: Stephen Amell Flounders in NBC’s Tonally Confused, Narratively Jumbled Legal Drama",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/suits-la-review-stephen-amell-225205253.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'By its third episode, NBC’s Suits LA has gotten itself somewhere in the ballpark of what you’d expect from a series called Suits LA. There’s a blandly attractive ensemble trading dutifully quippy banter. There are storylines about professional rivals and potential office couples, maneuvering around difficult clients and unsympathetic judges. There are many establishing shots of the CAA building in Century City, recognizable to anyone in Los Angeles adjacent to “the industry.”', 'Sure, it might not be fun or fizzy enough yet to replace Original Flavor Suits in anyone’s heart. And no, no one from Suits has appeared yet to explain what one show has to do with the other. But you can see how it’s trying to get there, and even how it eventually might. All in all, there are worse ways for a spinoff to start.', 'More from The Hollywood Reporter', ""'Suits' Creator on Bringing Back Harvey Specter for 'Suits LA,' With More Original Stars Likely to Return"", ""'Suits LA': What to Expect From the Spinoff (and Remember From 'Suits')"", ""Gina Torres on '9-1-1: Lone Star' Series Finale's Twist Ending and Her One 'Suits' Request"", 'The problem, of course, is that it’s not the start. It is, as I said, the third episode. This might seem like a nitpicky distinction for a series that NBC is clearly hoping will run for years to come. But it matters because the actual premiere is so awful, and in such baffling ways, that it’s hard to imagine a lot of would-be fans sticking around to find out if it gets better.', 'When I say the pilot is bad, I don’t just mean on the usual grounds, like bland dialogue or underwritten characters. I mean it’s misguided in respects that make you wonder how any of this came to be. Its single most laughable choice is a high-key bonkers, low-key offensive twist that I am forbidden to reveal here. But there’s plenty of stuff I can talk about that doesn’t work, either.', 'Let’s start with the protagonist. Ted (an uncharacteristically flat Stephen Amell) is an entertainment lawyer who spends all his time screaming at friends and colleagues, treating his clients like idiot pawns and generally coming across like a walking, talking tantrum. In Ted’s defense, he has tragic psychological reasons for being this way, as painstakingly detailed over way too many flashbacks to 2010, when he was a federal prosecutor taking down mobsters in New York. Not in Ted’s defense, those explanations do not make him any more interesting. Suffice it to say that some men would rather blow up their careers, alienate all their loved ones and move across the country than go to therapy about their daddy issues.', 'In any case, none of the other characters seem much to mind. To the contrary, everyone in the pilot treats him like the sun they must all orbit around — whether it’s the sweet younger brother (Carson A. Egan) who has no inner life beyond worshipping Ted, the less senior lawyers jockeying for his approval, or actor John Amos, playing himself as a client who’s unhappy with the firm’s services but nevertheless very happy to offer Ted sage counsel about his dad problems. It’s one thing for a show to center itself around a prickly, arrogant, self-centered antihero. It’s another, far more frustrating thing for it to insist that said antihero is really a great guy worthy of your reflexive adoration.', 'That the pilot does include a few moments of recognizably Suits-ian levity — like some flirty repartee between Ted and a cheeky pro bono attorney played by Maggie Grace — only makes it feel more perplexing, and more overstuffed. It’s as if creator Aaron Korsh turned in a gritty drama about a hotshot lawyer trying to take down the East Coast mafia, and NBC decided at the very last minute to tack on a few extra scenes to repackage it as a Suits spinoff.', 'Thankfully, the next two outings represent significant improvements, assuming the goal actually is to deliver a plausible extension of the Suits-iverse. The second hour is still heavy on Ted, who is very conflicted about taking up a criminal defense case when his ex-prosecutor instinct is to assume anyone who needs a criminal defense attorney is inherently guilty. But the B-plot, about rival lawyers Rick (Bryan Greenberg) and Erica (Lex Scott Davis) competing for the business of an on-the-rise starlet (Victoria Justice), displays a welcome lightness of spirit. If the experience of watching the episode feels like channel-flipping between two totally unrelated programs, it’s still nice to get the occasional break from Ted’s glowering.', 'The third — the one mentioned at the top of this review, and the last sent to critics — shifts the balance even further. Now it’s mostly a breezy dramedy about showbiz-centric legal wrangling, which only occasionally dips into a leaden drama about Ted’s past and present angst. It still has lots of room for improvement. Aside from hotheaded Ted and maybe Davis’ coolly ambitious Erica, almost none of the characters have distinctive personalities. Some don’t even have their own look; Ted’s ex Samantha (Rachelle Goulding), his assistant Roslyn (Azita Ghavizada) and district attorney Elizabeth (Sofia Pernas) are all interchangeably gorgeous brunettes with a taste for body-con office wear and a soft spot for Ted.', 'But of the three totally different versions of this show presented thus far, this one is the most broadly appealing. We get the beginnings of what looks like a cute odd-couple friendship between elegant Erica and quirky junior lawyer Leah (Alice Lee), and even some intriguing insight into Ted’s complicated history with his best frenemy, the gloriously bearded Stuart (Josh McDermitt). The storylines also become more playful, and more entertainment-specific — one involves Brian Baumgartner, best known for playing Kevin Malone on The Office, deciding he’s tired of being best known for playing Kevin Malone on The Office and demanding his lawyers introduce him to other celebrity clients who can help.', 'Again, had this been Suits LA’s first episode, I’d have deemed it rough but not unappealing. I’d have said there were sparks of potential in the cast, that a Hollywood-based Suits extension sounded like a slam-dunk idea, that it certainly deserved more time to keep growing into the best version of itself.', 'But this wasn’t a fresh start. It was a slightly more successful third try, from a show whose first two indicated a serious identity crisis. And while Ted may have an uncanny knack for getting people to give him another chance, I’m inclined to think I’ve given him enough already. Maybe this series will break free of Ted’s gloom eventually, and find its way toward the clear blue skies that its title suggests it should have been chasing all along. But by then, I can’t imagine I’ll still be watching.', 'Best of The Hollywood Reporter', ""'Yellowstone' and the Sprawling Dutton Family Tree, Explained"", ""A 'Star Wars' Timeline: All the Movies and TV Shows in the Franchise"", ""What the 'House of the Dragon' Cast Starred in Before the 'Game of Thrones' Spinoff"", ""Sign up for THR's Newsletter.

Gabriel Macht on Why Returning as Harvey Specter in ‘Suits LA’ Was the ‘Right Thing’ to Do: ‘I Did Think About the Fans’,https://www.aol.com/gabriel-macht-why-returning-harvey-001851591.html,"['Advertisement', '', '', '“Suits LA” arrives on Feb. 23, just six weeks after the devastating wildfires that destroyed much of the Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Initially, the series was only going to be set in Los Angeles, with production taking place in Vancouver. That’s where the pilot was shot in August. Then, the series received a tax credit from the state of California, and production relocated to L.A.', 'At the Feb. 20 blue-carpet premiere, the cast and creatives behind the highly-anticipated “Suits” spinoff celebrated the show’s move to L.A.', 'More from Variety', ""'Suits LA' Should Be Held In Contempt: TV Review"", ""'1923' Cast Says the Show Confronts Racism Against Indigenous People Because 'We Need to Acknowledge That It Happened'"", ""'Suits LA' and Boss Suit Up for Spin-Off Premiere With a West Coast-Inspired Workwear Collection"", '“We film at the northeast corner of the Universal lot,” star Stephen Amell told Variety. “There’s an entrance that’s right by where we film. And it’s the faster way for me to get to work. I don’t go that way. I enter off Lankershim at Gate 4, and I drive from one end of the lot all the way to the other, because I want to appreciate working here. I want to appreciate the history of this lot.”', '“I remember coming to Universal Studios when I was 10 years old,” star Bryan Greenberg said. “And I wanted to be an actor. Now, I’m here every day. It’s like … the coolest.”', 'Creator Aaron Korsh said that after the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, paired with the wildfires that struck just as the series was getting the season’s production off the ground, working in Los Angeles has been “very emotional.” When writing each episode, he tries to work in real L.A. locations to flesh out the city as a character. The characters’ law offices are in Century City. In one episode, they go to Hollywood’s famed Musso and Frank.', '“I always think of it as what place would serve the scene the best,” Korsh said. “If you think like that, you will get iconic places just naturally in the course of doing it. And then you’ll also get places that maybe aren’t as iconic, but show L.A. in a different light.”', 'Amell plays attorney Ted Black in “Suits LA.” His firm concentrates on criminal and entertainment law, and they often end up representing real-life celebrities. The late John Amos appears as himself in an episode, and Patton Oswalt portrays an exaggerated version of himself in another.', '“[The show’s] celebrating how crazy this town is,” Oswalt said. “There’s a lot of weirdness in this town that you do fall in love with … They don’t shy away from that.”', 'Star Josh McDermitt, whose character Stuart Lane heads the firm with Black, said that the series also highlights the “salt of the Earth” people that inhabit Los Angeles.', '“This show features a lot of people who are just really amazing people in their heart,” McDermitt said. “They’re very generous, community driven. They like to take action, even though L.A. has the reputation of being flighty. Look at the look at what’s happening with the wildfires. Everybody came together immediately. [The show] is a love letter to Los Angeles.”', '“There’s a big initiative to get people working, which is great for the crew, Teamsters, craft services, for everybody,” said Kevin Weisman, who portrays a powerful film executive who is the catalyst for the show’s season arc.', '“We need to celebrate that production is back. We need to get our city working,” said Azita Ghanizada, who plays Black’s no-nonsense secretary Roslyn. “We need to get our city back to its golden age … I hope it inspires every showrunner [and] studio executive to fight to get tax cast credits.”', 'Korsh promised that fans of the original series will not be disappointed.', '“The rhythms and the style of the writing and the storytelling are going to be the same,” Korsh said. “It doesn’t mean it’s exactly the same. Obviously it’s different characters, different place, but the sensibility of the show has a lot of overlap with the original, and I think people will find that comforting.”', 'Kristen Hager, who recurs on the series as Valerie Thompson, said that the original “Suits” was one of her comfort shows.', '“I really appreciated the escape, [and it] was still witty and entertaining, but it is a world that lacks true malice. It’s a world I needed at that moment and really enjoyed,” Hager said.', 'Lex Scott Davis, who joins the cast as lawyer Erica Rollins, said she hadn’t seen the series prior to landing her audition, but quickly became a fan.', '“I binged the whole first season when I should have been learning my lines for my audition,” Scott Davis said. “I’m stepping into a massive universe … and I’m going to take it seriously.”', 'Characters from the original series will be making appearances on the spinoff, including original series star Gabriel Macht – set for a three-episode stint as Harvey Specter. Macht has not yet filmed his scenes, so will appear later in the season, and it took some convincing to bring him on board.', '“It was a ‘let me think about it.’ Let me see if it makes sense for where I’m at creatively. What other creative things are going on and what is the story? What are the stories that we’re telling?” Match saiad. “I did think about the fans, and that was ultimately the reason I turned around and said, ‘You know what? I think it’s maybe the right thing. I wanted to support the launch of this show.’”', 'Macht was coy when previewing how Specter will figure into the split.', '“I can tell you that there’s some flashbacks. There’s a relationship that Harvey and Ted had in the D.A. ‘s office. And I can tell you that they’re cut from the same [cloth], and they have a deep friendship. They look out for each other,” he said.', 'Korsh promised that at least one additional character would make a surprise appearance this season. Who that will be, however, remains a mystery.', '“You can lay your money on Meghan [Markle] if you want to,” Korsh chuckled.', 'Best of Variety', 'New Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week ', 'Grammy Predictions, From Beyoncé to Kendrick Lamar: Who Will Win?

To maintain a link to the original series, creator Aaron Korsh — who was behind both projects — looked at who he could bring back from his previous cast, and “Ted was a prosecutor in New York, Harvey was a prosecutor in New York, so it seemed like a perfect fit.”', '', 'Korsh reconnected with Macht when he and Patrick J. Adams shot a Suits-inspired Super Bowl ad for T-Mobile in 2024, and took a leap of faith when putting together the spinoff. “When we shot the pilot, we put a picture of him in the pilot without me having discussed it with Gabriel. I knew we could always take it out if he didn’t want to do it, but it would be harder to put back in,” Korsh told The Hollywood Reporter at the show’s L.A premiere on Thursday. “So we did it and when we got a [series] pickup I called Gabriel and just asked him if he wanted to come play and he graciously said yes.”', 'Macht said that for fans of the original series, “if they can let go of that cast and welcome a new cast, there’s so many similarities and enough differences that people are going to be like alright, I can get into this,” adding that “what Aaron’s done with inviting me back is I think it does open up opportunities for other original cast members to come in and out and play and have little Easter eggs.”', 'Korsh echoed the same strategy, noting he “wanted to make sure it was an organic bringing people in, not just a parade of old characters.” With that being said, “I would love to have them all on, [but] I don’t want to have them all on one after the other because I think it harms the original and the new show to do that.

"“Suits: LA” Is Dumb, Glossy Nothingness",https://www.rogerebert.com/streaming/suits-la-spinoff-tv-review-2025,"['TV/Streaming', '', '“Suits: LA” is dumb. This is a show where one character tells another, “You have a lot of flaws,” and it’s supposed to come off as insightful and not something that could be said about, well, anyone. In the pilot, the attorneys at Ted Black’s firm repeat the phrase “every day of the week and twice on Sunday”—even writing it down and sending it to each other! —like it’s the most clever thing they’ve ever heard and not a standard phrase that started circulating a century ago.', 'And that’s just the writing. The plot holes also require a sort of brain-numbness to surpass. When Ted Black (Stephen Amell) takes on a last-minute case that a rival attorney has been working on for months, he’s able to quickly get a whole bunch of information she hasn’t uncovered. How? Unknown! His old colleague from the DA’s office Kevin (Troy Winbush) does it all off-camera like only a magical Black sidekick can. And “Suits: LA” asks us not to worry about it.', 'Or there’s an entire plotline about leading entertainment lawyer Erica Rollins (Lex Scott Davis) not knowing anything about the business—to the point where she can’t read a script and form an opinion on whether it’s good or not. How’d she get so far without a basic understanding of her own industry? Again, it’s better not to ponder too closely.', 'But if you like dozing off and looking at beautiful people in beautiful places wearing beautiful clothes, “Suits: LA” has got you covered. As our lead, Black has the most potential crossover with the original “Suits,” thanks to his time as a New York DA, which we see in flashbacks. He’s joined by a “like a brother” peer in Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt)—you can tell they’re equals because they’re both confident white guys—an ex named Samantha (Rachelle Goulding), two ambitious underlings in Rollins and Rick Dodsen (Bryan Greenberg), and one surprisingly charming associate Leah (Alice Lee).', 'We see this cast of characters traipse through well-appointed offices and lovely restaurants. The blazers are tailored, the blouses sumptuous, and everyone’s hair is perfectly blown out. Flattering lighting abounds. The aesthetics are glossy network TV—nice to look at but not striking in any way, nothing to remember, nothing that stands out.', '“Suits: LA” does reach for some depth in Ted’s backstory. We see his haunting, ostensibly final case in New York, his poor-excuse-for-a-human father, and happier times with Samantha. The lasting anger, grievances, and pain from that time carry over to current-day Black, giving the show a personal touch a bit deeper than the standard bed-hopping.', 'But these flashes of humanity are short-lived as “Suits: LA” is as invested in asking us to care about whether a rich Hollywood producer killed his business partner. Theoretically, the fate of Ted’s firm is tied up in the case, but it’s truly hard to care about, particularly as Lester Thompson (Kevin Weisman) is generally a jerk with plenty of character-damning potential motives. Without a compelling central case, “Suits: LA” doesn’t even function as a legal drama. ', 'It’s more of a character study of a handsome, rich white guy who’s wholly consumed with his little corner of the world. Which is to say, if you watched “The Good Wife” and wished it had fewer morally complex situations and no biting social commentary, this might be the show for you. Did you find the “Lincoln Lawyer” too edgy? Did you watch Kathy Bates’ award-winning turn in “Matlock” or Ramón Rodríguez’s in “Will Trent,” and think, “These shows have too strong of a moral compass?” If so, maybe check out “Suits: LA.”', 'Now, obviously, it’s a spin-off of “Suits,” which ran on USA Network from 2011 to 2019. That show also inspired the Gina Torres vehicle “Pearson” and recently topped the charts on Netflix, reminding us all how much viewers like network TV and its formula. Still, perhaps this particular well has run dry.', 'Because “Suits: LA” harkens too far back to the “TV is rotting your brain” age of the form, ignoring how its peers have advanced the genre in favor of good-looking nothingness. This is a show that asks you to please turn off your brain before viewing and let the whole thing wash over you like a warm bath. It’s pleasant enough, soothing even. But you better bring your own things to think about because it offers nothing more.', 'Three episodes screened for review.

You bet your goddamn ass it is.', 'After the USA Network legal drama exploded on Netflix and racked up 57.7 billion minutes watched in 2023, creator Aaron Korsh is expanding the Suits universe with a second spinoff — this time, set on the West Coast. Suits LA, which premieres Sunday on NBC, will feature a new set of lawyers attempting to recapture the hallmarks of the original series: impossibly sharp intellect, edgy and witty dialogue and, yes, impeccably tailored suits and high fashion.', 'More from The Hollywood Reporter', ""'Suits LA' Review: Stephen Amell Flounders in NBC's Tonally Confused, Narratively Jumbled Legal Drama"", ""'Suits' Creator on Bringing Back Harvey Specter for 'Suits LA,' With More Original Stars Likely to Return"", ""Gina Torres on '9-1-1: Lone Star' Series Finale's Twist Ending and Her One 'Suits' Request"", 'Given that the new spinoff offers very little carry-over in terms of characters, viewers could theoretically tune into the L.A.-based spinoff without having watched any of its predecessors. But they would be seriously depriving themselves of the addictive, cozy comforts of the original series. Whether you watched the mothership during its initial run on cable from 2011 to 2019, or during the “summer of Suits” craze amid the Hollywood strikes a couple years ago (or any other time in between), here’s a pocket-sized primer about what to remember heading into the next chapter of Korsh’s legal drama.', 'The original Suits told the story of debonair super lawyer Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), who, in his capacity as a senior partner at a top Manhattan corporate law firm, decided to hire Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) as his new associate. The catch? Despite having an insane photographic memory, Mike never graduated from college, let alone from Harvard Law School — which was one of the hiring requirements of the firm co-founded and managed by the indomitable Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres).', 'As they struggled to keep Mike’s lack of credentials under wraps from their own colleagues and then the rest of the world at large, Harvey and Mike became one of television’s most beloved dynamic duos. With their signature banter (and penchant for quoting old movies to each other), the characters have even compared themselves to the likes of Batman and Robin and Butch and Sundance. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter last year, Adams credited the enduring success of the dynamic between Mike and Harvey to a variety of factors, including his and Macht’s own close friendship and the inherent complications of a mentor-mentee relationship.', 'While Harvey and Mike were the beating heart (and Jessica, the fearsome lioness) of Suits, the show’s ensemble formed its strong backbone:', 'Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), Harvey’s petulant, heart-on-his-sleeve frenemy, became the kind of character audiences loved to hate, or even grew to love. Sure, Louis may have used Mike’s secret to blackmail his way into becoming a name partner in the middle of season four (among a litany of other offenses), but his eccentricities — namely his love for ballet, theater and mudding — and his struggles to find a lasting romantic relationship were, at the very least, endearing to watch.', 'Initially slated to appear in only a few episodes, Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty) became an important foil for Harvey — first as his all-knowing secretary and then as a chief executive of the firm. Donna’s will-they-won’t-they relationship with Harvey remained a constant until the end of the eighth season, at which point they both realized that their one true love has been in front of them for over a decade.', 'In her final role before marrying into the British Royal Family, Meghan Markle starred as Rachel Zane, a brilliant paralegal-turned-lawyer whose on-again, off-again relationship with Mike formed most of the romantic intrigue of the first four seasons. As the show progressed, the writers seemed intent on making Rachel break down in tears every few episodes — usually about Mike or her own career, which was inevitably affected in some way by Mike’s fraudulent behavior.', 'Following the departures of Torres (in season six) and Adams and Markle (in season seven) from the series regular cast, Suits promoted Amanda Schull (Katrina Bennett) and Dulé Hill (Alex Williams) and cast Katherine Heigl in the role of Samantha Wheeler. All three senior partners were promoted to name partners alongside Louis by the end of the series.', 'Over the course of nine seasons and 134 episodes, the embattled firm at the center of Suits weathered a string of scandals, power plays, coups and promotions. The company underwent two mergers and at least 12 name changes (we all know “Pearson Specter Litt” was the best combination of name partners). Two managing partners — Jessica in season six, Rachel’s father Robert Zane (Wendell Pierce) in season eight — were disbarred in order to protect Mike and Harvey’s own ability to practice law. The firm’s legal minds waged war against shady billionaires (Eric Roberts’ Charles Forstman); federal prosecutors (Leslie Hope’s Anita Gibbs); the SEC (Neal McDonough’s Sean Cahill, Zeljko Ivanek’s Eric Woodall); dangerous criminals (Paul Schulze’s Frank Gallo); and even the District Attorney’s office, Harvey’s former employer.', 'After flip-flopping between wanting to be a lawyer and not wanting to put the rest of the firm at risk, Mike was formally arrested and charged with fraud in the middle of season five. Following a tumultuous trial, Mike decided to take a plea deal to prevent Gibbs from going after his colleagues, but he learned after the fact that the jury was actually planning to rule in his favor. (Talk about a gut punch.) In season six, Mike served a couple months in a white-collar prison and traded valuable intel on Gallo in exchange for an early release.', 'While Harvey worked to get Mike out of prison, Rachel and Jessica joined forces to free an innocent man from death row. The case reminded Jessica of the reason she became a lawyer in the first place — to help those who are disadvantaged and marginalized — and she made the difficult decision to leave the firm and New York behind. She decided to move to Chicago, where she got her own one-season spinoff, Pearson, and became a fixer in the dirty world of politics. (Torres recently told THR that Pearson was the show that she set out to make: “I had often said that whereas Suits was about the top 5 percent, I wanted Pearson to be about everybody else.”)', 'After Jessica returned in the season six finale to take the fall for Mike’s hiring in a character hearing, Mike was officially admitted to the bar. At the end of the following season, Mike and Rachel got married and moved to Seattle to run a firm that only takes class-action lawsuits against Fortune 500 companies. In the series finale, after Harvey makes a deal to resign in exchange for the departure of iron-fisted managing partner Faye Richardson (Denise Crosby), Harvey and Donna — who decided to get married on a whim after Louis’ wedding was interrupted by his wife going into labor — decide to reunite with their best friends on the West Coast. Fittingly, after beginning their partnership working for some of the biggest names on Wall Street, Harvey and Mike have chosen to dedicate themselves to fighting for “the little guys” for a change.', 'Nearly six years after the end of Suits and Pearson, NBC is not-so-subtly attempting to capitalize on the franchise’s resurgence with a spinoff built around a character from Harvey’s past: Ted Black (Stephen Amell). In the second episode, Ted and his old friend Kevin (Troy Winbush) talk about Harvey, whom Kevin describes as “the only person I know cockier than” Ted. As it turns out, Harvey and Ted worked together at the DA’s office before the former left to work for Jessica.', 'Here is a list of what else you should and should not expect from the new offshoot:', 'Expect some original cast cameos — just not a certain Duchess of Sussex. Any iteration of Suits wouldn’t feel like Suits without an appearance from one of the OGs. THR has confirmed that Macht will appear in three of the 13 episodes of Suits LA, as a kind of ceremonial passing of the baton from Harvey to Ted. Torres recently told THR that she has not had any conversations about reprising Jessica, but has expressed her willingness to do so. Likewise, Adams and Rafferty, who are currently hosting a Suits (re)watch podcast, and Hoffman have all expressed interest in suiting up again, but Hoffman stressed that the LA cast needs time to find its footing first. One person who very likely won’t be returning is Markle, who, in a 2022 interview, stated that she does not intend to go back to acting.', 'Don’t expect a repeat of Harvey and Mike. Rather than choosing to make Suits LA another two-hander, Korsh has opted to have a single lead and a rotating cast of series regulars, including Lex Scott Davis and Bryan Greenberg, and recurring players. Even though Ted and his criminal defense partner Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt) may be best friends, the events of the pilot make it clear that they are in very different places — both personally and professionally speaking.', 'Expect to hear “Greenback Boogie.” The iconic earworm by Ima Robot will be reimagined with a new opening credits sequence.', 'But don’t expect as many “goddamns” or coarse language. We are on a broadcast network now, after all. There will sadly be no characters yelling out “Bullshit!” in the middle of a contract negotiation or a deposition, but there may be some substitutes for that colorful language.', 'Expect another big secret to eat away at the lead, but this time a story that plays out across two timelines. Ted may have reinvented himself as a lawyer for the biggest names in entertainment, but his sordid past as a federal prosecutor — and the reason he moved across the country — will come back to haunt him.', 'Suits LA premieres Sunday, Feb. 23 at 9 p.m. on NBC, streaming the next day on Peacock.', 'Best of The Hollywood Reporter', ""'Yellowstone' and the Sprawling Dutton Family Tree, Explained"", ""A 'Star Wars' Timeline: All the Movies and TV Shows in the Franchise"", ""What the 'House of the Dragon' Cast Starred in Before the 'Game of Thrones' Spinoff"", ""Sign up for THR's Newsletter.

While the smart, sexy legal procedural originally aired on USA Network, its success there was nothing compared to its second life on streaming. Suits took Netflix by storm in 2023, becoming an unconventional sensation almost overnight. For those who'd watched the show in its initial run, seeing its resurgence offered a potent dose of vindication. Now everyone could see what they'd seen 10 years ago. Total newbies likewise found comfort in its low-stakes bingeability. Its success on the streamer could have been a one-and-done phenomenon, but NBC naturally saw a prime opportunity to expand the world of the series… and capitalize on the Netflix boom."", ""Fast forward a year and change, and now we've got Suits LA. It's not a direct sequel to the series that started it all: While original Suits star Gabriel Macht is set to appear sometime this season, the narrative connection between these two shows is tissue-thin. Instead, most similarities manifest behind the scenes. Suits showrunner Aaron Korsh is back to helm the new spin-off, as are most of the writers and producers. That results in some familiar beats, and a tone that teeters between soapy stakes and breezy, aspirational fantasy. "", 'ALSO READ: Everything to know about Suits LA', 'For all the ways it invokes the classic comforts of the 2010s, however, Suits LA is also a product of the streaming era. It may not have anything to do with Netflix, but it\'s definitely taken a page from the streamer\'s playbook. The new series feels like an attempt to reverse engineer Suits\' success on the platform, creating prime material for ""casual viewing"" while honoring the soul of the original series. That makes a lot of business sense, but combining past and present is easier said than done.', ""Our story focuses somewhat clumsily on Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a smooth-talking prosecutor with a successful Los Angeles firm. As he explains to a potential client, few in the city are more successful, or more qualified, than he is. Like a grislier Harvey Dent, Ted spent years in New York City facing off against the criminal elite. He never lost a case there, and it's a streak he's continued in his 10 years on the West Coast. His character is almost entirely wrapped up in that convenient (if heavy-handed) nugget of information, and so much of Ted's world is explained in similar fashion. The pilot uses clunky dialogue to introduce us to most members of our cast, like Erica Rollins (Lex Scott Davis) and Rick Dodson (Bryan Greenberg), two dueling associates working under Ted, or Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt), a rival waging war against Ted's firm. "", ""Ted's relationship with Stuart is the exact inverse of Suits' bromance between Harvey Specter (Macht) and Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), but it nonetheless forms the heart of the new series. They were once inseparable partners, with Ted focusing on the glossy world of entertainment law and Stuart carving out a niche in criminal defense — but their friendship soured as Ted started taking Stuart for granted. Stuart answers that disrespect by merging with another firm run by Ted's ex, Samantha (Rachelle Goulding), and poaching all but a few of Ted's best clients. The first three episodes provided to critics are mostly concerned with laying out this drama, positioning Ted and his remaining allies on a mission to rebuild. The problem is that we never really get to see any of that drama unfold in real time. So much of the action occurs off screen, forcing our cast to talk us through what could have been truly compelling moments. "", ""It's here that Suits LA's allusions to the Netflix model feel the most glaring. The streamer specializes in shows you could technically watch while scrolling on your phone or folding laundry, all without missing a beat. The writers of these shows accomplish that feat by forcing characters to announce everything they do, and everything going on around them, for those barely paying attention. Suits LA follows that same brief, replacing smart, clean copy with watered-down exposition. Characters explain their plans before, during, and after the execution, but with allegiances constantly shifting, it's not any easier to follow. Even the inciting incident that drives the first wedge between Stuart and Ted — an incident that could have told us a lot about their relationship — is recapped in a later conversation. It's a jarring way to lay out such a complex story. And sure, maybe there was a bit of that in the original Suits too… but at least it had the courage to trust its audience in other ways. "", 'ALSO READ: The complete guide to winter TV', 'Suits worked so well because it took its time. It built up its characters and their relationships through season upon season of strong storytelling; its conflicts hit harder because we understood who the ensemble was, and why it all mattered to them. Suits LA, on the other hand, starts with what could have been a bombshell of a season finale. It throws us into the deep end and expects us to catch on as we go, dropping familiar Suits-isms like breadcrumbs to follow. A lot of that manifests in vaguely familiar characters. At turns, Ted evokes both Harvey at Mike: He\'s a pretty boy with the instincts of a shark, but he\'s also running from a professional blunder that nearly ruined his reputation in New York. (The series gives us morsels of his backstory through shoddily rendered flashbacks, setting up a season-long mystery.) Erica also feels like an amalgam of two characters. Like Gina Torres\' Jessica Pearson, she\'s never not thinking of ways to improve her position. Suits LA also wastes little time setting her up for a ""will they, won\'t they"" with her work rival Rick, evoking the slow burn between Mike and Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle). Even Harvey\'s loyal secretary, Donna (Sarah Rafferty), has been reincarnated in Roslyn (Azita Ghanizada), a doting assistant who exists solely to deliver the most blindsiding news — like, say, ""Your father has three days to live"" — with a totally straight face. ', ""Even without the shadow of a truly great show looming over it, Suits LA just can't seem to find its footing. Suits got by well enough with its case-of-the-week conceit; it consistently stretched the limits of corporate law into thrilling new shapes. Entertainment law is another beast entirely, but it's not rendered here with much pizzazz: Our power players are mostly here to manage egos, secure film schedules for emerging starlets, and push character actors into the next phase of their careers. Juxtaposing all the Hollywood hijinks with the life-and-death world of criminal defense also feels like a mismatch. While Erica and her associate Leah (Alice Lee) try to appease clients like Brian Baumgartner (playing a version of himself who is tired of all the typecasting he's endured after The Office and now wants to become an Oscar-winning actor), Ted takes on the case of a big-time exec accused of murder. There's no reason why these two plots can't live side by side: other procedurals have found ways to juggle much wilder themes. The problem here may boil down to an identity crisis.

There are the trappings of the original series: the pretty people in business formalwear, kicky music, fast-paced dialogue, full-frontal flirtation and a legal system that exists only in Fantasyland. But it\'s missing the humor and fun of the original series, an integral part of the addictive tone that makes it so very binge-watchable. Plus it lacks a unique hook or characters anywhere nearly as appealing as the beloved Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) or Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams).', '""Suits LA"" is what seltzer is to soda: Sort of, almost, not really the real thing. Your La Croix gives you a hint of strawberry, and ""LA"" will give you a smattering impression of ""Suits.""', 'The dissonance starts from the very first scene of the first episode, in which we see our ostensible hero, Ted Black (Stephen Amell, ""Arrow""), as a New York federal prosecutor in 2010 threatening a mob whistleblower before both are caught in a bomb blast. In the present, Ted\'s life is completely different: He\'s the partner at a swanky Los Angeles law firm, now working in entertainment rather than as a prosecutor. His partner Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt) is his best friend and confidante, though Ted doesn\'t respect Stuart\'s criminal-defense specialty. That difference between them proves rather problematic when Stuart tricks Ted into merging their firm with another that\'s coincidentally run by Ted\'s ex, Samantha (Rachelle Goulding), and then cuts his partner out of the deal.', 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', ""Ted struggles to keep what's left of his side of the firm alive after losing half his staff, including mentee Rick (Bryan Greenberg), to Stuart. He's left with Erica (Lex Scott Davis), an ambitious entertainment lawyer he doesn't fully trust, his loyal secretary Roslyn (Azita Ghanizada) and quirky associate Leah (Alice Lee). Oh, and his top client has just been arrested for murder."", 'There\'s just too much going on in the messy, hard-to-follow pilot, and barely any time to meet the characters, let alone being to feel for them, by the time the big betrayal happens. (By comparison, CBS\' ""The Good Wife"" took five seasons to get to its law-firm split). By the time you\'ve processed Stuart\'s move, there\'s another puzzling element thrown in, like the flashbacks to Ted\'s career as a prosecutor which featured his estranged father and some vague terrible incident. Or there\'s John Amos, who died in August, appearing as himself and verging on the ""Magical Negro"" trope that can be found all over American TV and film ― a wise old Black person who only exists to impart wisdom to a white character ― as he gifts advice to a floundering Ted.', 'It\'s all a big tonal jump from the original series, which was campy and lighthearted, with frequent phallic jokes and an infamous dream sequence about the trial of ""Faye Pooperson."" Amell, known for his subdued performances and public controversy, lacks the magnetism of Macht and Adams. And the central relationship in ""Suits"" was not a romance but a deep friendship between those two men, while ""LA"" blows up its only chance to recreate that in the first episode.', 'The appealing moments that feel most like ""Suits"" are between Erica and Leah, two supporting characters tasked with the series\' Hollywood lawyer B-plots, like getting an actress out of a contract on an indie film or introducing ""The Office"" star Brian Baumgartner to Patton Oswalt (both also awkwardly playing themselves). But when the camera turns back to Ted\'s increasingly dark life, things sour.', 'The series was originally imagined by Korsch as a show about Hollywood agents, and it was only after the Netflix bump that the creator was asked to rework it into the ""Suits"" universe. In the three episodes made available for review, it\'s easy to see how many concepts were pasted on top of each other to fill the running time: Baumgartner\'s crowing about wanting an Oscar doesn\'t gel with flashbacks to a New York prosecutor\'s war on the mob, which doesn\'t make sense juxtaposed with scenes about a high-profile Hollywood murder case. It\'s not enough like ""Entourage"" to be a Hollywood romp, not ""Law & Order"" enough to be a serious legal drama and not ""Suits"" enough to be compellingly bingeable.', 'Without a bit more heart and soul, the spinoff is just a pretender in a nicely tailored suit.']"

""Suits"" was a frothy, binge-worthy mix of legal chatter, relationship drama, and deeper secrets that played out across the glitzy offices of New York City that I\'ve fondly revisited in the years since it came to an end.', 'It then reemerged in the pop culture sphere after being added to Netflix in 2023, where it suddenly became the show of the summer and easily the streaming service\'s most popular library title. With that kind of success, it was clear there was an appetite for more. Enter: ""Suits LA"".', 'Fast forward to now, and ""Suits LA"" is almost upon us. Ahead of the season premiere on NBC and Peacock, I had the chance to watch rough cuts of the first three episodes. Below, I\'ve pulled together my thoughts on whether you should tune in for ""Suits LA"", or whether you should stream something else instead.', 'The drama in ""Suits LA"" revolves around Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a former federal prosecutor from New York who has since reinvented himself in Los Angeles and now represents some high-profile clients.', ""We meet him when his firm's in crisis, and he's forced to embrace a role he's held in contempt for his entire career to survive. And as if solving a crisis wasn't enough, across the series, we also learn about the fraught events that led Ted to abandon everything and everyone that he loved years ago."", 'Ted\'s surrounded by a talented group of characters, but in classic ""Suits"" fashion, they all test their loyalties to both Ted and one another as they can\'t help but mix their personal and professional lives.', '', 'Even with this small selection of episodes at hand, it\'s easy to connect at least some of the characters back to their ""Suits"" forebears, and ""Suits LA"" is clearly striving for the same sort of cocksure, brassy tone, just with the action playing out on the other side of the country.', 'Striving for the same flavor of drama sounds like a recipe for success, right? What made ""Suits"" so fun was that mix of personal and professional drama, after all. Well, I\'m sorry to say that I came away from my viewing with the opinion that ""Suits LA"" felt like a cheap knock-off of a well-tailored original.', 'Mild spoilers for ""Suits LA"" episodes 1-3 below', '', ""The writing's not nearly as sharp or as fun and the dialogue at times ranges from hokey to downright cringe-inducing. Likewise, this pivot to a new branch of law might have helped define the show as more of its own beast, but it also hasn't served up stories worth caring about ... just yet."", ""The season-long arcs are somewhat intriguing, but the subplots have thus far felt like bland distractions, and the rivalries just lack the energy that was evident from the jump between, say, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) and Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman). It's too early to say if there's a romance worth rooting for like the one between Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) and Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle)."", 'And, as much as I was ready to welcome another ""Suits"" lead into my viewing life, Stephen Amell just doesn\'t have the magnetic swagger that Macht had. That\'s not to say he\'s putting in a bad performance; indeed, most of the cast are generally doing decent work — most of the time — but they\'ve just got muddled, lower-quality material to work with.', ""The worst problem, though, is simply how episodes are structured, or rather, how they seemingly lack structure. From the jump, you've got a LOT to keep up with — your new ensemble, their relationships, clients, personal histories — and it's all just thrown at you, with very little breathing room."", '', ""Before you can wrap your head around what's going on, cases and revelations begin piling up and you're also seeing flashbacks to Ted's past life. It's all a bit much for the opening episodes, even viewed back-to-back, and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of viewers come away from the season premiere feeling at least confused, rather than enthused."", 'There is a bright side, though; the third episode was easily the strongest of the three available for review. It feels somewhat more assured. And even if weaknesses are very much still present, it at least feels more settled into a rhythm. A light-hearted diversion featuring Brian Baumgartner and Patton Oswalt also makes for an entertaining story of the week.', 'With that improvement in mind, I\'m hopeful that ""Suits LA"" can grow into something stronger. Specter\'s return has been teased but hasn\'t happened yet; maybe when he\'s finally roped in, things will liven up even further.', 'Nevertheless, the episodes I have seen do suggest that the show\'s doing little more than trying to emulate the original show.

Greenlighted after Suits was crowned the most-streamed show of 2023 following a Netflix resurgence, expectations are high.', 'While Suits focused on the cutthroat world of corporate law in New York City with a fake yet practicing lawyer as its main hook, Suits LA, written and produced by original Suits creator Aaron Korsh, follows an entertainment law firm dealing with elite Hollywood clients and relies on complicated interpersonal dynamics as its driving force. The firm is led by Ted Black (Stephen Amell), a former federal prosecutor who uproots his life in the Big Apple in exchange for a sunnier West Coast setting to escape his dark past.', 'He’s surrounded by a trio of new characters: Erica Rollins (Lex Scott Davis), an ambitious lawyer with sights set on a promotion; Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt), Ted’s close friend and firm partner; and Rick Dodson (Bryan Greenberg), a driven attorney jockeying for power. At some point in the season, Suits star Gabriel Macht returns as Harvey Specter, who had close ties with Ted back in the Manhattan office.', '', '', 'Early reviews for Suits LA have been mostly negative.', ""“The new Suits is an echo of the original that neither embodies enough of its ethos to satisfy nor sufficiently differentiates itself to stand alone,” the Guardian wrote, giving it two out of five stars. A critic for TV Guide wrote that “Suits LA just can't seem to find its footing,” “sabotag[ing] any genuine attempts to keep the franchise alive.” RogerEbert.com was even harsher, describing the spinoff as “dumb, glossy nothingness.”"", 'Max Gao, a freelance entertainment writer who credits Suits for inspiring his law school journey, said the spinoff may face an uphill battle when it comes to meeting viewers’ “impossibly high standards.”', ""“It’s definitely a different flavor,” Gao told Yahoo Entertainment of the L.A. iteration. “So much of the original Suits was about aspirational, willful wish fulfillment. The spinoff is trying to do the same thing, but it's very difficult to live up to that bar.”"", 'Though aspects of the original Suits remain, such as the signature theme song “Greenback Boogie” by Ima Robot and traces of similar dialogue (Suits’ go-to interjection, “Goddamn,” is freely used here), Gao believes Korsh may have forgotten what made the original series “so fun to watch” in creating Suits LA.', 'Without establishing clear stakes as Suits did in its first episode — unlicensed attorney Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) pretending to be a lawyer under Harvey’s eagle-eyed supervision with the risk of getting found out at any point — there’s less clarity on what fans can relate to here.', ""“The main characters in this [spinoff] aren't holding the same kind of secret, so they're not having to deal with the fact that one of the lawyers actually isn't a lawyer and didn't go to law school. In this case, you have another big secret that will be eating away at the lead, but this time the story is played across two different timelines,” Gao said, referring to flashbacks that are woven into the storylines. “In doing that, Aaron Korsh very specifically wanted to create a different kind of show. It remains to be seen if there is going to be an emotional payoff.”"", ""Gao said that comparisons to the original are inevitable, especially with its streaming popularity surging over the last two years — well after the series signed off from USA Network in 2019. “People who love the original series and want to tune in [may be] expecting the same thing.

Unless I’ve missed something in the marketing, no such hook exists for [all the characters of] Suits LA, which kind of makes it [like] any other legal show starring a bunch of 30- and 40-somethings.”"", 'Edgar Cheung, an editor in the animation industry, was a late adopter of Suits. After reading Prince Harry’s 2023 memoir, Spare, which referenced the show in the context of his blossoming romance with then-Suits star Meghan Markle, Cheung checked out Season 1 DVDs from the library and was “immediately sold.”', '“I loved how charming Harvey Specter was, and Mike Ross captured this ‘everyman’ energy that made him relatable. Mike was literally the audience surrogate,” Cheung told Yahoo Entertainment. “The show had a great theme song, wonderful cast and enjoyable cases and storylines.”', 'He hopes that the spinoff “is able to find its own Mike-Harvey dynamic,” a key relationship that transformed into a real friendship as Suits progressed. For Cheung, the big question Suits LA will need to answer is, “What is the heart of this new show?”', '“Mike Ross’s journey was the throughline of the original. You wanted him to solve cases and get the girl. He was put in impossible situations that created moral dilemmas,” he said. “I hope Suits LA will have something just as engaging that will make me come back week after week.”', 'Ethan Huynh, a professional in the pharmaceutical industry who considers Suits one of his favorite TV shows, said he’s “cautiously excited” about the spinoff.', '“It’d be great to see some of the old Suits charm in a new context while developing new relationships and arcs,” he told Yahoo Entertainment. “And, of course, I’m curious to see how they weave in some of the past characters and whether they can make Suits LA feel like its own show while still honoring what made Suits so enjoyable.”', 'Harvey’s appearance on Suits LA will certainly help. Macht agreeing to come back is “absolutely” a good thing for the new show, Huynh said.', '“Gabriel Macht’s portrayal of Harvey Specter was integral to the success of the original show, and his presence in Suits LA will likely bring a sense of continuity and connection to the original series,” he said. “Harvey’s charisma, confidence and complex relationships with other characters made him one of the most iconic parts of the Suits world.”', '“His return can serve as a bridge for fans of the original show and provide some much-needed gravitas to the spinoff,” Huynh said.', 'Gao echoed those sentiments, saying Harvey back in tailored three-piece suits will be “a breath of fresh air.”', '“It will give fans of both the original series and of the new one a chance to catch up with the characters, just to get a sense of where Harvey is,” he said. “Is he still with Donna? Is he still working with Mike? All of those fun little details, I think, are going to be intriguing for fans.”', 'Suits LA premieres Feb. 23 at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.']"

Suits LA review – glossy legal spinoff is an unsexy disappointment,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/feb/20/suits-la-tv-review,"['After Suits became a surprise Netflix smash hit in 2023, the inevitable follow-up is unlikely to find as many fans', 'F\nor all my eye-rolling at spinoffs, reboots and IP rehashing, I have to admit that a redux of Suits, the erstwhile USA Network show about smartly dressed hyper-smart lawyers bickering smartly, is smart business. The original series, which ran from 2011 until 2019, is the type of show that linear television used to excel at, and what streaming services have long struggled to replicate: lightly serialized, an aspirational workplace drama with near-comically low stakes, sleek and sexy and easily second-screened. It was the show of the summer in, of all years, 2023, nearly half a decade after it wrapped its run and cultural eons away from the heyday of breezy, beautiful so-called “blue sky” television.', 'Given that everyone and their friend was watching (or rewatching) Suits a year-ish ago, it made sense, and was even maybe promising, that NBC greenlit Suits LA, a spinoff set in a somehow even sunnier environment than the original’s unrecognizably bright vision of New York (via Toronto). As an original series watcher carried back by the Netflix resurgence, I, too, was hopeful for an extension of the show’s cheeky, clever, bad-but-fun spirit, a show that doubled down on the magnetic hyper-competence of a corporate lawyer like Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), continued the predominance of unrealistically sexy tailoring, and transcended the presence of a pre-Sussex Meghan Markle.', 'Unfortunately, Suits LA, again created by Aaron Korsh, disappoints in the tradition of many a network reboot. Like Frasier, How I Met Your Father and the Gossip Girl 2.0 before it, the new Suits is an echo of the original that neither embodies enough of its ethos to satisfy nor sufficiently differentiates itself to stand alone. To be fair, while the original made the drudgery of corporate law unrealistically and definitively sexy, the new version takes on arguably an even more difficult case: the work of entertainment law. Where there was once mergers, embezzlement and white-collar crime, there is now contracts, movie-star schmoozing and one actual murder involving a producer that is so dry and unmoving it made me wish they stuck to negotiations of film schedules.', 'Suits LA certainly has the pieces to succeed: in the tradition of Harvey Specter, entertainment lawyer Ted Black (Stephen Amell) is a fast-talking, quick-thinking, largely unflappable closer of extreme confidence, with a keen sense of banter and, of course, a pretty face. In the tradition of Patrick J Adams’ Mike Ross, a broke autodidact who fakes his way into a Harvard-only law firm at the expense of everyone’s trust for the rest of the series, Ted also has some secrets – though not nearly as endearing and rendered in shoddily deployed flashbacks to his 2010 New York life. (None of the three episodes provided for review were finalized for air, but I doubt color correction can fix a stale aesthetic that is particularly drab in the 2010 scenes.) Like Gina Torres before her, Erica Rollins (Lex Scott Davis) is an ambitious careerist made ruthless by the corporate norm that Black women have to work twice as hard to get half as far, engaged in a war of egos and chemistry with comparatively laidback frenemy Rick Dodson (Bryan Greenberg). Everyone, yes, wears excellent suits (Erica in particular); there are obligatory shots of tight pencil skirts sashaying away.', 'Spoiler guidelines prohibit much discussion of the plot, which, in the spirit of the original, shuffles the main players around in a wheel of self-interest and pride. The show tries, largely unproductively, to wring mystery out of how Ted, a former federal prosecutor of mobsters turned entertainment lawyer with the most baldly stated daddy issues I’ve ever seen, moves from New York to Los Angeles to set up a firm with close friend Stuart Lane (Josh McDermitt), a former corporate lawyer turned criminal defense attorney (the practice of law is fungible, I guess).', 'The pals open the show staring down a merger with another shop run by Ted’s very attractive ex Samantha (Rachelle Goulding). All the while, Black Lane clients – all actors playing themselves, including the late John Amos – flow in and out of the office with a slew of actor-specific demands that seem much more compelling in theory than in practice. Nice as he may be, watching Brian Baumgartner, aka The Office’s Kevin Malone, seek help on becoming an Oscar-winning dramatic actor doesn’t have quite the same intrigue as, say, going after an investment firm that ripped off a non-profit.', 'Crucially – and this really the whole deal – not enough of this work is in the service of Suits’ bread and butter: characters verbally jockeying their way through life, musical tête-à-têtes of exceptional timing and wit. There are flashes of that, such as when Ted and Erica recognize their mutual shark-ness, or when Erica takes on Rick, or when Erica deals with a less straitened junior assistant (Alice Lee). Aside from Erica, and an occasional good Ted Black moment (Amell has the cadence and the jawline), the banter wilts more than it zings. Without it, Suits LA is just convoluted plot and unrealistically alert lawyers – maybe baseline entertaining, but not sexy. Without it – after three episodes, at least – this spinoff is just business.', 'Suits LA airs on NBC on Sundays with a UK date to be announced']"
