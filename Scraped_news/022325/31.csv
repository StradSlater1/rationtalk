There‚Äôs no one to blame but Humane.', 'by David Pierce', 'Ten days from now, the Humane AI Pin will be able to tell you how much battery it has left, and essentially nothing else. To be fair, though, it couldn‚Äôt do that much before. And it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway, because you almost certainly didn‚Äôt buy one. But if you did, that‚Äôs the bad news: Humane is shutting down the AI Pin ‚Äî almost exactly a year after it first started shipping the little chest-mounted device ‚Äî and has sold some of its remnant technology to HP.', 'The details here are brutal for everyone involved. The $116 million HP is paying pales next to the $230 million the company raised since it was founded in 2018. (There was a rumor last spring that Humane was trying to sell to HP for somewhere near $1 billion.) The company‚Äôs founders, Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, have now gone from celebrated Apple product makers to‚Ä¶ working on AI stuff for HP‚Äôs printers and conference room gadgets. Pin owners will be stuck with a $699 paperweight, since Humane is neither offering refunds outside the normal 90-day purchase window nor appears to have a plan to open-source or otherwise make available any of its software. It‚Äôs all just over.', 'Humane will go down in the annals of tech history as one of the most spectacular gadget failures of all time, up there with Quibi, the Fire Phone, and the Apple Newton. The company never seemed to put a foot right. It labored in secret for years, building relentless hype, before first showing off the device in an overwrought, thoroughly confusing TED talk in which Chaudhri mysteriously got the Pin to translate a sentence to French without ever asking it to, and answered a phone call by doing‚Ä¶ nothing. Knowing what we know now, it seems virtually impossible that the demo wasn‚Äôt mostly or entirely a fake.', 'Humane was hellbent on convincing everyone that the Pin was the future, and that the future was here right now. It called that TED talk ‚ÄúThe Disappearing Computer,‚Äù and pitched its device as the first true AI gadget ‚Äî and maybe the successor to the smartphone. Humane made a big deal out of its announcement of the product‚Äôs name, and had its device declared one of Time‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Inventions of 2023‚Äù before the thing ever actually shipped. (Surely it‚Äôs a coincidence that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff both owns Time and invested in Humane, right?) The company delayed the Pin‚Äôs launch, before ignoring panicked warnings from early testers who said the device was woefully unfinished and shipping the thing anyway.', 'Even if the Pin had been, let‚Äôs say, pretty good, it would have felt like a disappointment after all that build-up. But the Pin was junk. I gave it a 4 / 10 in my review last year, and in retrospect I was too generous. There were certainly a few impressive things about it: it was small and sturdy and genuinely nice to hold and look at. As any good student of Apple design knows, though, design is how you use it. And using the Pin was a study in disappointment. The Pin couldn‚Äôt do much ‚Äî it shipped without features as basic as a timer or an alarm, and was missing a number of the features Chaudhri demoed during his TED Talk. What it could do, it did sporadically and mostly poorly. The battery didn‚Äôt last very long, not that you could ever test it ‚Äî the Pin overheated so quickly even in moderate use that it shut itself down long before it died.', 'Oh, and did I mention it was SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE DOLLARS? Plus a mandatory $24 monthly charge for cell service? Forget pretty good, the Pin would have had to be great to be worth it. At least Rabbit had the good sense to only charge $200 for the similarly crummy R1 ‚Äî and to make it orange and fun to fiddle with.', 'At least Rabbit had the good sense to only charge $200', 'To its credit, Humane eventually updated the Pin to add some missing software features and fix a bunch of what was broken, and the Pin will certainly be a better device on its last day than on its first. But it never mattered. Pretty quickly, Pin returns started to outweigh Pin sales. Humane had to recall the Pin‚Äôs charging case, which was an overheating risk. The company had always planned to make its operating system, called CosmOS, into a platform for other developers and hardware manufacturers to use, but waited too long and found no takers.', 'Some of this, a lot of it even, was self-inflicted. Humane just tried to do too much, and reinvent too many things, that it would have had to execute at unheard-of levels for a first-time startup to pull it off. But Humane also made a huge bet on AI technology that, while it continues to improve, also continues to be woefully inadequate for most things. We‚Äôre only now seeing companies like OpenAI begin to slowly give their models these so-called ‚Äúagentic‚Äù capabilities, so they can go book you Airbnbs or remind you to pick up flowers. When all that works perfectly, when AI models are integrated seamlessly with every app and service and real-time detail of our lives, maybe a totally interface-less device like the Pin will be useful. But if that‚Äôs ever going to happen, it‚Äôs not going to be soon.', 'What‚Äôs most damning in the Humane story, though, is how much the company was right about. The time was ripe for a first mass adoption of AI ‚Äî but ChatGPT and Claude figured out the user interface people actually want right now. There are opportunities for new kinds of gadgets ‚Äî but they‚Äôre going to look more like glasses than brooches. People do increasingly want faster, easier, less screen-based ways to interact with technology ‚Äî but the voice assistant on their phone and in their ears is a lot more useful than a laser projector on their hand.

What's more, the turnaround for this city EV will be fast‚Äîdeveloped and ready for production in just 16 months. ‚ÄúI defy any competitor in the world to do that,‚Äù de Meo said, ‚Äúincluding the Chinese when they come to Europe.‚Äù"", ""The new model, which Dacia says will only use 750 parts (!!) to keep costs down, likely won't replace the Spring, as that itself is relatively new. However, the Spring is built in China and will therefore be subject to any tariffs on Chinese EVs, If this new model is EU-made, then it would circumvent such tariffs, and it could also probably improve on the Spring's 140-mile range. ‚ÄîJeremy White"", ""Gimbals aren't often talked about enough, but they can be vital in delivering stable video footage, whether you're shooting on your smartphone or a professional camera. DJI this week unveiled two gimbals, designed for both of those respective platforms. The Osmo Mobile 7P and Osmo Mobile 7 are meant for smartphones, whereas the RS 4 Mini can be used with cameras and smartphones."", ""The Osmo Mobile 7P now comes with a Multifunctional Module, an attachment that adds capabilities like enabling subject tracking with a hand gesture. While the Mobile 7 supports the module, you have to buy it separately if you want it. Since it's not included, it's much more lightweight at 300 grams and is cheaper. The Mobile 7P costs $149 and the Mobile 7 is $89, and both are available for purchase now."", ""The DJI RS 4 Mini is in a different class altogether, with a starting price of $369. DJI promises speedier setups with this gimbal, including a faster way to switch to filming vertically. The stabilization has been upgraded, especially with vertical video, and battery life is longer (up to 13 hours) with fast-charging support. It also now supports intelligent subject tracking via the tracking module, similar to the Multifunctional Module on the Osmo Mobile 7P. It's also available now."", 'Can we resist a James Bronze joke?

No, really. If you‚Äôre wondering, ambient IoT is all about finding ways to power small devices like trackers and sensors by harvesting ambient energy from the immediate environment, which could be radio waves, light, motion, heat, or any other viable energy source. With ambient IoT, there‚Äôs no need to make small, wasteful batteries or find ways to wirelessly power over distance.', 'Ambient IoT-enabled devices might detect location, temperature, humidity, and other things, feeding data back through the wireless infrastructure created by our smart appliances, phones, and wireless access points. From accurate package tracking to E Ink shelf tags in-store, this could be meaningful for supply chain management, retail, and health care, which is why the founding members are such a diverse group, including Atmosic, Infineon Technologies AG, Intel, PepsiCo, Qualcomm, VusionGroup, and Wiliot.', 'The underlying technologies for ambient IoT are varied, so the Alliance aims to define them within the global communications standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth SIG, and 3GPP (5G Advanced). Steve Statler, spokesperson for the Ambient IoT Alliance, told WIRED that ambient IoT could make it affordable for companies to track packages in real time with stickers containing a small chip capable of harvesting radio frequency signals for energy. Then it can broadcast a stronger signal to share its location and potentially other data including temperature, crucial for some medications and food products.', 'What begins as a B2B technology for better inventory and supply-chain management has many other potential future applications. Statler suggests a tag on designer clothing may not just prove authenticity, but track provenance and even record how often it has been worn or washed. In the short term, food safety is another potential application, as this kind of tracking could close the loop for recalls, making it much faster and easier to track contaminated batches of foodstuffs.', 'There‚Äôs still much to figure out. Delivering on the original promise of ambient IoT will generate huge amounts of data; there are privacy concerns with tracking; and it will be a challenge to get everyone on board with open standards and interoperability, as we have seen in the smart home space with Matter. That said, an alliance is a vital first step. ‚ÄîSimon Hill', 'The seventh-generation Thermomix blender is coming.

With the product on the market now, initial words and comments raised doubts regarding the product's worthiness. Is the Humane AI Pin already a product failure? In this article, we will examine why it has received such a lukewarm response and what this has done for wearable technology's future."", 'The AI Pin focuses on a more natural model of interaction compared to traditional wearables, which often use screens and buttons. It seeks to give users effortless access to information and services through voice commands and context awareness. The idea is lofty, framing itself as a personal assistant that will fit in your pocket.', 'When the Humane AI Pin launched, it piqued the interest of both consumers and technology enthusiasts. It was attractive to think that a device powered by AI could streamline life and help people be more productive. Numerous people expected that it would set new benchmarks in wearable technology and hence created considerable expectations among people who might consider using it.', 'However, as with numerous novel products, it is essential to manage expectations. The gap between what consumers hope for and what a product delivers can often lead to disappointment. In the current AI Pin discussions, this appears to be a significant factor.', 'Feedback began to pour in as users began to receive their Humane AI Pins. Many early adopters expressed dissatisfaction over a variety of issues, even though some of them praised its innovative design and the possibility of hands-free operation.', ""Innovative idea: Humans loved the thought of having an AI buddy that doesn't make use of traditional interfaces such as screens or keyboards.

The Humane AI Pin debacle is a reminder that AI alone doesn‚Äôt make a compelling product,https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-humane-ai-pin-debacle-is-a-reminder-that-ai-alone-doesnt-make-a-compelling-product-190119112.html,"['The demise of Humane is perhaps the most predictable tech story of 2025. The company tried to build some buzz around its AI Pin in late 2023, marketing the device as a tiny replacement for smartphones and playing up the fact that Humane‚Äôs co-founders were former Apple employees. The problem was that it wasn‚Äôt really clear what the AI Pin would do to justify its $700 asking price (plus a $24/month subscription).', 'It didn‚Äôt take long for things to spiral out of control. The AI Pin was released in April of 2024 to some of the worst reviews I‚Äôve ever seen for a consumer tech product. Just a month after launch, reports surfaced that the company was already trying to be acquired ‚Äî for the positively ludicrous sum of $750 million to $1 billion dollars. At the same time, it was rumored that Humane sold only 10,000 Pins, a far cry from the 100,000 they had planned for. HP was named as a potential suitor last May, and the company smartly waited until they could pluck Humane for a comparatively paltry $116 million.', 'As it turned out, waving your hands and shouting about the promise of AI doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to build compelling hardware ‚Äî we slammed its high price, terrible battery life, slow performance, excessive heat and hard-to-use projected display. (And Engadget was far from the only publication to eviscerate this device.)', 'For a device whose main interface was conversational, the challenges the AI Pin had answering questions or executing commands made it a non-starter. Even when it did what was asked, it did it in some strange ways, like sending generic texts instead of letting you dictate what exactly you wanted to say. Its camera rarely worked as intended; after taking photos and viewing them on the projector, the Pin would get extremely warm and sometimes just shut down entirely. Speaking of that projection screen, it was nearly impossible to actually see it outdoors, even on a cloudy day. And interacting with it made our reviewer Cherlynn Low want to ‚Äúrip [her] eyes out.‚Äù', 'Oh, let‚Äôs not forget that its extended battery case was recalled because it was a full-on fire hazard!', 'The whole debacle is an illustrative example of how most consumer-grade AI isn‚Äôt ready for prime time. Google and Apple may be trying to shove Gemini and Apple Intelligence down our throats on nearly every product they make, but those tools are additive, built on top of the strong foundations of each company‚Äôs existing platforms. In Humane‚Äôs case, there was nothing to fall back on. And the combo of terrible voice responses and recognition paired with a projector display that was not at all ready for prime time (not to mention the other hardware failings) was far too much to overcome.', 'There was simply no intelligence to be found here, artificial or otherwise.', 'To be fair to Humane, building hardware is notoriously difficult; first-generation products often have glaring flaws, even when you‚Äôre talking about massive companies like Apple. The first iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch may have shown huge promise, but they also had strange omissions and performance issues that made them hard to recommend to everyone.', 'Some companies manage to figure that out; Pebble is a great example of a hardware startup that survived some early issues to find some success. It beat Apple, Samsung and Google to the smartwatch market, and did it in a way that has yet to be imitated (maybe that‚Äôs why the company is being resurrected). The Pebble wasn‚Äôt exactly the most elegant piece of hardware, but both the watch and its software worked well enough that it paved the way for the more advanced smartwatches we have today. Of course, that wasn‚Äôt enough to keep Pebble alive, as the company eventually filed for insolvency and had its assets picked up by Fitbit (which was later purchased by Google, if you‚Äôre keeping track).', 'Humane‚Äôs situation at launch wasn‚Äôt entirely different ‚Äî it was trying to build a new type of hardware altogether, and history tells us that the first products in a new space are going to be far from perfect. But, if there had at least been a glimmer of useful software, Humane might have survived to improve on those hardware problems with a future version. But its assistant was so bad that it killed any potential that the AI Pin had. There was simply no intelligence to be found here, artificial or otherwise.', ""My takeaway from the Humane disaster is that it‚Äôs too soon to spend your hard-earned money on the promise of AI ‚Äî the marketplace isn't solidified at this point, and trusting a brand-new company like Humane to get this sort of thing right is several bridges too far. (If you're not convinced, look at the similarly flawed Rabbit R1.) Apple Intelligence is still half-baked at best, but at least you can turn it off and ignore it. But the AI Pin, well, relied completely on AI, and it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù ‚Äî it was one of the worst devices we‚Äôve ever tried in our nearly 21 years as a publication. For some thousands of early adopters, that means their Pin will be a brick in just a few days, with no financial compensation coming their way. But hey, at least it will still be able to tell you its battery level.""]"

Humane AI Pin bombed because voice control is (mostly) a terrible idea,https://www.cultofmac.com/news/humane-ai-pin-canceled,"['BY ED HARDY ‚Ä¢ 8:40 AM, FEBRUARY 23, 2025', 'A lesson Apple and other device makers should learn from the failure of the Humane AI Pin is that while voice control can have a role, it needs to be a very limited one. It‚Äôs simply not practical for people to talk to their computers except in special circumstances.', 'I hope the developers at Apple for Siri and HomePod took notes while Humane cratered.', 'The creators of the Humane AI Pin ‚Äî a group of Apple veterans ‚Äî seem to have watched a few too many Star Trek episodes. They looked at the combadge from TNG and set out to recreate it with current technology. They came up with a pin that users wore on their chest that gave them easy access to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. The device used a combination of voice control and hand gestures, and the gizmo included a laser that could project text onto the user‚Äôs palm.', 'Although reviewers tried very hard to like the product, they just couldn‚Äôt. Criticism flowed like lava over Pompeii, with disastrous results for the company.', 'Humane announced Tuesday that its servers will be shut down at the end of February, turning the $700 AI Pin into rubbish. HP bought its CosmOS software.', 'While the Humane AI Pin offers users more technical problems than features, those could have been overcome. What couldn‚Äôt be fixed is its basic design flaw: it tried to replace a touchscreen with voice commands.', 'I use voice commands many times every day to control the lights, temperature, music, etc. in my smart home. It‚Äôs a convenient system‚Ä¶ when I‚Äôm alone. When I have friends over, it becomes a hassle. I‚Äôd need to hush people from talking so I could order Siri turn up the living room lights, for example. Of course, I don‚Äôt do this ‚Äî I pull out my iPhone to make the adjustment. That‚Äôs because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands.', 'And I recently took a roadtrip with a couple of friends. One of them sat in the backseat and kept giving her iPhone voice commands, like ‚ÄúSend a text to Mary‚Äù and then dictating the text. It was kind of irritating for the rest of us in the car. That‚Äôs because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands.', 'We don‚Äôt want to listen to other people‚Äôs conversations. There‚Äôs no better proof than the guy in France who got fined ‚Ç¨200 for making a call on a speakerphone in a train station. And listening to people talk to their computers would be even worse. Imagine the cacophony on a train or coffee shop full of folks all talking to AIs via their smartphones. Instead, everyone quietly scrolls on a touchscreen, not bothering everyone around them. That‚Äôs because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands.', 'I joked earlier that the founders of Humane watched too many Star Trek episodes, but maybe they didn‚Äôt watch enough. While Kirk and Picard sometimes talk to their ships‚Äô computers, it‚Äôs only in special circumstances. The officers on the bridge of the Enterprise use consoles and screens ‚Äî they don‚Äôt all talk to the computer. That‚Äôs because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands.', 'Humane didn‚Äôt understand this, which is why the AI Pin cratered. The whole concept for the device was bad. But I think Apple does understand ‚Äî it explains the reports of a HomePod with a large touchscreen. That‚Äôll be in addition to support for voice commands, which the current versions already offer.', 'But Humane‚Äôs fall is not good news for the AI-enhanced version of Siri expected in the spring. While a smarter Siri is certainly welcome, better ways to interact with our iPhones via voice commands are not going to be a game-changer. That‚Äôs because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands.', 'I know I used that phrase five times, but repetition plays a key role in learning.

HP discontinuing the AI Pin is just the capper."", ""The withering of Humane's fortunes has more significant implications for another AI device, the Rabbit‚Äôs R1. The chirpy little AI gadget and the startup behind it may end up in a similar place as Humane if it's not careful. There are plenty of reasons why Humane may have failed, though I have a few theories."", 'The biggest reason may have been a lack of features people wanted. There were some intriguing ideas, like the screenless interaction with the AI, the laser projector that looked great in demo videos, and the continual link to the AI assistant. However, the reviews all highlighted slow AI processing, unreliable hardware, and feeling like the $24 monthly subscription fee was too much, especially on top of the $700 purchase price. As AI apps like ChatGPT improved, many may have decided they could get all the features they liked from their smartphone and returned the Humane AI Pin.', ""Rabbit should be taking notes. Right now, the R1 is struggling with some of the exact same issues: a lack of must-have features, performance hiccups, and a growing sense that it's an inessential accessory. Rushing out a prototype too quickly when the hardware is still unstable is a problem, especially when the hardware is the main selling point. A lack of certain features, like messaging and social media support, raises the same questions about its value as Humane faced."", ""I think the R1 can survive if Rabbit makes the right moves. That includes upgrading the R1‚Äôs Large Action Model (LAM) AI engine. The LAM is supposed to be the magic sauce that makes the R1 superior to Siri or Alexa, but even being just as good won't help it stand out. It needs to be instant and accurate when booking a ride, answering a question, or summarizing emails. Rabbit should throw everything they have into improving LAM, even if that means bringing in outside help and partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic."", ""Rabbit also needs to get deals in place to work with WhatsApp, Slack, and the Android and iOS messaging services at the very least. Even better, they should lean into voice-based messaging and AI-powered summaries, though they'd need to make sure they work at least as well as Apple Intelligence."", 'Ultimately, Rabbit needs to work out its positioning. Right now, it‚Äôs unclear who the R1 is for. Is it a productivity tool? A digital assistant for busy professionals? A toy for tech enthusiasts?
