,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/kash-patel-fbi-abuses-church/,"['', '', '', '', 'Fifty years ago, lawmakers started lifting the lid on the shocking abuses of the new Bureau chief’s most famous predecessor. The trouble is, very little changed.', 'When Kash Patel is confirmed this week as FBI director, he’ll go to work in a building that bears the name of J. Edgar Hoover, who headed the agency and its forerunner under eight presidents. To anyone who has grown up on Mars—as Elon Musk hopes people will in years to come—this might seem extraordinary. After all, a Senate investigation of US intelligence agencies—established on January 27, 1975—found that Hoover had orchestrated lawbreaking on an industrial scale for decades, causing people to lose their jobs, their liberty, and, in some cases, their lives.', 'On the face of it, President Trump has given Patel a brief to prevent the FBI from being “weaponized to persecute political opponents.” But don’t expect “political opponents” to mean progressive movements. Trump has already made clear his intent to clamp down on Palestine solidarity action with an executive order giving every department and agency of the federal government 60 days to “identify all civil and criminal authorities or actions…that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism.”', 'Hoover would have relished the task, judging by what Senator Frank Church and his committee discovered when they lifted the lid on the FBI activities in 1975. Their report, published the following year, was a blockbuster running to 2,679 pages. It had been produced in the face of stiff resistance from Hoover’s successor Clarence Kelley, who had refused to cooperate for six months, causing “great difficulties” for Frederick Schwarz, the inquiry’s chief counsel. When agreement was finally reached to give the Church Committee access to FBI files, Schwarz discovered that “substantial numbers of relevant, highly pertinent and sensitive Bureau documents” had been destroyed after Hoover’s death in 1972.', 'What Church exposed was nonetheless truly remarkable. The final report revealed that the FBI had engaged not only in highly intrusive domestic surveillance but also in illegal break-ins, smear campaigns and covert operations, known as COINTELPRO, to disrupt groups deemed “subversive.” Among its findings were:', 'FBI mass surveillance failed, however, to discover much that was actually unlawful. From a sample of 675 cases, Schwartz’s team found that only seven prosecutions were initiated—of which just four led to convictions.', 'Hoover’s abuses did, however, have an enormous human impact through other channels. As subsequent academic studies have revealed, the intelligence the FBI generated was used, both officially and illicitly, in multiple other ways with devastating consequences for tens of thousands of people.', 'According to David Caute in The Great Fear, FBI investigations led to 2,700 civilian dismissals and 12,000 resignations from government jobs under the Federal Loyalty Program and to the denial of clearance for 5,312 people under the Industrial Personnel Security Program. Seth Rosenfeld, author of Subversives, says that the FBI’s secret “Responsibilities Program” planted derogatory information anonymously on at least 908 people, more than half of whom were fired or forced out of academic and local government jobs.', 'As for the House un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), a University of Chicago study found that the intelligence provided by the FBI was used as ammunition in 172 hearings at which 3,079 witnesses placed into the public record 16,700 names of “misbehavers” most of whom were then blacklisted in some way.', 'Witnesses who refused to cooperate with HUAC would often be convicted of contempt of Congress and jailed. Across those targeted in different ways, hundreds ultimately suffered periods of incarceration—for contempt, for proxy offences unrelated to their political views, or using the 1940 Smith Act outlawing advocating the forcible overthrow of the government, under which 145 people were indicted, of whom 108 were convicted and sentenced to a total of 418 years in prison.', 'These US-wide developments were mirrored at a local level. In nearly every state, there were mini-HUACs, Smith Act replicas, oaths of allegiance, and blacklists. California’s Un-American Activities Committee, for example, published 15 reports and named in them some 20,000 people and organizations during its 30-year existence. In New York City, Caute says, the sustained purge of schools and colleges throughout the 1950s ended up ousting an estimated 379 teachers from their jobs.', 'A central issue facing Church was whether to ban the FBI from investigating “ideas or associations” completely. In a hearing on December 11, 1975, committee member Walter Mondale argued that such investigations should happen only by exception and “under the severest and most closely defined standards,” adding: “If we fail to do that, I am convinced that this committee has failed and that in another 50 years, there will be hearings just like this in which the excesses that we have uncovered will have been repeated.”', 'How right he was. Nearly all of Church’s 96 recommendations have been either ditched, diluted or defied. The Smith Act has not been repealed. New guidelines requiring the FBI to have “specific and articulable facts” concerning possible violence before targeting a political group were replaced as early as 1983 by a requirement only to have a “reasonable indication” of such a threat and have been watered down even further since.', 'A recommendation that judicial warrants must be obtained for surveillance, which led to Congress passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, mutated into a secret court nodding through virtually every request, including bulk authorizations since the act was amended in 2008. Meanwhile, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence—established in response to Church’s call for “intensified” congressional oversight—has proven hopelessly ineffective in living up to its brief.', 'ELIE MYSTAL', 'DAVE ZIRIN', 'JOAN WALSH', 'WOLF HERTZBERG', 'While the Church Committee’s exposure of past abuses was historic, the harsh reality is that it failed to produce a fundamental change in the modus operandi of US intelligence agencies. The FBI did not even make cosmetic changes. Not only is its headquarters still named after Hoover; its website has a tribute to his third in command, Cartha De Loach, who continued to work for the agency as a consultant after the Church inquiry and was hailed when he died in 2013 by the then–FBI Director Robert Mueller as someone who upheld the agency’s “highest ideals.”', 'At the heart of the problem is the question of whom the intelligence agencies deem “subversive” to the interests they serve. In the decade following Church, the FBI targeted groups campaigning against US military intervention in Central America. The American Civil Liberties Union discovered in 2008 that the FBI had been targeting anti-war groups such as the Thomas Merton Center and United for Peace and Justice. In recent years, it has mounted surveillance and covert operations against racial justice activists. Now pro-Palestine protesters are top of the list.', 'To make matters worse, the FBI now has 38,000 staff, compared to the 4,602 at the height of the witch hunt in 1950—and access to technology beyond Hoover’s wildest dreams. While Washington politicians worry about this force being weaponized against each other, the real issue for progressives is whether it is being used for repression of dissent.', 'The lesson from Hoover’s era is the classic adage that we must not stand by while they come for people whose views we don’t wholly or even partially share. Hoover may have started with communists—but social democrats and liberals soon found themselves caught in his net. It was not until the latter stages of the witch hunt that opposition to it took on a mass character, as happened with protests against HUAC hearings in San Juan in 1959 and San Francisco in 1960. Those events were the beginning of the end for HUAC, though it would also take a burglary in 1971 by seven brave civil rights activists to expose the way Hoover had turned to covert action as other weapons in his war on progressives were being denied him.', 'Today, we should expect Trump and Patel to act fast and fiercely in cracking down on political dissent. Sadly, liberal failure to fight for the implementation of the Church report has gifted them with an FBI still rooted in the culture of Hoover.', 'Steve Howell is a journalist and the author of Game Changer: Eight Weeks That Transformed British Politics, a book on the 2017 UK general election—during which he was an adviser to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He has also written two novels, Collateral Damage and Over The Line.', 'When hospitals suddenly stop treatment for trans patients, real people are harmed immediately. “I was sent links to suicide hotlines instead of a prescription,” one person told us...', 'ELSIE CARSON-HOLT', 'Maybe because its support for students is popular with Republicans as well as Democrats.

US Senate narrowly confirms Kash Patel as next FBI director,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/20/kash-patel-senate-confirms-fbi-director,"['Key Trump ally, who aligns with US president on range of issues, wins confirmation in 51-49 Senate vote', 'The US Senate on Thursday confirmed Kash Patel as the next FBI director, handing oversight of the nation’s premier law enforcement agency to an official who has declined to explicitly say whether he would use his position to pursue Donald Trump’s political opponents.', 'Patel was narrowly confirmed in a 51-49 vote, a reflection of the polarizing nature of his nomination and what Democrats see as his unwillingness to keep the bureau independent from partisan politics.', 'Notably, at his hearing before the judiciary committee, Patel refused to commit that he would not use his position to investigate officials he portrayed as Trump’s adversaries in his book, and affirmed that he believed the FBI was answerable to the White House.', 'Patel’s responses suggest that his arrival at FBI headquarters will usher in a new chapter for the bureau as a result of his adherence to Trump’s vision of a unitary executive, where the president directs every agency.', 'That objective to implement the Trump administration’s mandate has already taken hold at the justice department, which oversees the bureau and last week forced through the dismissal of corruption charges against Eric Adams, the New York mayor, in order to get his help to deport undocumented immigrants.', 'The greatest challenge for recent FBI directors has been the delicate balance of retaining Trump’s confidence while resisting pressure to make public pronouncements or open criminal investigations that might personally benefit the president.', 'Patel is unlikely to have difficulties, such is his ideological alignment with Trump on a range of issues including the need to pursue retribution against any perceived enemies like former special counsel Jack Smith and others who investigated him during his first term.', 'The new leadership at the FBI also comes as questions about the far-reaching nature of his loyalty to Trump remain unresolved. At his confirmation hearing, Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee tried in vain to elicit answers about his role as a witness in the criminal investigation into Trump’s mishandling of classified documents.', 'During the investigation, Patel was subpoenaed to testify about whether the documents the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago had been declassified under a “standing declassification order”, as he had represented in various public comments at the time.', 'The Guardian reported at the time that Patel initially declined to appear, citing his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. He later testified after the chief US district judge in Washington authorized Patel to have limited immunity from prosecution, which forced his testimony.', 'That loyalty, to resist federal prosecutors, endeared him to Trump and is understood to have played a factor in him ultimately getting tapped for the FBI director position after Trump struggled for weeks to decide who he wanted at the bureau, a person familiar with the matter said.', 'Patel ultimately clarified, in something of a partial admission under close questioning from senator Cory Booker, that although he witnessed Trump issue a declassification order for some documents, he did not actually know whether they applied to the documents found at Mar-a-Lago.', 'Democrats have unanimously considered Patel’s track record in the first Trump administration, his incendiary remarks criticizing the bureau he was nominated to lead and more generally his role in the classified documents case to be disqualifying.', 'When Trump tapped Patel last year, Democrats largely believed it would lead to a backlash that would sink his nomination. No resistance ever materialized, in part because Patel was less controversial than some of Trump’s other nominees, such as Pete Hegseth for defense secretary.', 'Patel was formerly a public defender in Florida before joining the justice department in 2014 as a line prosecutor in the national security division.', 'In 2017, Patel became a top Republican aide on the House intelligence committee, where he authored a politically charged memo accusing the FBI and the justice department of abusing surveillance powers to spy on a Trump adviser. The memo was criticized as misleading, though an inspector general later found errors with aspects of the surveillance.', 'His efforts impressed Trump, who brought him into the administration and quickly elevated him to national security and defense roles. By the end of Trump’s first term, he was the chief of staff to defense secretary Chris Miller and briefly considered for CIA director.', 'While John Durham, the special counsel appointed by Trump, found a catalog of mistakes by prosecutors in the Russia investigation, he found no evidence that officials had been motivated by political animus and brought no charges – contrary to claims by Trump and Patel.']"

Mr. Schiff described Mr. Patel as a “political hack” and a “sycophant” who is unqualified for the position. He went on to add that Mr. Patel is absolutely unqualified for the job and the Republicians are also aware about the same.', 'Mr. Schiff added, “The only qualification Kash Patel has to be FBI director is that when everyone else in the first Trump administration said ‘no, I won’t do that, that crosses moral, ethical, legal lines’, Kash Patel said sign me up.”', 'Meanwhile, in a bid to block Mr. Patel’s confirmation in the final attempt, about half a dozen Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats gathered outside FBI headquarters earlier that day.', 'Following Mr. Schiff’s sharp criticism, speculations have surfaced that he may be added to list of “enemies” Kash Patel mentioned in his 2023 book Government Gangsters.

White House officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.', 'Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats’ concerns about the steadfast Trump ally’s plans to radically overhaul the FBI.', 'ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation’s laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it’s in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.', 'The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.', 'The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF’s top lawyer.

Trump Devotee Kash Patel Confirmed As FBI Director By Senate,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-devotee-kash-patel-confirmed-as-fbi-director-by-senate_n_67a25226e4b00f88fbeb12ef,"['', 'Despite promoting debunked far-right conspiracy theories popular with movements like QAnon — including the claim that the FBI incited the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — and a very public record of calling for so-called “deep state” operatives who oppose President Donald Trump to be punished, Kash Patel has been confirmed as director of the FBI.', 'The Senate confirmed Patel 51-49.', 'He will oversee more than 38,000 civil servants, of whom 13,000 are special agents, over a 10-year term.', 'Patel’s confirmation hearing in January before the Senate Judiciary Committee featured the president’s avowed ally working hard to repel concerns that he would weaponize the bureau and return it to an era of retribution and paranoia promulgated by the agency’s first-ever director, J. Edgar Hoover.', 'Patel deflected last month when grilled about a list of “deep state” enemies he published in the appendix of his book, “Government Gangsters.” Patel called it a “glossary” and told legislators that describing it as an enemies list was a “total mischaracterization,” even though the 60 names on the list are almost all known public critics of Trump.', 'Before Patel was confirmed, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged lawmakers to understand the gravity of their decision.', '“For the ordinary nominee, any of the defects in character or experience or performance in past jobs would have been disqualifying. We live in a time that is not ordinary, and this nominee is not normal. I’ve never seen any nominee to a position of significant responsibility that has as many disqualifying factors in his or her background,” he said before invoking the words of Trump’s onetime national security adviser John Bolton.', 'Bolton, who recently had his Secret Service protection pulled by Trump, compared Patel to the notorious Soviet secret police chief Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, who advised Joseph Stalin and was known for telling the dictator, “Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime.”', '“He calls it something different. He calls it ‘Government Gangsters’ and he says he is on a ‘manhunt’ for them.” That’s his word. He can use different words, but he is on a mission to use the powers of this office and Donald Trump’s name for political retribution against his enemies, Trump’s enemies, against MAGA’s opponents. To use these institutions for political retribution is the height of irresponsibility. … He doesn’t just hint it at. It’s a theme that runs through his public comments,” Blumenthal said.', 'Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) had similar concerns ahead of the vote Thursday.', 'Speaking at a press conference in front of the FBI building in Washington, Whitehouse said Patel will be the first senior law enforcement official ever confirmed who has pleaded the Fifth Amendment.', 'Patel has offered zero explanation as to why he invoked his right against self-incrimination when he was called to testify in 2022 before a grand jury investigating Trump’s alleged unlawful retention of classified documents.', '“Kash Patel, mark my words, will cause evil in this building behind us,” Whitehouse said. “And the Republicans who work for him will rue that day.”', 'The Republicans who voted against Patel included Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.', 'Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, hailed the confirmation in a statement.', '“Change is coming to the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building, and that is a good thing. Over the past several years, political infection has diminished the FBI’s credibility and distracted the Bureau from its core law enforcement responsibilities. As FBI Director, Kash Patel promises to restore the FBI’s primary focus on law and order, as well as national security, and do right by the brave FBI agents who work day in and day out to keep Americans safe. From a congressional oversight standpoint, you can bet I’ll be keeping a close watch to ensure Congress gets answers to our questions and transparency assured.”', 'Patel started his career as a public defender in Florida and then moved to the Justice Department to work as a prosecutor. He later served as a national security adviser and counsel to Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. He worked his way into the first Trump White House by becoming deputy assistant to the president for the National Security Council and later, he served as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense at the Department of Defense.', 'It was during this time that Patel worked to discredit the Mueller report. (He was the primary author of a report that accused federal investigators of political bias against Trump.)', 'In January, CNN reported exclusively that the CIA once referred Patel for criminal investigation during the end of Trump’s first administration. There was concern that Patel may have shared classified information in 2020 about Mueller’s probe with officials who were not permitted to see the records. Patel denied any wrongdoing and no charges were ever filed.', 'In 2023, Patel told Steve Bannon, once briefly Trump’s adviser at the White House, that as director of the FBI, he would “come after people in the media who lied about American citizens” and those who “helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.” When the committee asked him about these comments, he responded by vowing that he wouldn’t tolerate politicization at the bureau. He also refused to say whether former President Joe Biden had won the 2020 election.', 'Patel’s political devotion to Trump runs deep. He even published a series of children’s books starting in 2022 — the last one was published in 2024 — where he cast himself as a wizard who aids “King Donald” in his pursuit to unravel a series of conspiracies to remove the leader from power.', 'Ahead of his confirmation, a financial disclosure form Patel provided to the committee revealed that he received $25,000 from the Los Angeles, California-based Global Tree Pictures, an entity managed by Igor Lopatonok, a Russian film producer with U.S citizenship.', 'According to an investigation undertaken by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project last spring, Lopatonok promotes pro-Russian propaganda and narratives for his films that are laudatory of strongmen like Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko or Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Lopatonok’s ventures have also received funding, as The Washington Post first reported, from groups created by Russian President Vladimir Putin.', 'Patel received the money from Global Tree Pictures for his part in the documentary series “All the President’s Men: The Conspiracy Against Donald Trump,” a film that aired exclusively on the Tucker Carlson Network. In the series, Patel said he wanted to turn the FBI headquarters into a “museum of the ‘deep state’” after he shuttered it.', 'Durbin asked Grassley for a second open hearing to address this and other lingering questions he had about Patel before confirming him. That included questions about allegations Durbin said he received from whistleblowers at the FBI.', 'The whistleblowers allegedly told Durbin that Patel was secretly overseeing a slew of FBI firings even before his confirmation was complete. Durbin said his sources reported the firings were being coordinated with senior White House officials.', 'Patel brushed off the claims through his spokeswoman Erica Knight. She dubbed it mere “gossip” in a social media post. Grassley refused the request for a second hearing, saying it was unnecessary and an attempt by Democrats to “mischaracterize and malign” the nominee.', 'Acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove — once Trump’s personal lawyer — fired a half dozen FBI executives in January before demanding that the FBI’s acting director Brian Driscoll hand over a list of all bureau staff who worked on the Jan. 6 investigation or other Trump-related cases. Driscoll complied and since then, litigation has ensued against the Justice Department from FBI agents who say the administration is eager to retaliate against them for their work. (A judge has since ordered the Justice Department not to make the names public — or share it with any other officials including so-called special government employee Elon Musk — without first providing the court 48 hours notice.)', 'Neither the White House nor the Justice Department returned requests for comment to HuffPost.', 'Patel’s rise to the role of FBI director is a near-perfect fairytale ending for a Trump ally who has wantonly described his desire to tear down institutions that he claims are rife with misconduct.', 'According to an AP report published in January, Patel has zealously castigated the nation’s institutions, specifically the DOJ and FBI, hundreds of times in the last four years. Whether it was Trump’s alleged role in conspiring to subvert the 2020 election, illegally retaining classified documents or advancing fake elector slates, Patel has fiercely defended Trump and his claims of broad immunity and sweeping executive power. Patel has called the prosecutions “baseless” while making baseless claims himself, including that FBI informants fomented the attack on the Capitol. A Justice Department watchdog report found this was not true.', 'Patel, who has hawked supplements and Trump merch regularly, also boasted of producing a song by the “J6 Prison Choir.”', '“We just took a flame thrower to the music industry,” Patel said in March 2023, heralding the release of the song “Justice for All” by a group of now-pardoned rioters who were detained at the jail in Washington, D.C.', 'Yet at his confirmation hearing when asked whether he knew that most of those singing in the choir were imprisoned for assaulting police, Patel drew a blank.', 'He told lawmakers he was “not aware of that” despite also taking credit for the song during an 2023 interview with Steve Bannon. (Patel told Bannon “we went to a studio and recorded it, mastered it, digitized it and put it out as a song.”)', 'Though he’s denied awareness of the choir’s individual membership, generally speaking Patel has broadly categorized Jan. 6 rioters exactly as Trump has: In a Truth Social post, while casting the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6 as a “protest for election integrity,” the now-FBI director referred to the choir members as “political prisoners.”', 'One of those choir members was the recently pardoned Julian Khater. Khater pleaded guilty to assaulting U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick with pepper spray. Sicknick died after suffering multiple strokes. Though medical examiners ruled Sicknick died of natural causes, they said the onslaught he faced at the Capitol played a direct role in his death.', 'Patel disturbingly evaded other questions during his confirmation hearing, too. He denied knowing far-right commentator and white nationalist Stew Peters “off the top” of his head. But Peters, who once had a Jan. 6 defendant on his show and discussed a need for retribution against those who prosecuted Jan. 6 crimes, said Patel was “lying” about not knowing him.', 'Patel “absolutely does know who I am,” Peters said after the hearing.', 'For a time, they texted “constantly” on personal cell phones, he added.', 'Patel appeared on Peters’ show at least eight times, according to Durbin.', 'A year ago, Patel said the world needed to be educated “on the weaponization of justice that occurred on Jan. 6” and that with Trump back in power, there would be an investigation of members of Congress he claimed destroyed and withheld evidence.', 'He’s also vowed to “come after” journalists.', '“We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said in 2023. “Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out.”', ""The next four years will change America forever.

US Senate confirms Kash Patel for a 10-year term to lead the FBI,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/us-senate-confirms-kash-patel-for-a-10-year-term-to-lead-the-fbi,"['Two Republicans voted against Patel, citing questions about how his ‘political activities’ may affect his leadership.', 'The United States Senate has voted to confirm former federal prosecutor Kash Patel as the next director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), continuing a streak of success for President Donald Trump’s government nominees.', 'But Thursday’s confirmation came by slim margins. Only 51 senators, all Republican, voted in favour of Patel in the 100-seat Senate.', 'There were two notable defections from the Republican Party: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. They joined 47 Democrats in opposing what critics have called a dangerous nomination to lead the FBI.', '“\u200aMr Patel’s record demonstrates that he’s dangerous, inexperienced and dishonest,” Democratic Senator Dirk Durbin of Illinois said. “He should not and cannot serve as an effective FBI director.”', 'For his part, in a social media post, Patel thanked Trump and said he was honoured to be confirmed.', '“The politicalization of our justice system has eroded public trust — but that ends today,” Patel wrote. “My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops — and rebuild trust in the FBI.”', 'But in the lead-up to the vote, a parade of Democratic lawmakers, including Durbin, took the Senate floor to warn against confirming Patel, saying he would indeed politicise the FBI.', 'They raised questions about his ability to lead the FBI fairly, given past statements that suggested he might use the bureau’s resources to go after Trump’s political rivals and journalists.', '“\u200aIt is shocking that my Republican colleagues are willing to support him despite the serious threat he poses to our national security,” Durbin said.', '“I’m sorry to say, I believe they will quickly come to regret this vote. When I think of giving this man a 10-year tenure as director of the leading criminal investigative agency in the world, I cannot imagine a worse choice.”', 'Those concerns were reflected in the historically tight margins through which Patel’s confirmation passed. His predecessors at the FBI were approved with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.', 'Former FBI director Christopher Wray won confirmation in 2017 with 92 votes. Before him, in 2013, James Comey notched 93 votes in support. And for Robert Mueller in 2001, the vote was unanimous, 98 to zero.', 'Still, with a solid 53-member Republican majority in the Senate, none of President Trump’s nominees are expected to fall short in a confirmation vote.', 'Even Mitch McConnell of Kentucky — who has broken ranks with his fellow Republicans over the confirmations of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F Kennedy Jr — threw his support behind Patel on Thursday.', 'But in separate statements, Collins and Murkowski explained they could not vote for Patel for fear he might use the FBI for political gain.', '“My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership,” Murkowski wrote. “The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores.”', 'Collins echoed that sentiment, saying Patel’s “aggressive political activity” cast doubt on his ability to lead a nonpartisan bureau.', '“Mr. Patel’s recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI,” Collins explained in her statement.', 'This is not the first time that Patel has fractured Republicans under Trump’s leadership.', 'During Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2021, Patel served in a variety of roles, including in the National Security Council and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.', 'But news reports emerged that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Gina Haspel threatened to resign over the prospect of Trump naming Patel as her deputy.', 'In a memoir, Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during Trump’s first term, also recalled shooting down a proposal to make Patel the deputy director of the FBI, saying it would be “over my dead body”.', 'During his confirmation hearings in January, Patel defended himself against allegations that he would leverage the FBI to do Trump’s bidding. He also denied that he would do anything unlawful if confirmed as FBI director.', '“I have no interest, no desire and will not, if confirmed, go backwards. There will be no politicisation of the FBI,” Patel told Democratic senators as he faced heated questioning.', 'Patel also sketched out his plans to increase the FBI’s law enforcement capabilities, including through the distribution of greater resources across the 50 states.', '“A third of the workforce for the FBI works in Washington, DC,” Patel replied. “I am fully committed to having that workforce go out into the interior of the country where I live, west of the Mississippi, and work with sheriff’s departments and local officers.”', 'The son of Indian immigrants who moved from Uganda to Canada and later the US, Patel denounced the attacks on his character as “false accusations and grotesque mischaracterisations”.', 'But he has been repeatedly confronted with his own words, from multiple appearances on podcasts and books he has written.', 'Patel, for instance, has spread the conspiracy theory that the FBI planned the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a “false flag” operation to corner Trump supporters.', 'In a September interview on The Shawn Ryan Show, Patel also threatened to “shut down” the FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, and turn it into a “museum for the deep state”.', 'And speaking to Trump ally Steve Bannon in 2023, Patel pledged to go after the president’s political rivals, which he described as “criminals” and “conspirators”. He also repeated false claims that Trump’s election defeat in 2020 against Joe Biden was fraudulent.', '“We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media,” Patel said. “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.”', 'Patel has even penned a children’s book, The Plot Against the King, that depicted Trump as a monarch besieged by antagonists styled after Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, his Democratic rivals in the 2016 and 2024 presidential races, respectively.', 'And Democrats have slammed him for his association with the “J6 choir”, made up of defendants who were arrested after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.', 'In the minutes before the Senate voted to confirm Patel, Democratic Senator Alex Padilla of California characterised Patel as using Trump as his “cash cow” — a tool to book media appearances and publishing deals.', 'Padilla also questioned whether Patel had the law enforcement or intelligence experience to qualify for the job as FBI director.', '“Kash Patel has demonstrated a dangerous lack of judgement, lack of preparation and lack of independence,” Padilla said. “He’s shown that he’s either unwilling or unable of putting politics aside in order to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution, should he be confirmed to lead the FBI.”', 'Senator Adam Schiff, another California Democrat, echoed his colleague. He expressed concern that the FBI would be gutted under Patel’s leadership, as part of Trump’s slashes to the federal workforce.', '“\u200aIn a democracy, law enforcement does not serve the president, let alone someone who fashions himself as a king. Law enforcement serves the people,” Schiff said.', '“\u200aI’m of the opinion that the people the FBI should be going on manhunts for are actual criminals, not the president’s enemies of the day.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska voting against Patel—a staunch Trump loyalist who faces opposition from Democrats over threats to go after political enemies.', 'Kash Patel, U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee to be Director of the Federal Bureau of ... [+]', 'Feb. 20, 2025The Senate confirmed Patel, 51-49.', 'Feb. 20, 2025Collins, who also voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said in a statement Thursday she would vote “no” on confirming Patel, citing his “high profile and aggressive political activity” in a statement that said his previous criticism of the FBI and fears that FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases could be retaliated against “cast doubt on Mr. Patel’s ability to advance the FBI’s law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation.”', 'Murkowski said she would oppose Patel because of “his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership,” citing his refusal to push back on the Trump administration’s request for a list of agents who were involved in the Jan. 6 investigations.', 'Feb. 13, 2025The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-10 along party lines to approve Patel’s nomination and refer him to the full Senate for confirmation.', 'Democrats voiced their strong opposition to Patel during Thursday’s hearing, with Ranking Member Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., saying the Senate is “inviting a political disaster if we put Kash Patel into this job,” and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., telling his GOP colleagues, “Mark my words, this Patel guy will come back to haunt you.”', 'Feb. 11, 2025 Durbin said in a letter to the Justice Department’s internal watchdog he “received highly credible information from multiple sources” (which were not named) that Patel had been “personally directing the ongoing purge of career civil servants” at the FBI, despite saying in his hearing last week he was “not aware of” any plans to punish or terminate personnel associated with investigations into Trump, according to a letter obtained by The New York Times.', '“It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership,” Durbin said in the letter, adding: “If these allegations are true, Mr. Patel may have perjured himself.”', 'In a statement to Forbes, Patel’s spokesperson Erica Knight said “the media is relying on anonymous sources and second-hand gossip to push a false narrative,” and that Patel is “a highly qualified national security expert who has been fully transparent with the American people throughout this process and has demonstrated the integrity and leadership needed for this role.”', 'Feb. 6, 2025The Senate Judiciary Committee met on whether to approve Patel but delayed the vote by a week, after Democrats moved to “hold over” the nomination—with Durbin arguing Patel “does not have the temperament for the job.”', 'Jan. 30, 2025In an exchange with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Patel said he would not “lie” for Trump—though Patel previously refused to tell Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., whether he would resign if Trump ever asked him to go after a political enemy or block an investigation into a Trump ally.', 'Jan. 30, 2025After Patel told senators he didn’t have any knowledge of specific Jan. 6 rioters, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., asked Patel about comments he made to Steve Bannon in which he described how “we” recorded the Jan. 6 anthem “Justice for All” with participants in the riot—but Patel, who produced the song, claimed not to have had any involvement in the process of recording the track, insisting his use of the term “we” doesn’t imply he had any role in the recording process.', 'Jan. 30, 2025In an exchange with Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., Patel refused to say former President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, only saying Biden was certified and served as president even when repeatedly pressed to admit Biden won the race.', 'Jan. 30, 2025Patel refused to explicitly say he would not investigate specific former officials who have been critical of Trump and appeared on the “enemies list” in his 2023 book, like former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General William Barr, telling Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, only that he has “no intention of going backwards” in his work at the FBI.', 'Jan. 30, 2025After Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., brought up an “enemies list” of anti-Trump government officials Patel included in his 2023 book and the nominee’s suggestion he wants to “shut down” the FBI’s headquarters and reopen it as a “museum of the deep state,” Patel called it a “gross mischaracterization” to describe the grouping in his book an “enemies list,” and said that if “the best attacks on me are going to be false accusations and gross mischaracterizations, the only thing this body is doing is defeating the credibility of the men and women at the FBI.” (Klobuchar responded she was “quoting [Patel’s] words directly.”)', 'Jan. 30, 2025Patel appeared to disagree with Trump’s decision to pardon all Jan. 6 rioters, specifically those who were charged with assaulting Capitol police officers, telling Durbin he “[does] not agree with the commutation of any sentence of any individual who committed violence against law enforcement.”', 'Jan. 30, 2025In his opening statement Thursday, Patel touted his belief that “all Americans” must be afforded “due process without bias” and said his priorities at the FBI will be to “tackle violent crime” and let Congress conduct “aggressive Constitutional oversight” over the agency—after Democrats already started railing against Patel’s nomination, with Durbin saying Patel “traffics in debunked conspiracy theories” and “has neither the experience, the temperament nor the judgment” to lead the FBI.', 'Jan. 29, 2025Patel published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, saying he’s “committed to working alongside the dedicated men and women of the FBI” and restoring “public trust” in the agency.', 'Jan. 27, 2025Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee announced they’re requesting documents from federal agencies regarding “alleged misconduct” by Patel during the first Trump administration, with CBS News reporting an anonymous FBI whistleblower contacted the committee with allegations that Patel violated protocol by confirming a hostage exchange to the press before it was completed (a source denied the allegations to CBS).', 'Jan. 23, 2025Patel’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled for Thursday, January 30.', 'Jan. 15, 2025Senate Democrats grilled Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi about Patel’s nomination during Bondi’s confirmation hearing, asking the nominee about Patel’s “enemies list” of former government officials—to which Bondi said she believes Patel “is the right person at this time for this job” but argued there will “never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice” if she’s attorney general.', 'Dec. 11, 2024FBI Director Christopher Wray announced his intention to resign, clearing the way for Trump to install Patel as the next FBI chief.', 'Nov. 30, 2024Trump announced he’s nominating Patel to be the next FBI director, following reports that Patel was being floated for the position.', 'If the Senate Judiciary Committee signs off on Patel Thursday as expected, he will go to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. It’s still unclear when that vote will take place.', 'A lawyer by trade, Patel briefly served in the Justice Department during the Obama administration before moving to the House after Trump took office. He spent two years as senior counsel to former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., when he led the House Intelligence Committee in 2017 and 2018, helping with the committee’s widely criticized inquiry into the FBI’s Russia investigation and writing the widely criticized memo that came out of that probe. The memo alleged missteps at the FBI in its investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia, which Democrats criticized as a “misleading” document that compromised national security and was largely an effort to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump. Patel joined the Trump administration after Democrats took back the House in 2018, going from serving as Trump’s senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council to senior adviser for Trump’s directors of national intelligence, and then finally being promoted to chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller during Trump’s final months in office. The Washington Post reported Patel was the de facto head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Pentagon when he was at those agencies, even if other people held the director title.', 'Patel garnered criticism from officials in Trump’s first administration as he “appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump” while in office, The Atlantic reports. Patel followed Trump’s policy aims and rhetoric in wanting to seek revenge against a so-called Deep State of political enemies, and was focused on getting rid of officials within intelligence agencies and helping carry out the Trump team’s plan to “restrict the intelligence agencies’ power,” according to The Post. He reportedly butted heads with top officials in the first Trump administration who weren’t always willing to side with the then-president’s more extreme views and believed Patel did not have sufficient experience for his roles. Trump tried to install Patel to serve as deputy director of the CIA or FBI in the final months of his presidency, according to multiple reports, but backed down after then-CIA Director Gina Haspel and then-Attorney General William Barr threatened to resign over the move, with The Times reporting Barr vowed Patel would help lead the FBI “over my dead body.”', 'Beyond his extreme loyalty to Trump and desire to clean house at intelligence agencies, outlets including The Atlantic, Times and Post have pointed to multiple particularly controversial moments during Trump’s first term that illustrated why officials had issues with Patel. Former NSC official Fiona Hill testified during Trump’s first impeachment trial that a staffer told her Patel, when he was at the NSC, was privately feeding Trump information about Ukraine and the then-president described him as the council’s “Ukraine director.” Hill said that “alarmed everybody,” because Ukraine was not part of Patel’s remit and he was not on the list to receive materials about it. The Post also reports that Patel pushed officials to declassify information that would harm national security and the military, according to an anonymous senior defense official.', 'Trump-era officials raised issues with an instance in which Patel claimed that then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told him the U.S. had received airspace permission from Nigeria as it executed a rescue mission to retrieve an American hostage. That was in fact not true, and the plane had to circle around while officials scrambled to alert Nigerian authorities about their plan, with Pompeo saying he had never spoken with Patel. Patel denied both of those instances to The Atlantic. That hostage retrieval is separate from the instance Senate Democrats are seeking information on, in which Patel allegedly confirmed a hostage exchange to The Wall Street Journal before the hostages were in U.S. custody. That would violate protocols requiring such hostage missions to be kept confidential until they’re complete. An anonymous source responded to those allegations to CBS News, saying there is “no veracity” to the allegations Patel breached protocol.', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', '“A lot of people say he’s crazy,” Trump reportedly said about Patel, according to an anonymous adviser cited by The Atlantic. “I think he’s kind of crazy. But sometimes you need a little crazy.”', 'Democrats have been staunchly opposed to Patel’s nomination, with Durbin saying in a statement Patel is the “wrong choice” and “has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the FBI.” “Mr. Patel’s political grievances make him a favorite of the MAGA world, but they have not prepared him to work night and day to keep us safe from violent crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, and other threats,” Durbin said. Given Republicans’ Senate majority, Patel could be confirmed without any Democratic support, however, and GOP lawmakers have been largely positive about the Trump nominee. “I am ready to vote for Kash Patel,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CBS News Sunday, while Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in December the FBI nominee is “the real deal.” (Both serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee.) “I assume that Mr. Patel will be confirmed as the next FBI director,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, another Senate Judiciary member, told CNN in December, saying he was “certainly inclined to support him – barring some unforeseen circumstances.” It still remains to be seen how some Senate Republicans viewed as potential swing votes will rule on Patel, however, particularly Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.', '“No part of the FBI’s mission is safe with Kash Patel in any position of leadership in the FBI, and certainly not in the deputy director’s job,” former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN in November, saying the “scope of authority” in that job is “enormous.” “If you enter into that position with nothing more than a desire to disrupt and destroy the organization, there is a lot of damage someone like Kash Patel could do,” McCabe added.', 'Patel has remained a key Trump supporter since leaving the White House, going on to launch an organization called The Kash Network that funds legal and educational efforts for people in line with Trump, including “whistleblowers” and “defamed American citizens” and educating “the public in areas the mainstream media refuses to cover.” The former adviser has also been an outspoken Trump advocate in the media, frequently appearing on right-wing podcasts and programs, and launched a line of merchandise highlighting Trump and Jan. 6 rioters. He has also penned a children’s book called “The Plot Against The King” that paints him as a wizard defending “King Donald” and helped produce the pro-Jan. 6 rioter anthem “Justice for All.” Patel testified before a grand jury in the investigation that led to Trump being indicted for allegedly withholding White House documents, with the Associated Press reporting he received immunity for his testimony, after claiming to Breitbart News that Trump broadly declassified materials while he was in office.', 'Patel has broadly vowed to retaliate against Trump’s enemies during a second stint in the White House, telling Steve Bannon on his “War Room” podcast that he wanted to go after perceived enemies “not just in government but in the media.” “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 election. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. ... We’re putting you all on notice.” Patel’s book “Government Gangsters” also calls for a “comprehensive housecleaning” of officials at the DOJ and firing the “top ranks” at the FBI, as quoted by ABC News. He argues in his book that anyone at the FBI should be prosecuted who ""in any way abused their authority for political ends,” ABC reports, writing that ""the FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.” Other measures that Patel could seek to impose in a second Trump term include taking away security clearances from anyone involved with the FBI’s Russia investigation, shutting down the FBI’s main Washington, D.C., headquarters and sending most officials out into the field, and declassifying and releasing documents from the FBI’s Russia investigation, according to ABC.', 'Trump named Patel as his FBI nominee in November, even before current FBI Director Christopher Wray announced in December he intended to resign. Trump was widely expected to replace Wray, whom Trump initially hired in 2017, but Wray’s decision to leave on his own with more than two years left in his decade-long term allowed Trump to avoid political blowback from firing the FBI chief. Patel’s nomination as FBI director comes as Trump has been focused on staffing his second term with loyalists who will carry out his agenda and more extreme proposals, as the incoming president reportedly wants to avoid issues during his first term with top figures like Haspel and Barr refusing to capitulate to his demands. Patel is one of several controversial nominees Trump has named to top roles in his administration, like choosing former Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense, Robert F.

But he also echoed Trump’s desire for retribution. Patel raised alarm among Democrats for saying before he was nominated that he would “come after” anti-Trump “conspirators” in the federal government and the media.', 'Republicans angry over what they see as law enforcement bias against conservatives during the Democratic Biden administration, as well as criminal investigations into Trump, have rallied behind Patel as the right person for the job.', '“Mr. Patel wants to make the FBI accountable once again -– get back the reputation that the FBI has had historically for law enforcement,” Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said before Patel was confirmed. “He wants to hold the FBI accountable to Congress, to the president and, most importantly, to the people they serve — the American taxpayer.”', 'Democrats complained about Patel’s lack of management experience compared with previous FBI directors and they highlighted incendiary past statements that they said called his judgment into question.', '“I am absolutely sure of this one thing: this vote will haunt anyone who votes for him. They will rue the day they did it,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.', 'He added: “To my Republican colleagues, think about what you will tell your constituents” and family “about why you became voted for this person who will so completely and utterly disgrace this office and do such grave damage to our nation’s justice system.”', 'About a half-dozen Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee gathered outside FBI headquarters earlier Thursday in a last-ditch plea to derail his confirmation.', '“This is someone we cannot trust,” said Sen.

We know that, our Republican colleagues know that.”', 'Patel’s eyebrow-raising remarks on hundreds of podcasts and in other interviews over the past four years include referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as “criminal gangsters,” saying some Jan. 6 rioters were “political prisoners” and proposing to shut down the FBI headquarters and turning it into a museum for the so-called deep state.', 'At his Senate hearing in January, Patel said Democrats were taking some of his comments out of context or misunderstanding the broader point that he was trying to make. Patel has also denied the idea that a list in book he authored of government officials who he said were part of a “deep state” amounted to an “enemies list,” calling that a “total mischaracterization.”', 'FBI directors are given 10-year terms as a way to insulate them from political influence and keep them from becoming beholden to a particular president or administration.

THE JUDGE RULING YESTERDAY REFUSED THE REQUEST BY 14 DEMOCRAT STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL TO IMMEDIATELY OPPOSE WIDE-RANGING RESTRICTIONS ON ELON MUSK'S DOGE. A COALITION OF STATES CLAIMS THAT MUSKA'S FAR-REACHING ROLE HEADING DOGE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL SINCE HE WAS NOT CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE AND THE STATES SOUGHT TO BLOCK DOGE FROM ACCESSING SEVEN FEDERAL AGENCIES. THERE FUSE THE DEMAND SAYING THEY HAD NOT MADE THE NECESSARY SHOW OF IRREPARABLE HARM. HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID, PLAINTIFFS WILL GENERALLY CALLED INTO QUESTION WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE UNCHECKED AUTHORITY OF AN ELECTED INDIVIDUAL AND ENTITY THAT WAS NOT CREATED BY CONGRESS AND OVER WHICH HAS NO OVERSIGHT. IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT MUST BE INDISPUTABLE THAT THIS COURT ACTS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF ITS AUTHORITY. ACCORDINGLY IT CANNOT ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. ESPECIALLY ONE AS WIDE-RANGING AS PLAINTIFFS REQUEST WITHOUT CLEAR IMMINENT IRREPARABLE HARM TO THESE PLAINTIFFS. THE CURRENT RECORD DOES NOT MEET THAT STANDARD.

HE WAS NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, HE HAS NOT GONE THROUGH PROPER -- HE HAS NOT GONE THROUGH ANY KIND OF SECURITY CLEARANCE. HE HAS GONE THROUGH EVERY DEPARTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND BASICALLY UNDERMINING AND DESTROYING WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY WORK AND WHAT MAKES IT GREAT. THIS GUY IS TRULY IN DANGER.

TO RESPOND TO THE LAST CALLER, DEMOCRACY IS NOT EQUATED WITH WASTING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT C-SPAN CAN BRING UP. INFLATION IS NOT THE RISING PRICES. INFLATION IS THE RISE INFLATION OF THE MONEY SUPPLY, ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF WHICH IS A RISE IN PRICES SO THE ROOT CAUSE IS AN INCREASE IN MONEY SUPPLY THROUGH BORROWING. AND THE OTHER IS WELL -- THE POINT ABOUT, THIS WAS AN ASIDE BUT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON ELON MUSK SECURITY CLEARANCE.

TALKING ABOUT THIS ON C-SPAN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND AFTER ALL THE OTHER MAJOR ISSUES IT'S A BIG ISSUE COMING UP IS GOING TO BE THE DEBT AND THE CHANGES THAT WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE, CUTBACKS AND ENTITLEMENTS AS THE NUMBER ONE. YOU ONLY HEAR THAT MENTIONED SOMETIMES CONGRESS AND SENATORS MENTION IT. CUTBACKS AND ENTITLEMENTS IT'S A PAINFUL WITHDRAWAL FROM OUR ADDICTION TO SPENDING. IT'S GOING TO HURT. BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DEMOCRATIC OR RUINING DEMOCRACY, IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE IN DEBT AND AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THE PRICE WE WILL PAY IF WE GO OVER THE CLIFF.

HERE IS WILLIAM IN OHIO, INDEPENDENT LINE. GOOD MORNING WILLIAM.', ""I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ONE THING BEFORE I GET INTO ELON MUSK AND TRUMP. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CANNOT CALL THEMSELVES THE PARTY OF W & ORDER EVER AGAIN AFTER HAVING A CONVICTED FELON LIKE THAT. THEY ARE DESTROYING MY BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. THIS HAS BEEN A DEMOCRACY FOR 248 YEARS AND IT'S BEING DESTROYED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BIG YOUR POCKETBOOK IS, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ALL PEOPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE DEPEND ON THE STUFF THEY ARE GIVING THEM. THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THEMSELVES BIG TAX CUTS AND IT'S GOING TO DESTROY DEMOCRACY. TRUMP IS A CANCER IN THE BODY POLITIC AND NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. I'M SORRY I SAY THAT BUT IT IS CRAZY. HE IS NOT A REPUBLICAN, HE IS A TRUMPLICAN. HE ONLY THINGS ABOUT ONE PERSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH."", ""WE GOT THIS FROM ROBIN ON FACEBOOK WHO SAID WHO WOULDN'T SUPPORT CUTTING FRAUDULENT SPENDING. LET'S TALK TO HOWARD INDIANAPOLIS DEMOCRAT GOOD MORNING."", ""GOOD MORNING. MY CONCERN IS THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS JUST A MASK TO CUT GOVERNMENT. ALL THE ITEMS I'VE HEARD REPORTED FROM ELON THAT HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE. THAT THEY HAVE CALLED WASTE. FOR EXAMPLE SOME PROGRAM ADVANCED D.E.I. INITIATIVES, THEY WILL CALL THAT WASTE. BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT NOW HAS THIS 2ACIST 2IEW 2HAT 2.E.I. 2S NOT 2MPORTANT. THAT IS NOT WASTE, THAT IS DOING THINGS THAT CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATIVE BODY APPROVED AND THEN WHAT TRUMP AND ELON ARE ENGAGED WITH PARTICULARLY TRUMP IS AN UNLAWFUL ACT BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING WHAT WAS APPROVED BY CONGRESSIONAL PROCESS REFLECTS THE COLLECTIVE WILL OF ALL OF OUR CITIZENS. SO THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE WHO SAYS TRUMP IS JUST TRYING TO BE A DICTATOR AND USING THIS DOGE THING IS IN THE EXCUSE IS ONE THING. ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT IS THIS DISTORTION OVER THE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DEFICIT FOR CURRENCY BASED COUNTRY LIKE THE U.S. HEARD IN OTHER WORDS THE U.S. CAN ISSUE ANY CURRENCY IN ANY VALUE IT WANTS THAN WHAT WE CALL DEBT IS JUST FEDERAL EXPENDITURES BEYOND TAXES. AND IT DOES NOT -- IT IS NOT NECESSARILY DETRIMENTAL OR POSITIVE. IT IS AN IRRELEVANT MEASURE. BUT THIS DOGE AND TRUMP AND THIS BUDGET AUSTERITY MARCH THEY ARE ON IS A USEFUL EXCUSE TO TAKE BENEFITS AWAY FROM PEOPLE. AND I LOOK TO C-SPAN TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF HAVING A MORE INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION ON BUDGET PLANNING FOR THE U.S. BECAUSE WE ARE A SOVEREIGN CITY. WHERE THAT SIMPLY MEANS WE ISSUE OUR OWN CURRENCY. ISSUE BONDS, DO ANY OF THAT. IN THE U.S. HAS DONE THAT OVER TIME. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT, LOW EMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE BUDGET DEFICITS AND DEBT HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY HAVE NO IMPACT, THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY IS ON OUR ECONOMY. SO THANK YOU."", ""LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER PORTION OF THAT INTERVIEW FROM YESTERDAY ON HANNITY TALKING ABOUT THE GOAL OF GETTING $1 TRILLION OUT OF THE DEBT.

WE WILL BE SCROLLING THIS THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM."", ""WELL, THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO TRY AND GET A TRILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE DEFICIT. IF THE DEFICIT IS NOT MORE UNDER CONTROL AMERICA WILL GO BANKRUPT. THIS IS IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND. IF THAT AN INDIVIDUAL OVER SPENDS, THE END VIGIL CAN GO BANKRUPT PRAY AND SOAK IN A COUNTRY.

IT IS INSANE."", 'FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR.', ""WE INHERITED IT. AND INFLATION IS BACK. I'M ONLY HERE FOR TWO AND HALF WEEKS. THINK OF IT, INFLATION IS BACK AND THEY SAID TRUMP.

GENERAL OVERALL INSANITY THAT THEY WERE PUSHING, IT HAD TO BE STOPPED. TRUMP MIGHT COME UP WITH AN IDEA REMAINING THE GULF OF MEXICO. OR YOU KNOW BUT BY AND LARGE, HE IS WRITING THE SHIP THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED SO HARD IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. DEMOCRATS 10 YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THEY HAD A LOT OF NORMAL POSITIONS.

IT'S BASICALLY THE REPUBLICAN POSITION, GET IN LINE, NOW IT IS LIKE OPEN BORDERS ANYBODY CAN COME IN."", ""SO JOHN, I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER, BUT IF WE ARE JUST TO LOOK AT THE ACTIONS OF DOGE AND ELON MUSK'S ROLE.

IT IS JUST WASTEFUL SPENDING. A BUNCH OF -- I'M NOT FOR A BUNCH PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS, BUT THE WASTE HAS TO BE CUT AND THE MONEY THAT COULD BE SAVED, IT'S ONLY A FEW BILLION HERE OR THERE. BUT IT ADDS UP. I THINK THE --"", ""I KNOW YOU'RE STILL TALKING BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ONE MORE THING, ELON MUSK IN THE FIRST CLIP THAT I PLAYED TALKED ABOUT THE BUREAUCRACIES NOT ELECTED AND ANYWAY EVERYBODY WHO LIVES IN D.C.

VOTED FOR KAMALA HARRIS, DO YOU THINK THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE ASKED WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR AND IF YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTING OR IF YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR LET'S SAY THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, SO THIS WOULD APPLY AND DEFTLY THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE HIRED INTO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT QUESTION MARK"", ""NO. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT ALL. DEMOCRATS WERE ACTIVELY PERSECUTING PEOPLE -- NOT PERSECUTING BUT NOT PROMOTING FROM WITHIN AND THAT WAS WRONG. IN EITHER CASE. WHETHER IT'S A WEAPONIZATION OF ANY AGENCIES GOING AFTER CERTAIN PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEM IS WRONG. I THINK TRUMP IS ADDRESSING THAT AS WELL. IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN ON EITHER SIDE THAT IT WAS HAPPENING ON STEROIDS UNDER BIDEN AND HARRIS. AND WHEN DEMOCRATS SAY WE CAN'T HOW WE LOST, WITH THESE POLICIES, WELL I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE POLICIES WERE SO HORRIBLE AND FOR ELON MUSK AND TRUMP TO EXPOSE THE WASTEFUL SPENDING IS THEM BEING UPSET BECAUSE THERE WASTEFUL SPENDING IS BEING EXPOSED."", 'IS IT CEREBRAL IN MICHIGAN, INDEPENDENT LINE?', 'THAT IS CORRECT.', '2OOD 2ORNING, 2O 2HEAD.', ""YEAH, HERE IS MY THING HEARD ELON MUSK IN THE MUSKETEERS, ISN'T THE BUDGET, A 50% OF IT IS FROM DEFENSE SPENDING AND DIDN'T HE HAVE A ROCKET HE LAUNCHED THAT EXPLODED IN THE AIR.

AMONG ALL U.S. CITIZENS, THE NUMBER FROM DUST ROSE FROM 51 TO 63% WHO SAYS THEY BELIEVE ELON MUSK HAS A LOT OF INFLUENCE. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE HOW IT IS BROKEN UP BY DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, REPUBLICANS. THEN IT ASKS THE QUESTION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERCEIVED INFLUENCE, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE HAS WITHIN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION VERSUS HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DO YOU WANT ELON MUSK TO HAVE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. AMONG ALL U.S. ADULTS THAT WERE QUESTION, THE PERCEIVED INFLUENCE THAT HE HAS A LOT OF INFLUENCE IS AT 63%. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE IS ONLY AT 18%. SO QUITE A DIFFERENCE THERE.
