Why BYU’s upset of Arizona will have fans reminiscing about Jimmer Fredette,https://www.yardbarker.com/college_basketball/articles/why_byus_upset_of_arizona_will_have_fans_reminiscing_about_jimmer_fredette/s1_17116_41804854,"['', 'Although it took a phantom foul call in the final seconds of the game to seal the deal, the BYU Cougars departed the McKale Center with a win over the 19th-ranked Arizona Wildcats on Saturday night, greatly improving the Cougars’ chances of making the NCAA Tournament for a second consecutive year.', 'There are plenty of potential headlines here for BYU, including the the questionable whistle on Arizona’s Trey Townsend that sent Richie Saunders to the free throw line for the two game-winning free throws, or the fact that the Cougars have won four games in a row. But the one worth focusing on, at least for a moment, is that with a 96-95 win, BYU made a statement at the expense of the Arizona Wildcats that hasn’t been made since Jimmer Fredette was still the Big Man on Campus in Provo, Utah.', '“BYU’s 96 points in tonight’s win are the most by any visiting team in a game at McKale Center since December 28, 2009, when BYU beat Arizona 99-69, led by 49 from Jimmer Fredette,” writes former ESPN Stats & Information researcher Jared Berson on X. “That was BYU’s last visit to McKale — Arizona played 258 home games in the interim.”', 'That game in late December 2009 represents the second-highest scoring output of Fredette’s storied BYU career, topped only by a 52 point outburst against New Mexico in the 2011 Mountain West Tournament Semifinal. It was one of six 40 point games that Fredette, who led the nation in scoring during his senior season, had during his four years at BYU.', 'The Cougars don’t have a singular force on their roster this year like Fredette, and their NCAA Tournament ticket, although looking better now than two weeks ago, is by no means punched, but if BYU makes it to the Big Dance, this could be a sign of good things to come. The last time BYU made it out of the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament was in Fredette’s senior season, when the Cougars — a 3-seed — were ousted in the Sweet Sixteen by the 2nd-seeded Florida Gators.', 'This article first appeared on NCAA Basketball on ClutchPoints and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', ""Several teams made statements on Saturday, some good, some bad. Here is what some of the year's top men's college basketball contenders told us this weekend. Auburn (23-2, 11-1 in SEC): We're the future 2025 NCAA Tournament champions Auburn has overcome its toughest challenges this season, including Saturday's first conference game in SEC history between the top two teams in the Associated Press Top 25. No. 1 Auburn defeated No. 2 Alabama, 94-85, holding the Tide to their worst three-point percentage this season (19.2 percent). Leading Player of the Year contender Johni Broome was one of six Tigers to score in double-digits. It's hard to spot weaknesses in Auburn's game. A month out from Selection Sunday, the Tigers should feel extremely confident. With the NCAA Tournament fast approaching, no team looks more dangerous. Tennessee (21-5, 8-5 in SEC): Don't forget about us Tennessee's second-half rally against Vanderbilt showed why the Vols shouldn't be overlooked in the loaded SEC. With their defense, they're never out of a game. Tennessee is No. 1 in KenPom's defensive efficiency rankings, and it showed during the second half. The Vols held Vanderbilt to 35.7 percent on its field goal attempts after halftime in their 81-76 win after the Commodores shot 54.8 percent in the first half. Tennessee's offense has sometimes disappeared this season, making the Vols more volatile than others. But Tennessee has the defense to lead it to a second SEC Tournament title in four seasons. Duke Blue Devils (22-3, 14-1 in ACC): We can outscore anyone No. 2 Duke scored 106 points in its 106-70 win over Stanford, its most in an ACC game since 2017. The Blue Devils are a national title contender because they're a complete team, but their shooting makes them special. Per KenPom, Duke is No. 1 among ACC teams in three-point field goal percentage (39.3 percent) in conference games. The Blue Devils were 14-of-29 against the Cardinal, with junior guard Tyrese Proctor leading the way with five makes. The Blue Devils run an efficient offense that has become a well-oiled machine against ACC competition. Next Saturday, they'll have a chance against Illinois (17-9, 9-7 in Big Ten) to show what kind of impact the fine-tuning has had on their abilities to win out of conference. Houston Cougars (21-4, 13-1 in Big 12): We can stop anyone Arizona entered Saturday 24th in the country in scoring (82.3 points per game). But the Houston buzzsaw held the Wildcats far below their season average in a 62-58 road comeback win. Arizona shot 37 percent from the field, its second-worst shooting performance this season. Houston's suffocating defense has been the backbone of the team's recent brilliance under head coach Kelvin Sampson. That's still the case this year. And by shutting down one of the country's top offenses, the Cougars should have even more confidence that no one can consistently score on them. Wisconsin Badgers (20-5, 10-4 in Big Ten): We have Final Four potential No. 16 Wisconsin was cast aside after a three-game losing streak in early December, but it has since won 12 of its last 14 games, including 94-84 at No. 7 Purdue on Saturday. There's a lot to like about the Badgers. They have several capable three-point shooters, take smart shots, are sound defensively, and don't beat themselves with miscues. Wisconsin ranks 18th in the country in turnover rate (14.3 percent). The Badgers have the pieces in place for an extended tourney run. Ole Miss Rebels (19-7, 8-5 in SEC): We aren't there yet Ole Miss is well on its path to its first NCAA Tournament bid in six years, but an 81-71 drubbing in the hardwood Egg Bowl doesn't inspire much confidence that the Rebels will do much once dancing. The Bulldogs led by as many as 19, 69-50, while limiting Ole Miss to 38.3 percent shooting. Ole Miss head coach Chris Beard has turned the program around quickly, but Saturday's thrashing is a reminder of how much farther he must go. UConn (17-8, 9-5 in Big East): Winning three consecutive national titles is hard UConn suffered one of the worst losses of the Dan Hurley era on Saturday, falling 69-68 in overtime at Seton Hall. The Huskies entered the season with aspirations of winning a third consecutive NCAA Tournament, but as the regular season winds down, they are trending in the wrong direction. ESPN men's NCAA Tournament bracketologist Joe Lunardi projected UConn as an 8-seed in his most recent update, putting it on track to potentially play a 1-seed in the Round of 32. UConn's title defense might end far sooner than expected."", 'NHL legend Wayne Gretzky was in a celebratory mood after Team Canada’s overtime win over Team USA in Thursday’s 4 Nations final, and he was eager to share in that with the players. The Great One handed out customized hats to all members of the Canadian team that beat the Americans 3-2 in overtime in Boston on Thursday. In addition to the classic Canadian maple leaf emblem, the hats carried a two-word message: “Be Great.” Photos showed that Canadian players wore the hats as they celebrated their victory in the locker room following the game. The players also blasted a fitting song during the locker room party. Canada certainly earned bragging rights with the victory, especially after they had lost 3-1 to the United States in Montreal less than a week earlier. On Thursday night, they rallied from a 2-1 deficit to come back and win on an overtime goal by Connor McDavid, a player who has received countless comparisons to Gretzky. Gretzky was on hand for Thursday’s game, and he was named an honorary captain for Canada and participated in a pregame ceremony. He was not a part of the postgame celebrations, but his hats certainly were.', 'Los Angeles Clippers forward Ben Simmons played in just his third game on Sunday after being bought out by the Brooklyn Nets. LA lost to the Indiana Pacers 129-111. Simmons had a typical all-around stat line that he is accustomed to, providing eight points, four assists, three rebounds, and two steals in just 24 minutes. The former No. 1 overall pick is nowhere near the player he was back in Philadelphia, but he is showing very encouraging signs of positive production for a Clippers team striving to make a playoff push post-All-Star break. Clippers head coach Ty Lue had positive praise for Simmons in the postgame presser, describing his ability to increase the pace of the offense as well as bring a dynamic team defender. ""It was good being able to have him on the floor, being able to switch one through five,"" Lue said of Simmons. ""… That’s the advantage you have of being able to have him on the floor, he can push the basketball and make a play, attack the basket, or get to the free throw line.” While Lue spoke highly of the three-time All-Star, he unfortunately announced he will not play on Monday against the Detroit Pistons. ""No,"" Lue said definitively when asked if Simmons will play Monday. Simmons has yet to be cleared to play back-to-backs due to the lingering back injury he has been dealing with dating back to Philadelphia. Simmons went through two surgeries within three of years of his time as a Net, restricting him to play only 90 of the total 246 regular season games, while also being on a max contract. He has yet to break the 30-minute mark in a game with Los Angeles, as they continue to find his role with the team. The last contest Simmons played 30 minutes was Jan. 12 with the Nets.', ""The Edmonton Oilers have demoted forward Viktor Arvidsson to the fourth line, which will further speculation that he could be traded as a salary cap dump. NHL insider Frank Seravalli has suggested earlier the Oilers could trade Arvidsson to free up cap space, as Jeff Skinner can use his no-move clause to block a trade. Oilers trading Viktor Arvidsson looks like possibility after demotion to the fourth line At practice, Oilers coach Knoblauch demoted Arvidsson to the fourth line in place of top prospect Matthew Savoie, playing on the second line with Draisaitl. Nuge - McDavid - Hyman Savoie - Draisaitl - Podkolzin Skinner - Janmark - Perry Arvidsson - Henrique - Brown Ekholm - Bouchard Nurse - Klingberg Kulak - Emberson Skinner Pickard Matthew Savoie is being called up after dominating in the AHL this season, and if he makes a good enough impression, it's possible that he commands a roster spot for the rest of the season. Savoie is a player with offensive skill and also has earned praise for his defensive play in the AHL. If he can translate a 200-foot game with scoring alongside Draisaitl for a salary of $886K, he would make another winger disposable. Viktor Arvidsson emerging as candidate for cap dump trade with demotion to fourth line Arvidsson is falling to the fourth line after struggling to find a consistent groove with the Oilers all season. He's played through injuries much of the season, but only for a while was able to bring his best hockey. Oilers analysts have called out Arvidsson for having the worst year of his career this year. Only 7 goals and 18 points in 40 games is a disappointment alongside Draisaitl, especially at $4M for two years. Arvidsson does not have any trade protection, either. If Matthew Savoie can live up to expectations, it's possible the Oilers could deal Viktor Arvidsson to clear up $4M in cap space to address the blueline, or potentially goaltending in trade. If Evander Kane returns before playoffs, they may need to move him to clear the space."", 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily. Always free!']"

Tommy (Lloyd) is a really good coach, as I’ve learned in this landscape. He knows what he is doing. He’s very sharp, and they are a good team, and Caleb (Love), he is a gamer. He made plays when they needed him to,” said BYU coach Kevin Young.', '“Luckily we were able to make enough (plays) of our own. Richie (Saunders) was incredible.

And if you think you are going to just show up, and go through the motions, and be successful, you are delusional,” Lloyd said. “We need to make sure every time we take the court that we are serving the game the way it should be served, and that’s with effort, energy, intelligence, all that stuff.”', 'BYU (18-8, 9-6) is looking for a Q1A win that would almost certainly punch its ticket to the NCAA Tournament, while Arizona is trying to catch Houston (22-4, 14-1) in the Big 12 standings.', 'BYU crushed No. 23 Kansas 91-57 on national television Tuesday night, a night after the Wildcats won in Waco, and Lloyd and company obviously noticed.', '“Obviously they had a great game plan that their staff put together.

What am I going to say?” Lloyd said. “You hate for a game to be decided by that … And the guy who called it is one of the best refs. So we’ve got to live with it. But step back.

Mandatory Credit: Katie Stratman-Imagn Images', 'Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd gave his slumping team a couple of days off this week, hoping the rest will recharge a squad that has stumbled in the closing minutes of its past three games. If BYU coach Kevin Young were to give his players time off from grueling practices, it would be for a different reason. The Cougars (18-8, 9-6) enter Saturday night\'s Big 12 Conference game against the No. 19 Wildcats (18-8, 12-3) in Tucson, Ariz., on a roll, having demolished No. 23 Kansas 91-57 on Tuesday following solid wins over Kansas State (80-65) and West Virginia (73-69). The Kansas score was not a typo. Richie Saunders continued his season-long stellar play with 22 points, Trevin Knell hit four 3-pointers in scoring 15 points, and Mawot Mag added 13 to lift BYU to a landslide victory over the visiting Jayhawks. The Cougars head to Arizona on a three-game winning streak and sit in sole possession of fifth place in the Big 12. ""I feel like this is just a continuation of the past couple of games,"" said Knell, who scored the 1,000th point of his BYU career against Kansas. ""This is just another team win that we\'re stacking. Every day in practice, we\'re competing, and it\'s showing out on the court. It\'s a great team win, and I feel like it was a statement."" BYU led by as many as 38 in the 34-point victory in what wound up matching the worst defeat in scoring margin in Kansas coach Bill Self\'s 22-season career. ""I think we\'re just hitting our stride right now at the right time of the year, playing our best brand of basketball,"" BYU\'s Dallin Hall said. ""We\'re less concerned with the opponent in front of us, and more concerned with executing our side of things -- the game plan on both sides. I thought we did a really good job of that. We\'re hitting our stride, and trying to put the country on notice."" The Wildcats should be well-rested for Saturday\'s intriguing matchup. Lloyd gave his players Tuesday and Wednesday off after they played a Saturday-Monday set, capped by a 74-67 victory at Baylor. Although Arizona won, it was a continuation of a concerning trend. The Wildcats were leapfrogged by Kansas State in the final four minutes of a 73-70 loss on Feb. 11. Next, they saw a seven-point lead with nine minutes remaining evaporate in the final nine minutes of a 62-58 setback against then-No. 6 Houston on Feb. 15. Arizona then got a scare from the Bears down the stretch after blowing the majority of a 53-39 lead with under 13 minutes remaining. ""You and I can think about every excuse in the book. I\'m not an excuse guy,"" Lloyd said. ""We had two games that I thought were winnable. I\'ve re-watched them, and I re-watched the end of them really closely, to try to figure out ways I can get better, and to help our guys a little bit more, obviously giving them some advice on how I think we can close these games better. ""I think we\'ve been a good closing team the last couple months. We just lost a tough game to a K-State team that\'s playing really well at home, and obviously, Houston\'s got a great thing going. So we\'ve got to move on.
