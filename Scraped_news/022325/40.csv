SAG Awards 2025: See the Full Winners List,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/awards-insider-sag-awards-winners-2025-full-list,"['As honored as SAG Award winners must feel to take home their prizes, the ceremony may be even more important as a bellwether of things to come. Actors happen to make up the largest voting branch in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which means that as SAG goes, so might the Oscars.', 'And that, in turn, means that the 2025 SAG Awards may just have initiated a vibe shift in two of this year’s least predictable categories: best picture and best actor.', 'Though Wicked was the most nominated film at the SAG Awards this year, that musical wound up going home empty-handed when the SAGs were handed out in Los Angeles Sunday night. Instead, the evening ended with a surprise winner for best ensemble in a motion picture: Conclave, a crowd-pleaser that recently won this same award at the BAFTAs. Despite that previous victory, star Ralph Fiennes seemed pleasantly surprised to be delivering another acceptance speech as he and cast mates Isabella Rossellini, John Lithgow, and Sergio Castellitto took the podium.', 'A Complete Unknown star Timothée Chalamet looked even more shocked moments earlier, upon learning that he had won the award for best male actor in a leading role—a prize that he and chief rival Adrien Brody seem to have even odds of winning on Oscar night. Though Chalamet admitted from the stage that he had not expected the prize, he recovered by delivering a confident acceptance speech in which he noted that he intends to become one of cinema’s great actors—and saying that he takes as much inspiration from GOATs Michael Phelps and Michael Jordan as he does from screen legends like Marlon Brando, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Viola Davis.', 'Even the night’s TV awards had their share of surprises. Though Shōgun swept the drama categories, Colin Farrell beat Baby Reindeer Emmy winner Richard Gadd in best actor in a limited series, while Only Murders in the Building beat Emmy darlings Hacks and The Bear to win both best actor in a comedy—the award went to Martin Short, who wasn’t present at the ceremony (perhaps because, according to his pal and costar Steve Martin, he caught Covid at the SNL 50th anniversary special)—and best comedy. Star Selena Gomez, who was present, couldn’t contain her glee: ""We never win,” she said from the podium. “This is so weird!""', 'Read on for the full list of winners of the 2025 SAG Awards, which kicked off at at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday, February 23, and were streamed live on Netflix.', 'WINNER: Conclave\nA Complete Unknown\nAnora\nEmilia Pérez\nWicked', 'WINNER: Demi Moore, The Substance\nPamela Anderson, The Last Showgirl\nCynthia Erivo, Wicked\nKarla Sofía Gascón, Emilia Pérez\nMikey Madison, Anora', 'WINNER: Timothée Chalamet, A Complete Unknown\nAdrien Brody, The Brutalist\nDaniel Craig, Queer\nColman Domingo, Sing Sing\nRalph Fiennes, Conclave', 'WINNER: Only Murders in the Building\nAbbott Elementary\nThe Bear\nHacks\nShrinking', 'WINNER: Shōgun\nBridgerton\nThe Day of the Jackal\nThe Diplomat\nSlow Horses', 'WINNER: Zoe Saldaña, Emilia Pérez\nMonica Barbaro, A Complete Unknown\nJamie Lee Curtis, The Last Showgirl\nDanielle Deadwyler, The Piano Lesson\nAriana Grande, Wicked', 'WINNER: Colin Farrell, The Penguin\nJavier Bardem, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\nRichard Gadd, Baby Reindeer\nKevin Kline, Disclaimer\nAndrew Scott, Ripley', 'WINNER: Jessica Gunning, Baby Reindeer\nKathy Bates, The Great Lillian Hall\nCate Blanchett, Disclaimer\nJodie Foster, True Detective: Night Country\nLily Gladstone, Under the Bridge\nCristin Milioti, The Penguin', 'WINNER: Martin Short, Only Murders in the Building\nAdam Brody, Nobody Wants This\nTed Danson, A Man on the Inside\nHarrison Ford, Shrinking\nJeremy Allen White, The Bear', 'WINNER: Jean Smart, Hacks\nKristen Bell, Nobody Wants This\nQuinta Brunson, Abbott Elementary\nLiza Colón-Zayas, The Bear\nAyo Edebiri, The Bear', 'WINNER: Hiroyuki Sanada, Shōgun\nTadanobu Asano, Shōgun\nJeff Bridges, The Old Man\nGary Oldman, Slow Horses\nEddie Redmayne, The Day of the Jackal', 'WINNER: Anna Sawai, Shōgun\nKathy Bates, Matlock\nNicola Coughlan, Bridgerton\nAllison Janney, The Diplomat\nKeri Russell, The Diplomat', 'WINNER: Kieran Culkin, A Real Pain\nJonathan Bailey, Wicked\nYura Borisov, Anora\nEdward Norton, A Complete Unknown\nJeremy Strong, The Apprentice', 'WINNER: Shōgun\nThe Boys\nFallout\nHouse of the Dragon\nThe Penguin', 'WINNER: The Fall Guy\nDeadpool & Wolverine\nDune: Part Two\nGladiator II\nWicked', 'Your Invitation to Vanity Fair’s 2025 Oscar Party', 'See Every Look From the 2025 SAG Awards Red Carpet', 'Elon Musk’s 13 Children and Their Mothers (Whom We Know of)', 'Republican Congressmen Are “Scared Shitless” of Trump', 'How Patrick Schwarzenegger “Eye-F—ed” His Way Onto The White Lotus', 'Meet Trump’s Inner Circle of Suck-Ups', 'Where to Watch Every 2025 Oscar-Nominated Movie', 'The Education—and Anointment—of Barron Trump', 'Millie Bobby Brown on Stranger Things, Marriage, and Life on the Farm', 'Every Steven Spielberg Movie, Ranked', 'From the Archive: The Wrath of Putin', 'MORE FROM VANITY FAIR', 'CONTACT', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

But while some stars (or their stylists, at least) will be saving their show-stopping outfits for the Academy, Sunday evening’s Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards saw attendees having fun with a comparatively relaxed dress code.', 'This year’s big celebrity events have thus far seen plenty of dark ensembles — and some of the most anticipated arrivals continued the trend. Demi Moore stunned in a black drop-waist leather gown from Bottega Veneta’s Summer 2025 collection, while fellow nominee Zoe Saldaña looked elegant in a demure one-sleeve velvet Saint Laurent gown.', 'Yet, the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles also welcomed lots of lighter touches, both in shade and material. Pamela Anderson floated along the venue’s blue-colored carpet in a goddess-like Dior gown, while Ariana Grande arrived in an ethereal sheer Loewe bustier dress with floral detailing. Others opted for brighter and more delicate dresses than we’ve seen of late, by embracing lace (see Quinta Brunson, also in Dior) or satin (see Millie Bobby Brown in Louis Vuitton).', 'There were bold statements, too. Cynthia Erivo was wrapped in the silver metallic fabric of a Givenchy dress taken from the label’s Fall-Winter 1997 Haute Couture archive. “Shōgun” star Anna Sawai meanwhile wore a crystal-embellished Armani Privé gown with an optical illusion neckline that appeared to float without straps.', 'Several of evening’s men experimented with less conventionally formal looks, though it was all the usual suspects: Best actor nominee Andrew Scott and “Abbott Elementary” star Tyler James Williams both wore stylishly loose-fitting suits, while “The Bear” actor Jeremy Allen White put a wide-legged spin on black-tie attire. Never one to play by the rules, Timothée Chalamet delivered one of the night’s most outlandish looks in a leather Chrome Hearts suit, Brat-green shirt and diamond-encrusted bolo tie by Cartier.', 'See below for some of the red carpet’s best looks.

SAG Awards 2025: ‘Conclave’ crashes the party,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2025-02-23/sag-awards-2025-analysis-oscars,"['Do you want to be an actor? Listening to Screen Actors Guild Awards host Kristen Bell singing that question to the tune of “Do You Want to Build a Snowman,” it seemed like the only reasonable response was a hearty “hell yes,” even with all the talk of failure and embarrassment and the possibility that Colin Farrell might give you COVID if you win an award.', 'You know what would be more alarming than catching a contagious disease from a charming Irishman? “Conclave” winning best picture at the Academy Awards. And yet it’s a very real possibility after the crowd-pleasing papal potboiler won the SAG Awards’ ensemble prize Sunday night.', 'Oscar voting is closed, with the ceremony being just seven days away. So nothing that tonight’s movie winners said from the stage will have any impact on the 97th Oscars, nor will the playing of Diane Warren’s nominated power ballad “The Journey” during the in memoriam segment.', 'But the SAG Awards are, for the most part, a reliable precursor to the Academy Awards. How trustworthy will they be this year? Let’s take a look.', 'CAST IN A MOTION PICTURE\nWinner: “Conclave”', 'The past: The winner of this award went on to take the best picture Oscar 15 of 29 years, making it easily the SAG Awards’ least trustworthy Oscar precursor. (The ensemble prize wasn’t awarded in 1994, the SAG Awards’ first year.) Perhaps worth noting: The past three winners — “CODA,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “Oppenheimer” — have also won the Oscar.', 'Will history repeat itself? After taking this ensemble honor and the best picture prize last weekend at the British Academy Film Awards, “Conclave” is very much in the running for the best picture Oscar. It has long been held up as the movie that could prevail with the Oscars’ preferential ballot, a ranked choice vote that rewards movies that are well-liked — or at least, not widely disliked.', 'Still, it’s worth pointing out that “Anora” won the top prizes this year from the producers, directors and writers guilds. Only one film has won those three honors and lost best picture — “Brokeback Mountain.”', '“Anora” remains the favorite.', 'FEMALE ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE\nWinner: Demi Moore, “The Substance”', 'The past: SAG and the academy have matched 21 of 30 years. Notable recent exceptions: Frances McDormand winning her third Oscar for “Nomadland” after Viola Davis (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”) won SAG, Olivia Colman (“The Favourite”) denying 2019 SAG winner Glenn Close (“The Wife”) her first Oscar and, just last year, Emma Stone (“Poor Things”) winning her second Oscar over SAG winner Lily Gladstone (“Killers of the Flower Moon”).', 'Will history repeat itself? Did you see that standing ovation? Moore began her comeback narrative at the Golden Globes when she gave a speech — one that she had memorized — that was both gracious and inspiring. She wrapped it up, beaming, “I do belong.” But then Madison took the honors at the British Film Academy Awards and, yesterday, the Spirit Awards. And with “Anora” winning top prizes at the directors and producers guild awards, it was easy to believe that the momentum in this race had shifted to the film’s terrific lead. It’s still a toss-up. But Moore is genuinely loved in the industry. People are rooting for her. All season long, it’s been easy to see why.', 'AWARDS', '', 'MALE ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE\nWinner: Timothée Chalamet, “A Complete Unknown”', 'The past: This category has been the most reliable indicator of Oscar victory, with SAG and the academy matching 24 of 30 times. There are exceptions, though, such as when Anthony Hopkins won the Oscar for “The Father,” prevailing over SAG winner Chadwick Boseman (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”).', 'Will history repeat itself: Chalamet won’t turn 30 until the end of the year. If he won the Oscar for “A Complete Unknown,” he’d be the youngest to take the lead actor trophy. Who currently holds that distinction? None other than Adrien Brody, nominated for “The Brutalist,” who won for “The Pianist” in 2003, 22 days before his 30th birthday.', 'One thing is certain: Chalamet now holds the record as being the youngest to win SAG’s lead actor prize, taking that badge from Nicolas Cage, who was 32 when he prevailed for “Leaving Las Vegas” in 1996.', 'The SAG Awards, voted on by a broad membership of 125,000 members, skew more populist than the Oscars, so I think Brody remains the favorite. But now it’s competitive. The answer, my friends, is blowin’ in the wind. Brody’s film, “The Brutalist,” earned 10 nominations, while “A Complete Unknown” scored eight. Both have their camps. But as much as the Oscars love rewarding a good biopic turn, Brody delivers a serious, deeply emotional performance in a movie that feels weightier. And he’s old(er). And Kieran Culkin thought he was a shoo-in. What more do we need?', 'FEMALE ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE\nWinner: Zoe Saldaña, “Emilia Pérez”', 'The past: The SAG award winner has gone on to take the Oscar 22 of 29 times, including last year, when Da’Vine Joy Randolph won for “The Holdovers,” one of countless prizes she won that season. (Kate Winslet took this category in 2009 for “The Reader” but was nominated for — and won — the Oscar for lead actress for that performance.)', 'AWARDS', '', 'Will history repeat itself? Let me answer by asking another question: Is there an award that Saldaña has not won this season? She’s so good in “Emilia Pérez” that none of the movie’s controversies, including the offensive social media posts of her nominated co-star Karla Sofía Gascón, can keep her from winning. “Why should she be penalized for something she had nothing to do with?” one Oscar voter told me last week. Obviously, it was a rhetorical question as Saldaña’s triumphs have continued unabated. She’ll add an Oscar to her haul next week.', 'MALE ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE\nWinner: Kieran Culkin, “A Real Pain”', 'The past: The SAG winner has gone on to win the Oscar 21 times in 30 years, including the last 11, the longest streak of any category.', 'Will history repeat itself? This category has become a snooze since 2016, the year Idris Elba won for “Beasts of No Nation” after not being nominated at the Oscars. Mark Rylance ended up winning the Oscar for “Bridge of Spies,” beating sentimental choice Sylvester Stallone, nominated for the “Rocky” reboot “Creed.” We haven’t had a competitive race since then, with the likes of Brad Pitt (“Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood”), Ke Huy Quan (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) and Robert Downey Jr. (“Oppenheimer”) sweeping the season — just like Culkin this year.', 'From the Oscars to the Emmys.', 'Get the Envelope newsletter for exclusive awards season coverage, behind-the-scenes stories from the Envelope podcast and columnist Glenn Whipp’s must-read analysis.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', '', 'Glenn Whipp covers film and television for the Los Angeles Times and serves as columnist for The Envelope, The Times’ awards season publication.', 'AWARDS', 'HOLLYWOOD INC.', 'AWARDS', 'AWARDS', 'AWARDS', 'AWARDS', 'AWARDS', 'Subscribe for unlimited access\nSite Map', 'Follow Us', '']"

Timothée Chalamet wins Best Actor at the SAG Awards: ‘I want to be one of the greats’,https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/timothee-chalamet-sag-awards-best-actor-win/,"['Timothée Chalamet had a mic-drop moment at the SAG Awards on Sunday, singing his way to a Best Actor win for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.', 'Chalamet, who was in second place in the Gold Derby odds, beat Adrien Brody (The Brutalist), Daniel Craig (Queer), Colman Domingo (Sing Sing), and Ralph Fiennes (Conclave).', '', '', '“I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me,” Chalamet said during his acceptance speech. “The truth is that this was five-and-a-half years of my life. I poured everything that I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan — a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime to play him.”', 'After thanking his costars, Chalamet proudly proclaimed, “I know we’re in a subjective business, but the truth is, I’m in pursuit of greatness. I know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I’m inspired by the greats. I’m inspired by the greats here tonight. I’m as inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, Marlon Brando, and Viola Davis as I am by Michael Jordan and Michael Phelps. I want to be up there. This [award] doesn’t signify that, but it’s a little more fuel to keep going.”', 'Chalamet’s win shakes up the Best Actor race ahead of the Academy Awards on March 2, but he’s still considered an underdog. Brody prevailed at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, and BAFTAs — but if anyone knows that doesn’t make you a sure bet, it’s Brody. He won the Best Actor Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist despite losing all those same precursors to Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York) and Jack Nicholson (About Schmidt). Just a year before that, Russell Crowe swept all the precursors for A Beautiful Mind before ultimately losing the Oscar to Denzel Washington for Training Day.', 'This was Chalamet’s first win after seven nominations at the SAG Awards. He was previously nominated for Best TV Drama Ensemble (Homeland) in 2013, Best Actor (Call Me by Your Name) in 2018, Best Ensemble (Ladybird) in 2018, Best Supporting Actor (Beautiful Boy) in 2019, Best Ensemble (Don’t Look Up) in 2022, and Best Ensemble (A Complete Unknown) in 2025.', '', '', 'Chalamet was one of four SAG Awards nominees from A Complete Unknown, which is up for eight Oscars next month including Best Picture. He was joined by Monica Barbaro (Best Supporting Actress), who lost to Zoe Saldaña (Emilia Pérez), and Edward Norton (Best Supporting Actor), who lost to Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain). The cast was also up for Best Ensemble, but lost that prize to Conclave. According to Gold Derby’s Oscar odds, Searchlight’s A Complete Unknown will come up short in all eight of its races.', 'SAG, the final industry acting precursor, has aligned with the Oscars in Best Actor 24 times in the previous 30 years. It’s mismatched only twice in the last 10 years. SAG chose Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom) and Washington (Fences), while the Oscars anointed Anthony Hopkins (The Father) and Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea), respectively.

The trend abated at the 2025 SAG Awards, where he took home Outstanding Lead Actor in a surprise upset over Adrien Brody. And it turns out, as a speech-giver, he is … kinda kooky and extremely earnest. Who’da thunk? “I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me, but the truth is this was five years of my life,” he said. “I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan.” He then kind of negged his own movie while thanking “the entire cast, who, in a genre doin’ a biopic that could be perhaps tired, gave it their all.”', '“I know we’re in a subjective business, but the truth is I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” Chalamet continued. “I know people don’t usually talk like that, but I’m inspired by the greats.” He already sounded like 2000s-era Kanye West writing a twinkier version of “Jesus Walks,” but then he decided to get even stranger. “I’m as inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando and Viola Davis,” he proclaimed, naming three great actors seemingly at random, “as I am by Michael Jordan and Michael Phelps.” Totally, dude.

This year’s red carpet style has leaned decidedly more glamorous, with today’s actresses taking style cues from a bygone era of Hollywood. Think: peplums, pretty updos and bouffant-style coifs, gloves, diamonds, pearls, and plenty of hourglass-shaped silhouettes. Perhaps it’s a sign of the fashion pendulum swinging back towards something more elegant after a moment when ideas of minimalism and quirkiness had somewhat outpaced the appeal of sparkle and glamour. Now, glitter and glitz are winning again.', 'The stars walking the red carpet at tonight’s SAG Awards are following suit, dressed in off-the-shoulder gowns, corset bodices, and more peplum and classic evening gloves. There were also some very modern interpretations of glamour, whether in the form of a mini hemline or the severe, square shape of a neckline bedazzled in red beads. And then of course, there’s Timothée Chalamet, who is having more fun than anyone when getting dressed for these events—bolo ties, sleaze boy leather, and all.', 'Below, these are our picks for the best-dressed stars at the SAG Awards.', 'The Emilia Perez star looked fabulous tonight in a navy, off-the-shoulder gown with a softly pleated neckline. It was undeniably one of her best red carpet moments this awards season—the subtle but still glamorous silhouette was exactly right.', 'Peplums are really making a comeback this year. and Elle Fanning gave the return a chef’s kiss at the SAGs this evening. Jonathan Anderson played around with the shape a lot in his Spring 2025 collection for Loewe, taking the traditional, cylindrical fabric embellishment and turning it into something more angular, more contemporary. It’s peplum with a dose of cool.', 'And speaking of Loewe, Spanish actress Úrsula Corberó wore a version of Anderson’s mini dress from the spring runway, with long sleeves and a peplum-esque skirt constructed to look as though it were floating. It was nice to see at least one star go the opposite of old Hollywood glamour, trading column gowns and ball skirts for something cool and contemporary.', ""This guy is having a blast right now. The Oscar contender and star of A Complete Unknown has been making the red carpet rounds wearing the most fantastic, ridiculous fashion we’ve seen on the awards circuit in a long time—think teeny Chanel bags, skinny scarves, and True Religion jeans. Tonight, he referenced an old photo of Bob Dylan wearing a lime green shirt, a bolo tie, and a black jacket. Chalamet copied the outfit almost exactly (a trick he's done before), but his version was designed by Chrome Hearts, with a bolo tie by Cartier."", 'Coughlan looked stunning tonight in a powdery blue dress in a 1950s-style wrap silhouette, worn with black opera gloves decorated with a diamond ring and bracelet. She understands the nuances of making classic glamour look right for today, and this particular red carpet outing was proof.', ""The Anora star has been upping her game on the red carpet this awards season with sophisticated gowns that feel grown-up but not too precious. For the SAGs, she wore a sleek custom Vuitton gown with statement-making draping at the front. Her fashion vernacular is all about saying “I’m a movie star” without a hint of embarrassment or irony, and it's working."", 'The actress was one of few who really went for it in terms of color and embellishment, but her Armani Privé gown didn’t overpower. It was the perfect mix of color pop with exquisite beading, and the geometric shape of the square neckline felt fresh, too.', 'Saldaña’s sculptural Saint Laurent dress was strikingly beautiful. The one-shoulder silhouette with the crystal petal-esque detailing felt like one of the more modern looks on the carpet tonight—sharp with just a hint of flash.', 'The star of The Bear killed it on tonight’s red carpet in a tuxedo with a flared pant (hello, Kendrick!) and a 1940s-era Tiffany’s brooch on his lapel. He may not be considered a fashion risk-taker like Chalamet, but White is consistently good at looking hot while being cool, whether in a three-piece suit and a pretty piece of jewelry or a pair of Calvin Klein underwear.', 'Rossellini is an icon of glamour and always will be.

Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the cast's best wishes for Pope Francis."", 'All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Baker’s “Anora,” which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds. Now, with “Conclave” winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what will nab best picture in a week’s time at the Academy Awards is, again, anyone’s guess.', '“Wow,” said “Conclave” star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. “I’ve not been elected to speak. I’ve been designated to speak on behalf of our conclave, our ensemble.”', ""That wasn't the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamet's best actor win upset “The Brutalist” star Adrien Brody and put the 29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award."", 'Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the “A Complete Unknown” star spoke with composure and confidence.', '“The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life,” said Chalamet. “I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing him.”', 'He then added: “The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats.”', 'The other Oscar favorites — Demi Moore, Zoe Saldaña and Kieran Culkin — all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their picks don’t always align exactly with those of the film academy, but they often nearly do.', 'The last three best ensemble winners — “Oppenheimer,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “CODA” — all went on to win best picture at the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone, who won SAG’s award for female actor last year for “Killers of the Flower Moon,” but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for “Poor Things”.)', 'Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her Golden Globe win for her performance in “The Substance.” Moore, whose campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a “popcorn actress,” has traded awards with “Anora” breakthrough Mikey Madison.', '“What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think,” said Moore. “The saying, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it’ — the reality is when I believe it, I will see it.”', 'The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell introduced attending firefighters as “the most attractive tables” among a sea of stars.', 'Jane Fonda, 87, given the guild’s Life Achievement Award, provided the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trump’s administration.', '“We are in our documentary moment,” said Fonda. “This is it. And it’s not a rehearsal.”', 'Fonda added that “woke just means you give a damn about other people.”', '“A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by what’s happening, by what’s coming our way,” said Fonda. “We are going to need a big tent to resist what’s coming at us.”', 'Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for “Hacks.” Smart didn’t attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her character, Deborah Vance.', 'Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen White to win best male actor in a comedy series for “Only Murders in the Building.” The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble.', ""“Wait, we never win. This is so weird,” said Selena Gomez. “Marty and Steve (Martin) aren't here because, you know, they don't really care.”"", 'Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in “The Penguin” and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee Curtis, as “the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes.” Farrell bounded to the stage and promptly responded, “Guilty as charged,” before blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him.', ""The night's first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just about every award in the category for “A Real Pain.” Gripping the SAG trophy, he could quickly tell the difference."", '“It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors,” said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: “Believe it or not, this actually means a lot to me.”', 'Netflix’s “Emilia Pérez,” which has seen its awards hopes largely dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascón, took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite Saldaña.', ""For Netflix's second time around streaming the awards, it inserted ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fonda's speech."", 'After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, “Shōgun” kept up its dominance.
