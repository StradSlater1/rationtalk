This Week in AI: Microsoft Sees Quantum Breakthrough as Ai Pin Deflates,https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/this-week-in-ai-microsoft-sees-quantum-breakthrough-as-ai-pin-deflates/,"['If you’re interested in artificial intelligence (AI) news, here are the the latest in AI updates.', 'Let’s start with Microsoft’s quantum moment. It has created the world’s first ‘topoconductor,’ which is a new type of matter — not solid, liquid or gas — that has only previously existed in theory. The topoconductor forms the core of Majorana 1, its new quantum chip.', '“We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a Wednesday (Feb. 19) LinkedIn blog post.', 'Quantum computing has been in development for decades, but its exponentially greater computing power has not found practical use due to instability, errors and cost. It also needs to scale to be useful.', 'Microsoft said its topoconductor, or topological superconductor, leads to a more stable qubit, or quantum bits used for processing information in quantum computers. This is opposed to today’s “classical” computer bits of 1s and 0s that are manipulated to perform computations.', 'But qubits aren’t stable. When they are destabilized, they turn into an ordinary bits and lose their quantum abilities that enable them to perform exponentially greater than classical computers.', '“The qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable and smaller,” Nadella said. “They are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor” or chip.', 'Nadella added that its palm-sized quantum chip can solve problems that “all the computers on Earth today combined could not!”', 'In December, Google unveiled its new Willow chip that can “reduce errors exponentially” as it scales using more qubits, according to a company blog post. It was able to do a benchmark calculation in less than five minutes that would take today’s fastest supercomputer 10^25 (septillion) years to do.', 'Figure’s humanoid robots are showing off skills we’ve always wanted robots to have, such as putting away our groceries, among other ordinary tasks.', 'The Nvidia-backed robotics AI startup unveiled Helix on Thursday (Feb. 20), a generalist vision-language-action model that gives a robot the combined ability to see, understand language and exercise control.', 'Figure said its robots can now pick up anything, even small household objects that they have never encountered before.', 'The video released by Figure shows its robots understanding the homeowner’s voice command to put away groceries in their right place. They pick up the items and decide where to place them — some in the fridge and others in cabinet drawers.', 'This is a big deal because the hardest part of making humanoid robots useful isn’t just getting them to move like humans — it’s getting them to generalize and adapt to new tasks in dynamic environments.', 'Figure aims to get its robots into factories, warehouses and ultimately, homes. If they pull this off at scale, we could be looking at a future where C-3PO-type robots of Star Wars fame become more than just science fiction.', 'Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s xAI on Wednesday launched Grok 3, its latest attempt to go toe-to-toe with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and other AI rivals.', 'While early versions of Grok felt more similar to ChatGPT, Grok 3 outperformed top-of-the-line AI models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and new Chinese startup DeepSeek.', 'Grok 3 was trained on double the computing power as Grok 2: a cluster of 200,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs running on its own Colossus supercomputer.', 'The real question is how long Grok can hold on to its lead in performance. Meta is set to launch Llama 4, and OpenAI is releasing GPT-4.5 and GPT-5. Anthropic is also supposedly coming out with an updated model soon.', 'Finally, let’s talk about Humane’s Ai Pin, a wearable AI-powered smart device that its creators hoped would replace smartphones. It was a square device that users attached to the shirt like a brooch but using magnets. The idea was to evoke the Star Trek communicator.', 'The AI Pin projected information onto your hand and could send messages, answer calls, search the web, play music, take photos, translate conversations and more. Time magazine even named it among the best inventions of 2023.', 'The $699 device — later discounted to $499 — launched less than a year ago but immediately faced negative reviews from early adopters: The AI was slow. The interface was clunky. The device overheated. And don’t forget the $24 a month subscription fee (excluding taxes and other fees) just to use it.', 'Humane had some serious hype going in — a founding team of ex-Apple veterans and funding from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank, Microsoft and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff (who owns Time).', 'But none of that mattered once people actually tried using it. The AI Pin was impractical and expensive.', 'However, HP is buying the startup for $116 million, a purchase that includes its technology, technical staff and patents, both granted and pending. The Humane team would become HP’s new AI innovation lab called HP IQ, tasked with making its computers, printers and scanners smarter.', 'In the meantime, the 10,000 early adopters of the AI Pin were told their devices will no longer work after Feb. 28.', 'The head of the House Judiciary Committee is demanding more clarity on Europe’s tech regulations.', 'As Reuters reported Sunday (Feb. 23), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wants European Union (EU) antitrust chief Teresa Ribera to clarify how she enforces the European Union’s rules governing Big Tech under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), saying they seem to target American firms.', '“We write to express our concerns that the DMA may target American companies,” Jordan wrote in a letter sent to Ribera, seen by Reuters. ', 'The letter, co-signed by Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI), chairman of the subcommittee on the administrative state, regulatory reform and antitrust, argues the rules place undue burdens on companies and give Europe’s tech firms an advantage. It also criticizes the 10% fines on global yearly revenues companies are subject to under the DMA.', '“These severe fines appear to have two goals: to compel businesses to follow European standards worldwide, and as a European tax on American companies,” the letter said.', 'The lawmakers gave Ribera until March 10 to respond to their letter. PYMNTS has reached out to the European Commission (EC) — the EU’s antitrust enforcement arm — for comment, but has not yet gotten a reply.', 'As Reuters notes, the letter came two days after President Donald Trump signed a memorandum saying the White House would scrutinize the DMA and its counterpart Digital Services Act (DSA) “that dictate how American companies interact with consumers in the European Union.”', 'Adopted in 2023, the DMA governs tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and is designed to provide a level playing field and greater consumer choice.', 'However, complaints about the DMA are not confined to just Republicans. As covered here in late 2023, a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote to then President Biden with concerns that the new regulations unfairly target American tech companies.', 'They argued that the DMA designates five leading U.S. tech companies as “gatekeepers” while excluding many Chinese and European firms.', 'The news follows reports from last month that the EC was reconsidering its investigations into American tech companies ahead of Trump’s inauguration. One EU official said the shift was due to “tech oligarchs” being close to Trump, a situation that creates “a whole new ballgame,” per a report from the Financial Times.', 'We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.']"
Microsoft unveils chip it says could bring quantum computing within years,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/19/topoconductor-chip-quantum-computing-topological-qubits-microsoft,"['Chip is powered by world’s first topoconductor, which can create new state of matter that is not solid, liquid or gas', 'Quantum computers could be built within years rather than decades, according to Microsoft, which has unveiled a breakthrough that it said could pave the way for faster development.', 'The tech firm has developed a chip which, it says, echoes the invention of the semiconductors that made today’s smartphones, computers and electronics possible by miniaturisation and increased processing power.', 'The chip is powered by the world’s first topoconductor, which can create a new state of matter that is not a solid, liquid, or gas – making it possible to design quantum systems that fit in a single chip smaller than the palm of a hand, and to create more reliable hardware, a peer-reviewed paper published in Nature reports.', 'Paul Stevenson, a professor of physics at the University of Surrey, said Microsoft could be “very serious competitors” in the race to build the first reliable quantum computers if the company successfully built on this research.', '“The new papers are a significant step, but as with much promising work in quantum computing, the next steps are difficult and until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,” he said.', 'George Booth, a professor of theoretical physics at King’s College London, said the research represented an “impressive technical achievement”, albeit one whose value would probably become clear only with hindsight. “Whether a claim of ‘years’ [rather than decades before meaningful development] is accurate will remain to be seen,” he said.', 'Microsoft claims that the topoconductor offers a path to developing quantum systems that can scale to a million qubits – the delicate building blocks of quantum computers that are analogous to the ones and zeros computers currently use.', 'This could eventually produce the most powerful computers yet, based on quantum mechanics rather than classical physics, which would be capable of solving highly complex industrial and societal problems.', 'This could include breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts; inventing self-healing materials for construction, manufacturing or healthcare; solving complex logistics supply chain problems; or cracking encryption codes.', 'Sign up to TechScape', 'A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives', '', 'Earlier this month, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) selected Microsoft’s topoconductor as one of two pathways to quantum computing it is exploring as part of a programme intended to determine whether it is possible to build an industrially useful quantum computer by 2033, much faster than most predictions.', 'The other approach is created by PsiQuantum, which is using silicon-based photonics, meaning light wave-based technology, to create a quantum computer based on a lattice-like fabric of photonic qubits.', 'Microsoft previously claimed to have developed topological qubits in a paper that had to be retracted after scientific flaws were pointed out.', 'Booth said that although Microsoft’s progress had been slow relative to some other companies, it had instead “focused on the long game by working on a system which is inherently more resilient to noise and interference” than the fragile basic quantum computers that competitors have been building for a few years.', '“These topological qubits protect the information they carry by using the properties of a new type of emergent particle, a Majorana fermion, which means that it is harder for this information to be lost as it is processed. However, [there is an] added layer of complexity when constructing these qubits when compared to competing architectures,” he said.', 'These Majorana particles had never previously been seen or made. Microsoft said they had to be “coaxed into existence with magnetic fields and superconductors”, which is why most quantum computing research has focused on other approaches.', 'Booth said the research represented a step in the direction of a very different platform that could “compete with the more mature technologies pioneered by the likes of Google”, though he added that there was still a long way to go in demonstrating that the technology could be scaled up.']"
Microsoft’s New Majorana 1 Processor Could Transform Quantum Computing,https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-just-claimed-a-quantum-breakthrough-a-quantum-physicist-explains-what-it-means/,"['THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.', 'Researchers at Microsoft have announced the creation of the first “topological qubits” in a device that stores information in an exotic state of matter, in what may be a significant breakthrough for quantum computing.', 'At the same time, the researchers also published a paper in Nature and a “road map” for further work. The design of the Majorana 1 processor is supposed to fit up to a million qubits, which may be enough to realize many significant goals of quantum computing—such as cracking cryptographic codes and designing new drugs and materials faster.', 'If Microsoft’s claims pan out, the company may have leapfrogged competitors such as IBM and Google, who currently appear to be leading the race to build a quantum computer.', 'However, the peer-reviewed Nature paper only shows part of what the researchers have claimed, and the road map still includes many hurdles to be overcome. While the Microsoft press release shows off something that is supposed to be quantum computing hardware, we don’t have any independent confirmation of what it can do. Nevertheless, the news from Microsoft is very promising.', 'By now you probably have some questions. What’s a topological qubit? What’s a qubit at all, for that matter? And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?', 'Quantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits—or qubits.', 'An ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both. If you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a “superposition” of up and down).', 'This means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations—particularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.', 'So far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.', 'Researchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.', 'Microsoft has taken a very different approach to build its “topological qubits.” They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorized in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.', 'Majoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).', 'A Microsoft explainer on the Majorana 1 processor.', 'Indeed, Majorana particles are so exotic they are usually only studied in universities—not used in practical applications.', 'The Microsoft team say they have used a pair of tiny wires, each with a Majorana particle trapped at either end, to act as a qubit. They measure the value of the qubit—expressed by means of whether an electron is in one wire or the other—using microwaves.', 'Why has Microsoft put in all this effort? Because by swapping the positions of Majorana particles (or measuring them in a certain way), they can be “braided” so they can be measured without error and are resistant to outside interference. (This is the “topological” part of “topological qubits.”)', 'In theory, a quantum computer made using Majorana particles can be completely free of the qubit errors that plague other designs.', 'This is why Microsoft has chosen such a seemingly laborious approach. Other technologies are more prone to errors, and hundreds of physical qubits may need to be combined together to produce a single reliable “logical qubit.”', 'Microsoft has instead put its time and resources into developing Majorana-based qubits. While the company is late to the quantum party, it hopes to catch up quickly.', 'As always, if something sounds too good to be true, there is a catch. Even for a Majorana-based quantum computer, such as the one announced by Microsoft, one operation—known as T-gate—won’t be achievable without errors.', 'So the Majorana-based quantum chip is only “almost error-free.” However, correcting for T-gate errors is much simpler than the general error correction of other quantum platforms.', 'Microsoft plans to scale up by grouping together more and more qubits.', 'What now? Microsoft will try to move ahead with its road map, steadily building larger and larger collections of qubits.', 'The scientific community will closely watch how Microsoft’s quantum computing processors operate, and how they perform in comparison to the other already established quantum computing processors.', 'At the same time, research into the exotic and obscure behavior of Majorana particles will continue at universities around the globe.', ""In your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories"", 'DOGE takeover: Elon Musk’s toxicity could spell disaster for Tesla', 'Big Story: A crypto crimefighter’s descent into Nigerian prison', 'I dated multiple AI partners at once.

That means it's theoretically possible to bring two of these particles together, and they will either annihilate each other in a massive release of energy (as is normal) or can coexist stably when pairing up together — priming them to store quantum information."", 'These subatomic particles do not exist in nature, so to nudge them into being, Microsoft scientists had to make a series of breakthroughs in materials science, fabrication methods and measurement techniques. They outlined these discoveries — the culmination of a 17-year-long project — in a new study published Feb. 19 in the journal Nature.', 'Chief among these discoveries was the creation of this specific topoconductor, which is used as the basis of the qubit. The scientists built their topoconductor from a material stack that combined a semiconductor made of indium arsenide (typically used in devices like night vision goggles) with an aluminum superconductor.', 'The researchers needed the right combination of these components to trigger the desired transition into the new topological state of matter. They also needed to create very specific conditions to achieve this — namely, temperatures near absolute zero and exposure to magnetic fields. Only then could they usher MZMs into existence.', '', 'To construct one qubit, which is less than 10 microns in size — much smaller than superconducting qubits — the scientists arranged a set of nanowires into an H shape, with two longer topoconducting wires joined in the center by one superconducting wire. They next induced four MZMs to exist on all four points of the H by cooling the structure down and tuning it with magnetic fields. Finally, to measure the signal when the device would be operational, they connected the H with a semiconductor quantum dot — equivalent to a small capacitor that carries charge.', 'Topoconductors differ from superconductors in the way they behave when burdened with an unpaired electron. In superconductors, electrons usually pair up — known as Cooper pairs — with an odd number of electrons (any unpaired electron) requiring a massive amount of energy to accommodate, or enter an excited state. The difference in energy between the ground state and the excited state is the basis for the 1s and 0s of data in superconducting qubits.', 'Like superconductors, topoconductors use the presence or absence of an unpaired electron as the 1s and 0s of computing data, but the material can ""hide"" unpaired electrons by sharing their presence among the paired electrons. This means there is no measurable energy difference when unpaired electrons are added into the system, making the qubit more stable at the hardware level and protecting the quantum information. However, it also means it\'s harder to measure the qubit\'s quantum state.', 'This is where the quantum dot comes in. The scientists beam a single electron from the quantum dot into one end of the wire, through the MZM, and it emerges from the other end, through another MZM. By blasting the quantum dot with microwaves as this happens, the returning reflection carries an imprint of the quantum state of the nanowires.', 'The accuracy of this measurement is approximately 99%, the scientists said in the study, noting that electromagnetic radiation is one example of an external factor that triggers an error once per millisecond, on average.

More importantly, we need a way to ensure that there are no errors in those measurements and that the probabilities associated with them aren’t affected by how we measure them or by fluctuations in temperature and charge. Then we need tools to build and run the complex quantum circuits used to model problems, going from code to physics and back again, from our high-temperature world to one colder than interstellar space.', 'It’s enough to make rocket scientists think they have an easy job.', 'Microsoft has long been committed to building a quantum computer as part of Azure. It has set up a long-running research project as part of its Station Q initiative, designing and building a new type of quantum computer based on what it calls topological qubits that promise to be a lot more stable than current approaches. The Azure Quantum team has been developing a set of tools and languages designed to program these devices, compiling code into quantum circuits and providing simulators where anyone can experiment with writing quantum code.', 'MICROSOFT', 'Outside of its own work, Microsoft has been sponsoring fundamental research into quantum computing technologies and working with universities around the world. One of the key areas of research has been into Majorana fermions, a theoretical particle that’s eminently suitable for twisting into stable topological qubits.', 'Like much scientific research, the journey has not been straightforward or simple. The equipment needed to both make and detect Majorana particles is new and complex, as no one has done this work before. The path is perhaps best described as difficult, with possible breakthroughs turning into dead ends.', 'This week’s news is a lot more positive, with peer-reviewed papers and a design for a first-generation quantum processor, the Majorana 1. Designed to scale to a million qubits, the first iteration of what Microsoft is calling a topological core has eight qubits, which can help prove many of the requirements for quantum processing.', 'Microsoft has published a paper in the journal Nature that details how it constructed its first topological superconducting qubits and, more importantly, that these are made up of a pair of trapped Majorana particles with a quantum state that can be measured. The process of measuring its state is complex; the topological structure of a Majorana qubit makes it stable, but it also makes it harder to read that state. Part of the process of developing the Majorana 1 has been developing a new microwave-based technique for getting highly accurate information about a particle.', 'One advantage to this new technique is that it reduces the complexity of the circuitry around the qubits in a quantum processor. The same technique is used to send digital control signals, taking advantage of the stability of the Majorana qubits. The techniques used with other qubit types require fine-tuned microwave signals to make changes and require complex analog control circuitry, with a much higher risk of induced errors.', 'MICROSOFT', 'The design of the quantum processor is fascinating and at the same time extremely complex. Building the structure needed to hold the topological qubit, a material Microsoft calls a topoconductor (as it’s a superconducting environment for a topological quantum node), requires near atom-level precision. Each layer on the indium arsenide substrate is sprayed on “atom by atom,” as Microsoft says. The slightest error means you won’t get the necessary properties to create a qubit.', 'MICROSOFT', 'And while the basic engineering is in place, the more complex the quantum processor, the harder it will be to deliver that level of accuracy. There’s a certain irony in the fact that to get more scale, you need a scaled-up quantum computer to design those quantum structures. It’s much like conventional processor design, with higher-density transistor layouts needing significant amounts of compute to design, build, and construct.', 'Having a repeatable technique for building these novel materials is key, as it ensures that Microsoft can turn experimental structures into computing hardware. Getting things right required a lot of simulation for the indium arsenide topoconductor structures and the essential aluminum superconductor.', 'The topoconductor differs from standard superconductors in the way it hosts qubits. Like standard superconductors, the topoconductor provides a zero-resistance path for Cooper pairs of electrons. Unlike standard superconductors, the topoconductor allows an unpaired electron to exist. This is how the topoconductor sets its quantum state and how that state is measured. With an unpaired electron, the topoconductor has a charge (and different superposition states will have different charges). At the same time, there’s no way to trap that electron, as it’s everywhere in the topoconductor at the same time.', 'The single qubit building block is called a tetron. It has two superconducting topological wires that host four Majorana Zero Modes (MZM) at each end. The wires are linked by a thinner superconductor. Together with the wire, these four MZMs control and store the state of the qubit. The topological wire is coupled to a pair of quantum dots, which have a different charge depending on the state of the qubit.', 'This charge is what the microwave detectors measure. The process is extremely accurate, with an extremely low probability of error. However, the extremely low probability of error still isn’t low enough, and there needs to be better error correction for Microsoft to deliver a working quantum computer. This is why the device road map goes up to multi-tetron devices that provide only a handful of qubits. Despite this, Majorana 1-based devices will need only one-tenth of the error-correction hardware of comparable quantum computers.', 'Those microwave-based measurements are the basis for programming and using the Majorana 1’s tetron-based qubits, as they allow us to connect and disconnect the quantum dots from the tetrons. Instead of requiring complex analog controls to change quantum states, this new approach allows Microsoft to program tetrons digitally, simplifying the connections between the quantum devices and the digital computers that link them to our programs and data. The more complex the tetron structure, the more states can be superimposed in a single wire, letting you use the topoconductors to deliver many different types of quantum information processing.', 'Microsoft is using this quantum processor as the first building block in a road map that’s intended to end with a scalable quantum computer. There’s a logic in the path to much more complex quantum processors able to support many qubits on a single device. Theoretically it’s a move from the experimental physics that led to the Majorana 1 to an engineering-led approach that first delivers a single qubit, then two, then an array of four-by-two tetrons acting as a two-qubit device with error correction, to much more complex devices with arrays of tetrons delivering multiple error-corrected qubits.', 'Although this is significant progress, it’s not yet a fully scalable quantum computer. That’s still some time away, as it needs the development of multi-qubit devices based on this first eight-qubit design.

New state of matter powers Microsoft quantum computing chip,https://www.popsci.com/technology/majorana-1-microsoft/,"['BY ANDREW PAUL', 'POSTED ON FEB 20, 2025', 'Microsoft says its researchers have created a new quantum computer processor that relies on a never-before-seen state of matter. The technological leap—called Majorana 1—represents a major step forward towards an era of powerful quantum computers that unlock currently unachievable advancements across artificial intelligence, medical research, sustainable energy, and many other industries.', 'Since their invention, traditional computers have almost always relied on semiconductor chips that use binary “bits” of information represented as strings of 1’s and 0’s. While these chips have become increasingly powerful and simultaneously smaller, there is a physical limit to the amount of information that can be stored on this hardware. Quantum computers, by comparison, utilize “qubits” (quantum bits) to exploit the strange properties exhibited by subatomic particles, often at extremely cold temperatures.', 'Two qubits can hold four values at any given time, with more qubits translating to an exponential increase in calculating capabilities. This allows a quantum computer to process information at speeds and scales that make today’s supercomputers seem almost antiquated. Last December, for example, Google unveiled an experimental quantum computer system that researchers say takes just five minutes to finish a calculation that would take most supercomputers over 10 septillion years to complete—longer than the age of the universe as we understand it. ', 'But Google’s Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) is based on different technology than Microsoft’s Majorana 1 design, detailed in a paper published on February 19 in the journal Nature. The result of over 17 years of design and research, Majorana 1 relies on what the company calls “topological qubits” through the creation of topological superconductivity, a state of matter previously conceptualized but never documented.', 'Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'Instead of a traditional computer’s reliance on electrons, Majorana 1 works on the “world’s first topoconductor,” using the Majorana particle first described in 1937 by theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana. According to Microsoft, the machine is based on “gate-defined devices” combining the semiconductor indium arsenide with aluminum, a superconductor. Once the topoconductor’s temperature is lowered to near absolute zero (about -400 degrees Fahrenheit) and tuned to magnetic fields, the devices “form topological superconducting nanowires with Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) at the wires’ ends.”', 'Majorana 1 is reportedly more reliable than competitor Quantum Processing Unit  designs, but it still exhibits a problem that plagues all experimental quantum computing chips. Just as it’s illustrated in quantum particle physics, qubits may be able to hold two states of information at the same time,but when human operators attempt to read them, the information “decoheres” into a basic 1 or 0. Microsoft researchers, however, are pinning their hopes that further fine-tuning will yield more reliable and scalable topoconductors that ultimately form the basis of the first true quantum computers. Majorana 1 currently holds just eight qubits, which doesn’t set it apart from existing QPU prototypes. But it’s built to house many more: 1 million qubits, to be more exact.', '“A million-qubit quantum computer isn’t just a milestone—it’s a gateway to solving some of the world’s most difficult problems,” Chetan Nayak, Microsoft’s Technical Fellow and Corporate Vice President of Quantum Hardware, said on Wednesday.', 'Andrew Paul is Popular Science’s staff writer covering tech news.', 'POPULAR SCIENCE TEAM', 'KRISTIN SHAW', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'RAHUL RAO', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'HARRY GUINNESS', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'HARRY GUINNESS', 'ANDREW PAUL', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'CHARLOTTE HU', 'Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'Articles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service.\n\n© 2025 Recurrent.

Satya Nadella explains why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important,https://www.businessinsider.com/satya-nadella-microsoft-new-majorana-chip-quantum-breakthrough-state-matter-2025-2,"['Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter.', 'CEO Satya Nadella described it as a ""breakthrough"" in the advancement of quantum computing.', '""Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,"" Nadella said in a post on X. ""After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we\'ve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing. It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core. We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.""', 'Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of technology that combines the disciplines of computer science, math, and quantum mechanics to solve more complex calculations more quickly than is possible through classical computing. The foundation of quantum computing relies on units of information called qubits, rather than the binary bits used in classical computing.', 'Qubits exist in multiple states at once, like a spinning coin appearing to show both heads and tails simultaneously. They behave differently when observed and require specific conditions such as low light or extremely cold environments to replicate results reliably and without errors, which has made advancement in the field slow going.', 'But when they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits enable quantum computers to quickly calculate equations with multiple solutions and perform advanced computations that would be impossible for classical computers.', 'Researchers in the field agree that computations solvable through quantum computing could help discover new drugs, promote sustainable food growth in harsh climates, and develop new chemical compounds that break down plastics or break our current encryption methods, among other outcomes.', 'Nadella has said he believes quantum will be a global game changer when used in conjunction with advancements in artificial intelligence.', 'In an appearance on the ""Dwarkesh Podcast,"" Nadella said quantum computing would be most useful for exploring how various compounds work in different states, like advancements in chemical physics and biology, rather than the data-heavy processing that AI is best at.', '""The way I think of it is, if you have AI plus quantum, maybe you\'ll use quantum to generate synthetic data that then gets used by AI to train better models that know how to model something like chemistry or physics or what have you,"" Nadella said in the podcast. ""These two things will get used together.""', ""Microsoft said in a press release that its topological superconductor is a new material that isn't solid, liquid, or gas, which the company fabricated atom by atom. Where many familiar electronic devices rely on the raw material silicon in their semiconductors, Microsoft said in peer-reviewed findings released in Nature that its topological superconductor was a path forward for quantum computing to produce more stable qubits."", 'Troy Nelson, the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that, since the behavior of quantum systems is often hard to prove because of the unstable nature of qubits, he\'d like to see more real-world testing to confirm Microsoft\'s findings. He said, however, that he was ""more on the optimistic side of cautiously optimistic"" about the company\'s announcement.', '""What they\'ve done is they\'ve created a new foundation that we can build off of,"" Nelson said. ""Now we need to solve the production problems like the economies of scale and bringing costs down. But I see what they produced here as a new road map.""', 'Microsoft\'s new topological architecture was used to develop its Majorana 1 processor, offering what the company called in its press release ""a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one\'s hand.""', '""This is a needed threshold for quantum computers to deliver transformative, real-world solutions — such as breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts or inventing self-healing materials for construction, manufacturing or healthcare,"" Microsoft\'s press release reads. ""All the world\'s current computers operating together can\'t do what a one-million-qubit quantum computer will be able to do.""', ""Nelson said Microsoft's topological breakthrough, if it can be replicated by other researchers in the field, would be a turning point that shortens the timeline for developing fully functional quantum computers to just years."", '""If we really can print topoconductor to chips the size of your hand, that\'s just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor,"" Nelson said.', ""Microsoft's stock rose 1.25% on Wednesday following the announcement of its new quantum chip."", ""While Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip doesn't mean commercially useful quantum computing is right around the corner, it's the latest in a series of significant advancements in the field that leads some researchers to believe more widespread, commercial adoption will come sooner than previously expected."", 'In December, Google unveiled Willow, its new quantum chip, which the company says can perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes — a task that would take the current fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete; a timeframe that exceeds the age of the universe.', 'But not everyone is convinced. Quantum stocks tumbled in January after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggested we were still 20 years away from the technology being ""very useful.""', '']"
