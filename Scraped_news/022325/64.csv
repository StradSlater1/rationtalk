Such scales are comparable to those of the individual star systems that themselves are born out of this material, and have not been resolved in previous imaging of light echoes with HST and Spitzer; in fact, it was not known prior to these JWST observations that the ISM was structured on such small scales. The current best explanation for these features is that they are sculpted by the weak magnetic fields that permeate interstellar regions, with the whorls and knots potentially representing magnetic ‘islands’ embedded within those fields.', 'The dust and gas illuminated in this light echo are unrelated to any matter ejected from the supernova itself, but are simply material that the former star lived alongside. Though earlier Spitzer imaging has shown that Cassiopeia A is surrounded by dozens of such light echoes, the phenomenon is in general extremely rare as it requires that the light pulse from the supernova is short — here, less than 10 days — and that sufficient densities of dust are nearby.', 'This is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution', '', 'Access Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals', 'Get Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription', '$29.99 / 30 days', 'cancel any time', 'Subscribe to this journal', 'Receive 12 digital issues and online access to articles', '$119.00 per year', 'only $9.92 per issue', 'Buy this article', 'Prices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout', 'Nature Astronomy https://www.nature.com/natureastronomy', 'Lindsay Oldham', '', 'Correspondence to Lindsay Oldham.', 'Reprints and permissions', 'Oldham, L.
