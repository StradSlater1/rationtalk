Though the rate improved 2% last month on an annual basis, the sales pace continues to hover around 15-year lows.', 'The situation isn’t much rosier for new builds: Construction permits declined 1.7% in January from 12 months earlier, while housing starts were mostly flat, federal data showed Wednesday. And homebuilders’ confidence slipped to a five-month low this month, the National Association of Home Builders’ latest survey found.', 'It’s been a very unusual start to 2025. A lot of buyers and sellers were thinking this was going to be their year.', 'LISA STURTEVANT, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BRIGHT MLS', 'Meanwhile, homebuying remained very difficult at the end of 2024, driven by economic instability, rising costs and shortages of homes on the market, according to NBC News’ Home Buyer Index, which measures the challenges potential buyers face county by county.', 'The current outlook reflects the collision of long-running trends — tight, if improving, inventories; steep prices; high interest rates — with fresh uncertainties posed by Trump’s economic agenda, including tariffs and mass deportations that threaten to drive up costs.', '“It’s been a very unusual start to 2025. A lot of buyers and sellers were thinking this was going to be their year,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS housing group.', 'Instead, she said, many listings are staying on the market longer as buyers wait for stubborn mortgage rates to fall.', '“It’s going to be a slower spring than we hoped it would be,” Sturtevant predicted.', 'On the campaign trail, Trump promised mass deportations of undocumented people to free up existing properties, deregulation to spur more development and tax incentives to help first-time home buyers. He also pledged to slash mortgage rates “very fast.”', '“We will drive down the rates so you will be able to pay 2% again and we will be able to finance or refinance your homes drastically at much lower costs,” Trump told Arizona rallygoers in September, estimating he would save families in the state $800 to $1,000 in monthly mortgage payments.', 'But nationwide, rates for 30-year fixed mortgages — the most popular type — have hovered from 6% to 8% for the last two years, and demand for mortgage applications recently fell to its lowest level in six months.', 'Since the election, several major builders have warned Trump’s proposals could crimp their business. The higher tariffs he’s already unveiled on steel and aluminum, set to take effect next month, and new ones on Chinese goods that are already in force could add thousands of dollars to home prices, industry executives say.', '“Whether it’s steel or any of the other tariffs relative to our friends to the north or to the south, we do expect some cost pressure from some of that,” said Curt VanHyfte, CFO of the homebuilding firm Taylor Morrison, on a Feb. 12 earnings call. But he added that those wouldn’t affect the company until late 2025 if fully implemented.', 'Lennar, another major homebuilder, said it made a “major shift” eight years ago away from materials manufactured in Asia during Trump’s first-term trade war with China. Levies on Chinese electronics components used in residential construction could make the average property $5,000 to $7,000 more expensive, Lennar co-CEO Jon Jaffe told investors in December.', 'The potential impact of immigration policy changes would be “much more difficult to assess,” he said.', 'Some economists argue that tighter immigration enforcement slows construction, drives up home prices and even fuels job losses among the industry’s American-born workers. Home builders who spoke to NBC News in the final leg of the presidential race said that any dent to their heavily foreign-born workforce, which is already facing shortages, would be detrimental. But many weren’t sure at the time how far Trump might go. So far, his new administration has seen an early frenzy of arrests and deportations that are now running up against resource limits, much to the president’s frustration.', 'In a statement, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the president had “cut red tape” and taken executive action calling for lower housing costs and expanded supply.', '“Americans trust President Trump to fix the housing crisis left behind by Joe Biden,” Rogers said.', 'Despite the unknowns weighing on the housing market, Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather advised buyers wary of high prices to consider new builds, adding that many developers are offering incentives.', 'While inventories are picking up, there’s still only about 3.5 months’ supply relative to current sales levels, far off the six-month level reflective of a balanced market. Nearly 73,000 homes were delisted in December, a 64% increase from the previous year, a recent Wall Street Journal analysis of CoreLogic data found.', 'Still, JPMorgan analysts said last week that new homes for sale hit 481,000 — the most since 2007 — and speculative properties built without buyers lined up reached 385,000, the most since 2008.

More recently, though, she said buyers and sellers are both getting tired of waiting for mortgage rates to fall and are beginning to come out of their holding patterns.', '“Instead of it being so lopsided and having not enough inventory and too many buyers, which was creating this multiple-offer overbidding,” she said, “I think we have kind of a coming-to-grips.”', 'J.J.

', ""It's worth noting that in December, existing home sales saw an even larger year-over-year bump — 9.3% — but that still wasn't enough to push annual sales above 2023 levels."", 'Buyers are adapting, but spring may be sleepy: Although affordability is strained, the year-over-year increase in sales in January ""suggests that a fair number of buyers have adapted to the higher mortgage rates in today\'s market environment,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.', 'While some buyers have been dipping their toes into the market, a significant uptick in sales is unlikely as long as mortgage rates remain elevated, said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American. Sluggish pending sales numbers suggest that existing home sales will continue to struggle in the coming two months — which means the start of the spring homebuying season could come in more like a lamb than a lion.', '""The bottom line — we\'re likely to see a modest, seasonal increase in home-buying demand, but it will still be constrained by affordability issues and the persistence of the rate lock-in effect compared to pre-pandemic spring markets,"" Kushi said.', 'An inventory-related boost? Rising levels of supply could help spur sales, however: ""Inventory is expected to continue trending higher, potentially giving buyers more choices and negotiating power,"" Kushi said.', 'While some of that inventory is stale, new listings are up by more than 4% compared to this time last year, according to Redfin. ', 'Home prices push higher: Along with high borrowing rates, rising home prices continue to hurt overall affordability. NAR estimates the median existing home sales price was $396,900 in January, down slightly from $404,400 in December, but up 4.8% from a year ago and the 19th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases.', 'There are signs that price growth has slowed, however. Altos Research estimates overall home prices grew 2% year-over-year, a much slower pace than in recent months.
