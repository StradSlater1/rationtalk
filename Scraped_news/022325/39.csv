In our recent hands-on preview, we called it “the bigger evolution” we were hoping for and praised all the ways it looks to be streamlining the structure of 2018’s Monster Hunter World to make the act of slaying giant beasts even more approachable and seamless. But if Monster Hunter World was the big-budget instalment that finally saw the long running Capcom franchise take hold in the West, Wilds has the tough job to follow such a tentpole entry.', 'To learn more about how Capcom is living up to this tricky task of meeting player expectations, we recently sat down with Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and director Yuya Tokuda. Here’s what they had to say about harnessing the power of PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, their stance on Steam Deck verification, and how the team chose which monsters made sense in this new, wilder world.', 'READ MORE: EA FC 25 Fantasy FC tracker – live upgrade tracker and upgrade requirements', ""READ MORE: Game hailed as 'one of the best' is now available to play for free"", 'Ryozo Tsujimoto: Looking back on Monster Hunter World from the present day, I think it’s now sold something like 28 million copies. It’s got a massive sales record for us. But when it first launched there was a lot of expectation. It took us a while to reach that number. One of the reasons we’ve been able to get to this point with that game is due to the support of the existing fans. Until our global breakthrough with Monster Hunter World, the fan base in the West was a relatively small and passionate community. Having the backup of that community when launching these titles really got us to where we are today.', 'As we’re here now, on the eve of launching Monster Hunter Wilds, I think it’s impossible to compare the scale of the fan base because we’ve come so far since then. The huge number of fans we know are waiting for this game and also the amount of expectation that brings is totally different compared to 2018.', 'Yuya Tokuda: My approach is to always consider the monster lineup in the context in the setting of the game and the ecosystem we’re trying to design. In Monster Hunter Wilds you’re exploring a place called the Forbidden Lands and there are different maps or biomes within that. I don’t want to just have a list of monsters and then pop them in the game. I always think, ‘what would be the most plausible monster to fit in this area and fit into this food chain? Where would it sit in the ecological pyramid? What would it hunt and who would hunt it?’.', 'When you have the concept nailed down like that, then it becomes clear. I’ll design a new monster that fits into the setting or, in some cases, it just so happens that an existing monster can be taken and revived for this title. It plugs that gap in the ecosystem quite neatly, so it’s very much a holistic design approach to having the ecosystem and monsters all feel like they naturally fit together rather than just doing a checkbox exercise.', 'YT: Right from the start out direction with this game was to target the current generation of consoles. That being the direction from the beginning, we knew we were free to design things that weren’t going to be limited by having to release on older hardware. In particular, the two major aspects we were only able to do because of this approach were the herds of monsters, where many of the same monsters appear on the map at the same time and we can process all of their AI individually, making them behave as a herd or break off from one another.', '[The other is] the more seamless world, which, unlike past games where you’d move from the world to the base camp and there’s a loading screen, it’s right there on the map and you can just walk outside onto the field. Even when you’re in the base camp everything in terms of the monster behaviour and the environmental conditions are all being calculated in real time. We couldn’t have possibly done that if not for the power of the current generation of hardware.', 'YT: It didn’t really start from the idea of, ‘let’s put two-weapon holding in the game and then design the game around it’. This was more of an organic extension of the more seamless environment, which is changing constantly. The conditions can change, there can be a storm rolling in. Because you’re on this seamless map and you’re exploring and seeing monsters other than your specific quest target, it just made sense that you needed to have two options at any given time. If you only had one weapon and are hunting a certain monster, the conditions can change and that changes the game, or you discover another monster along the way and you wish you’d brought another weapon to help hunt that.', 'By at least giving you one more weapon you can have with you, it means there’s less need for players to constantly go back and forth to the camp to respond to the changing conditions and change the gear. It’s truly in service of the seamless experience we had in mind since the design stages. It’s not really about picking different weapons, but more the loadout and what benefits different weapons bring.', 'RT: At the moment we don’t really have Steam Deck compatibility in our list [of priorities]. This isn’t to say that this might not change in future, but that’s not something we’re looking into at the minute.', 'RT: I always bring a Hammer, and I pair it with a second Hammer.', 'YT: I really use all the weapons all the time, so I’m constantly changing my loadout. I would say I had cause to focus more on the weapons that we’ve made the most changes to based on the beta feedback. That probably would mean that the Lance and the Insect Glaive my most commonly used pairing, but I’m sure once the game is out and I’m playing after launch I’ll be changing my favourites all over again because I really feel there’s something to enjoy in all 14 weapons.', 'Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release on February 28, 2025, on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.', 'The latest console and PC gaming news and reviews', '', 'At Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

Here’s how it works.', ""Sure, I feel like I say this every time a new game in the series comes out, but Monster Hunter Wilds really is going to be the best game to get started with in the series. Broken record? Not really, I'm simply observing a very favorable trajectory that just goes to show how in tune Capcom is with its core experience: hunting monsters with friends. You can develop the greatest behemoth battler ever made but what good is it if players don't show up? Capcom knows how to get them in the lobby."", 'Yet, the developer is also keen to make sure long-time fans (Monster Hunter just celebrated its 20th anniversary, after all) are well served by Monster Hunter Wilds as well. Handily, director Yuya Tokuda doesn\'t sweat the difference too much. ""I think both types of fans are basically similar in what they want from the Monster Hunter experience,"" he shares. ""But the difference would be in how they get on board with the game. If you\'re a veteran since the old days, then you kind of already know right from the start how to play the game, and you can jump right on board.""', '', 'Giving newcomers that helping hand up to the same perch requires some planning, though. ""If you\'re a relatively new player, I think that it\'s our job to give you a story that helps you learn how to play Monster Hunter as you go along and follow the quests,"" Tokuda continues. ""What we want you to reach is the same point as existing veteran fans, which is the really rewarding and challenging gameplay cycle and the massive amount of content volume that you can enjoy later on in the game.""', 'What\'s key is ensuring there\'s no split in where they ultimately end up, in order to keep the player base unified. ""It\'s really about getting two different types of people to the same place, rather than trying to cater to two completely different fan bases who want different things,"" says Tokuda.', 'Online co-op is vital to Monster Hunter Wilds. But it isn\'t everything. ""I would say that you don\'t need to feel like you have to jump straight online if you\'re new to Monster Hunter. It can take a while to get comfortable with the feeling of playing in a group of up to four people,"" says producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. ""Don\'t rush it, and take advantage of the support system that we have built in with the AI characters who can join you on a solo hunt when you\'re playing offline.""', '', 'These \'support hunters\' don\'t just make the huge open areas in Monster Hunter Wilds feel alive, as they hunt the monsters that freely and naturally roam the gorgeous environments. They also emulate the experience of playing alongside others online. ""That\'s a great way for beginners to play sort of fundamentally solo, but get a feeling for what it means to have other hunters in the map with them,"" says Tsujimoto. ""They\'re quite intelligent characters, and they\'ll do things like, you know, maybe distract the monster for you, or lure it to a different place, or help you trap it. And when you see what the support hunters are doing for you, that will give you an idea of what to expect and also what you should want from your fellow players.""', 'They can act as prompts for how to play, and even what you can do. Capcom doesn\'t want to make any assumptions about player skill level jumping in. ""Because if it\'s your first time, maybe you weren\'t aware it\'s possible, to say, trap a monster,"" notes Tsujimoto. ""So when the support Hunter does it, you go, \'Oh, right, yeah, that\'s a good idea. And whenever I\'m playing online later, maybe I\'ll try to do that to be helpful."" Strategy, after all, is important when stalking your prey, and Capcom is mindful about not letting the series devolve into something mindless. ""That it isn\'t just four players acting as if they were solo and bashing away, there\'s a certain amount of interaction and strategy that you need to have,"" he says.', 'Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more', '', ""Storylines in the series have often been light touch, a reason to throw you into a series of boss fights as a ladder to get to an endgame of even bigger boss fights. In Monster Hunter Wilds, though, it's a bigger focus, providing a chapter-by-chapter journey through its tale."", '""The concept that I had from the start of the game was humanity as part of the ecosystem, and realizing that humans weren\'t something on the outside of it looking in, they were part of it, and they had an effect on it,"" says Tokuda. ""That naturally led to an increased focus on story. Because the storytellers, the humans, are actually right in there amongst it. It just made sense to me to have the story more upfront than in past titles.""', 'I can\'t help but compare the approach to being like some more traditional RPGs. Tokuda acknowledges the comparison, but calls the approach more of a ""natural evolution"" of implementing a ""learning curve"" that introduces players to the game. ""I think a chapter structure just makes a lot of sense, because it\'s easy to follow, and players can understand more generally which chapter they\'re in right now, how far along they are,"" says Tokuda. ""The result was, it looked like, as you said, \'Oh, are you trying to go for RPG players by imitating that structure?\' But really it was just, again, it was a natural outcome of our other decisions that hopefully makes sense to players.""', ""Importantly, Monster Hunter Wilds is a game for everyone. The series' console co-op journey has been a long and storied one, but even though past entries have been a bit intimidating – there's immense depth to the hunt – the goal has always been for players to play together. Paving the way for players to jump in, and reach a point where they comfortably join forces is just another weapon in the series' arsenal that's been honed over time. In Monster Hunter Wilds, that winning edge is now razor sharp."", 'When you jump online, who knows, maybe you\'ll end up playing with the devs? The director of Monster Hunter Wilds was sneaking around the beta: ""There are players out there who\'d have no idea to this day that they were actually playing with the director""', ""Games Editor Oscar Taylor-Kent brings his Official PlayStation Magazine and PLAY knowledge to continue to revel in all things capital 'G' games.

Monster Hunter Wilds: What needs improvement?,https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-wilds-what-needs-improvement/,"['The Monster Hunter franchise has long been a cornerstone of the Action-RPG genre, continually evolving to deliver immersive and strategic hunting experiences. Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom’s latest entry, takes a bold step forward with a seamless open-world design that removes traditional loading screens between villages, hubs, and hunting zones.', 'Alongside this, the game introduces streamlined guidance and an improved UI to enhance accessibility while maintaining the depth veteran players expect. With a world significantly larger than its predecessors—Windward Plains alone is reportedly twice the size of Monster Hunter: World’s Wildspire Waste— Wilds aims to push the series to new heights.', 'However, while these advancements signal an exciting direction for the franchise, they also present potential challenges that could impact the core Monster Hunter experience. As a dedicated player with over 1,000 hours in the series, I spent about ten hours in the open beta tests and found that some of these ambitious changes raise concerns regarding gameplay depth, pacing, and technical performance.', 'Traversal Challenges', 'The sheer scale of Monster Hunter Wilds introduces concerns about traversal. While mounts facilitate faster travel, the expanded world may lead to excessive downtime between engagements, potentially detracting from the core hunting experience. If not designed thoughtfully, vast landscapes could disrupt the balance between exploration and action, shifting focus away from the methodical, high-stakes hunts that define the series.', 'Community discussions have already highlighted this concern. In a Reddit thread, users expressed apprehensions about the game becoming a “running simulator” if traversal lacks engaging mechanics.', 'One user aptly summarized the issue:', 'My main concern is that a considerable portion of playtime will be just holding forward. So many open world games boil down to “pick a spot on the map and hold forward for 5 minutes, then maybe something interesting happens.” I’d rather have a hub that I load into after each hunt, then get teleported to my destination once I’m ready to head back out. In an open-world game, traversal must be just as fun, if not more so, than what you do at the destination. Very few games pull this off.', 'To address this, Wilds must ensure that exploration enhances rather than hinders the hunting experience. Dynamic encounters, interactive environments, and innovative movement mechanics could help mitigate potential traversal fatigue and maintain engagement between hunts.', 'Technical Shortcomings', 'Visually, Monster Hunter Wilds is stunning. Its ecosystems are intricately detailed, bringing the world to life with breathtaking environments and dynamic creature interactions. However, technical performance has emerged as a significant concern based on both beta test footage and firsthand gameplay experiences.', 'During my time with the beta, I encountered inconsistent frame rates, particularly in areas with dense foliage and multiple large monsters interacting simultaneously. These performance dips disrupted the otherwise immersive experience. Additionally, some players reported severe texture pop-ins, asset loading issues, and noticeable stuttering when playing the game on PC—issues that, if unaddressed, could hamper the game’s visual fidelity.', 'For a game that aims to be the most immersive Monster Hunter title yet, ensuring stable performance across platforms should be a top priority. Optimization efforts, particularly on hardware that struggles with large-scale environments, will be crucial in delivering a polished final product.', 'Steep Learning Curve', 'Weapon mastery has always been a core component of the Monster Hunter experience, but recent titles have introduced increasingly complex mechanics that demand constant adaptation. While depth in combat is a hallmark of the series, the growing disparity in weapon balancing and evolving mechanics presents a learning curve that may feel more overwhelming than rewarding.', 'During the beta, I extensively tested the Switch Axe—a weapon I’ve dedicated over 300 hours to across Monster Hunter: World and Monster Hunter Rise. However, the sweeping changes in Wilds forced me to relearn the weapon entirely, making my accumulated experience feel somewhat obsolete.', 'While innovation is necessary to keep gameplay fresh, drastic changes to core weapon functionality risk alienating long-term players who have invested years into mastering their preferred playstyles. A balance between innovation and familiarity is essential to ensure that changes are enhancing rather than disrupting fluid and strategic combat.', 'A Promising Title with Room for Refinement', 'Monster Hunter Wilds takes the franchise in an ambitious new direction, introducing innovations that could redefine the series. However, certain aspects—such as its open-world structure, technical performance, and gameplay balance—still require refinement to fully deliver on that promise.', 'As a longtime player, I hope Capcom takes beta feedback seriously and fine-tunes these elements before launch. If executed well, Monster Hunter Wilds has the potential to be one of the most immersive and satisfying Monster Hunter experiences to date.', 'Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release on February 28, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.', '', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'About Annenberg Media • Contact Us • Get Involved', 'uscannenbergmedia.com © 2024 USC Annenberg Media']"

It's an admittedly thin justification for slaughtering hundreds of majestic beasts to turn into hats, pants, and weapons that you then use to slay more of their friends with, but Capcom has consistently tried to give Monster Hunter a noble sheen over the years. Wilds is no different. If anything, it's the company's most overt attempt yet to deliver an eco-positive message around the edges of its combat."", '""When we launched Monster Hunter: World, because it was very successful, we thought about what we wanted to express in the next Monster Hunter installment,"" said Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, who also directed 2018\'s World. One of the team\'s first priorities, he said, was to present ""seamless gameplay sequences"" without load screens between them, which manifest in Wilds\' pop-up camps that let you stay out in the field for long periods of time with no loading between hunts. Then came their thematic focus ""on not just the nature of the world of Monster Hunter, but also how the people living in that work interact with nature.""', '""The relationship between people, nature, and monsters, and what exactly is a hunter\'s role in a world like that"" inspired Wilds\' design, Tokuda said. ""We wanted to illustrate that not just through the gameplay, but a very deep story… There are many other things we have planned down the line that are aligned to the concept of Monster Hunter Wilds, and we\'re confident this game was able to achieve what we wanted to express with it.""', ""The volume of the text that's available in the game will not affect the number of monsters available, so we can satisfy everybody"", 'Tokuda said that there\'s an increased focus on dialogue in Wilds, letting you color in the personality of your hunter a bit more (also new for the series, which traditionally features silent protagonists). But he quickly reassured that it didn\'t come at the expense of combat. ""There may be players who prefer to skip all that and just go keep on hunting the next monster—that\'s possible too. The volume of the text that\'s available in the game will not affect the number of monsters available, so we can satisfy everybody.""', '""We have various people living in that world, like Nata, who had his hometown destroyed by a monster, and Olivia, who wants to correct that,"" he said. ""There are many people with different perspectives living all together. And we also wanted to illustrate how the hunter would feel in a world like that. What would they feel? How would they think? Everybody is different, so we decided to add those kinds of elements to Monster Hunter Wilds.""', 'Ultimately the thing that\'s stuck in my head from our conversation is that Tokuda\'s team already has ""many other things planned down the line"" that build on Wilds\' central idea.

"Nature documentaries, pet lizards and spying on players: how Monster Hunter Wilds built a whole new world",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/20/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom,"['The team behind Capcom’s hit series was known for its extensive grounding in real-world adventures. The latest chapter, developed during Covid, required a different kind of daring', 'M\ny favourite thing about Monster Hunter is that despite the name, you often feel more like the prey than the predator. Even armed with a sword several times your own size and weight, you are often outmatched by the incredible creatures in this action game. In Monster Hunter Wilds, out next week, you are also frequently outmatched by the weather. A routine hunt for some relatively unthreatening creature can go awry as storm clouds gather, bringing with them some terrifying lightning-dragon that will eat you for breakfast. Monsters entangle with each other, tearing with teeth and claws as you turn tail and head for the hills.', 'Over the past couple of weekends, players have been able to get hands-on with Wilds in beta tests, trying out the exquisite character creator and a couple of hunts against a horrid lion (Doshaguma) and an overgrown poisonous chicken (Gypceros). As someone old enough to have played these games on the PlayStation 2, and then later with my fingers contorted uncomfortably around a PlayStation Portable during a student year abroad in Japan, I am amazed and delighted by what Monster Hunter has become. What was once a stiff and densely complex game that hid all its thrills behind a barricade of mushroom-gathering quests is now a fluid, inviting and globally popular spectacle of a thing. Monster Hunter World, 2018’s entry, broke Capcom records and reached 23m sales.', 'Sign up to Pushing Buttons', ""Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming"", '', 'Ryozo Tsujimoto, the series producer and son of Capcom’s founder Kenzo Tsujimoto, has been with Monster Hunter since the early 00s, when he was a designer for Capcom’s online games. Evidently it still excites him; he’s been front and centre on a lot of Wilds’ promotion. “It’s really energising for our team to watch so many people play the game at the same time,” he told me at the most recent Tokyo Game Show, where over 250,000 people turned up to try out forthcoming games. “There’s a lot of things we can only discover by watching players pick up the game and try it out, things we don’t ever get to see in our own testing. We’ve got a few of the dev team undercover on the booth so they can watch how players are responding.”', 'The main innovation in Wilds is how the monsters interact with each other. Previously herbivores would potter about grazing in herds, but it’s only with the additional power of the current generation of consoles that the team had been able to create a seamless ecosystem where they’ll come across each other and get into turf wars. “Having creatures travel together in a realistic way is challenging in terms of making it look plausible,” says Yuya Tokuda, Wilds’ director. “If they all moved in perfect sync it would be a bit uncanny and unconvincing as a pack animal behaviour. But if each individual monster was a complete wildcard, like they were before, it would be untenable to keep it all together. Striking that balance between herd and pack behaviours while having individuality for each creature … that was a lot of work, and we had to get it going from nothing.”', '“I think it’s finally let us make the humans be part of the same ecosystem as everything else in the game,” adds Kaname Fujioka, the art director. “The depiction of a totally seamless ecosystem where there’s not even a loading screen between the base and the map itself is something that has only been possible on this generation.”', 'Monster Hunter’s creators have traditionally done their natural-behaviour research out in the real world on a kind of global team safari, getting a feel for different natural surroundings and recording ambient soundscapes that would later appear in the games. They’ve been to Argentina, Chile and Patagonia, places so remote that they had to subscribe to a satellite phone service because their phones wouldn’t work. This time around, Covid restrictions kicked in right around the time that they would have been out on these research expeditions, so they had to make do with watching a lot of nature documentaries – except Tokuda, who has what he describes as a “significant number” of pet lizards. He has created a special environment at home for them to roam around.', 'Expectations are high for Wilds. Its publisher Capcom is on a run at the moment, having had several more big hits since the last Monster Hunter game in 2018, including popular remakes of its older Resident Evil horror titles – but Monster Hunter remains its makers’ very biggest game. In fact it’s now one of the world’s biggest. At one point during its first open beta test last November, more than 460,000 people were playing Wilds at the same time.', 'Tsujimoto is confident that Worlds can hold its own among gaming’s apex predators. “Any big blockbuster game is our competition now,” says Tsujimoto. “That’s the turf we’ve chosen.”', 'Monster Hunter Wilds is out 28 February']"
