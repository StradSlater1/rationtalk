Mikaela Shiffrin claims sporting immortality with incredible World Cup win No.100,https://www.fis-ski.com/alpine-skiing/news/2024-25/mikaela-shiffrin-claims-sporting-immortality-with-incredible-world-cup-win-no-100,"['Share:', 'Mikaela Shiffrin (USA/Atomic) has done it. At the age of just 29-years-old the American megastar has claimed her 100th Audi FIS World Cup win.', 'A feat many thought was simply not possible.', ' And she did it in typically mind-blowing style too on Sunday afternoon, in Sestriere, Italy.', 'Just a day after failing to qualify for the second run of a World Cup race for the first time in more than 14 years and battling the mental and physical scars of a traumatic crash in November last year, the most consistently successful skier of all time somehow dug into the depths to produce a stunningly assured, aggressive and accurate pair of Slalom runs to hit her century.', ' For an athlete who already owns just about every skiing record, this is surely one that will never be matched.', ""“I don't know that it's possible to dream about a milestone like this. It's too big, it's too long, it takes too much,” Shiffrin said. “I always dreamed about good turns and step by step, and try to be better tomorrow than I was today. And that dream for me is big enough.”"", 'Just like the crowd, the rest of the field and millions watching on TV around the world, Zrinka Ljutic (CRO/Atomic) and Paula Moltzan (USA/Rossignol) will never forget 23 February 2025.', 'Second place to Shiffrin is a special place to be and Ljutic, who ended second, +0.61 seconds behind, is one of the sport’s undoubted rising stars. While Moltzan (+0.64 seconds) getting to join her compatriot on the podium on such a historic day, was wonderfully fitting.', 'But ultimately, when Shiffrin races she often wins, and when she races Slalom, she normally wins.', 'This was not only her record-extending 63rd World Cup Slalom victory – the next most successful skier of either gender is Ingemar Stenmark (SWE) with 40 wins – it was also her seventh World Cup Slalom triumph in her past eight races. And the 11th time in her career that she has won three or more World Cup Slaloms in a single season.', 'A dynamic but relaxed-looking first run on a long, difficult course set the stage for Shiffrin’s heroics. Her advantage however, was just a miniscule 0.09-seconds over Ljutic, winner of three of the past four World Cup Slaloms.', 'Given this, the internal battles she has faced of late and the immense pressure of creating history, many racers would surely have come out the gate a little hesitant for the second run.', 'But Shiffrin is no mortal. Somehow treating it “like a training run”, Shiffrin produced a run fitting of her extraordinary achievement.', 'Showing off a technique that has long been the envy of past and present skiing greats, Shiffrin increased her advantage at each of the first three splits, before cruising to victory in a combined time of one minute 50.33 seconds.', 'It was an exhibition of Slalom skiing from the very best ever, who had to look once, twice, three times at the clock before falling to the snow in disbelief.', ""“I didn't know if it said fourth or first. A hundred times later, and I still can't find the darn scoreboard,” Shiffrin laughed, between tears."", 'The fact that Shiffrin had spent 60 days in recovery from severe trauma to her oblique muscles and a deep puncture wound after that Killington crash, while openly continuing to fight “PTSD” and “mental trauma”, only makes her achievement even more remarkable.', ""“It's been hard to find the right momentum and the right flow and to work through the injury and to come back and compete with these women who are skiing so strong and so fast,” Shiffrin explained. “I have wondered in the last weeks so many times whether it is the right thing to come back."", ""“But in the end, in order to keep moving forward, and to finish this recovery, I have to be in the start gate, and I have to experience these emotions when they're good and when they're bad, and that's really important. Today was just an amazing day in the middle of some really tough months."", '“Today a lot of things had to go right for me and actually wrong for some others. Camille (Rast, the recently crowned Swiss Slalom world champion), on the first run, was just so fast (before crashing within meters of the finish line). A lot of things had to go right in my direction for this to happen but in the end, I did something right too.”', 'She certainly did. For the 100th time overall, and the second in Sestriere.', '“Thank you, everybody has been so nice and so supportive, all of my teammates and competitors and coaches in the whole World Cup. I am so grateful,” added Shiffrin who also won in the Italian resort back in 2016.', '“Thank you and the fans, thank you, thank you so much.', 'Numbers alone cannot do justice to Shiffrin’s gasp-inducing achievement, but they do help give it context.', 'Her first World Cup came on 12 December 2012 in the Slalom in Are, Sweden, when she was aged 17. In the following 4,456 days she has won one Alpine combined event, two Parallel Slaloms, three city events, four Downhills, five Super Gs, 22 Giant Slaloms and 63 Slaloms.', 'She remains the only Alpine skier to win all six World Cup disciplines, an achievement she ticked off in 2019.', 'With 63 Slalom wins, she is now by some distance the most decorated Slalom skier of any gender with Ingemar Stenmark (40 wins) and Marlies Schild (35 wins) her nearest competitors.', 'She is also two clear of Swiss great Vreni Schneider (SUI) as the women’s best World Cup Giant Slalom skier of all time.', 'And if that lot is not enough, her win marks the 155th time she has been on a World Cup podium, meaning she snatches a share of that all-time record, alongside Stenmark.', 'No surprise that second-placed Ljutic’s main emotion, was one of delight that she will forever be able to tell everyone she was just over half-a-second back when Shiffrin made history.', '“I am really happy that I got to be here today. She was fighting so hard, she really deserved (it). She finally took this 100th win and it was special that I could witness it today,” the 21-year-old Croatian said of Shiffrin.', 'With three wins and a second place, Ljutic does take control of the season-long race for the Slalom Crystal Globe, jumping ahead of Rast.', 'Third place for Moltzan caps a superb few weeks for the long-time teammate of Shiffrin’s. After securing a first ever World Cup GS podium in January, she grabbed her maiden individual World Championship medal, finishing third in GS in Saalbach last week. Now, a third career World Cup Slalom podium sends the 30-year-old off for a short break with a big smile on her face.', '“We have four days off, so I am going to go to London. I have been in the mountains since December 18th, so I need a change of pace,"" Moltzan said. ""A little vacation.”  ', 'The last word can only go to the greatest of all time, for whom a vacation is surely due too.', ""“We didn't take the easy way, that's for sure,” Shiffrin laughed. “But I’m very thankful for this day.”""]"

This is in the stratosphere, it’s not in the atmosphere. It’s hard to believe that someone can do it,” Klammer, who triumphed 25 times on the World Cup circuit, said before trying to explain just how she has done it', '“Her skiing is so clean. She sets an edge and she lets the ski run. Even though she is technically very precise. She has just the right mixture.', '“She can perform in any conditions. Amazing, amazing.”', 'Marc Giradelli (LUX), like Shiffrin a true all-rounder, could not agree more.', 'The five-time overall World Cup champion who won across five disciplines, just cannot get over how good Shiffrin is at switching skis.', '“Coming from Downhill to Slalom was a big problem for me, it’s like a 100m sprint and the marathon, they are so far apart,” Giradelli laughed. “But Mikaela is a phenomenon, she does it so easily.”', 'The impact Shiffrin’s exploits have had and will continue to have on Alpine skiing is something Hermann Maier (AUT), the double Olympic and three-time world champion, loves.', '“100 victories is an outstanding milestone, and not just in the history of skiing, this glamorous, incredible achievement also represents a historic event in the sports world,” Maier said.', 'The Austrian’s final World Cup race was just a couple of years before Shiffrin got started, giving him ample time to admire the way in which the Colorado resident has gone about her record-setting career.', '“What also sets Mikaela apart is her naturalness, her authenticity and the joy that she radiates,” he said. “This also has enormous value far beyond skiing.”', 'That is something Shiffrin’s old rivals agree wholeheartedly with. Many of them just delighted to have competed against the greatest of all time.', '“I will for sure tell my kids one day I beat Mikaela, once or twice!” laughed Frida Hansdotter (SWE), who grabbed Olympic Slalom gold in 2018, ahead of the fourth-placed Shiffrin.', '“You are an absolutely amazing skier and athlete and what makes you even greater is you have a warm heart and you have always competed with class and respect.”', 'The love for Shiffrin from even those legends whose records the American has burst past is clear. Two who were winning when Shiffrin first joined the circuit, Tina Maze (SLO) and Viktoria Rebensburg (GER), were so blown away by what their one-time rival has achieved that they… burst into song.', '“You are the dancing queen, young and sweet” the pair sung, before urging Shiffrin to “Keep on dancing!” ', 'Current rivals are just as delighted to be part of the Shiffrin story.

Being a good roommate to me back when we were 12. Always being such an inspiration.', '“It’s those things coupled with how good you are that have really inspired people to join ski racing and have really made the impact that you have.”', 'Given the fact the 29-year-old Shiffrin shows no signs of slowing down, thoughts have already started to move on to what is on the horizon for the record-breaker.', '“I am looking forward to the next 100,” double Olympic champion Michelle Gisin (SUI/Salomon) said, smiling, before adding a touch more seriously, “This is the most incredible number.', '“I don’t think anyone has ever dreamt of it or thought it possible.”', 'A 26-year-old with just 57 World Cup starts to her name so far, made the final plea.', '“I am dreaming since I am a little girl to have one (win) and she has 100,” Camille Cerutti (FRA/Atomic) said.', '“Please give me one!”']"

All of them, and each of them is/was top!” Once again, the skiing legend, Mikaela Shiffrin, has written her name in history, this time with a feat that the last season felt would be in her hands. Nevertheless, luck played a bad trick on her at the Stifel Killington Cup. Instead of the victory, she received an injury that later translated into surgery. Now, with undeniable resilience and sheer dominion, she has silenced all doubts, thus showing why she is number one in alpine skiing. Her recent victory at Sestriere is historic not just because it went the extra mile to show that the Colorado native is stronger than her injuries, but also for another iconic reason.', 'Watch What’S Trending Now!', 'FIS Alpine’s Instagram page is the harbinger of the good news this time, “💯🏆 A historic podium in Sestriere! 🥇 🇺🇸—100th career victory! 🔥” The 29-year-old skiing legend is the first skier, male or female, to win triple-digit World Cup races.

Now or ever.', 'Shiffrin won her 100th World Cup race Sunday, less than three months after a crash in her first attempt at the milestone left her with a puncture wound in her abdomen and severe muscle trauma. It comes in her sixth race since returning from injury.', '""It certainly feels like I’ve been fighting a lot lately,"" Shiffrin said. ""It’s been hard to find the right momentum and the right flow and to work through the injury and come back and compete with these women who are skiing so strong and so fast. I have wondered in the last weeks so many times whether it is the right thing to come back.', '""Today was just an amazing day in the middle of some really tough months,"" she added. ""I’m very thankful for this day.""', ""When Shiffrin crossed the finish line of the slalom in Sestriere, Italy, she fell to the snow, overwhelmed by the moment and all it's taken for her to get to it."", 'On Nov. 30, in her first opportunity to get her 100th win, Shiffrin crashed during the second run of a giant slalom race in Killington, Vermont. She was in the lead when she lost an edge, hitting one gate at full speed and somersaulting into another before coming to rest against the safety netting.', '""There’s a puncture and then basically whatever stabbed in there did a little dancey dance inside of my obliques and basically tore a cavern into my oblique muscles. That’s what’s causing bleeding and inflammation and just pain, in general,"" Shiffrin said in a Dec. 4 update.', '""This is another fairly ambiguous injury and really hard to put a timeline of when I’ll be either back on snow or back to racing,"" she added.', 'Shiffrin was bedridden for several weeks and needed surgery in mid-December to ward off an infection. She missed almost two months before returning to the World Cup circuit in Courchevel, France, on Jan. 30. She paired with Breezy Johnson to win the team combined at the world championships two weeks later, but said recovery would be an ongoing effort the rest of the season.', ""That was evident in the first two races in Sestriere, both giant slaloms. She looked tentative on the longer, faster courses and was so far off the pace Saturday that she didn't even qualify for the second run."", 'Now look at her. Not only back on the podium, but the very top of it.', ""Shiffrin posted the fastest time in the first run, finishing 0.09 seconds ahead of Croatia's Zrinka Ljutic, a three-time winner this season. She got out of the gate strong on the second run and was in control throughout, displaying the aggressively fluid style that's become her trademark."", ""Though Shiffrin has said she's still working on her endurance, she kept pushing until the very end. She finished 0.61 seconds ahead of Ljutic. U.S. teammate Paula Moltzan was third."", ""While her team and fans began celebrating, Shiffrin didn't show emotion immediately – in part because she didn't know where she'd finished."", '""I didn’t know if (the scoreboard) said fourth or first. One hundred times later, and I still can’t find the darned scoreboard,"" Shiffrin said with a laugh.', 'Once she realized she\'d won, however, the emotions took hold. She fought tears in the finish area and in her post-race interview, and several times had to put her face in her hands. By the time she came back out for the victory ceremony, Shiffrin was all smiles. She also was sporting a new pair of gloves, ones that had ""100"" emblazoned in gold on them.', ""The victory also was Shiffrin's 155th time on a World Cup podium, tying Ingemar Stenmark's record."", '""It takes time to get the mind in the right state, to take on ski racing and the full speed,"" Shiffrin said. ""These top women, I can see how powerful they are and how secure they are, to take the speed from the course and to make it stronger. I’m not there.', '""The mountain ahead of me to climb is steep and long. If I get there – when I get there – it will be very sweet. But for now, I just have to take this day and be grateful for it because it’s a small moment in the middle of many tough moments that makes me feel that maybe I can be good again.""', 'Stenmark’s record of 86 career World Cup wins was once considered untouchable, standing for 30-plus years despite the best efforts of Lindsey Vonn, Marcel Hirscher, Hermann Maier and Alberto Tomba. But Shiffrin not only broke Stenmark’s mark, getting her 87th win in March 2023, she has blown past it.', 'She has not said how much longer she’ll ski but, at 29, she’s still in the prime of her career. And with the win rate she already has – at least five victories a season for the last 11 years, with the exception of the injury- and COVID-shortened 2020-21 season – Shiffrin joins Michael Phelps, LeBron James and Simone Biles on that rare list of athletes whose records truly are unbeatable.', 'Vonn, who came out of retirement this year, is the next-closest to Shiffrin with 82 wins. After that, the active skiers with the most World Cup wins are Lara Gut-Behrami with 46 and Marco Odermatt with 45.', '""I don’t know that it’s possible to dream about a milestone like this. It’s too big. It’s too long, it takes too much,"" Shiffrin said Sunday. ""I always dreamed about good turns and step by step and try to be better tomorrow than I was today. That dream for me is big enough.""', 'Shiffrin, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, has never been driven by records or accolades. To the contrary, viewing her career through that limited prism has always made her uncomfortable. It’s the process that fuels her, that never-ending quest to get a little bit better every time she puts on skis or to see the work she’s been doing in training carry over to a race.', ""But she was determined to take a different view as she approached this 100th victory, trying to appreciate it because of the way others do. She's also hoping to use the spotlight that comes with these milestones to bring attention to Share Winter, a foundation that brings winter sports to kids and communities that historically have not had access to them."", 'Shiffrin donated $10,000 to Share Winter for her 100th win, and challenged fans and sponsors to join her to get the total to $100,000. That would allow Share Winter to fund an entire season of skiing for 200 children.', '""One of the most beautiful things we can do as athletes is to share this passion and this love for the winter and the outdoors and the mountains with more of the world,"" Shiffrin said. ""When you look around at the fans and everybody here cheering and enjoying the weather and the mountains and the sport, I wish there were even more people that understood the beauty of it.""', 'There are two more technical races, a GS and slalom in Are, Sweden, before the World Cup finals next month in Sun Valley, Idaho.', '""It’s step by step,"" Shiffrin said. ""Also, to stand in the start gate and take the mentality of what I want to do (so it) is what I actually do, that’s not been totally connected. Today it was and that’s really – that feels good for the soul.""', '(This story was updated with new information.)']"

"With 100th World Cup victory, Mikaela Shiffrin's legend as GOAT only grows",https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/43614775/100-world-cup-victories-mikaela-shiffrin,"['', 'THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ski racer of all time has achieved what no skier has ever gotten close to doing before. Mikaela Shiffrin has reached a level that few athletes have reached in any sport.', 'On Feb. 23, the 29-year-old notched her 100th World Cup victory in Sestriere, Italy. The victory marked an incredible surge of strength -- both physical and mental -- following recovery from a serious early-season injury.', 'When the first-place result came up on Sunday, she lay on the snow, almost in disbelief, before being helped up by teammate Paula Moltzan. Afterwards, Shiffrin cried when she was asked what it meant to her to win after struggling the last few months.', '""I don\'t know that it\'s possible to dream about a milestone like this,"" she said after the race in an interview, ""It\'s too big. It\'s too long. It takes too much. I always dreamed about good turns, step by step and trying to be better tomorrow than I was today. That dream for me is big enough.""', 'In November, Shiffrin was going for her 100th World Cup victory in front of a massive home crowd in Killington, Vermont, when she crashed violently in the second run of the giant slalom race, sliding at high speed through a gate and sustaining a deep puncture (likely from either the gate or her ski pole) to her abdomen. The crash tore her oblique muscle, required surgery and forced her into a long hiatus from racing at home in Edwards, Colorado.', '""You\'re racing at your limit. There\'s fine margins in this sport,"" she told ESPN after the injury, following surgery that involved cleaning out the wound and attaching a drainage device. ""We have to be on the limit. Those crashes do happen. If I was just a few feet lower or a few feet higher, I might have missed the gate entirely. There\'s all sorts of reasons when you\'re racing at your limit and it\'s a difference between a couple centimeters of actually crashing like that or having a winning run.""', ""A week or two after her injury, Shiffrin did not have the strength to sit up in a chair. She felt as if the muscles in the right side of her body were completely disconnected and would not fire. Simply the act of getting out of bed was an extended ordeal. Laughing, coughing or sneezing brought on sharp pain. She wouldn't have imagined she'd be back in the start gate so soon, much less winning."", '""One of the biggest takeaways from this injury is resilience, being relentless in how I approach the recovery, how I approach my training. It\'s like putting your head down and being able to do the work, grind it out, but also being able to bite off what you can chew,"" she said after several months of recovery, in January. ""At the time, I was in the thick of it. It was hard to see the progress I was making when I was in the moment. Looking back at it now, that progress is undeniable. It\'s so powerful to look back at that.""', 'Shiffrin spent the next several weeks making step-by-step progress. She started out walking slowly and gingerly, then a bit faster. She got back to the gym for some weightlifting and strength training, then finally made her way back to the slopes to free ski and test how the impact on her body would feel cranking her skis around gates. A few days before returning to racing, Shiffrin said that winning -- taking another crack at that 100th victory -- was pretty much off the table.', '""Right now, 100 is not really on my radar,"" she said. ""I\'m focused on making a successful turn, which means coming back to racing with strong form, good fitness level and good skiing. That doesn\'t necessarily mean winning just yet. I don\'t really know where I stand compared to the other athletes at this point in the season. I feel so lucky that I\'m able to make a return to racing in the same season as my injury. It could have been a lot worse. It was about one millimeter from being an internal organ puncture situation. That would have life-threatening, catastrophic. Instead, I\'m eight weeks down the road looking at making a return and feeling physically strong again. This is something to soak in and cherish.""', ""She skied notably cautiously in the World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France, on Jan.30, landing 10th place. She then moved on to compete in the 2025 world championships in Saalbach, Austria, notching a fifth place in the slalom. Struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder from her crash, the last time she'd competed in giant slalom, Shiffrin opted out of the world championships giant slalom. But after encouragement from U.S. teammate Breezy Johnson, who had just become world downhill champion and with whom Shiffrin has raced since childhood, the duo managed to clinch gold in the team combined event, Shiffrin blazing ahead to win the slalom portion and secure the win."", ""The gold was Shiffrin's 15th career world championship medal, matching the record set in the 1930s by German skier Christl Cranz."", '""This was an amazing day for me up there, nerve-wracking because Breezy did her job just spectacularly this morning,"" said Shiffrin after the race. It was so much fun to watch all these days, day in day out, she has been executing. ... So, really, really unbelievable.""', 'THIS, OF COURSE, is not the first time Shiffrin has proven her resilience.', ""Two years ago, she eclipsed the World Cup record (86 wins) previously held by Swedish skier Ingemar Stenmark. Shiffrin landed her first World Cup podium when she was only 15, her first victory at 17. She once won a World Cup slalom race by more than 3 seconds -- the largest margin in women's slalom history. She has collected 14 World Championship medals and three Olympic medals: two gold and one silver."", ""But her last Olympics proved to be a downturn in Shiffrin's otherwise rocket-like career trajectory. Competing in six events, Shiffrin failed to finish the first two races, her two strongest disciplines. She crashed in the first run of the giant slalom, then skied off-course five gates into the slalom, her best event. The next two races were speed events -- super G and downhill."", ""While Shiffrin hadn't had as much experience or success in these disciplines, she had won both in the World Cup. She notched a ninth and 18th, respectively. She then took another DNF in the Olympic combined race, skiing off-course in the slalom leg."", 'The entire set of performances were highly uncharacteristic of Shiffrin. In the four years leading up to the 2022 Games, Shiffrin had posted only two DNFs. The unprecedented low point was possibly fueled by emotions, including a coaching changeup and grief over the loss of her father, who passed suddenly in an accident almost exactly two years before the 2022 opening ceremonies.', '""You can see how easily it goes wrong and how hard it is to actually make it to the finish with a fast time. I\'m grateful for how many times I\'ve been able to do that,"" Shiffrin said. ""I\'ve had plenty of luck in my career.""', ""The next Olympics are set for next February in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, a place where she has glimpsed some of her highest and lowest moments. Last year, Shiffrin suffered a crash and knee injury on the Cortina slope during the World Cup downhill, effectively ending her season and preventing her from retaining the World Cup overall title. But she has also landed several podiums at the Italian venue, including four back-to-back medals at the 2021 world championships. Shiffrin is looking forward to reminding the world what she's capable of while on her sport's most prominent stage. She's also looking forward to a Winter Games without the challenges of the pandemic."", '""Not having the same situation with Covid, how limiting, sterile and different that environment was to be in, on top of being in a pressure-full Olympic environment, that\'s certainly something I hope to not experience again,"" she told ESPN. ""Being in Cortina, that opens a whole world of comfort level. It\'s a regular stop on the World Cup. I\'ve been there a handful of times in my career. That familiarity is something I\'m looking forward to. My goal around these big events is to come in with a level of comfort and security with my skiing and preparation, so I can enjoy being there. ... I want to put out my best skiing, be part of a great show. I hope to be able to perform at my best on that global stage.""', ""SHIFFRIN HAS GATHERED a massive social media following with 1.4 million on Instagram alone, not just because of her skiing prowess, but because of her authentic, somewhat shy personality and extracurricular talents. She has described herself as an introvert but has showcased her skills for dancing, singing and playing guitar, also posting the reality of her experience as a human being -- deliriously (and hilariously) waking up from surgery in a hospital bed, heartfelt tribute posts to her father and silly couples' moments with fiancé and fellow ski champion Aleksander Kilde Aamodt."", ""She is reluctant to admit her role in bringing her sport into the spotlight, rendering it one of very few in the world where viewers are more interested in the women's side than the men's."", '""I\'m grateful to be part of this generation of athletes who are having such an impact on women\'s ski racing,"" Shiffrin said. ""It\'s been quite a few years that I\'ve been one of the top athletes in that group, but it doesn\'t come without its challenges. It\'s an honor to be one of those athletes making a difference in the sport. I guess I sort of look around and see all the enthusiasm that does exist for ski racing and all I want to do is help find a way to give more people access to the sport and make it something that\'s more viable for more people.""', 'Shiffrin partners with the Share Winter Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at providing snowsports opportunities to youth across America, particularly those in urban and rural areas. In honor of her 100th World Cup victory, Shiffrin will work with Share Winter to raise $100,000 for ski and snowboard programs for youth who otherwise would not have access to these sports.', '""Simply being outdoors and in the mountains, being able to experience something adventurous and good for the soul, your mind, your body and your spirit, it\'s such a beautiful thing,"" she said. ""A sport that has given so much to me, it\'s a time in my career when I\'m really cognizant of how much I can give back. If it\'s bringing a few more fans to the sport, then that\'s just incredible.""']"

In Sestriere’s giant slalom race yesterday, Shiffrin had not even made the flip (ski racing jargon for finishing in the top 30 first run and earning a second run). In her 278 World Cup starts, Shiffrin has only missed a second run seven times.', '“There’s always expectation that I’m going to be on the top step,” Shiffrin said after her slalom win. “When I look around at the at the other athletes, at my competitors, it sometimes seems impossible that I can win these races. They’re so strong. In the GS the last two days, you could see this unbelievable level of skiing, and this whole season for me, watching from the sideline, was incredible. Returning has been very tough. So it was the last thing on my mind to win this race today. Maybe that’s good.”', 'Even better, Shiffrin shared the podium with teammate Paula Moltzan, who earned her first slalom podium of the season in Sestriere. And AJ Hurt skied the fastest second run. It’s a testament to the strength of the U.S. women’s team this season.', 'To celebrate her 100th win, Shiffrin announced a partnership with Share Winter Foundation to raise $100,000 for its learn to ski and snowboard programs for underserved youth who don’t have access to winter sports. Shiffrin is kicking in $10,000 of her own money, with Ikon Pass adding another $50,000, and she is challenging her sponsors—and fans—to make contributions.', '“I see this 100 victory conversation as an opportunity to bring more eyes and, ideally, more passion to the sport,” Shiffrin said earlier this season when she announced an ambassadorship with Share Winter. “I just feel like winning 100, just in and of itself, is about me. It’s about my career and what I’ve done to get there. It’s incredible of course, but I’d like to turn the spotlight to something bigger than me. Helping Share Winter bring more kids to the mountain is really meaningful. It’s far bigger than me winning 100 races. This will make that 100th victory one of the most meaningful to me.”', 'Shiffrin had hoped to make this announcement three months ago at the Killington World Cup. At the Vermont resort, leading the giant slalom after the first run, she tumbled head-over-keister near the bottom of the course — a near catastrophic fall that left her with a puncture wound that nearly pierced her colon. She lay very, very low for three weeks, had surgery, then had to slowly rehab, careful not to reinjure her punctured oblique muscle.', 'Once back on snow, a “PTSD-esque” response to the crash made her comeback a steep climb. She began racing again at the end of January but without her usual intensity. And giant slalom has been particularly hard.', 'Shiffrin has had many dark moments in the past 12 weeks, particularly in Giant Slalom. At world championships earlier this month, she had planned to defend her GS world title and compete in slalom. But mental hurdles got in the way of GS, so she dropped that race from her program. This weekend, the two GS races in Sestriere were her first since Killington; she finished 25th on Friday (her lowest finish in a tech race in over a decade), then 33rd on Saturday.', 'The challenges of this season made the 100th World Cup win incredibly emotional for Shiffrin.', '“I feel like the mountain ahead of me to climb is steep and long, and if I get there when I get there, it will be very sweet,” she said. “But for now, I just have to take this day and be grateful for it, because it’s a small moment in the middle of many tough moments that makes me feel that maybe I can … maybe I can be good again.”', 'In the past couple of weeks, she talked about the effort it has taken to find her form again, her flow in the course, especially in a sport that’s as much mental as physical.', '“It certainly feels like I’ve been fighting a lot lately, and it’s been hard to find the right momentum and flow, work through the injury, and come back and compete with these women who are skiing so strong and fast,” she said. “I have wondered in the last weeks so many times whether it is the right thing to come back [this season]. We didn’t take the easy way, that’s for sure.', '“But in the end, in order to keep moving forward and finish this recovery, I have to be in the start gate, and I have to experience these emotions when they’re good and when they’re bad. That’s really important.', '“Today was just an amazing day in the middle of some really tough months, but I’m very thankful for this day.”', 'Asked if she remembers each of her 100 World Cup victories, Shiffrin said no, just certain ones that hold extra meaning — like when she can share the podium with her teammates, or back at win 87 two years ago, when her brother and his wife made a surprise visit. The announcement with Share Winter also made her 100th win special.', '“One of the most beautiful things that we can do as athletes is to share this passion and this love for the winter and the outdoors and the mountains with more of the world,” she said. “When you look around at the fans and everybody here cheering and enjoying the weather and the mountains and the sport, I just I wish that there were even more people who understood the beauty of it.”', 'For the statisticians in the group, Shiffrin’s win in Sestriere also brought her into another record-resetting territory. It was her 155th World Cup podium, tying a 36-year-old record held by Ingemar Stenmark.', 'As for her “lost” look when she crossed the finish line, she could not find the scoreboard. She had no idea where she had finished—first, fourth, last …', '“One hundred times,” she quipped, “and I still can’t find the darn scoreboard!”', ""Testing skis and winter gear is hard work (just ask our boot testers)—but someone's gotta do it."", 'Join Outside+ to get access to exclusive content, thousands of training plans, and more.']"

Only Ingemar Stenmark (SWE, 86), Lindsey Vonn (USA/Head, 82) and Marcel Hirscher (AUT/NED/Van Deer, 67) have won more World Cup races in all disciplines combined than Shiffrin has won in Slalom alone."", ""The next most World Cup wins in one discipline by any Alpine skier is Stenmark's 46 victories in Giant Slalom."", ""Shiffrin's Slalom dominance is such that among the eight Alpine ski racers with 50 or more World Cup victories, she has the second-highest percentage of wins in one discipline, trailing only Alberto Tomba (ITA), also in Slalom."", ""For all her Slalom success, however, let's not forget that Shiffrin has also won 37 World Cup races in non-Slalom disciplines."", ""If you threw out all 63 of her Slalom victories and left her with 'just' the 37 others, she'd still be in equal seventh spot on the women's all-time World Cup victory list, tied with Marlies Schild (AUT)."", 'Shiffrin has competed on the World Cup in 17 countries, and won in 16 of them — the only exception being Russia, where she came third in her only World Cup race, a city event in 2013 in Moscow.', 'Fortunately, Shiffrin can console herself with the fact that she did win a non-World Cup race of some importance in Russia once: the 2014 Olympic Slalom title in Sochi.', 'The American is equally as comfortable on home snow, however, as the USA is her second-most successful country in terms of World Cup wins.', ""Shiffrin's counting stats are unparalleled, but her rate stats are equally impressive."", ""With 100 wins in 278 World Cup starts, she wins once every 2.78 races. Looking at the same eight stars with 50+ victories, Shiffrin's mark ranks second, just behind Stenmark's rate of a win every 2.69 starts."", 'When it comes to converting podiums into wins, Shiffrin tops even Stenmark, as 64.5% of her podiums are victories — No.1 among our eight legends.', ""Speaking of podiums, Shiffrin equaled Stenmark's World Cup record of 155 with her victory on Sunday, and will overtake him with her next top-three result."", ""Shiffrin is still only 29 years old and won't turn 30 until next month. Her 100 wins before turning 30 are obviously an all-time record, but how many more victories could be left in her?"", ""Alpine skiers winning a huge bag of races after 30 used to be rare, but in more recent years, Vonn, Maier and Federica Brignone (ITA/Rossignol) have shown that it can be done. Here's a final look at our eight most successful World Cup Alpine ski racers and the age profile of their victories."", ""If Shiffrin keeps skiing into her 30s, we wouldn't bet against her moving up this table, just as she has in virtually every other category in her amazing career."", 'And who knows? One day she might even be able to make her own Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all her records.']"

Shiffrin’s U.S. teammate Paula Moltzan was third, 0.64 back.', 'The 29-year-old Shiffrin also tied an all-time World Cup record for men and women, as her 155th career top-3 finish on the podium matched Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark.', 'Shiffrin crossed the finish line and took a long look toward the scoreboard showing her victory -- which she later said she could not find. She then looked again over her left shoulder with an expression of amazement.', 'She lay down on the snow with her right hand to her helmet, and was helped to her feet by Moltzan who hugged her.', 'Shiffrin cried at first when asked in a post-race interview what it meant after all she had been through in the past few months.', '“Everyone had been so nice and so supportive. I am so grateful, thank you,” she said, adding later it was “just an amazing day in the middle of some really tough months.', '“I have wondered in the last weeks so many times whether it is the right thing to come back,” said Shiffrin, who had been a distant 10th in a Jan. 30 slalom at Courchevel, France.', 'Shiffrin’s 99th win was earned exactly three months ago in a slalom at Gurgl, Austria.', 'No. 100 had been within clear sight one week later when Shriffin crashed out of a giant slalom at Killington, Vermont, while racing fast as the first-run leader.', 'The injuries she suffered in a tumbling fall -- severe trauma to her oblique muscles and a deep puncture wound -- sidelined her for several weeks and left “PTSD-like” anxiety about racing giant slalom.', 'In two giant slaloms at Sestriere, she placed 25th Friday and Saturday finished outside the top-30 fastest racers in the first run for the first time since 2012.', 'Shiffrin showed no sign of nerves Sunday with an aggressive second run to victory, a full half-second faster than Ljutic who is a three-time winner this season in World Cup slaloms.', '“A lot of things had to go right in my direction for this to happen. But I did something right, too,” a tearful Shiffrin said minutes after the race.', 'Shiffrin and Stenmark are the two greatest record setters in the World Cup’s 58-year history.', '“She’s much better than I was. You cannot compare,” Stenmark said in an interview two years ago.', 'His record of 86 World Cup wins was broken by Shiffrin in March 2023, almost 34 years after his last win.

Sunday was her 278th World Cup race and Stenmark’s last podium was in his 284th, according to the ski-db.com site.', 'Shiffrin’a injury absence means she is unlikely to add to her eight career titles in the season-long World Cup slalom standings.
