Ukraine and Western countries have previously accused North Korea of supplying weapons to Russia, which Pyongyang and Moscow have denied.\nPutin said on Thursday it was up to Moscow and Pyongyang how to conduct their mutual defense agreement, and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Russia plans to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield starting Oct. 27-28, citing intelligence reports.\nUkrainian military intelligence said on Thursday that around 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia, and training was taking place on five military bases.\nThe United States has said it has seen evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, and South Korean lawmakers said about 3,000 soldiers had been sent, with more to follow.', 'LONDON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged Friday to work with “real urgency” for a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon and urged Israel to spare civilians, but stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire.\n“We have a sense of real urgency in getting to a diplomatic resolution and the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, such that there can be real security along the border between Israel and Lebanon,” Blinken said after meeting Lebanon’s prime minister in London, referring to calls for the disarmament of Hezbollah.\nJordan’s foreign minister on Friday called for pressure on Israel to end “ethnic cleansing,” in strong remarks as he met in London.\nDeploring the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, Ayman Safadi told Blinken: “We do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop.”', 'Kabul: A former wife of legendary US boxer Muhammad Ali arrived in the Afghan capital, a Taliban government official said Friday, to reportedly open a stadium in a country where women are barred from sports.\nThe head of the Taliban government’s sports directorate, Ahmadullah Wasiq, told AFP that Khalilah Camacho-Ali, who was married to the boxer for a decade from 1967, had arrived in Kabul.\nState media cited the directorate as saying she was in the city “to build a sports stadium to be named ‘Pirozi’ (victory in Dari) and a sports association named after Muhammad Ali.”\nBorn Belinda Boyd in 1950 in the United States, Camacho-Ali, like her world champion boxer ex-husband, converted to Islam after they married.\nMuhammad Ali himself visited Kabul in 2002, a year after the US forces overthrew the first Taliban government, visiting a girls’ school in his role as a United Nations peace ambassador.\nSince the Taliban government came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, they have imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law, with women bearing the brunt of restrictions the United Nations have called “gender apartheid,” including blocking women from participating in sports.\nDuring the Taliban’s first rule from 1996 to 2001, public executions in sports stadiums were common.\nPublic corporal punishment has continued since their return to power and at least two public executions have been held in a sports stadium.\nThe authorities have recently set restrictions on combat sports as well, saying free fighting such as in Mixed Martial Arts was un-Islamic.\nCamacho-Ali is a martial artist, as well as an actress and author, according to her website.\nAli was born Cassius Clay in the southeastern state of Kentucky and is known as both a sporting great and for his role in fighting for civil rights for African Americans. He died in 2016.', 'MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin said his Turkish counterpart, Tayyip Erdogan, had proposed reviving contacts on Black Sea shipping but that he had not yet had time to study the documents.\nPutin told Russian state television that Erdogan had “once again renewed these proposals to continue contacts related to shipping in the Black Sea, (and) on some other issues.”\nPutin met Erdogan at the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan as well as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n“To be honest, I haven’t even had time to read the materials that our Turkish partners and friends have given us,” Putin said. “Well, let’s see. We have never refused this.”\nTurkiye and the United Nations helped mediate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal struck in July 2022 that had allowed the safe Black Sea export of nearly 33 million metric tonnes of Ukraine grain.\nRussia withdrew from the agreement in July 2023, complaining that its own food and fertilizer exports faced serious obstacles.\nTurkiye and Guterres have repeatedly tried to get merchant shipping sailing more freely though the Black Sea, which in some areas has been turned into a naval war zone since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\nThe advance of Moscow’s forces, which control just under a fifth of Ukraine, has underlined Russia’s vast superiority in men and materiel as Ukraine pleads for more weapons from the Western allies that have been supporting it.\nWhen asked if he felt that the war might become some sort of frozen conflict along the lines of Korea or Cyprus, Putin said: “Any outcome should be in favor of Russia, I speak bluntly, without any hesitation, and should proceed from the realities that are taking shape on the battlefield,” Putin said.\nRussia controls about one fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 80 percent of the Donbas — a coal-and-steel zone comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions — and over 70 percent of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.\n“We are not going to make any concessions here, there will be no trades,” Putin said. “We are ready to make these compromises, we are reasonable. But I don’t want to go into details right now, because there are no substantive negotiations.”\nHe said that Ukraine had already twice rejected Russian ceasefire initiatives but that Russian forces were advancing along the front.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"
