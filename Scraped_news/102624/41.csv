Venom: The Last Dance is a delight when it’s not being a Madame Web rerun,https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/venom-the-last-dance-review-b2634281.html,"['', 'The third and supposedly final chapter in this oddly vintage buddy comedy super-villain series is plenty fun – if you ignore the abundance of dull exposition', 'This election is still a dead heat, according to most polls. In a fight with such wafer-thin margins, we need reporters on the ground talking to the people Trump and Harris are courting. Your support allows us to keep sending journalists to the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by 27 million Americans from across the entire political spectrum every month. Unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock you out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. But quality journalism must still be paid for.', 'It’s a testament to Tom Hardy and writer-director Kelly Marcel that the process of having to bid adieu to the veiny, intrusive-thought-made-hulking-flesh that is Venom may bring the whisper of a tear to the eye. Venom: The Last Dance is, supposedly, the third and final outing for the classic Spider-Man adversary who, for contractual reasons, has not been allowed to fight any Spider-Men.', 'The Venom trilogy has partly been Sony’s Eminem-soundtracked, oddly vintage attempt to offer a clapback to MCU wholesomeness. Yet, thanks largely to Let There Be Carnage, the trilogy’s 2021 middle chapter, it’s also transformed into a feverishly inspired romcom between Hardy’s moto-jacketed journalist Eddie Brock and Venom, the alien symbiote who latched onto him.', 'The Last Dance, though, sees the franchise unfortunately relapse somewhat into the Morbius and Madame Web brand of dense, dull exposition that Sony’s non-Spider-Man movies seem drawn towards like a moth to a flame. Knull (voiced by Andy Serkis), the “god of the void” and Venom’s creator, whose appearance is of the interchangeable, skeletal wraith variety, is on the hunt for a codex that will free him from his prison and allow him to get back on schedule for destroying the universe.', 'We’re subsequently introduced to more symbiotes, all helpfully colour-coded, and Knull’s squad of symbiote hunters, the xenophages, a generic alien foe save for a quite cool feature that sees them spray a blood mist out the back of their heads every time they chow down on someone. Two accomplished actors, Ted Lasso’s Juno Temple and Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor, play a scientist and a soldier, respectively – jobs that largely involve peering through observation windows and attempting to fathom the unfathomable.', 'But Marcel, who’s now added director to her usual screenwriter credit, is well aware of what her film is. Any non-Venom scene flies by like it’s being watched from a passing rollercoaster while, crawling out from underneath the pile of studio demands, appears a tribute to Hardy’s blissfully untethered performance as both host and guttural-voiced parasite. What started as the actor dunking his entire body into a restaurant lobster tank here ends with him hunched over a Vegas slot machine, slamming buttons and pulling cranks as if he were being puppeteered off camera.', 'Any scene in The Last Dance that concerns Venom and Eddie is a delight, a direct continuation of the series’s charming, broad-purpose metaphor – queer-coded in parts (they refer to each other as Thelma and Louise), and all about self-love and acceptance. Together, they break up a dog fighting ring and ensure the pups all find “loving forever homes”, a particularly Hardy touch considering his offscreen canine advocacy.', 'They join up with an alien-obsessed camper van family headed by Rhys Ifans, and get roped into a sing-along to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”. Venom, at one point, fuses himself with a horse, hooves throwing up dust and tongue flapping gracefully wind. There’s even some unexpected sincerity when Venom tells Eddie, “You would make a good dad.”', 'It’s enough to justify both the film’s tongue-in-cheek nod to Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam and its end-game highlights reel of Venom and Eddie’s best moments. It’s hard to say how these films will be remembered in the grand scheme of comic book history, but, with The Last Dance, we can at least be reminded that sometimes they actually managed to have fun with these things.', 'Dir: Kelly Marcel.

Here’s how it works.', 'The “Venom” movies shouldn’t work at all. The only reason they even exist is because of the complexities of the licensing deal between Marvel and Sony, which allows Sony to make live-action movies featuring characters that are connected to Spider-Man — but without Spider-Man himself.', 'That has led to notorious failures like “Morbius” and “Madame Web,” and the best I can say for the “Venom” movies is that they aren’t as bad as those infamous flops. If they succeed at all, it’s through the sheer willpower of star and producer Tom Hardy, who is fully dedicated to his oddball performance as the title character.', 'Hardy once again throws himself into the role in the new sequel “Venom: The Last Dance,” opening Oct. 25 in theaters. The third and allegedly final movie in the franchise finds Hardy’s Eddie Brock on the run from the law following the events of 2021’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” while also being pursued by a secret government agency and alien hunters from the home planet of the extraterrestrial symbiote he’s bonded with.', 'It’s a chaotic, often incoherent plot that makes poor use of elements from the previous movies as well as mythology from Marvel’s recent Venom comic books.', '', 'Since the release of the original “Venom” in 2018, the character has become something of a camp icon, thanks to Hardy’s hammy performance as both Brock and the voice of the Venom symbiote. Writer-director Kelly Marcel, who makes her directorial debut after co-writing the first two movies, leans into that off-kilter tone, and most of the Eddie/Venom scenes in the first half of the movie are self-consciously wacky, full of terrible one-liners and winking references.', 'Eddie begins the movie in a Mexican bar where he was left during his brief sojourn into the main Marvel Cinematic Universe in the mid-credits scene of “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” but that just gives him time to complain about multiverses before being transported back to his own dimension, where he’s a fugitive from justice.', 'Attempting to evade a nasty-looking monster sent from the other side of the universe to hunt down Venom, the pair go on a sort of meandering road trip. They encounter an eccentric alien-obsessed hippie played by Rhys Ifans and take a side trip to Las Vegas, where Venom and Eddie’s old neighbor Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu) engage in a dance routine set to a cover of ABBA’s “Dancing Queen.”', 'Meanwhile, government scientist Dr. Payne (Juno Temple) and stern military commander Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have been collecting and studying symbiotes at a hidden underground base, and they set out to capture Eddie and Venom, too. Their scenes are serious and dull, full of unwieldy exposition and unclear motivations. Temple and Ejiofor are great actors, but they can’t make their characters into anything other than plot devices, despite a treacly and confusing flashback about Payne’s trauma over the death of her brother.', '', 'The symbiotes and the government agents all become targets of Knull, the vaguely evil alien who originally created the symbiotes and was then imprisoned by them. In order to break free of his captivity, he needs something called a codex, which Venom and Eddie possess when they are fully joined together. It’s an ill-defined doohickey that serves as a weak engine to drive the action. Knull appears only briefly onscreen (played via motion capture by “Let There Be Carnage” director Andy Serkis), so his nondescript threat of destroying the universe doesn’t carry much weight, and his actual powers are never fully explained.', 'The villains in the first two “Venom” movies may have been underwhelming, but at least they were present, consistently reminding the audience of their vendettas against Eddie and Venom. Payne and Strickland don’t get enough characterization to function as worthwhile antagonists, or as reluctant allies during the big finale.', 'That final battle is the most substantial action sequence in the entire “Venom” franchise, but it still makes almost no impact, despite the proliferation of new symbiotes and the possible world-ending stakes. The design of the various new aliens is generic and unexciting, and the special effects are passable without being particularly dazzling or creative.', 'All that’s left, then, are Hardy’s goofy voices and the slightly homoerotic buddy-comedy vibe between Eddie and Venom. For audiences who’ve embraced these movies as ironic kitsch, that may be enough, but “The Last Dance” is a complete failure as a superhero movie. Of course, it’s also not truly the end — there’s both a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene — but there’s no reason to care whether Venom will return, in any capacity or in any universe.', 'Here at Tom’s Guide our expert editors are committed to bringing you the best news, reviews and guides to help you stay informed and ahead of the curve!', ""Josh Bell is a freelance writer and movie/TV critic based in Las Vegas.

Is the greatest comic book movie love story — a man standing in front of a symbiote asking to be loved — finally done?', 'Going by the events of the movie, it’s a yes to all three. But The Last Dance has two post-credits scenes that leave open the smallest possibility that this might not be the end of the alien’s superhero era.', 'In the film, Brock and Venom — the alien symbiote with whom the reporter shares a body — are hounded by a villain named Knull (CGI actor extraordinaire Andy Serkis). Knull is apparently some kind of awful, terrible evil — a being draped in shadows with startlingly white hair — that’s trapped in a world of eternal darkness. The only thing that can free him is a codex (which looks like a little glowing, swirling gem), which, because this is ostensibly a movie about Venom, is actually part of Venom’s body. Knull sends unkillable alien creatures called xenophages after Venom and Eddie, with the intent of killing one or both and bringing back the codex so Knull can unleash destruction and despair upon the universe.', 'Meanwhile, Venom and Brock are on the run after the events of Venom: Let There Be Carnage. They’re hiding out in Mexico, but after Venom eats some men, they decide to try to build a new life for themselves in New York City. Venom tells Eddie that he wants to see the Statue of Liberty, in large part because Eddie explains how she welcomes anyone who needs America’s shelter and protection. (Yes, Venom: The Last Dance actually functions as an allegory for immigration reform featuring a literal undocumented alien.)', 'Because of Knull and his xenophages, as well as interference from the American military, the pair never make it to New York. Instead, they’re stuck at Area 51, where things look bleak for Venom. In the symbiote’s last stand, he absorbs Knull’s murder beasts and douses himself in corrosive acid — the only thing strong enough to dissolve the xenophages. Venom’s final act is sacrificing himself for Brock and Earth, and as he and his attackers die, so does the codex.', 'In the movie’s final scene — after an extended Eddie and Venom montage — Eddie visits New York City and gazes at the Statue of Liberty. It’s a sight that he knows Venom would have loved. And this folks, is the end … or is it?', 'The first of The Last Dance’s credits scenes is a short one. Knull appears on screen again, proclaiming that Venom has died and that he is coming to take over the universe! Will he? Well, Knull’s return will largely depend on how much money this film makes. If it does rake in some cash — Venom movies do particularly well overseas — Knull could be back. But if Knull returns, wouldn’t this point to the return of Venom as well? You can’t have a villain without a hero! That’s not how superhero movies work!', 'Lately, the once-solid, surefire success of a superhero movie looks more vulnerable, and studios are scrambling. Marvel’s post-Endgame design has fallen apart, and the studio is banking on bringing back Robert Downey Jr. to help jump-start the engine. Warner Bros. is headed for a Jame Gunn-led reboot of its DC Comics properties. Sony’s tiny coterie of Marvel-adjacent films has been a semi-bright spot in the landscape, so if this film’s a hit, they’re liable to find a way to bring the franchise back.', 'But how?', 'The Last Dance’s second credits scene happens after all the credits scroll, and it features a look at the rubble that remains at Area 51 where Venom perished. It’s all destroyed! Everything is a mess! All this has allowed Brock’s bartender from Mexico, who we see detained by the US military early in the film, to break out of his cell, and he wanders across the desert.', 'The important part here is that we see a cockroach approach remnants of a symbiote. (I fully understand that sentence is silly, but Venom is silly.) The gist: If this cockroach — nature’s ultimate symbol of survival — touches the symbiote, then said symbiote could possibly live. Therefore, if any part of Venom was spared by the acid, it could possibly survive via cockroach too.', 'What this all means is that even though the movie said farewell and even though it probably is a goodbye to Hardy, there’s still a possibility that Venom or Venom-affiliated heroes (e.g., other symbiotes) could live on. That ambiguity is good for anyone who loves these movies, or anyone who possesses the odd, delusional fantasy of seeing some kind of Sony shared universe where Madame Web, Morbius, and Venom all hang out like pals, or anyone who wants to finally get the Venom x Tom Holland Spider-Man crossover that’s been relentlessly teased.', 'Like the aforementioned Knull credits scene, what will ultimately determine Venom’s future movies will be the box office.

Venom: The Last Dance Is Bad on Purpose,https://www.vulture.com/article/review-venom-the-last-dance-is-bad-on-purpose.html,"['', 'Venom: The Last Dance begins the way so many promising movies do: with the villain explaining what his deal is in an opening monologue that was clearly added in because either test audiences or studio executives found him too confusing. The thing is it’s no less confusing for being laid out in flat terms over a montage of Frank Frazetta–y imagery of a savage fantasy wilderness. The villain, Knull (Andy Serkis), is a godlike figure who apparently predates the universe; he created and then was betrayed and imprisoned by the race of alien symbiotes that Venom belongs to. In the movie, he manifests as a mass of dirty-blond hair hunched in the middle of a swamp. As Venom: The Last Dance progresses and it becomes clear that Knull is just going to remain in that swamp and dispatch portal-hopping spider-lizard-monster things to do his bidding, you might start to get that sinking feeling that accompanies so many late-period superhero movies, when you realize that half of the shit happening onscreen is in service to some future installment that may or may not ever arrive. Venom: The Last Dance is supposed to be the end of a trilogy — it’s right there in the title — and yet it floats some future big bad seemingly out of habit, like the need to never resolve things is a feature and not a bug of these movies, a promise that next time, things will actually get good.', 'Have any of the Venoms been good? The first one was essentially a Madame Web–quality enterprise held together by Tom Hardy’s decision to play his character’s transformation from investigative journalist to carnivorous vigilante as a one-man buddy comedy. The subsequent follow-ups have had the misfortune of being in on that joke and leaning into it with increasingly goofy bits like Venom cooking breakfast (which happens in Venom: Let There Be Carnage) and Venom dancing to ABBA (as he does in Venom: The Last Dance, which finds screenwriter Kelly Marcel stepping up to directing duties). Hardy has remained compelling throughout and spends most of this new movie hung-over in cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, getting yanked from location to location while looking like he’s about to hurl — a comic-book hero who never gets to look cool. But Hardy is one of the great leading weirdos of our era, and the fact that he has spent years now making these half-hearted affairs remotely watchable doesn’t actually feel like much of an accomplishment. Three features is a lot to hang on Hardy doing a digitally enhanced version of a hand-puppet act. There’s a certain point at which you have to wonder if, instead of applauding his ability to sneak a subversively odd performance into a franchise product, he and everyone else involved wouldn’t be better served just making a movie that’s daring to begin with.', 'Venom: The Last Dance is, as much as it’s anything, a road-trip movie that begins with Hardy’s Eddie Brock on the run in Mexico. He attempts to head to New York and instead ends up in the Nevada desert, where scientist Dr. Teddy Payne (Juno Temple) and General Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are running Imperium, an underground program for the study of symbiotes next to the soon-to-be-decommissioned site of Area 51. This is less a journey than a plot convergence. While Strickland and his special-ops forces have been tracking Eddie in their efforts to gather symbiotes, Eddie and Venom have also attracted the attention of one of Knull’s henchmonsters for reasons that even the characters within the movie have trouble explaining. Basically, the Eddie-Venom combination is key to Knull’s freedom, though the henchmonsters, which are called Xenophages, can home in on the duo only when they’re in full black, toothy form. This is regrettable because Venom only really looks good that way, though the effects are in general a little less janky in this installment than the previous two. Instead, we get a lot of Venom as a floating head coming out of Eddie’s back, as well as Horse Venom, Fish Venom, and Frog Venom, as the pair try to evade capture by Imperium and by the Xenophages, which can leap thousands of feet, can’t be killed by traditional means, and have a mouth that operates as a wood chipper for flesh.', 'The solution for the problem is that Eddie and/or Venom has to die, an issue that the entire movie tries to pretend isn’t obvious in order to include digressions about the death of Dr. Payne’s brother in a lightning accident or about a road-tripping hippie family led by an aliens-obsessed Rhys Ifans or a sequence early on in which the movie retcons the post-credits scene from Spider-Man: No Way Home while Venom howls about how he’s “so done with the multiverse shit.” The lack of coherent stakes matters less than the general feeling that the movie is bad on purpose, in addition to being bad accidentally, which is the only way to explain why there’s a shadowy character in a control booth whose identity is never revealed and whose presence is never explained. It makes weak gestures toward wanting to be about regret and mortality, then includes a montage cut to Maroon 5 as a fuck-you for thinking there was ever any intention of getting sincere. Venom: The Last Dance isn’t a lark but a smirk to let you know that while everyone may be aware of what it’s up to, you’re the sucker who bought the ticket.', '', 'For a limited time, get a free tote when you choose an annual plan.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Knull is encased in a prison, on a desolate planet, and needs a symbiote and host to be freed – that means he needs Eddie and Venom to escape. So for them to keep Knull in place, either Venom or Eddie has to go.', 'But as we know, comic book movies tend to have a story that spills over into the main credits.

10 Questions About Venom: The Last Dance,https://www.laineygossip.com/review-venom-the-last-dance-is-about-fan-service-tom-hardys-love-of-dogs/80110,"['What is Venom: The Last Dance?', 'Venom: The Last Dance is the third and probably final entry into the Sony’s only successful Spider-Man spin-off franchise, centered on Spider-Man’s rival, Venom. The film stars Tom Hardy in the dual role of Eddie Brock and Venom, who is an alien co-existing with Eddie in a symbiotic relationship. The film is set approximately one year since the events of 2018’s Venom. ', 'That’s a pretty compressed timeline given that six real years have passed. Do they make any attempt to have Tom Hardy look like he did in Venom?', 'None whatsoever. He is noticeably older, which would not matter in the least if they didn’t try that ridiculous “one year later” plot point.', 'What is Venom: The Last Dance about?', 'It is nominally a film about friendship, but it’s mostly about fan service and Tom Hardy’s love of dogs.', 'Wait, is there a Venom DOG in this movie?!', 'Sadly no, even though there is perfect opportunity for such a thing, and the movie does include a Venom horse, Venom fish, and Venom frog. The Venom dog is a HUGE missed opportunity.', 'At any point in this film does Venom leave an airplane crippled mid-flight, suggesting he caused hundreds of people to die in an air disaster that is never mentioned again?', 'What an interesting and specific question! Yes, that exact scenario DOES happen! It seems like it should be the setup for a story in which Venom does a lot of collateral damage while trying to be good, which is why people see him as a villain despite his best efforts to be a hero, but the events of this film happen in a moral vacuum. There is no judgment on anyone or anything except the people running a dogfighting ring and the science lady who suggests that assuming aliens are automatically out to kill us is maybe not the best approach to fostering intergalactic understanding. ', 'Some of the aliens are out to kill us, though, right?', 'Oh, yeah for sure.', 'Why is Rhys Ifans in this movie? Is he connecting Venom to the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies?', 'Nope!

Venom: The Last Dance Retcons Spider-Man: No Way Home Ending,https://www.superherohype.com/news/586304-venom-the-last-dance-retcon-spider-man-no-way-home-ending,"['', 'BY VANSH MEHRA', 'Venom: The Last Dance’s opening follows Eddie Brock’s story after Spider-Man: No Way Home. However, the film changes a few elements from what viewers saw in No Way Home’s post-credits scene. Here’s how Venom: The Last Dance retcons the Symbiote’s previous appearance.', 'In the post-credits scene for Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Venom and Eddie get taken to the MCU’s Earth-616 thanks to Doctor Strange’s botched spell in Spider-Man: No Way Home. But as Doctor Strange tried to make everyone forget about Peter Parker in No Way Home, Eddie and Venom got sent back to their original Earth-688, which is the home of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU).', 'Venom: The Last Dance begins right where Spider-Man: No Way Home ended. However, it changes how Eddie gets pulled back to Earth-688. In No Way Home, Eddie got sent back to the SSU with a glowing white effect. It was similar to how others, including Electro, Green Goblin, Doc Ock, the Lizard, Sandman, and the two Spider-Men, were sent back. Even Morbius stayed consistent with this glowing effect while pulling Adrian Toomes / the Vulture from the MCU to the SSU.', 'But in Venom: The Last Dance’s opening, Eddie and Venom get pulled into the SSU through a yellow portal. This portal is similar to the ones that Knull opens for his Xenophages later in the film. This raises the question of whether Knull was involved in pulling Eddie and Venom back. However, this doesn’t seem likely given the plot of the film. If Knull could do that, he’d simply pull Eddie and Venom onto Klyntar to obtain the Codex.', 'So it seems most likely that Eddie was sent back because of Doctor Strange’s spell. Sony only appears to have retconned how he gets transported.', 'Additionally, a sliver of Venom goo was originally left at the bar counter on MCU’s Earth-616. But now, Venom leaves a piece of him in the SSU’s bar instead, which later gets collected by Rex Strickland. Whether this was also meant to be a retcon, or whether Venom left pieces of himself in both the MCU and the SSU, remains to be seen.', 'Vansh is an SEO Contributing Writer for ComingSoon.

Venom: The Last Dance review – messy sequel ends series with a shrug,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/23/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-marvel,"['Tom Hardy’s agreeably silly Marvel franchise wraps things up in a patchy final adventure that needed a tighter, and funnier, script', 'T\nhe recent, long-awaited, cratering of the superhero movie (with a notable Deadpool-sized exception) has led to a mad scramble – release dates pushed, marketing strategies tweaked, Robert Downey Jr bribed – and a concerned question mark over what the future might hold for Hollywood’s most commercially lucrative contemporary genre. The Venom franchise, which launched in 2018 to surprise success, had already felt like a throwback to an earlier time – a glossy and light-hearted burst of mid-00s nostalgia – but now, with its third and final chapter releasing at such a fraught time, it also feels like a reminder of a more recent time when these films used to mean more to audiences.', 'Whether or not something like Venom: The Last Dance will jolt enough of a response remains to be seen (the second film saw a $350m drop at the global box office and the third is tracking for a franchise-low opening) but it’s at least a smartly planned conclusion to an inoffensively silly and low-stakes series, Tom Hardy and his quippy alien symbiote leaping off a sinking ship with a spring in their step. It’s not as catastrophic as Madame Web or as redundant as The Marvels or as annoying as Deadpool & Wolverine, it’s just about passable in a throwaway kinda way, blessed by a surprisingly brief runtime that doesn’t allow it to grate or exhaust. If only it amused and excited us a little bit more.', 'The novelty of Hardy sparring with a dance-loving, head-eating, chocolate-guzzling alien that lives within him wore off in the middling second outing, where the first film’s co-writer Kelly Marcel took sole credit. She returns here, also debuting as director, and brings the same struggles with her, failing to find the funny in the absurdist conceit, her dialogue quite staggeringly refusing to make us laugh even once. The franchise’s lack of portentousness has always been one of its major selling points yet it’s not translated into enough genuine humour, something that becomes far more glaring this time around. Hardy intensely commits, as ever, returning as the journalist Eddie Brock who we left last time as he was zapped into the multiverse, one where Tom Holland’s Spider-Man had just been outed.', 'But his time there is short, returning to his world after just one scene and a jab at how tiresome the multiverse is (it’s hard to tell if this was always the intention or a rethought result of a shrinking genre). A clunky and convoluted cold open tees us into the threat of an impending war as Eddie and Venom are on the run not just from the authorities but also another alien, tracking them to obtain a magic cortex that would help free a new Big Bad. Their journey intersects with an alien-seeking family (led by Rhys Ifans), the military (led by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and some scientists (led by Juno Temple) as well as a figure from his past (Stephen Graham). Arguably the strangest film about a film so thirsty to be defined as strange is the amount of British actors playing American …', 'It’s quick and brash and seemingly aware of how goofy so much of it is but it’s also awkwardly overstuffed. There are jokes without punchlines (a tertiary character’s obsession with Christmas goes nowhere), unnecessary backstories (Temple’s scientist gets a dead brother we never needed to know about) and a villain we never really get to see in full (he will allegedly be part of Sony’s upcoming, much-delayed Kraven the Hunter). While it’s a mercy to watch a superhero film of such brevity at a time when even evil clown horrors are running over two hours, it also has the stop-and-start choppiness of something that has caused endless headaches in the cutting room. Marcel is a director of ho-hum competence, and like many within this world, gets lost in a frantic, hard-to-follow finale of gloop and guns.', 'An abrupt, Maroon 5-soundtracked joke of an ending shows it all to be one big lark, a relief in a way that even the alleged conclusion of the series wouldn’t aim for out-of-reach emotion but also a reminder of its utter disposability. You might remember where this franchise started but you’ll be hard pressed to remember how it ends.', 'Venom: The Last Dance is out in Australia now and in US and UK cinemas on 25 October']"

Venom: The Last Dance stays firmly in its ridiculous lane,https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24277702/venom-the-last-dance-review,"['By Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.', 'Though neither of Sony’s previous standalone Venom movies were cinematic gems, their strange blend of Odd Couple humor and bloodless body horror were enough to put them squarely in so-bad-they’re-kinda-fun territory. It was hard to imagine a Venom feature — let alone a franchise — really working without a Spider-Man in the mix. But the box-office success of the films made it clear that something about Tom Hardy’s take on the lethal protector was working for audiences and all but ensured that Sony would go for a third installment.', 'Venom: The Last Dance from writer / director Kelly Marcel is neither better nor worse than its predecessors. It feels like a film that’s trying to stick to the beats it knows it can pull off well. Instead of diving into the multiverse to wow you with crossovers, the movie plays to the franchise’s strengths with a story that’s mostly about the ups and downs of being in a long-term relationship. And while The Last Dance doesn’t exactly deliver on the iffy but intriguing comic madness Sony has been teasing, it does bring this gooey, gory bit of ridiculous adaptation to a fitting end.', 'As chaotic as the first two Venom films were, they were also a fairly straightforward account of how disgraced journalist Eddie Brock’s (Hardy) life was repeatedly upended by the arrival of Venom (also Hardy), one of many parasitic aliens that crash-landed on Earth. Unlike other symbiote / host bonds that proved to be fatal, Eddie and Venom grew stronger because of their connection and found purpose in one another as they grew accustomed to sharing a body. The two had their fights and hit a big emotional rough patch, but they were always able to work things out when faced with a new deadly threat. The Last Dance picks up soon after Let There Be Carnage, which ended on a cliffhanger in another dimension. ', 'At first, it seems like the movie is using its multiversal connection to the MCU to pivot from its narrative past and start things over in a world filled with Marvel-branded superheroes. But The Last Dance instead decides to keep things focused on just how much has happened to Eddie and Venom in their universe during the surprisingly short amount of time they’ve been together.', 'Especially after Deadpool & Wolverine, the way The Last Dance basically gives the multiverse the middle finger is kind of refreshing and makes it feel like Sony and Marcel — who also wrote the first two Venom films — are trying to stay in a very specific lane, similar to Madame Web’s.', 'As much as fans might want to see Venom in New York beefing with Spider-Man, that’s just not what this franchise has been building to (yet). These are films about a haggard failson trying to hold his life together with the help of a wise-cracking goo monster who longs for the taste of human brains. And The Last Dance brings Eddie and Venom’s story to a close by confronting them with the consequences of their past adventures.', 'With the government finally realizing how many strange deaths and symbiote incidents he’s connected to, Eddie is on the run somewhere in Mexico as The Last Dance first opens. It seems like there’s nowhere Venom and Eddie can hide without special-ops soldier Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his team finding them. But the duo figure — sort of unreasonably — that they might have a chance of disappearing into the shadows if they can just make it to New York City.', 'Because it’s the culmination of a trilogy, there’s an understandable logic to the fugitive aspects of The Last Dance’s story (which Hardy contributed to). After blowing up a rocket in Venom and creating a new serial killer symbiote in Let There Be Carnage, it makes sense that Eddie and Venom would become high-profile targets forced to go off the grid. But it’s harder to follow the narrative thread being unspooled in The Last Dance’s larger plot about a symbiote invasion. ', 'Much in the same way Let There Be Carnage introduced its Cletus Kasady with a lore-dense info dump, The Last Dance tries its best to explain the whole deal with the symbiote god Knull (Andy Serkis) through a CGI-heavy chunk of exposition pulled from the comics. Knull created the symbiotes, who then betrayed him by trapping him in the center of their homeworld. And after eons of being imprisoned and thinking of ways to punish his parasitic children, Knull suddenly realizes that Eddie and Venom’s unique symbiosis has created the MacGuffin necessary to set him free.', 'There’s an irony to the way The Last Dance cracks a Thanos joke in its opening act and then awkwardly attempts to establish Knull as its own throne-bound big bad. The movie constantly reminds you how scared Venom is of Knull as a way of making its alien villain seem like a threat that has always been lurking out in space. But Knull’s plan — he can send other kinds of monsters through very Doctor Strange-like portals to find things for him — is so contrived that his presence in The Last Dance feels like the result of there not being all that many Venom-related characters Sony holds the cinematic rights to.', 'That “scraping of the bottom of the barrel” quality grows stronger as The Last Dance drops in even more symbiotes whose names are never mentioned but comic fans may recognize because of their color schemes. And while Knull’s alien goons are very cool / terrifying visually, the danger they’re meant to represent feels hollow because the film knows that it can’t exactly afford to kill off its emotional center. ', 'As was the case with the previous films, Hardy’s performances as Eddie and Venom are, depending on how you feel about goofy slapstick comedy, The Last Dance’s biggest strength. While his accent is still shaky as hell, Hardy brings a believable weariness to Eddie this time around that feels right for a man who’s been living with an alien infection for about a year. And Venom is even more subtly emotive in ways that emphasize how much more deeply connected he and Eddie have become during their time together.', 'Even though its plot is weak, its supporting characters are woefully underdeveloped, and its visual effects leave much to be desired, Venom: The Last Dance almost works when it’s just Eddie and Venom getting into shenanigans or reflecting on their life together. That isn’t nearly enough to make for a solid film, but again, solid films have never been the Venom franchise’s forte, and Sony isn’t switching up the formula this late in the game. If you were down to clown with Venom and got a kick out of Let There Be Carnage, The Last Dance will probably keep you mildly entertained. But for folks who could never understand why Sony has been churning these things out, the only real appeal here is that the studio seems to be finished — at least for now.', 'Venom: The Last Dance also stars Juno Temple, Rhys Ifans, Peggy Lu, Clark Backo, Cristo Fernández, and Stephen Graham.

US. 2024. 109mins ', 'Tom Hardy’s beleaguered journalist and his symbiote best friend go on the run in Venom: The Last Dance, which leans hard on the franchise’s two strengths: its goofy sense of humour and its big heart. Although often characterised as a superhero series with horror elements, the trilogy has mostly played out as an oddball buddy comedy – and this purported final chapter follows that formula to intermittently entertaining effect.', 'This trilogy is probably ending at the right time', 'The Last Dance pits our heroes against their most formidable foe yet — an ancient alien evil that wants to destroy everything in its path — but what works best is the dopey charm of Hardy opposite his CGI sidekick. Their grouchy rapport is almost enough to make up for a slapdash script and some predictable genre elements.', 'Sony unveils The Last Dance in the UK and US on October 25, looking to end the trilogy on a commercial high note. But the 2018 original’s $856 million gross seems out of reach, and initial tracking suggests that the new film may even have trouble matching the $507 million collected by 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Nonetheless, there is no comic-book competition in sight, which should help theatrical prospects. ', 'Eddie (Hardy) is in hiding after the events of Let There Be Carnage with the alien symbiote Venom (voiced by Hardy) still attached to him. But once they learn that authorities are looking to arrest Eddie for a murder he did not commit, the duo decides to get on the road to escape detection. Unbeknownst to the pair, though, a terrifying alien — a sibling of sorts to Venom and his fellow symbiotes — has arrived to find Eddie and Venom, who hold the key to unlocking an unfathomable power.', 'Writer Kelly Marcel, who wrote or co-wrote the previous Venom picture, makes her feature directorial debut here. Not surprisingly, then, The Last Dance feels like a thematic continuation, with the film building toward a finale that is far less open-ended than most blockbusters. There is also a noticeable melancholy that starts to weave through The Last Dance, despite the usual amounts of slapstick silliness and Eddie and Venom’s smart-aleck banter.', 'By now, audiences know what to expect from these two characters, with Eddie eternally frustrated by Venom’s impulsive, violent behaviour, and Hardy again attacks his dual role with comic abandon. But even if Eddie and Venom’s odd-couple shtick has grown familiar, Marcel injects enough surprisingly sweet moments that it’s clear that she and Hardy, who also worked on the story, are invested in this bizarre, unexpectedly touching bromance.', 'Unfortunately, the plot has not enjoyed the same amount of care. The Last Dance is simply the latest superhero flick in which a boringly indestructible enemy seeks to rule the universe, leading to a typically overblown third-act showdown. Likewise, this sequel’s new supporting characters are unoriginal types, including Chiwetel Ejiofor as Strickland, a gruff US general determined to eliminate Eddie and Venom. Juno Temple plays Teddy, a conscientious scientist who believes symbiotes should be studied, not killed. She is saddled with a tritely tragic backstory that is awkwardly shoehorned into the action-packed ending, but the hoped-for emotional wallop never develops.', 'What has made this franchise refreshing is its irreverence, and a refusal to be squeaky-clean family entertainment in the same vein as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. (With Disney owning many of the starriest Marvel properties, Sony has adapted lesser secondary characters it controls, such as Venom, Morbius and Madame Web.) Venom’s rude humour, edgier tone and cartoon-like mayhem were never particularly sophisticated, but Hardy’s madcap gusto gives that film and its sequels a combustible energy. In addition, Eddie’s growing fondness for this uncouth symbiote opened the door to an appealing sentimentality once these two outcasts formed a de facto family. ', 'The Last Dance demonstrates how that mixture of sassy and earnest can be fun, but both the tepid action scenes and mediocre plot twists suggest that this trilogy is probably ending at the right time. The Venom effects are still nicely rendered, but the punchlines are a little shopworn, although this franchise’s penchant for truly bonkers sequences has not diminished. (A dance sequence set in Las Vegas is so superfluous that it’s almost endearing.) Eddie and Venom remain feisty company but, as they hit the road for this final chapter, it is soon apparent that they don’t really have anywhere else to go.

Venom: The Last Dance Says No to Your MCU Hopes and Dreams,https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-the-last-dance-says-no-to-your-mcu-marvel-hopes-and-dreams,"['Warning: Full spoilers follow for Venom: The Last Dance.', '', ""The eternal irony of the Sony Marvel movies – a.k.a. Sony's Spider-Man Universe – is that in a Hollywood where interconnected superhero worlds are a dominant force, the Spidey spin-offs that make up Sony’s slate really have very little to do with one another. And while most of those films have bigger problems beyond how they do or don’t connect to one another, in the case of the Venom trilogy – the, I suppose, crown jewel of the SSMU? – the lack of connective tissue to Spider-Man’s world has always been glaring."", 'The new and apparently final film in the Venom trilogy, Venom: The Last Dance, doubles-down on the “no Spider-Man” stance. And while there are many possible reasons why there’s never been a Tom Hardy/Tom Holland Venom/Spidey crossover – ranging from creative decisions to legal or contractual ones to maybe even the politics of the relationship between Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios and Sony – the funny thing is, the previous Venom movie and the previous Spider-Man movie each seemed to finally be setting up a connection between the two universes. But that set-up is just hand-waved away in The Last Dance as if to say, “Oh, you fans thought we were gearing up for something big? Nahhhh.”', '2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage featured a post-credits scene where Hardy’s Eddie Brock/Venom was somehow seemingly transported to the MCU. Once there, the bonded pair see on TV that J. Jonah Jameson has revealed Peter Parker’s identity to the world (from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home), and Venom licks the screen right where Spidey’s face is, saying “that guy.” The symbiote was clearly very interested in Peter for some strange reason.', 'Seemed like Sony setting up a face-off to me!', 'Two months later, Spider-Man: No Way Home was released, and in that film’s post-credits scene we saw Eddie/Venom’s very brief trip to the MCU already come to an end. Following directly on the Let There Be Carnage scene, Eddie/Venom is sitting in a bar talking to a bartender (Ted Lasso’s Cristo Fernández) about all the “super people” who live in this universe. “Maybe I should go to New York and speak to this Spider-Man,” he says, before suddenly being magically transported away… but not before leaving the smallest bit of Venom symbiote on the bar.', 'And that seemed like Marvel Studios getting Hardy out of the MCU as fast as they could.', 'It was also the last time we saw Eddie/Venom before The Last Dance, and in fact, they’re still in the MCU at the start of the new film. The above bar scene is even replayed for us, but it’s a condensed version that’s missing some important bits. While the “purple alien who loves stones” is still mentioned in The Last Dance, the other “super people” talk is not, and most notably there’s no mention of… Spider-Man. The line about Eddie/Venom going to New York to find the wallcrawler is also gone. (Venom even makes a crack about being sick of the multiverse before they depart.)', 'The funny thing is, The Last Dance does feature a recurring thread about Hardy’s character(s) wanting to get to New York. Only now it’s not to find Spidey, but rather because the symbiote has always wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. One can almost see an earlier draft of the script being about the pair trying to get to Manhattan to find Spider-Man, as was previously set up in not one but two different post-credits scenes, but then the decision being made that, “Eh, we’re going in a different direction.” And who doesn’t want to see Lady Liberty in person, anyway?', 'Fernández’s bartender turns out to have a Venom universe counterpart (you can tell them apart because the Venom world’s guy has long hair!). And indeed, he figures in The Last Dance’s post-credits scene, though it’s unclear what that will really add up to, if anything. Earlier in the film, Eddie/Venom left a small part of the symbiote in the bar, just as they had in the MCU. So perhaps that will lead to some new take on Venom for Sony? But what about the bit of symbiote left behind in the MCU? At the rate that Marvel has ignored post-credits scene revelations in recent years, I wouldn’t be surprised if we just never hear about it again.', 'My colleague Tom Jorgensen (who reviewed Venom: The Last Dance for IGN) pointed out that it would’ve been cool for Eddie to finally make it to New York at the end of the film, only to see the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man swinging across the skyline. Fans have long speculated that the Hardy Venom movies are set in that world. So even if Tom Hardy never made another appearance as Venom, that could’ve been an interesting way to close out his story. His Venom never met Spider-Man, but Spider-Man does exist there after all.', 'But instead, it just feels like Sony has closed the door on the MCU after teasing what could’ve been.', '']"

There hasn’t been a huge hit since Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice opened in early September, and Hollywood’s hopes that Venom: The Last Dance would be a blockbuster aren’t amounting to much. According to Deadline, the superhero threequel is set to open in the low $50-million range after a $21 million Friday. That’s below more optimistic box office projections but pretty much right in line with the $50 million we predicted earlier this week.', 'As expected, Smile 2 should hit second place, with over $10 million, but the 52% drop, while not bad for a horror sequel, is far higher than the mere 18% the original fell on its second weekend in 2022. Its final gross will likely come in far under the $105 million the original made, but it should still turn a profit for Paramount. The Wild Robot and Terrifier 3 are making the race for third place pretty tight, with each grossing in the $5.5 – 6 million range. Focus Features’s Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes (who we interviewed yesterday), should open north of $5 million, which isn’t bad for an adult drama these days.', 'So, what’s going on with Venom’s box office? One thing studios may need to fess up to is that superhero fatigue is real. The massive success of Deadpool & Wolverine notwithstanding, studios have flooded the market with too many bad (or mediocre) superhero films, and audiences are no longer flocking to them the way they used to. Much is riding on the fate of Marvel’s next phase of films, as well as James Gunn’s Superman. The genre seems tired, as younger audiences seem to be sparking less to them nowadays. Perhaps it’s time for studios to think outside the box a little more and revisit genres they’ve all but abandoned, such as mid-level action movies, comedies and thrillers – all of which used to be the bread and butter of the theatrical experience.', 'What was the last great theatrical experience you had in theaters?

Venom: The Last Dance Scores 2024's Second-Biggest Superhero Box Office Opening,https://www.slashfilm.com/1698361/venom-3-the-last-dance-box-office-opening-weekend/,"['', 'In the school yearbook of superhero projects, 2018\'s ""Venom"" would definitely have been voted ""Least likely to succeed."" It was an origin story about a supervillain whose comic book origins are inextricably tied to Spider-Man ... but Spider-Man wasn\'t even in it, being tied up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead, ""Venom"" was to be part of Sony\'s own shared superhero universe (which at one point bore the unfortunate acronym ""SPUMC"").', 'Against all odds, ""Venom"" was a box office hit. Then the 2021 sequel ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" was also a sizable hit. And although this year\'s threequel is heading for the lowest opening weekend of the franchise so far, it\'ll still be the second-biggest opening for a superhero movie of 2024 to date. Per TheWrap, ""Venom: The Last Dance"" is on track for an estimated $52 million debut at the domestic box office after grossing $22 million on Friday (including previews). That\'s considerably short of the box office projections from last week, which pointed to an opening in the $70 million range. ', 'Still, it\'s not a disaster. The domestic numbers may have been impacted by this weekend\'s Yankees-Dodgers games keeping audiences glued to their TVs at home, and overseas ticket sales could give ""The Last Dance"" a lift. A massive 75% of the global box office total for ""Venom"" came from international markets, including $269.1 million from China alone. ""Venom: The Last Dance"" scored a $9.4 million opening day in China on Wednesday — the country\'s biggest opening for a comic book movie since ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" in 2019.', '""The Last Dance"" also has the benefit of a relatively thrifty (for a superhero film) budget of $120 million. Per Variety, $20 million of that budget went to star, producer, and co-writer Tom Hardy. That might sound like a lot, but considering Hardy\'s extensive creative involvement and the fact that he plays two characters (human host Eddie Brock and his symbiote partner Venom), he\'s working hard for the money. Plus, this franchise wouldn\'t have worked at all if Hardy hadn\'t thrown himself into it so enthusiastically.', '', '""Deadpool & Wolverine"" still holds the title of 2024\'s biggest opening weekend for a superhero movie (and for movies in general), with its massive $211.4 million opening weekend. Obviously there\'s quite a large gulf between that and the expected $52 million take for ""Venom: The Last Dance."" The fact that a disappointing debut has still landed ""The Last Dance"" a silver trophy speaks to just how far superhero movies have fallen from their recent peak — both in terms of the number of movies released, and how much money they\'re making.', 'Aside from those two, the only other comic book movies that have hit theaters this year are ""Madame Web"" (a box office bomb), ""The Crow"" (also a box office bomb), and ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" (a box office nuke). The last contender of the year will be another entry in the SSU (Sony\'s Spider-Man Universe, as SPUMC was rebranded after Sony got sick of people making fun of the name): ""Kraven the Hunter,"" which stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson and hits theaters on December 13.', 'The landscape of superhero movies in 2024 is very different to the one ""Venom"" was a part of in 2018, which included hits like ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" ""Deadpool 2,"" ""Aquaman,"" and ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" There are currently no plans for ""Venom 4,"" and looking at the way the box office is trending, it would be smart for Sony to let ""The Last Dance"" really be the last dance.', '', '', '', '', '']"

Venom: The Last Dance Review,https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy,"['Comic book movies have come a long way in the past 50 years, all the way from “you’ll believe a man can fly” to “you’ll believe a horse can Venom.” And if you saw that four-legged monstrosity in the trailer for Venom: The Last Dance and started hooting and hollering, you can rest easy knowing Tom Hardy’s third tango with a symbiote will likely deliver just what you’re hoping for. The Last Dance tests Hardy’s chemistry with himself in a road trip movie that wholly embraces the deeply weird tone established by this Spider-Man-without-Spider-Man spinoff franchise. Where The Last Dance really trips up is how it supports that tone, with a terribly formulaic plot that makes this superhero hangout movie a tougher hang than it could’ve been.', '', 'The major draw remains Tom Hardy’s dual, dueling performances as Eddie Brock and Venom, and the bickering chemistry the actor has built up with himself through the first two films... which is ironic, given the themes of symbiosis in play. With forces both terrestrial and extraterrestrial out to separate Eddie and his symbiote buddy, Hardy plays up the former’s addled, paranoid tics and tense physicality harder than ever, and you get the sense that he’s constantly on the brink of a breakdown. Eddie’s not completely willing to let himself become one with Venom, and his struggle with the uglier side of being a “lethal protector” represents The Last Dance’s only reliable source of drama.', 'While neither Venom nor Venom: Let There Be Carnage had particularly surprising plots, they grounded themselves in Eddie’s career as a journalist, each taking on the trappings of a different genre that fit the specific story Eddie was researching. The Life Organization’s creepy goals of human/symbiote union in Venom suited a sci-fi/body horror framework, while Let There Be Carnage highlighted serial killer Cletus Kasady with a crime procedural-inspired plot. But The Last Dance focuses on Eddie and Venom on the run after two movies of wreaking havoc on San Francisco, and Hardy’s human character feels a little less compelling without that investigative angle to fall back on. A Las Vegas detour may suggest a Hunter S. Thompson-esque foray into gonzo journalism – but that Venom horse is the closest The Last Dance comes to Raoul Duke’s hallucinatory trip to the heart of the American Dream. The sequel mostly sees Eddie at the mercy of his symbiote’s whims, more often just screaming and flailing as Venom does the heavy lifting in the action and chase sequences.', 'As for Venom, the symbiote is as food-motivated and attention-deficient as ever, and by far the most likable character onscreen. At the end of the day, Venom is a lovable, goopy doofus; the immature best friend Eddie needs to find space for as he’s growing up. He’s a dummy who likes slot machines, eating brains, and dancing with Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu) to ABBA. And who among us can blame him? I didn’t like The Last Dance all that much, and I certainly wasn’t wild about either movie that came before, but Venom? I’d get a beer with that guy. I’m a simple man, and when it comes to simple, cinematic pleasures, there are few as sweet to me as Tom Hardy giving bigger than life characters silly little voices.', 'What we said about Venom: Let There Be Carnage', 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage finally pairs Venom and Eddie with a worthy villain in a story that embraces its weirder side. Andy Serkis directs a fun and action-packed sequel that highlights Venom as his own character and features Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris as breakout villains with excellent chemistry. Taking itself less seriously and having more fun, its relatively short runtime is packed densely with plenty of action, character development, and campy humor. At the same time, it’s a love story about relationships evolving and learning to grow and trust each other. Venom as a series is working through its growing pains, but it looks like it’s uphill from here. – Francesca Rivera', 'Read the complete Venom: Let There Be Carnage Review.', 'Venom is far more reliable at facilitating The Last Dance’s comic relief than its symbiote-fuelled action. Though the visual effects have improved a lot since the first movie, The Last Dance has little sense of novelty after two outings that saw Venom deploy his tendrils in about as many ways as you could imagine. There’s a plot device in play which leaves Eddie and Venom especially vulnerable to the Xenophage when they’re fully transformed, which could’ve opened up some interesting opportunities to put Venom on the back foot, but Eddie and Venom become aware of this symbiote AirTag quickly and it becomes an increasingly predictable way to redirect the Xenophage’s attention at best. At worst, it’s an infuriating source of irresponsibility during times when Eddie and Venom know they’re supposed to be laying low.', 'There’s little variety to The Last Dance’s rhythm – run, fight, hide, repeat – and even at its most chaotic, the action never rises to equal the boldness and creativity of the central relationship between Eddie and Venom. It feels like a step back from Let There Be Carnage, which struck a much better balance between those two elements. Kelly Marcel – who wrote both previous Venom movies – makes her directorial debut here, and I was hopeful that an increased role for the writer who first illuminated the unique pairing at the franchise’s heart would mean a deepening of the dynamic between man and parasitic alien. But at the end of the day, this is a big-budget superhero movie, and Marcel doesn’t quite find a balance between the epic and the intimate.', 'There’s also a major villain vacuum to contend with. A cold open establishes Knull, creator of the symbiotes, as a brooding and existential threat – but only if he can get loose from his imprisonment. The Last Dance is in no rush to set him free. Venom holds the key to making his escape possible, but Knull is forced to delegate his capture to his symbiote-hunting Xenophages: giant, ugly bugs with woodchipper-like mouths which spray the viscera of their victims from blowholes at the back of their heads. It’s a design choice I feel like standing up and clapping for as I write it down, but which becomes old hat by the tenth time it happens.', 'Despite being a tricky physical match for Venom, the Xenophage is just not a substitute for a villain of substance (certainly not one movie after Venom faced down his most famous foe, Carnage.) Knull is rarely seen, seldom spoken about, and apart from sending the Xenophage out in the first place, has almost no impact on the story – think Thanos in The Avengers, not Infinity War. It’s sequel-baiting of the highest order, and if you’re gonna subtitle your movie The Last Dance, that’s going to feel more egregious than usual. Chiwetel Ejiofor’s General Strickland gets left holding the bag and, as written, he’s only an antagonist in the sense that he’s in Venom’s way. His motivation for wanting to boot the symbiotes from Earth by any means necessary is totally reasonable, and there’s zero depth or specificity there for Ejiofor to play as he marshalls the government response to the alien battle coming Earth’s way. There’s also a shadowy organization pulling the strings whose name probably appears in very tiny lettering on a computer screen in some scene of an administrator giving threatening orders – more promises for a sequel that has no guarantee of happening. As I said, we’re establishing lots of new factions and players for a movie that’s supposedly calling a wrap on this whole Venom thing.', 'Helping the government’s efforts is Dr. Payne (Juno Temple), a scientist researching symbiotes, but her role in the story doesn’t extend far beyond acting as the military’s in-house Venom when it comes to keeping the plot moving by doling out new information. She functions sort of like Amy Adams’ character in Arrival, but with way less depth, which is shocking considering the amount of time The Last Dance spends establishing Payne and her tragic past. But then, storytelling precision has never really been the strong suit of these movies. That feels especially true once Eddie crosses paths with a UFO-hunting family on their way to Area 51, led by a very burnt-out looking Rhys Ifans. The family picks a hitchhiking Eddie up just when he needs some sound spiritual guidance, but their odd and child-endangering dynamic is more off-putting than endearing. By the time they’re filling the “Russian family from Justice League” role of getting in trouble during the climax just to give someone else a hero moment, the amount of time The Last Dance cedes to them feels like it could’ve been better used diving deeper into Eddie and Venom’s bond.', 'If this is truly the last dance, then things end for Venom much as they began: with a mostly boring superhero story occasionally elevated by a jittery Jekyll-and-Hyde performance from Tom Hardy. Venom: The Last Dance is torn between its responsibilities to big-budget comic book moviemaking and a more-focused genre story of a boy and his alien.  The threat Knull poses from afar often steals the movie’s focus to disappointing results, but there’s still some fun to be had on this freaky ride into the sunset – largely courtesy of the toothy, titular symbiote. Lackluster action and new additions that distract from the unique relationship at the franchise’s heart suggest it’s past time to send this Venom horse to the glue factory. Hopefully we get something back that sticks a little more.', '']"

While Ruben Fleischer did a decent job with the origin story, the sequel – Andy Serkis' Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) – was also reflective of its title – a complete carnage beyond redemption. However, the threequel manages to get back to its roots and turn in a moderately fun, but befitting finale."", ""(Also Read: Will Tom Hardy's Venom fight Tom Holland's Spider-Man? Actor opens up at Comic-Con)"", ""Venom: The Last Dance is helmed by Kelly Marcel, who has been associated with the franchise since its inception as the head screenwriter. The threequel of the testosterone-fuelled Venom franchise marks her directorial debut, yet it benefits significantly from her female gaze – she's also written Fifty Shades of Grey and Cruella. Kelly peppers the film – particularly the banter between Eddie and the Venom symbiote – with moments that are sweet, funny, unconventional, and even moving."", '', ""For instance, Venom looking at the Grand Canyon and suggesting Eddie to take retirement and refuge there. Or Venom screaming “horsie horsie horse” with joy after spotting the animal in the middle of nowhere. Or Venom putting on his dance shoes and shaking a leg with Mrs Chen to ABBA's Dancing Queen. Or Venom hoping to touch down in New York so that he can catch a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty – the lady who welcomes all visitors to America. Hell, we even see Venom tear up by the end of the movie."", ""Also, since Kelly has been writing the Venom movies for six years now, she's well-versed with the conflicts and layers that come with them. So when Eddie kills a woman army officer in self-defence – without any symbiote to put the blame on – he realises how he's turning into Venom even when the symbiote doesn't hold him captive. Eddie goes on to save several other lives by the end for redemption, but that doesn't make the hero in him look down upon Venom. “We are Venom” isn't just a superhero punchline to throw around – it's a way of life. Venom is as much a part of him as much as darkness is a part of all of us."", '', ""Despite this fresh gaze and layered approach, I'd urge Kelly to not get tempted enough to write another Venom movie. The franchise has exhausted its possibilities and can take a backseat now. Andy Serkis, who directed the terrible second part, is the voice of Knull – the new supervillain who's even “older than the universe” – in this part. He teases a return, but one hopes it's for another property in the franchise because Venom has run its course."", 'The symbiote takes new shapes and forms in the threequel – taking over a horse, a fish, and even a frog. We also see many more symbiotes – including a Christmas coded one – and several new characters, but none of them is compelling enough to merit either carrying forward the franchise or warranting its own spin-off. The only characters who come close to falling on that radar are a nomad family of four, travelling across the country in a rickety van to spot aliens at Area 51. And boy, do they spot some.', '', ""In the age of multiverse storytelling, it feels rebelliously satisfying if a franchise or a character completes his arc. One can hope that Tom Hardy as Venom can hang up his symbiote now, and he doesn't end up resurrecting himself for the sake of a Deadpool & Wolverine-kind cash cow. While Tom is not bad, his Venom isn't even as iconic as Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man in the first place.

Venom: The Last Dance raises questions only a true comics fan could answer,https://www.polygon.com/movies/470588/venom-3-last-dance-every-symbiote-knull-cameras-guy-explained,"['And a few questions that no one could answer', 'BY TASHA ROBINSON AND SUSANA POLO', 'Venom: The Last Dance may be one of those “You just had to be there” experiences. It feels cluttered, confused, and yet remarkably inconsequential. We’re told that the entire universe is at stake in this story, and yet nothing in the movie feels particularly threatening or even meaningful. So many different threads, ideas, and characters are introduced and then dispensed with, ignored, or contradicted, to the point where nothing lands — not even the supposed ending of this movie series.', 'As Polygon’s entertainment editor, I’ve learned that when a comic book movie baffles me this much, I’m probably missing something that was mangled from the source material. It’s always possible the story made more sense in its original form. So I turn to our resident comics super-expert Susana to help me unpack what I just saw. I asked her my big questions from Venom: The Last Dance to see if there’s any way bringing in some extra background lore could help save this messy, overstuffed, suspiciously goofy movie.', '[Ed. note: Widespread spoilers ahead for Venom: The Last Dance.]', 'Tasha: Susana, let’s start with the McGuffin at the center of this movie: The codex, a nigh-magical hoobajoo that only the Eddie Brock/Venom symbiote (both voiced by Tom Hardy) share, and that the movie’s villain, Knull (Andy Serkis) wants, for Reasons.', 'Did you follow any of that, Susana? We’re told Venom has a codex because Eddie died at some point in these movies, and the symbiote revived him. But the film pretty pointedly doesn’t explain what a codex is or why it would be so rare, much less why it would work as a key to break Knull out of cosmic prison.', 'Susana: That’s easy enough — the “codex” is an idea adapted from Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman’s 2018 run on Venom. In the comics, a “codex” is a little trace of symbiote stuff that symbiotes naturally leave behind in the bodies of their hosts, particularly the nervous system. In a pinch, it can be used to tap into the symbiote hivemind. (In the comics, all symbiotes are connected in a species-wide hivemind, natch.)', 'In comics, it isn’t one codex that’s the key to freeing Knull, but lots and lots of codexes. That’s the main difference here: In the comics, codexes are the furthest thing from rare. They literally happen any time a symbiote bonds with a host for more than a fleeting moment. And thanks to the Venomverse and Venomized events, which were based around symbiotes bonding with all your favorite characters so you can see how cool they look in a Venom-ized suit, basically everybody of note in the Marvel Comics universe has a codex.', 'Knull was freed in the Absolute Carnage event, in which a Knull-communing Carnage went on a spree of ripping out people’s spines and eating them, in order to connect their codexes up to Knull, which would allow the god to regain control of the symbiote hivemind.', 'Does that help?', 'Tasha: In a way! It at least tells me more than the movie does about what a codex is supposed to be or how one is formed. And I can see why people making a movie would want to switch the dynamic from “This thing is available all over the universe” to “Our protagonist is a unique and special snowflake, and his McGuffin means the action will follow him from scene to scene, wherever he goes.”', 'So why would a codex/a lot of codexes free Knull from alien space jail? And given that we get no information about him in this movie except “He’s the god of symbiotes, and also, they hate him,” is there a backstory to him that would make him make more sense? Like, why does he want to destroy the universe, and why would this rando death-metal-guitarist guy have the power to destroy the universe?', 'Susana: In Cates and Stegman’s comics, Knull is a primordial god of the void, who ruled over the formless black nothing that stretched between the destruction of the 6th Cosmos and the creation of the 7th (our current one). He sees anything that isn’t the darkness of empty space as an encroachment on his domain.', 'Tasha: That is the most metal thing you’ve ever said.', 'Susana: Oh, I’m just getting started. Being the Most Metal is what cosmic superhero comics are all about!', 'When the Celestials started making the 7th Cosmos, Knull took that as an insult. Bathed for the first time in the light of creation, the god of the void reached into his own shadow and created the first symbiote, in the form of the Celestial-killing blade All-Black, the Necrosword. (All-Black was invented by Jason Aaron and Esad Ribić for their series Thor: God of Thunder. Cates and Stegman retroactively gave it an origin with Knull.)', 'The Celestials cast Knull back into the void, but he spent his time manifesting symbiote life from pure darkness, creating a shape-shifting, parasitic horde species fully controlled by a hivemind linked with his own divine consciousness. Then he launched that horde into the universe to devour all that it found.', 'Eventually, Knull’s control momentarily lapsed after a big fight with a young Thor (immortalized by human storytellers as the epic of Beowulf), and his symbiote army bonded with mortal hosts, discovering the concepts of “honor” and “nobility,” as Knull put it. The freed symbiotes rose up and imprisoned Knull in a massive ball of their own bodies, which, until 2018’s Venom #4, had always been understood to simply be the symbiote home planet.', 'Tasha: OK, gross. And this is why the symbiotes in Venom: The Last Dance are willing to bond with any and every human, including the ones who imprisoned them in tubes in an underground bunker, if it helps them fight off his creatures?', 'Susana: By comics canon, yeah. The symbiotes hate him because he was a god-tyrant, and they don’t like being his slaves. He wants to kill the universe because it is anathema to him. And he can do it because he’s a primordial cosmic entity.', 'Tasha: And why does he have an army of unkillable CG mega-bugs?', 'Susana: Oh, those are from a completely unrelated Venom comic. I got nothin’.', 'Tasha: Speaking of unrelated Venom stuff, I assumed all those symbiotes who show up for the big battle at the end and have distinctive colors and powers are from the comics? That whole sequence smelled like fan-candy to me, apart from the fact that most of those characters immediately get mulched. Was there anyone in there that Venom fans would care about?', 'Susana: It’s basically fan candy, but for just… an unspeakably small group of fans. The list of times Marvel Comics creators have tried to make a new symbiote/host hero or villain stick is longer than my arm, and most of them don’t rate more than a footnote. I’m checking wikis for all of these guys, but the ones on display seem to be based on Toxin (Officer Mulligan’s green form), and five more symbiotes roughly inspired by Venom: Lethal Protector. That 1993 miniseries, written by David Michelinie and drawn by several artists, introduced a litter of high-key toyetic offspring of the Venom symbiote.', 'Those five symbiotes were Riot (gray, turns his hands into hammers, etc.), Phage (brown, turns his limbs into spikes), Lasher (green, has extra back tentacles, attaches to the lady with a Christmas tree pin), Agony (purple, uses hair tentacles, attaches to Juno Temple’s Dr. Teddy Payne), and Scream (orange/yellow, also weaponized hair), and they seem to be the templates for Last Dance’s extra symbiotes. It’s complicated, though, because the movie doesn’t name any of them, and Riot was technically already used as the villain of 2018’s Venom (played by Riz Ahmed).', 'There’s also a two-headed symbiote at one point, but that one seems to be an original design, as best as I can research.', 'Tasha: How big a deal is Agony in the comics? Big enough to support her own movie? While The Last Dance’s post-credits scene leaves Sony a possible opening for a further Venom sequel, the film (title and all) seems to be aimed at shutting down the Tom Hardy Venom series, though Hardy has signaled he’d return if Venom got to fight Tom Holland’s Spider-Man in another Sony Spiderverse/MCU crossover.', 'So much of the way this movie treats Dr. Payne — as if her motivations and backstory are important, even though she doesn’t actually do much in the film, and as if her getting her own symbiote is a climactic, cathartic triumph for the story — only really makes sense if this movie is also being positioned as an Agony origin story that could be used to launch a new symbiote franchise. Which feels a lot like Sony trying to use Madame Web as a cinematic origin story for a bunch of new Spider-Women, but I digress. Clearly Agony doesn’t have Venom’s cultural cachet, but is there anything notable or interesting about her that could support a movie?', 'Susana: So, Teddy Payne appears to be a genderbent version of Dr. Thaddeus Paine, who featured as the villain of 1996’s Venom: The Hunger, by writer Len Kaminski and artist Ted Halsted. But his backstory has nothing in common with Dr. Payne’s other than a homophonic name and the fact that they’re both scientists, and he’s never merged with a symbiote in comics history. Payne is, in everything but name, an original character.', 'As for Agony, I’m going to be honest with you as a comics expert: If I’ve ever read a story with Agony in it, I don’t remember. Commenters are free to call that a gap in my knowledge, but I’m going to call it an indication of Agony’s lack of an established footprint in Marvel Comics canon.', 'Tasha: I mean, I’ve never read a Venom-centric comic, and I knew who Venom was well before the first movie, but I had to ask you who Agony was. I’m coming to all of this in ignorance, so I’m sure not going to claim you should know more about a character I’ve never heard of.', 'Speaking of characters I’ve never heard of, though, any idea who the mysterious guy in the control room is? The secretive silhouetted guy who’s so important that he can single-handedly shift control of the apparently massive government-run Imperium project from Dr. Payne to General Strickland on a moment’s notice? The guy who has somehow put up identical networked facial-recognition surveillance cameras all around the world, from downtown Vegas to random alleys in Mexico? Clearly this dude, whose presence and power and intentions and motives are never explained, is some really important and exciting comics reference, right?', 'Susana: I have no fucking idea who that man is. Maybe we’ll find out in Kraven the Hunter. Maybe it was just a dropped plotline.', 'Tasha: I admit that after seeing the first Kraven trailer in a theater last week, I have a really hard time believing the tone that movie seems to be going for could jibe at all with the hot-nonsense tone Venom: The Last Dance is keyed to. Speaking of which… A lot baffled me about this movie, including how the Venom symbiote is constantly abusing and overruling Eddie — literally ripping food out of his mouth or shoving food into it, grabbing and controlling his body, not to mention wrecking his career, his relationships, and his life. And yet Eddie calls the thing his best friend.', 'But the thing that alarmed me the most was when Eddie wants to leave Vegas ahead of the various threats coming after them, and the symbiote wants to hang out and dance with Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu), who… really seems to have a thing for Venom. I mean, the whole “Dancing Queen” scene is clearly a goof, but it also involves kinda hentai levels of tentacle-caressing. (Completely apart from being a sequence that makes no sense, since the symbiote is clearly scared of the Xenophage coming after him and Eddie, and yet after an hour of avoiding merging into Venom because it’s dangerous, he drops that concern entirely in order to force Eddie into a dance sequence.) Is Venom… flirting? Do I have to consider Venom a sexual being now?', 'Susana: Do you have to consider Venom a sexual being now? I don’t know if that’s my question to answer, Tasha. What a man and his goo-monster do in the privacy of their own home is none of my business.', 'I didn’t read that sequence as having a flirtatious vibe, but that might have been because I was furiously scribbling notes on how wild it was to cut to that scene from one of Dr. Payne sadly contemplating the childhood loss of her twin brother.', 'Tasha: I mean, what they do in the privacy of their own home is one thing, what they do in a Vegas penthouse is… well, even as I’m typing this, I’m realizing that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I’m just saying, there are already so many consent problems around Eddie and his bestie and their merged Venom form, and this movie really seems like it’s aimed at feeding the fandom debates (and the fanfiction) about whether Eddie’s tolerance of the symbiote comes from some kind of submissive kink.', 'But the less said about that, the better. I have so many more questions for you here. Why does Area 51 demolish its buildings with vast tanks of acid? Why does acid that dissolves concrete and rebar into dust within seconds not have any effect on the ground or anything below it? Why is a giant never-ending dust waterfall considered a subtle cover-up for a secret base? Why do the acid-tank biometric controls apparently have settings for “some acid” and “more acid” which have to be activated separately?', 'And why does Eddie lie to that poor kid Leaf about aliens not being real? I get that he’s trying to be comforting in the moment, but this is a universe where not believing in aliens can get you killed extremely messily, and the lie doesn’t come across as helpful, just crass. And cowardly. And ironic. And obviously a setup for Eddie having to take it back 20 minutes later.', 'Susana: Some questions are beyond even the power of your friendly neighborhood comics expert.', ""Do you like watching games, but don't play them?

Venom: The Last Dance,https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/venom-3-the-last-dance-film-review,"['Reviews', 'When it leans hard into the inherent absurdity of its wacky, mismatched buddy antics, “Venom: The Last Dance” can be a total blast. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen nearly as often as it should. ', 'Now starring in his third feature film as both journalist Eddie Brock and his symbiote alter ego, Tom Hardy clearly remains down for the broad playfulness the roles require. The fact that this is an actor who’s notoriously committed to his craft and has devoted all that intensity to bringing a wisecracking, shape-shifting space creature to life, is part of the allure of the bit. Hardy’s usually got some quirky voice up his sleeve, and playing Venom has given him the opportunity to take that instinct and run wild.  ', 'But far too frequently, “Venom: The Last Dance” makes the mistake of deviating from what worked in the previous two films, particularly the second movie in the franchise and the best of them all, 2021’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage.” It grinds to a halt and stops being a “Venom” movie in favor of dull developments at an underground lab, far beneath the surface of Area 51. Even more egregiously, it squanders the significant talents of Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor down there in one-note roles.  ', 'Directing for the first time, returning screenwriter Kelly Marcel spends way too much time away from the kinds of scenes that really sing. All we need is Eddie and Venom, bickering and bantering and fighting their way out of sticky situations (sometimes literally) as they further solidify their unlikely bromance. The visual effects can be a murky here, especially in the massive action sequences where it looks like inscrutable blobs of multicolored goo flinging themselves at each other, but that Eddie/Venom relationship is always clear as they share one body in myriad inventive ways. ', 'What ends up happening, though, is that just as some crazy set piece is really getting going, “Venom: The Last Dance” cuts away abruptly to what’s happening back at the lab. A fight atop an airplane at 30,000 feet, a rollicking horseback ride across the desert, a goofy dance number in a Las Vegas penthouse – these are the moments we should have time to luxuriate in, and they always feel too short. The pacing is frustratingly erratic throughout, and the tonal swings are awkward. ', '“The Last Dance” begins on a rather dour note with some deadly serious exposition from none other than Knull (voiced by Andy Serkis), the Marvel villain who created the symbiotes in the first place. Rendered with the grainy, grimy look of a retro video game, Knull explains in dreary, menacing fashion that he needs his toothy, crustacean-like minions to seek out the key that will unlock him from the void. That key exists when Eddie and Venom are paired together – like a red beacon that allows Knull’s beastly creatures to hunt the duo down. They are literally the McGuffin in their own movie. ', 'They’re on the run from everyone is every realm imaginable, and a bit in which Eddie keeps losing one or both of his shoes isn’t all that funny the first time. There are small joys along their journey, though. Cristo Fernández – the always sunny Dani Rojas from “Ted Lasso” – reprises his role as the Mexican bartender at the end of “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Peggy Lu, the steadfast Mrs. Chen, shows up in a surprising setting and breathes giddy life into the picture – but her appearance is a prime example of “The Last Dance” cutting away too quickly from a good thing. And an impromptu road trip with a hippie family led by Rhys Ifans and Alanna Ubach leads to an amusing musical interlude. ', 'But all roads lead to Area 51, where Temple’s scientist and Ejiofor’s military leader have conflicting ideas on how to handle the symbiotes in general and Venom in particular: She wants to study them, he wants to destroy them. And that’s about all there is to those characters. Even actors of their caliber can’t do much with what’s missing on the page, and so when significant developments occur that are meant to evoke real emotions from us, they instead ring hollow.

‘Venom: The Last Dance’ Review: The Greatest Love Story in Superhero Movie History Ends on an Entertainingly Generic Note,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/venom-the-last-dance-review-1235059391/,"['', 'By far the best thing about the “Venom” movies is that Venom is in them. Venom should be in all movies, but — to my great chagrin — he is almost exclusively in these ones, and so we have no choice but to be grateful that Sony has blessed us with a third installment of its most successful comic book franchise, even if this trilogy-capping adventure tends to forget that having Venom in it means that it doesn’t have to bother with all of the other bullshit endemic to its dying genre. ', 'Here’s the thing: When you have Tom Hardy bickering with a man-eating, canapé-licking, Osho-quoting alien symbiote who shares his body like a Platonic soulmate, you really don’t need to waste time on interminable battles with CGI space insects or strand overqualified actors like Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor in empty jargon roles that even they can’t manage to save.', '', '2021’s “Let There Be Carnage” had the right idea when it eschewed an extinction-level villain in favor of Woody Harrelson playing a serial killer named Cletus, but Kelly Marcel’s “Venom: The Last Dance” — which finds the series’ longtime screenwriter matching the same run-and-gun raggedness that directors Andy Serkis and Ruben Fleischer brought to these movies before her — cheats back towards the generic superhero crap that Eddie Brock and his extraterrestrial bestie had largely managed to avoid, even as it does what it can to deepen the marriage between them. ', 'That isn’t much. We just about reached the limits of their union in the last film, and all that’s really left for Marcel to do here is let the “Lethal Protector” go out in a ridiculous blaze of glory. But “The Last Dance” is still a fun time when it focuses on its core friendship (or uncivil union, or whatever you want to call it), its comic sensibilities are still much sharper and stranger than anything Deadpool could ever come up with, and it’s still less of a letdown than the other recent threequel that shares its subtitle. “Magic Mike” wins out when it comes to the actual dancing, but there’s no question that “Venom” has the edge when it comes to watching a perma-hungover Tom Hardy wear his own shoulders like an inflatable neck pillow. ', 'Defying the scourge of comic book movie bloat even as it forms into a grand finale (a franchise tradition that Marcel manages to maintain in spite of a limp third act that feels like it could belong to any C-grade MCU film), “The Last Dance” would much rather be a tattered 90-minute goof than an imperious two-and-a-half-hour wank. Needless to say, it doesn’t waste any time putting its cards on the table, which it accomplishes with a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it prologue that’s shot with the same dingy lighting this series has always used to emphasize its own junky self-image. ', '', 'Somewhere in deepest space, a gray-haired ghoul called Knull — who apparently created the symbiotes as a weapon to conquer the universe, only for them to imprison him on a colorless soundstage — has decided that he’s ready to break free, kill everything, and make good on the mega-powerful “Marvel Snap” card that bears his image (a vital component of any destroy-based deck). Escaping his shackles will require the use of the “Codex,” which is inconveniently lodged into the top of Venom’s spine for reasons that aren’t worth explaining here. ', 'In lieu of being able to travel (or even sit up in his space chair), Knull dispatches an alien race of Zerg-ass bug monsters to kill our beloved hero, which means that Eddie and Brock will spend the better part of this story running away from giant insects in lieu of dealing with a less generic threat. This franchise has always benefited from its lack of an overarching supervillain, but “The Last Dance” would rather cram the entire first phase of the MCU’s Thanos arc into a single film than find a more organic way of separating Eddie from Venom.', 'And, as promised by the movie’s poster, death will do them part. The Xenophage are basically unkillable, and either Venom or Eddie will have to die in order to break the Codex and save the universe from being Knull-ified — a detail that makes it very difficult to root for both of them to survive, and even harder to understand why the rest of the symbiotes would rather help Venom than save their entire species by killing one of their own. I guess they’re friends? Maybe they all formed a deep emotional connection on the meteor they rode to Earth in the first movie. ', '', 'Whatever the case, the movie’s human antagonist takes a more practical approach to the problem; alien-hunting American soldier Rex Strickland wants to kill Eddie and/or Venom with extreme prejudice, and honestly he might seem like a pretty sensible guy if not for how well Ejiofor plays a jerk. The character’s prickish disposition is contrasted against Temple’s wonderfully named but woefully underwritten Dr. Payne, a symbiote-loving scientist who spends the entire film deep within the bowels of her secret lab beneath Area 51. Her character brings a real “Ted Lasso” vibe to this story about a shape-shifting goo monster who likes to eat people’s heads, and that honestly might have worked to its benefit had Dr. Payne been given anything — and I mean anything — to do besides ogle her alien captives. ', 'It’s only a matter of time before Eddie and Venom find themselves in Dr. Payne’s lab, as the duo — falsely accused of killing someone who’s very much alive — begin the film as fugitives in desperate need of a safe haven. Venom targets New York for lore reasons, but “The Last Dance” hardly makes it further east than Nevada, by which point it’s already run out of gas. ', 'The journey really is the destination with this aborted road trip of a movie, the first half of which frequently delivers on the potential of stranding Eddie and Venom in the middle of nowhere. Michelle Williams is sorely missed as Eddie’s love interest (unfazed by the fact that her ex-boyfriend had become possessed by a gooey alien symbiote, her character was a priceless backstop for all of the comedy in the previous two movies), but Eddie’s folie à deux with the monster inside of him has become too all-consuming to accommodate a third wheel. ', '', 'The relationship between them has always been as mutable as Venom itself, and Marcel has mastered the duo’s rare ability to reflect several dynamics at once: an ego and its id, a pair of fraternal twins, an old married couple, etc. Hardy isn’t asked to do too many new tricks, but “what if an exasperated journalist who sounds like Al Capone were molecularly bonded with a hedonistic Cookie Monster from Hell?” isn’t the kind of thing that requires a ton of iteration to stay fresh. ', 'While Venom’s antics may not be as inspired as they were in the previous film, nor his puppy-like tenderness — once a sweet surprise — quite so unexpected, his lust for life still makes everything he does at least a little funny, whether he’s playing a slot machine for the first time in Vegas or singing a wistful cover of a certain David Bowie classic when Eddie hitches a ride with an alien-obsessed hippie played by Rhys Ifans (another Marvel alum whose presence here, like Ejiofor’s, serves to complicate this film’s broadly irrelevant but annoyingly inconsistent relationship to the MCU). ', 'Hardy has never really gotten the credit he deserves for giving one of the most difficult and dynamic performances that comic book movies have ever seen, and while “The Last Dance” gets away from that for long stretches at a time (even the wacky sequence where Venom inhabits a variety of different animals pulls focus from what this franchise does best), at least the film ends with a fittingly poignant/ridiculous tribute to the greatest love story ever told about a man and his symbiotic alien goo.', '', '“This is serious,” various people — Venom included! — repeatedly insist throughout “The Last Dance,” but it’s really not. Not even Knull, the self-described “Slicer of Worlds,” is scary enough to make the fate of the universe feel like it matters. But what this movie lacks in seriousness it makes up for in sincerity. Despite the film’s best efforts to melt its characters into the vast sludge of superhero cinema, the union between Eddie and Venom is simply too pure to be diluted down to nothing. Thanks to Hardy, even the least of the movies in this franchise is definitely something, and it’s something that its genre may not be able to survive without.', 'Sony Pictures Releasing will release “Venom: The Last Dance” in theaters on Friday, October 25.', 'Want to stay up to date on IndieWire’s film reviews and critical thoughts?

That sadly didn’t come to pass, though moviegoers do get to bid adieu to an important character and say hello to a new cosmic supervillain.', '“Venom: The Last Dance” seemingly closed the superhero trilogy starring Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and the title alien symbiote connected to him, a fan-favorite Spider-baddie from the Marvel comic books turned cinematic “lethal protector.” The new movie found Eddie and Venom on a buddy road trip to New York, looking to evade authorities – since Eddie is wanted for murder – as well as snarling outer-space beasts sent by Venom’s creator, the evil Knull (played via motion capture by Andy Serkis). The long-haired blond and brutish god of symbiotes, Knull is locked away on an alien planet, and the bonding of Eddie and Venom is the literal key keeping him from escaping and unleashing a wave of annihilation.', 'Let’s dig into the bittersweet ending, a pair of post-credit scenes, and the odds that this is indeed Eddie and Venom’s last dance.', ""Join our Watch Party!

Knull’s violent creatures battle Venom and the symbiotes (who find human hosts in the rando scientists around), and Venom ultimately sacrifices himself to save the day. He disengages from Eddie and forms a web around the vicious beasts, which allows military man Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to shower Venom with a liquid that dissolves the creatures but also our alien hero. (But not before he shares a final moment with Eddie.)', 'Eddie gets pardoned by the government and finally makes it to New York, where he takes in the Statue of Liberty – a landmark Venom really wanted to visit. “I won’t forget you, buddy,” he says.', 'It actually has two – one significant, the other cryptic. After the first wave of credits roll, we see an extra scene featuring Knull in close-up for a villainous rant. “The King in Black is awake,” he says, a reference to the Marvel Comics story line that featured Knull setting his sights on Earth. “I will kill your world. Everyone will burn and you will watch.” It’s not targeting anyone specifically but given that he’s a Thanos-level threat in the comics, it’s probably not great for the universe at large.', 'The other extra scene is at the very end following the last credits. It shows a cave in a wasteland where out comes a confused bartender played by Cristo Fernández (from “Ted Lasso”) that Eddie and Venom interacted with when they spent a little time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Hello?!” he shouts across a large swath of nothing as he begins to walk. The camera closes in on a nearby cockroach skittering by a shattered test tube − and it looks an awful lot like the one crushed by scientist Teddy Payne (played by Juno Temple) that unleashed a symbiote and turned her into a Venomized speedster.', 'So what does that all mean? Unclear. The locale resembles the Void, a purgatorial place that exists between the various universes as seen in “Loki” and most recently “Deadpool & Wolverine.” It could be a sign that symbiotes will play a role in future movies, the bartender might be getting a new alien friend, or, while Venom might be gone, the symbiote now in Teddy still survives.', 'Considering the Knull of it all, probably not. The post-credit scenes in Sony’s Marvel movies haven’t led to much – and given the bad feelings for both “Morbius” and “Madame Web,” probably won’t in the long run. But playing the Knull card means someone’s got plans for him, in some universe, and if he’s around, symbiotes will follow.', 'Moviegoers could see the return of Venom (and Knull) as early as the next “Spider-Man” film, which begins filming next summer with Tom Holland back as the web-slinging young hero. (The concept of the movie – directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and slated for release July 24, 2026 – is ""crazy,"" Holland reports.) Maybe Eddie meets up with Peter Parker in New York City, Venom somehow comes along for the ride, and a dynamic duo becomes a terrific threesome.']"

In the new film, Eddie and his symbiote are on the run, implicated in the death of Detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) in the previous movie, Venom: Let There Be Carnage. As anyone who watched that film will know, however, Mulligan is not really dead. He survived his encounter with Carnage and now appears to be infected with a symbiote of his own...', 'This development has its roots in Marvel Comics, where Mulligan and his symbiote are a pretty major character: Toxin, the offspring of Carnage (who is, himself, the son of Venom!). So, does that mean that Toxin features in Venom: The Last Dance? The answer to that is actually a little complicated...', 'Toxin made his first appearance 20 years ago in 2004\'s Venom/Carnage limited series by writer Peter Milligan and artist Clayton Crain. In the first issue it\'s revealed that Carnage is about to become a father to a new symbiote, which has been bonded to the body of NYPD cop Patrick Mulligan. Carnage wants to kill it (and Mulligan) before the ""baby"" matures, while Venom wants to protect it in the hope of having an ally in his fight against Spider-Man.

Alas, Mulligan suffers a lot in his time as Toxin and is eventually killed by Blackheart in 2011's Venom #11, though the symbiote survives. Most recently he bonded with teenager Bren Waters."", '', ""That's all very different to the character we see in Venom: The Last Dance. In the movie Mulligan is imprisoned in Area 55, the secret base underneath the decommissioned Area 51. When his symbiote eventually appears on screen he's blue, rather than the red usually associated with Toxin, and that name is never spoken on screen. What's more, he doesn't act much like Toxin in the comics, who has a more youthful and lighthearted vibe. In the movie, Mulligan's symbiote is all business until he is eventually killed by one of the Xenophages."", ""So, is Stephen Graham's character in Venom: The Last Dance meant to be Toxin? The answer is: we don't know, but probably not. It seems like Kelly Marcel (who wrote and directed the movie from a story that she developed with Tom Hardy) has taken the basic outline of the comics character – Mulligan is a cop who becomes infected with a symbiote – but gone in a completely different direction, similar to the way the Xenophages here are different to in the comics.
