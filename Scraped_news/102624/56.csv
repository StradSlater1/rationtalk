"No Rourke, no problem: IU football continues finding ways to win",https://www.thedailyhoosier.com/no-rourke-no-problem-iu-football-continues-finding-ways-to-win/,"['BLOOMINGTON — After yet another Indiana football win to match the best start in program history, head coach Curt Cignetti delivered his players a strong message about their performance.', 'No. 13 IU defeated Washington, 31-17, at Memorial Stadium on Saturday to reach 8-0, and this victory wasn’t easy. The Hoosiers didn’t play their absolute best football, and they couldn’t go into cruise control the way they had in several other wins this season. But they just found ways to get the job done, regardless of the circumstances.', ""“It was a great team effort,” Cignetti said after the win. “I told the team after the game, I said, ‘Really good teams, championship teams, they find ways to win games, and that’s what we did today. We found ways to win a game.'”"", 'It’s impossible to know, at this point, whether or not Indiana’s a championship team. But IU is undoubtedly a really good team.', 'The Hoosiers proved that against Washington as much as they have in any game this year. Quarterback Kurtis Rourke has thrown himself — literally — into the Heisman conversation with his exceptional play this season, but his thumb injury suffered against Nebraska last week kept him sidelined on Saturday. Redshirt sophomore Tayven Jackson re-entered the spotlight in his place, and IU’s offense wasn’t its usual dominant self.', 'It’s the type of circumstance that separates bad teams from good teams. Plenty of bad Hoosier teams through the years would’ve wilted without their star quarterback. But this IU squad found other ways. Other players — in all three phases — made things happen in big moments.', 'During the middle of the first quarter, Washington drove into IU territory and threatened to give the Hoosiers their first deficit of the season. But defensive lineman Tyrique Tucker tipped a Will Rogers screen pass, and cornerback D’Angelo Ponds grabbed it and took off. Nobody came close to catching the sophomore on a 67-yard pick six.', 'He managed to one-up that play early in the second quarter. Backed up deep in Washington territory, Rogers targeted sophomore Denzel Boston deep in a 1-on-1 matchup against Ponds. The Miami native locked Boston down the entire time, and after he couldn’t make the interception cleanly on first attempt, he tipped it up to himself and hauled it in.', '“He’s just a dawg, that’s what it comes down to,” defensive end Mikail Kamara said. “We pride ourselves in winning our 1-on-1s, and he wins his 1-on-1s every single time. You turn on the tape, he doesn’t lose.”', 'Offensively, IU has typically maintained a healthy run-pass balance this season. But without Rourke, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan leaned on the running game much more heavily. Jackson attempted only 19 passes, while he, Justice Ellison, Ty Son Lawton, and Kaelon Black combined for 52 rush attempts.', 'The Hoosiers usually rotate Ellison and Lawton very frequently, while also incorporating Black and Elijah Green to a lesser extent. But they strayed from that norm, as well. Cignetti said Lawton “had a little tweak” and didn’t feel 100 percent as the game went along, and the James Madison transfer recorded only three touches after halftime. Ellison became the de facto feature back, and turned in one of the finest performances of any IU player all season.', 'The fifth-year rushed for 123 yards on 29 carries — both career-highs, between this season and his four prior at Wake Forest — with a touchdown. Perhaps most impressive about his outing: his longest rush went for 12 yards. His yardage wasn’t bloated from one huge play. He grinded all game, fighting through contact for extra yards, and wore the Huskies down.', 'The Wake Forest transfer particularly stepped up in a pivotal moment. Jackson threw an interception on the first play from scrimmage in the second half, and Washington turned that into a touchdown four plays later to cut IU’s lead to 17-14. The Hoosiers answered with a long, methodical, ground-heavy drive to regain a stronghold on the game. They ran the ball on 11 of 14 plays in that series, with eight of the 11 runs by Ellison. He capped it off with a five-yard score.', 'Jackson had an up-and down game stepping in for Rourke, with some positive moments mixed with some missed throws and bad decisions. But the Hoosiers gave him support and found other ways to win.', '“Kurtis has been absolutely amazing. It’s unfortunate that he went down, but other guys had to step up, and we knew what we were getting into this week,” center Mike Katic said. “We knew that we were going to be running the ball a lot, so we took that as a challenge. And I think we did pretty well with it.”', 'When Indiana needed a jolt to help put the game away, Myles Price rose to the occasion.', 'The fifth-year let a punt drop in front of him late in the third quarter, which bounced Washington’s way and pinned the Hoosiers deep. Cignetti was less than pleased, and let Price know as he walked off the field.', 'When the Texas Tech transfer lined up deep for his next punt return early in the fourth quarter, he learned his lesson. Price caught it and burst ahead for a 65-yard return that set the Hoosiers up in the red zone. They scored a touchdown four plays later, to all but secure victory.', 'Price, Ellison, and Ponds have all stepped up in different ways throughout the season, and they weren’t the only ones to do so against Washington. But the way they continued producing big moments with Rourke out exemplifies this IU team.', 'One star player isn’t carrying the rest of the group. These Hoosiers don’t succeed at only one thing. They excel in every facet of the game, and even if a key piece of the puzzle is unavailable, they simply find other ways to fit everything together.', 'It’s the sign of a good team. It’s what defines winning teams: pulling out victories when they aren’t playing their best, by just figuring it out.', 'That’s what this 8-0 Indiana football team is, and that’s what it does.', '“You are what your record says you are. Believe me, we’re going to put that tape on, and it ain’t going to be real pretty a lot of times on offense and it won’t be on defense, either. There will be a lot of mistakes out there,” Cignetti said. “But not off to a bad start, I guess.”', 'For complete coverage of IU football, GO HERE.

"Commentary: After another loss, are the Huskies getting better or standing still?",https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/oct/26/commentary-after-another-loss-are-the-huskies-gett/,"['', '', '', '', '', 'BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – In college football, color coordination is a sign of respect.', 'The proof sits in the seats. When Washington opened its Big Ten road schedule Sept. 27 at Rutgers, the Scarlet Knights held a “black out” at SHI Stadium. The Nov. 9 game at No. 3 Penn State is slated as the Nittany Lions’ annual “white out” as well. Heck, the Huskies organized a “purple out” for their national championship rematch against Michigan this month, a 27-17 Washington win.', 'Teams don’t color-coordinate for cupcakes.', 'But these Huskies are no heavyweights, either.', 'Like Michigan, they’re a middling team with an outsized reputation, a sequel that performs at the box office but lacks its predecessor’s plot.', 'On Saturday, No. 13 Indiana (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) hosted ESPN’s “College GameDay” for the first time in Hoosiers history and did so while donning waves of resounding red.', 'They came in red jerseys and jackets, red sweatshirts and hats, and enough red-and-white pinstripe overalls to clothe the entire campus. One fan dragged a red cooler while wearing a red Santa suit that had clearly survived too many Christmases.', 'It was a red-out at Memorial Stadium, and despite UW’s disappointing season, that did make some sense.', 'In a 31-17 win, the Hoosiers saw red from the start.', 'On the opening play, UW kick returner Keith Reynolds was clobbered by Indiana’s Isaiah Jones and Bryson Bonds at his 18-yard line. UW’s first drive featured a sack of quarterback Will Rogers for an 8-yard loss, a false start penalty on center D’Angalo Titialii, a 15-yard completion to Jeremiah Hunter, and an intentional grounding penalty by Rogers on third-and-8 to escape a second sack.', 'Don’t blame that slow start on a second consecutive 9 a.m. kickoff. The Huskies have managed 24 total points in eight first quarters, averaging a field goal per game.', 'This is a team that too often hurts itself – and is not talented, disciplined or determined enough to escape its own hole.', 'On Saturday, Rogers surrendered a pair of interceptions, both of which preceded Indiana touchdowns. With 7:51 left in the first quarter, the senior quarterback was hit while releasing a wobbly wide receiver screen, allowing defensive back D’Angelo Ponds to return it untouched for a 67-yard score. Ponds raided Rogers again early in the second quarter, batting a deep ball to himself along the sideline. The Hoosiers cashed in two plays later, when quarterback Tayven Jackson located wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr., who lost cornerback Elijah Jackson en route to a 42-yard touchdown.', 'Enclosed by 53,082 waving white towels, Washington (4-4, 2-4) succumbed to its inconsistency. While the Husky defense held its own early, Indiana totaled 33 plays, 137 yards and 10 points in two critical drives, draining 15:12 of clock. The Hoosiers added a 2-yard Jackson touchdown, preceded by a 65-yard punt return, with 8:59 left in the fourth quarter to essentially put the game away.', 'It’s one thing to admit that UW is simply not that talented, with an offseason exodus yielding extreme youth on its offensive line and limited star power. From a roster construction standpoint, UW coach Jedd Fisch was dealt a difficult hand.', 'But remember the season-opening 35-3 win over Weber State, when Husky running back Jonah Coleman vowed: “We’re going to make this our worst game”?', 'The attainable goal was never perfection.', 'It was continual improvement.', 'And in too many places, the Huskies have not consistently improved.', '“We’re playing good teams. It’s hard to get good, sometimes, right away,” Fisch said Saturday. “I don’t think there’s a question, when I watch us, that there’s moments we’re getting better. Now you’ve got to get better against opponents. You’ve got to get better each week. You’ve got to get better when you go on the road against Iowa or on the road against an 8-0 Indiana team.', '“What does getting better look like? Does getting better mean scoring? Or does getting better mean that you have five penalties in a game and not 16? Does it mean you go 3 for 3 in the red zone, or does Grady (Gross) making his extra points and field goal, is that getting better? So I think we have all those phases we’re continuing to evaluate. But this is the trials and tribulations of trying to put together a whole new culture, a whole new system, a new offense, new defense, new special teams. We need to find a way to continue to improve.”', 'Like Fisch said, it’s unfair to simply compare box scores, when the quality of opponent and injuries make obvious impacts. But in UW’s final four games – against USC, Penn State, UCLA and Oregon – bowl eligibility is the bar to clear.', 'And beyond wins and losses … is UW getting better? Is a team ranking 110th nationally in red-zone touchdown percentage (50%) flipping yards into points? Is a special teams unit sitting 114th in opponent punt return average (13.2 yards) bandaging its bruises? Is this coaching staff making meaningful adjustments?', 'That’s what I’ll be watching. Because while talent can be improved via recruiting, an inability to develop and maximize it would be damning indeed.', 'Plus, with wavering stakes, will these players finish or fold?', '“If you don’t have nothing to play for, play for the seniors. Play for the ‘W’ on your chest. Play for yourself as well. Play for the team,” safety Kamren Fabiculanan said of his message to UW’s younger players. “Just putting things in perspective … don’t take it for granted.”', 'Beyond color coordination, the residual respect from last season’s accomplishments won’t help these Huskies win. Whether it’s Fox’s “Big Noon Kickoff” or ESPN’s “College GameDay,” UW continues to squander spotlights; its reputation precedes its play.', 'That said, it’s only a lost season if losses don’t become lessons. This team was never going to win a national title. It’s a bigger problem if, instead of making strides, UW keeps standing still.', 'Local journalism is essential.', ""Give directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

There are no bad wins. I thought it was really gutty finding a way to win. Defense with the big turnover in the first half for a touchdown and then Ponds comes back with another one shortly thereafter. We made a couple nice plays in the first half and had a two-score lead at times.', ""But we weren't playing very well. We just weren't executing. Quarterback has got a few plays that he'll learn from. It wasn't that there weren't things there. They did change their tendencies on us quite a bit. They went from a man coverage team to a zone team, so at some point in the game you almost throw out 50 percent of the game plan and just start shooting them from the hip."", ""The second half opened with the interception, so it was tight. We respond with a nice drive and a score. That was a point. I think one of those drives we had three runs for third-down conversions, and then it became more about -- sometimes you've just got to throw that game plan out, like okay, what works against this."", 'It still comes down to the guys up front and the running back, Justice Ellison, 29 carries.

We found ways to win a game."", 'On whether this game embodied complementary football ...', ""Cignetti: Well, I don't know if that's complementary football. Complementary football to me is you're playing well and you're balanced on offense and doing all the things you've got to do in all three phases. What I would say is the defense really saved us early in the game. Saved us, and then came up with some big turnovers."", 'Then at the end of the game the offense got the run game going, started eating some clock and kept them off the field, and special teams with the big return did their part, and we had some good plays on special teams.', 'I think this is a close team with a lot of competitive character, guys that really want to be good, have the right stuff, and they found a way to win.', 'On why running back Justice Ellison got the ball so often in the second half ...', ""Cignetti: Yeah, there was a time we used to give a guy the ball 42 times a game, but we won't go there."", ""You know, Lawton had a little tweak and didn't feel like he was 100 percent, and Justice had the hot hand.

They're tough guys."", 'On the big picture with the team at 8-0 and how well the Hoosiers are playing ...', ""Cignetti: I mean, you are what your record says you are.

The defense stepped up in a huge way, the offense kept grinding and made second-half adjustments, and the team overcame adversity.', 'Curt Cignetti’s Hoosiers can beat teams in multiple ways, with or without a star quarterback. The entire country is officially on notice.', 'Here are three things we learned:', 'The entire defense deserves credit today, but D’Angelo Ponds is worth singling out as a microcosm of Indiana’s team success this season. He had two interceptions in the first half, including a momentum-shifting pick six that stopped a promising early drive for Washington.', 'Ponds had some huge open field tackles today too, bringing down Washington backs and receivers that were among the top in the conference in yards after contact.', 'For somebody who was named to the Freshman All-America team last season, Ponds’ success this year should come as no surprise. As a true freshman, he was 11th in the FBS for passes defended with 15.', 'The problem was, these stats came from his season at James Madison, so people doubted whether he could succeed in the Big Ten.', 'Ponds, along with his head coach and many of his defensive teammates, like Aidan Fisher and Jailin Walker, are putting that narrative to bed. Good players and good coaches win football games, and Indiana is currently undefeated.', 'Teams like Ohio State may have some depth that could wear Indiana down, but until Indiana loses a game, I’m done hearing about a talent gap between the Hoosiers and the rest of college football’s elite.', 'Indiana’s Kurtis Rourke, who has recently started popping up in Heisman discussions, missed today’s game and his absence was felt. The Hoosiers high-powered passing attack was limited to one touchdown on just 19 passing attempts versus 52 run plays.', 'This is in no way a knock against Tayven Jackson, who played well enough to get Indiana the win in his first start since last season. He clearly has the physical tools too, delivering some good passes when his receivers were open including one off his back foot with pressure in his face on third down.', 'He hasn’t had the experience Rourke has had in college football though, and couldn’t make the same reads and decisions that we had gotten used to over the first seven weeks. In the longterm, having Jackson get these snaps will help him become more like Rourke when he has the chance to be the full time starter.', 'For the sake of this season though, the ceiling is clearly much higher with Rourke in, so Indiana should do everything it can to make sure he’s fully healthy before his return.', 'Indiana was better than Washington today, as a whole. All credit for this goes to Curt Cignetti and his staff.', 'There are plenty of players who stood out on both sides of the ball today, but the fact is that this team has had a variety of guys step up over the course of the season, and the team always responds well to big moments.', 'After Jackson’s interception to start the second half (on a missed pass interference call), Washington was set up for an easy touchdown to bring the game within three. This was the exact opposite of what Indiana needed, after the offense struggled to get the defense off the field in the first half.', 'Instead of folding, Mike Shanahan dialed up a 14 play, 7:34 second touchdown drive to regain a ten point lead. Then Bryant Haines unit came out to force back-to-back punts, the latter of which Myles Price returned 65 yards to Washington’s 14 yard line.', 'That’s how you put a team to bed, and it’s something Indiana has been able to do all season, no matter what’s thrown its way.

"", ""Washington was driving into Indiana territory after the first three-and-out and for a moment it looked like the Hoosiers would be facing a deficit for the first time all season. That's when sophomore D'Angelo Ponds jumped the route on a screen pass to log the first of his two interceptions in the game and sprint 67 yards the other direction for the game's first touchdown. "", 'PICK-6 FOR @IndianaFootball ‼️#B1GFootball on BTN 📺 pic.twitter.com/WmhIAZisEF', '""I thought it was a gutty win,"" Curt Cignetti told the Big Ten Network after the game. ""Defense made some plays in the first half, the interception for a touchdown and another interception that set up a touchdown. The defense wasn\'t perfect, but they had a lot of stops."" ', ""After Ponds' second interception of the first half it took Indiana just two plays for Jackson to connect with wide receiver Omar Cooper over the middle of the field for a 42-yard touchdown. "", ""OMAR COOPER ‼️ @IndianaFootball has Bloomington buzzin' 💥#B1GFootball on @BigTenNetwork 📺 pic.twitter.com/PqUjSb4sow"", 'It was a gut-punch for Washington, who through 17 minutes of game time had more total yards of offense and more first downs yet trailed 14-0 on the scoreboard. And even without Rourke in the lineup, the Hoosiers knew that their early offensive ineptitude was not likely to continue throughout the afternoon. ', ""Sometimes well-coached teams win by beating teams at the margins and sometimes they can win based on how they respond and adjust during a game. Indiana's win against Washington featured both, as splash plays on defense and special teams impacted the field position battle and the scoreboard but there was also some in-game adjustments that allowed the Hoosiers to put the game on ice in the second half. "", ""Washington's defense, led by Steve Belichick, presented Indiana with some different coverage looks that made it tough for Tayven Jackson and the passing game to get going. So the Hoosiers turned to the downhill rushing attack and it served them well on multiple fronts. Senior running back Justice Ellison was a willing workhorse with 123 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries and both Ty'Son Lawton (12 carries, 41 yards) and Jackson (six carries, 17 yards, one touchdown) were able to give the ground game some balance. "", ""A heavy dose of the run game helped wear down Washington's defense and keep the clock running as the Hoosiers protected their lead throughout the second half. The mentality was on full display early in the third quarter when Washington cut the lead to just three points after a Tayven Jackson interception and then Indiana responded with a 14-play, 75-yard drive that ate up 7:42 of game clock to push the lead back to 10. "", 'Justice Ellison extends the @IndianaFootball lead 👏#B1GFootball on @BigTenNetwork 📺 pic.twitter.com/t7l4DqMTIV', 'Moving forward for Indiana there will be a lot of deserved attention on the status of Kurtis Rourke as he continues to recover and rehab from the surgery to repair his injured finger. The outlook was reportedly optimistic following the procedure, up next are two games before the Hoosiers hit a late off week in prior to the Nov. 23 showdown with Ohio State in Columbus. Indiana is at Michigan State next week and then hosts Michigan on Nov. 9, and while the run game and defense answered the call against Washington the absence of Rourke could be felt in a bigger way away from home next week or against the reigning Big Ten champs in Michigan. ', ""But even if Rourke isn't able to return next week for Michigan State, what Indiana showed in a gritty win was the result of a team that's incredible well-coached and versatile. Rourke may be one of the Big Ten's best quarterbacks but his success is not the sole reason for Indiana's success. This is a total team effort to match one of the greatest seasons in Indiana football history, and with each step that keeps the Hoosiers on track to contend for the Big Ten title it makes 2024 look like it could be one of the greatest season in program history as well."", '© 2004-2024 CBS INTERACTIVE.

', 'A Seattle native and Husky fan, Rugg is taking in the scene as No. 13 Indiana’s bus pulls up in front of the Assembly Hall. It’s a cold Midwest morning — just 47 degrees despite the early morning sun shining brightly in a sky with no clouds. Plumes of steam and smoke waft from the endless rows of tents and tailgates as the smell of hot dogs fills the parking lots surrounding Memorial Stadium. ', 'Rugg, a former member of the Husky Marching Band, watches as the Indiana Marching Hundred perform Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby.” He arrived Friday night in Indianapolis, then drove down early in the morning to watch Indiana play his beloved Washington. Rugg is expected in Boston for a conference next week, so he figured he’d be able to sneak in a UW football game since Indiana is “so far east.”', 'About 800 feet away, the crowd from ESPN’s “College GameDay” is visible on Memorial Stadium’s south lawn. ', '“This is my two-day layover,” Rugg said with a laugh. “Work knows. They know I’m doing this.”', 'Rugg was one of a handful of Husky fans who made the trek to here to watch Washington play Indiana at Memorial Stadium. The Huskies lost 31-17 in front of a sold-out crowd of 53,082 fans, but Rugg, who said he tries to travel to at least one game per season, said he was enjoying the IU experience. ', '“They’re really passionate,” said Rugg, wearing a purple UW cap and a purple Homefield Apparel bomber jacket. “They’re excited to play us. When I think Midwest, I think passionate fan base, hospitable, kind in general. They’ve delivered.”', 'Nearby, John Komorita and Izzy Lyon are also enjoying the pregame festivities. They’re both originally from Indiana but have lived in Edmonds and gained an affinity for the Huskies. Lyon wears a UW jacket and candy-stripe IU-inspired leggings to represent her dual allegiances. ', ""Like Rugg, they’ve paired the UW game with another event to make the travel a little more realistic for Komorita, who still lives in Washington. They saw the band Chicago in Nashville, Ind., earlier in the week before driving into Bloomington for Saturday's game. "", 'Closer to the “GameDay” set, fans donning Indiana’s crimson colors huddle around the outskirts of the crowd. One fan wears a costume dressed as a box of Marlboros while their friends are individual cigarettes — a reference to Indiana coach Curt Cignetti. ', '“GameDay” host Lee Corso, who coached the Hoosiers from 1973-82, walks through the crowd with a police escort wearing a crimson Indiana pullover, identical to the one he used to wear on the Hoosiers sidelines. The IU crowd serenades him with praise as he walks past. ', 'In front of the east entrance of Memorial Stadium, David Hoff and his family, all wearing UW gear, wait to take a photograph with Hep’s Rock. Once a part of IU’s run out under coach Terry Hoeppner, it’s now located outside the stadium as an attraction for fans. ', 'Hoff was born in Seattle. He now lives in Georgetown, Ky., about three hours away from Bloomington. As soon as he saw the schedule, he knew he was going to make the trip. ', 'Hoff said UW’s move to the Big Ten has made them more accessible for his family, and he hopes to take them to at least one game a year going forward. He and his wife, Erin, are trying to get daughter Callie to become a college football fan. This is her first UW game, and Hoff is optimistic. ', 'He also praised Indiana’s atmosphere, noting he felt it was better than some of the former Pac-12 schools he’d traveled to as a UW fan. ', '“It’s neat,” he said. “We’ve met a couple people who’ve been hospitable. Said welcome to Bloomington. Seems like everyone here is real nice.”', 'However, Hoff noted Saturday’s game was the most outnumbered he’d ever felt as a Seattle sports fan. An avid Seahawks supporter, Hoff said he’s used to being among the minority at stadiums when they travel away from the Pacific Northwest but noted he hadn’t seen many UW fans.', 'Hoff, Rugg, Komorita and Lyon all have slightly differing opinions on the Huskies this season. Rugg said he hopes coach Jedd Fisch can continue to recruit, keep giving young players experience and make a bowl game. Hoff said he misses former coach Kalen DeBoer. Komorita noted the Huskies have a tough road ahead, but Lyon thinks they’ll be up to the challenge.

Huskies Upended by Indiana In 31-17 Defeat,https://www.uwdawgpound.com/2024/10/26/24280317/huskies-upended-by-indiana-in-31-17-defeat,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Washington couldn’t hand Indiana its first loss.', 'A bye week sat between Washington’s two most recent outings. It marked the only Saturday in the three-week stretch where Husky fans didn’t groan in frustration. Those groans carried throughout the entire second half against Iowa. They reappeared on today’s opening drive and then stuck around for the remainder of the 31-17 defeat.', 'The loss drops UW to 4-4 (2-3 Big Ten) on the year.', 'The Huskies had moved on from the dreadful slow starts we saw in the first few games of the season up until Saturday morning. Instead of being forced to punt or turning the ball over on downs, Will Rogers had a pass intercepted for a 65-yard score. It was the first of two takeaways off Rogers by Hoosiers defensive back D’Angelo Ponds.', 'After the opening period ended with Indiana leading 7-0, disaster struck again when Ponds plucked away his second interception, out-working UW’s Denzel Boston to earn the takeaway. Indiana then connected on a 42-yard touchdown through the air on the ensuing play to take a 14-0 lead. Sensing the pressure, the Huskies responded by scoring a touchdown of their own as Giles Jackson scored on a handoff from six yards out.', 'Washington found itself in danger to conclude the opening half. Indiana was in a goal-to-go situation, hunting for a 21-7 lead. But the Huskies stepped up and stuffed the Hoosiers three times to force a field goal. Rather than be stubborn, Indiana netted the 19-yard field goal and took a 17-7 advantage into halftime.', 'Momentum from the goal line stand to conclude the first half carried into the second as UW forced a turnover when defensive lineman Jacob Bandes pulled down an interception. Grateful for the field position, UW’s offense used four plays to pick up 24 yards, with quarterback Demond Williams picking up the final eight with his legs for a touchdown to trim the lead to 17-14.', 'Almost as quickly as UW made it a game, Indiana snatched back all momentum with a 14-play, 75-yard drive that took 7:42 off the clock. From that point on, Indiana flexed its muscle and undefeated record by stifling Rogers and Co. With just under nine minutes to go, the door was all but officially slammed on the Huskies one final time. Right before that, UW took the field in need of points but went three-and-out, then a huge punt return put Indiana’s offense deep into Husky territory.', 'Backup quarterback Tayven Jackson capped off a brief drive with a rushing touchdown from two yards out to put the Hoosiers up 31-14. UW got deep into Indiana territory but settled for a field goal and converted rather than going for it on fourth down. Grady Gross’ make trimmed the deficit to 31-17.', 'If you’re looking for a positive takeaway, Demond Williams had another pretty positive outing despite limited reps. Another is that the Huskies have not given up on the season, which is incredibly important, considering two wins are still needed to reach a bowl game.', 'The negatives? I’m sure Mark Schafer will cover plenty in his weekly “What We Learned” Monday.', 'For now, UW’s inability to keep the last two games close is what sticks out to me. Iowa is known for its inept offense but hung 40 on the Dawgs while allowing just 16. Indiana was without starting quarterback Kurtis Rourke and instead of capitalizing by turning the clash into a track meet, Washington’s offense practically spotted them 14 points.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

Here’s how the Hoosiers, who still have yet to trail this season, graded out:', 'It wasn’t as free-flowing and dangerous as it has been, but it wasn’t likely to be. Tayven Jackson had one week to prepare for a role Kurtis Rourke got all spring and summer to settle into. Jackson wasn’t perfect but he kept things ticking over, and he both passed and rushed for a score. Justice Ellison pounded away at Washington’s defense in his second-straight 100-yard rushing game. Together, they drove forward an offense that controlled the field and the clock in a punishing second half that put Washington to bed.', 'How it happened:Hoosiers remain unbeaten with 31-17 over Washington.', 'ESPN College GameDay at IU:Highlights, picks from wild Bloomington scene', 'Washington (4-4, 2-3) is a team of contradictions, poor on third downs and in the red zone, but the Huskies don’t make many mistakes, and they don’t turn the ball over. They did both Saturday. Will Rogers threw two interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. Indiana (8-0, 5-0) logged three sacks and, like so many quarterbacks before him, harried Rogers relentlessly even when the Hoosiers couldn’t get him on the ground. That’s what this defense does — makes quarterbacks uncomfortable and makes opponents commit uncustomary errors. Both contributed directly to eight wins in as many tries Saturday.', 'Indiana has not asked much of its special teams so far this season. Kicks have been clean, coverage good, returns uneventful. This was the kind of game that asked more, and special teams delivered, namely with Myles Price’s 65-yard fourth-quarter punt return that set up the touchdown that pushed IU’s lead to 31-14. So much of special teams is cleanliness and execution. When the Hoosiers needed more impact Saturday, they got it.', 'Doyel:Perfect IU season has perfect day, wallops Washington with GameDay, Lee Corso on hand', ""More:Lee Corso, 1979 Holiday Bowl reunion 'means the world' to IU's first bowl winners"", 'Hosting ESPN GameDay is an honor. For Indiana, it was a watershed moment. But it’s also a chore, particularly on players and coaches. There’s added attention and pressure, more media commitments and, for a team so proud of its sharp focus, more distraction. Layer that in next to Washington’s strengths on both sides of the ball, and the absence of starting quarterback Kurtis Rourke, and this game was never going to be straightforward. But the Hoosiers made far fewer of those mistakes. They were tougher and smarter. They wore the pressure of their ranking well. And they earned their win, all of which starts with good coaching.', 'Last week, Ellison’s explosive runs typified a rushing performance that caught Nebraska completely by surprise. This week, his work between the tackles set the tone for a game the Hoosiers won the hard way. They made Washington stop them on the ground, and Washington couldn’t, and nobody made sure of that quite like Ellison. Special mention here for D’Angelo Ponds, who had both picks and returned one for a score. But it was on Ellison’s back Indiana won this game.', 'Listen to Mind Your Banners, our IU Athletics-centric podcast, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.', '(This story was updated to add a video.)']"
