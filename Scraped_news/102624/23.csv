Gold Outlook: XAU/USD rally pauses amid strength in dollar and yields,https://www.forex.com/ie/news-and-analysis/gold-outlook-xauusd-rally-pauses-amid-strength-in-dollar-and-yields/,"['By clicking ""Accept all cookies"", you agree to the storing of cookies on your device and the sharing of information with third parties to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.', 'Now that we are seeing the bullish momentum fade somewhat, and prices remaining at significantly overbought technical levels on the higher time frames, even some of the most bullish enthusiasts would find it difficult to maintain a short-term bullish gold outlook, without first seeing a bit of a pullback in prices at the very least.', 'Share this:', ' ', ' ', ""After reaching fresh record highs earlier this week, gold prices have pulled back, raising questions about whether we’ve seen a short-term peak or just a temporary pause in the rally. It is the lack of fresh bullish drivers that has kept the metal’s gains in check this week. If anything, we have had more bearish fundamental reasons for the rally to pause, or even reverse.  The dollar's strong rally in recent weeks and the simultaneous climb in bond yields are clear headwinds for the metal, as they increase the opportunity cost of holding zero-interest assets like gold. Up until the latter parts of this week, these considerations have been largely ignored. But now that we are seeing the bullish momentum fade somewhat, and prices remaining at significantly overbought technical levels on the higher time frames, even some of the most bullish enthusiasts would find it difficult to maintain a short-term bullish gold outlook, without first seeing a bit of a pullback in prices at the very least. The question is whether that motion has now started or does this phase of the weakness yet again prove to be short-lived before we see new highs. Next week is a busy one for the economic calendar with lots of US economic data, the BoJ’s policy meeting and lots of major company earnings all to come ahead of the November 5 US Presidential election in the following week."", ' ', '', ' ', ' ', 'While bond yields fell on Thursday, they remain near their recent highs at around 4.2%. By holding gold instead of the US 10-year bonds, investors are effectively forgoing a fixed annual nominal return of over 4%. Their preference for gold must therefore be because of expectations for 1) even higher gold prices i.e., capital appreciation 2) inflation acceleration, 3) haven demand, or more likely, a combination of these factors. But it is also common that people like to buy things when they are going up, in part because of FOMO, and so momentum is another factor driving gold prices even higher. But with yields now above 4%, and the dollar going from strength to strength, you would seriously have to consider the downside risks for gold from here on.', ' ', 'Though I have long been a gold bull and expected prices to near the $3K mark, the fact that we have now seen a big rise in yields and the dollar means some of bullish arguments for gold are now no longer relevant. So, I can’t see gold maintaining its rally without a change in direction of either the dollar or bond yields, or a major escalation in the Middle East tensions such as a real war breaking out between Iran and Israel.', ' ', 'But gold’s haven appeal is now less of a bullish factor. Israel’s recent statement that it isn’t planning to escalate tensions with Iran by targeting its oil and nuclear sites, has already seen oil prices – the most sensitive market to Middle East tensions after gold – ease. This assurance should also be impacting gold from a safe haven demand point of view, especially if we hopefully see further de-escalation in the situation in the coming weeks.', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Technically, gold’s recent price action suggests a potential pullback. Despite reaching a new high earlier this week, the momentum has stalled, reflecting a challenge to sustain recent gains against a strong dollar and high yields. With the RSI (Relative Strength Index) already being at extreme overbought levels on the higher time frames like the monthly and weekly, a reversal similar to August 2020—when gold faced months of correction—could be on the horizon. So far, though, we haven’t seen any major reversal patterns such as the breakdown of a key support level to form a lower low, but that could happen soon.', ' ', 'Looking at the weekly chart, we can see gold is on the verge of potentially forming a doji or inverted hammer candle on this time frame. While this on its own wouldn’t be too alarming, the fact that the RSI is deep at “overbought” levels of 80.0 gives it a bit more relevance.', ' ', '', 'Source: TradingView.com', ' ', 'Next support on the weekly gold chart below $2715 area comes in around $2685, marking the high from September. Below that level, there are not many obvious near-term support levels to watch on the weekly chart, so you will need to look into the lower time frames. But essentially, the RSI situation needs to be addressed either through price action or a long consolidation around these levels. In either case, the risks to short-term gold outlook is therefore tilted to downside as the upside potential should be limited from here on, until such a time that prices are no longer so significantly overbought.', ' ', ' ', ' ', '-- Written by Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst', 'Follow Fawad on Twitter @Trader_F_R', ' ', ' ', '', 'Award-winning platforms, competitive spreads, low commissions and dedicated support.', 'We live and breathe the markets and are dedicated to helping traders realise their ambitions as we continue to set the industry bar.', 'StoneX Europe Ltd may make third party material available on this website which may contain information included but not limited to the conditions of financial markets.

Spot prices have now risen 32% this year, with the latest leg up encouraged by central bank easing, rising US election uncertainty, and geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.', 'CIO continues to rate gold as Attractive and recommends to position for further upside, with prices expected to trade near USD 2,850/oz in March 2025. (UBS)', 'While the speed and scale of gold’s rally this year could trigger the occasional bout of volatility, we think prices will continue to rise in the months ahead:', 'Gold should continue to benefit from declining real rates. The Federal Reserve easing cycle is still at an early stage, in our view, with 100 basis points of cuts expected in total this year, and another 100bps in 2025. Gold has historically rallied by as much as 10% in the six months after the first Fed cut, according to the World Gold Council. Global rates are also going down, with China and Canada’s central banks cutting rates this week by 25bps and 50bps, respectively, and the European Central Bank (ECB) easing by 25bps last week. We also see gold benefiting from dollar weakness next year as both rates and bond yields decline, while the metal’s political hedging utility could blunt near-term dollar upside risks if former President Donald Trump wins the US election.', 'Geopolitical flashpoints are no closer to resolution. An expected Israeli strike on Iran has not yet materialized ahead of regional peace talks in Doha this weekend. Still, the deaths of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah’s heir apparent leader Hashem Safieddine do not appear to have changed Israel’s approach, with continued strikes this week in both Gaza and Lebanon. In an escalation, North Korea has reportedly sent troops to Russia’s border region ahead of a possible wider deployment in Ukraine. Ukraine’s president last week said his country could seek nuclear weapons if NATO membership were ruled out.', 'Dollar diversification is driving flows, too. US President Joe Biden this week announced a USD 20bn loan to Ukraine backed by interest earned on “immobilized” Russian sovereign assets. The West’s approach has fueled central bank diversification into gold in recent years. Central banks purchased a record 483 tons in the first half, according to World Gold Council data, with Turkey, India, China, and Poland topping the list.', 'ETF data shows inflows into gold ETFs also continued in August for a fourth consecutive month. Total holdings have rebounded to nearly 3,182 metric tons, the highest since the start of the year, narrowing the year-to-date loss to 44 metric tons.', 'So, we continue to rate gold as Attractive and to position for further upside, with prices expected to trade near USD 2,850/oz in March 2025. Recent events have underscored gold’s hedging qualities and utility from a portfolio perspective, and we reiterate our recommendation for a diversified USD-denominated portfolio to include a 5% allocation to gold as a broad hedge. As returns on cash are eroded by this lower interest rate environment, more investor funds may end up redirected into assets like gold.

With that digital platform, you can buy as little as $5 in gold.', 'Physical gold investments — including digital fractions of them — typically come with tax liabilities.

A break of $2700 would likely begin squeezing the late longs. My guess is we see $2600 before $2800.”', '“I am bearish on Gold for the coming week,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. “Nothing came out of the BRICS Summit for precious metals and with precious metals having moved up ahead of that meeting, I think they are due for a correction. Also, there are no central bank meetings this week.”', 'Cieszynski said he almost went neutral for the week ahead, because in the longer term, “the underlying factors driving the current bull market have not changed like devaluation of paper money and political risk, especially with the US election less than two weeks away now.”', '“My bearish stance is one week only, based on the potential for a trading correction,” he said.', '“Up,” said James Stanley, senior market strategist at Forex.com. “So far bulls have struggled to gain acceptance over the 2750 level in spot, but I still have no evidence that the run is over yet,” he said. “Buyers put in a couple of strong support responses over the past week, so I’m going to continue to bias with the dominant trend until evidence suggests otherwise.”', '“Down,” said Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management. “Could the long-expected pullback finally be coming? Perhaps, but we doubt it will be very long or deep.

While I still think there could be buying interest tied to potential chaos ahead of the U.S. presidential election, the market might take a quick breather next week.”', 'In the longer term, however, Newsom believes gold prices are being driven primarily by inflationary and geopolitical risks, in the United States and abroad, and he doesn’t see either of those settling down any time soon.', ""“It's gold higher, on the idea that we're going to get into Inflationary problems again,” he said. “And from a chaos point of view, [geopolitical conflict] causes increased destabilization. Investors don't like uncertainty, and they start taking the money out of stocks, a very solid investment here over the last four years, because of the uncertainty.”"", ""“Where are they going to look for safe haven?” he asked. “Is it crude oil? No. Is it corn? Probably not. So you don't have king corn, you don't have king crude oil. If you're going to try to hedge against inflation, you're going to be buying into gold for both economic and political reasons.”"", 'This week, nine analysts participated in the Kitco News Gold Survey, and last week’s near-total bullish consensus has shrunk to a narrow majority.

There's some bitter pills that people are going to have to swallow to get spending under control here in the United States.”"", ""“I think the tax cuts that they're talking about will go through, the ones that expire next year that were pushed forward,” Haberkorn said, “I think they'll make some changes, and if not, maybe make some more significant cuts. But the key is, what about government spending? How are they going to get that under control?”"", ""Haberkorn believes the United States is at a pivotal point right now. “You could see it in the U.S. treasuries, where treasury yields are going up in spite of the Fed cutting rates,” he said. “What's that telling you? It's telling you that bond purchasers don't want to buy treasuries. They want higher guarantees, higher rates to purchase those treasuries. Given what's going on in the treasury market, I think right now gold's well-positioned, and I don't think in the short term, meaning in the next year, you're going to see much change from that standpoint.”"", ""Haberkorn said he’s keeping a close eye on bond yields to determine gold’s next moves. “We'll see how those shape out here next week, but I think that will also be a key driver right now, with those ticking up.”"", 'And Kitco Senior Analyst Jim Wyckoff said technical and fundamental factors remain supportive of the gold price. “Steady-higher as charts remain bullish and safe-haven demand keeping a floor under prices,” he said.', 'At the time of writing, spot gold last traded at $2,743.72 per ounce for a gain of 0.28% on the day and 0.75% on the week.', ""Ernest Hoffman is a Crypto and Market Reporter for Kitco News.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.', 'By Angelica Leicht', 'Edited By Matt Richardson', 'October 25, 2024 / 12:34 PM EDT / CBS News', ""If you've paid any attention to the precious metals market recently, you're likely aware that gold has been on an impressive upward trajectory since the start of the year. On January 1, gold was trading at $2,063.73 per ounce. Fast forward to today (October 25, 2024), and the price of gold is sitting at $2,734.46 per ounce. This represents an increase of $670.73 per ounce, amounting to a growth rate of approximately 33% in a little over 10 months. This significant growth has captured the attention of investors and market analysts worldwide, as gold's performance defies predictions and underscores its historic role as a stable store of value."", ""The recent rally becomes even more noteworthy when compared to gold's prior record highs. Just this August, the price reached $2,525 per ounce — a milestone that marked a new peak at the time. However, gold's price was far from plateauing at that point. The price of gold continued to surge, eventually surpassing that mark by over $200 per ounce. This upward movement has established the past year as a standout year for gold, drawing investors who may have initially seen these peaks as ceiling prices, but who now view gold's price potential as far more expansive than anticipated."", ""But while there's no question that gold has offered some of the biggest returns over the past year, many investors are questioning what, precisely, is driving this sustained surge. So why is the price of gold so high right now? That's what we'll break down below."", 'Add gold to your investment portfolio today.', ""Here are a few of the factors that have been pushing gold's price to new heights over the last year."", ""A primary force behind gold's recent bull run is the purchasing activity of central banks worldwide. Central banks, particularly those in emerging economies, are increasing their gold reserves as a hedge against economic uncertainty and to diversify their holdings away from traditional fiat currencies. This sustained buying pressure from such powerful market participants has created a strong foundation for price appreciation and signals a broader shift in institutional attitudes toward gold as a strategic asset."", ""In addition to central banks, individual investors have been flocking to gold, seeing an opportunity for both short-term and long-term gains. With gold prices rising so quickly, gold has become an attractive asset for speculative trading as well as a safer, longer-term investment. So, some investors are now seeking quick returns by betting on the momentum of gold's climb to earn rapid profits, while others continue to rely on gold's stability. "", ""The rush of buying and trading activity creates a feedback loop, further driving demand and prices up. This blend of trading activity has been a core factor in the consistent upward price movement over the past year, illustrating gold's dual role as both a stable store of value and a source of near-term market excitement."", 'Find out more about your gold investing options here.', ""Ongoing geopolitical tensions, including election year uncertainties, are also playing into gold's price surge. Elections can influence market sentiment by adding uncertainty, often triggering interest in safe-haven assets like gold. Additionally, global economic slowdowns and international conflicts, such as those involving energy trade disputes, have introduced more volatility in the global market, leading investors to seek refuge in gold. "", ""With each spike in uncertainty, gold's appeal as a safe, non-correlated asset increases, attracting investors looking to hedge against potential market downturns. For many, gold remains a reliable safeguard, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone in diversified portfolios, especially during periods of unpredictability."", ""The limited supply of gold has also contributed to its recent price surge. Gold is a finite resource, after all, and mining new gold is both costly and time-intensive. As demand grows from both investors and industrial sectors, the pressure on gold's limited supply intensifies, elevating its value. "", ""Technological advancements in sectors like electronics and green energy have also increased gold's utility. Gold is used in electronic components, medical devices and emerging green technologies, creating steady industrial demand. This expanding industrial application is a lesser-known but increasingly important factor, reinforcing gold's value beyond traditional uses."", ""The remarkable ascent of gold prices in 2024 can be attributed to a perfect storm of global economic and political factors. Central banks' substantial purchases, investors' pursuit of both security and short-term gains, geopolitical uncertainties and the finite nature of gold itself have converged to create a robust and sustained rally."", ""Looking ahead, many analysts believe that gold's trajectory may continue upward, especially if central banks and industrial sectors sustain their interest and if global uncertainties persist. While the current price surge may eventually stabilize, investors and analysts alike are continuing to keep a close eye on this precious metal right now, as gold continues to set new records and play a vital role in today's dynamic economic landscape."", 'Angelica Leicht is senior editor for Managing Your Money, where she writes and edits articles on a range of personal finance topics.

HSBC Predicts Gold Prices to Hit New Highs Amid Political Uncertainty,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2567781/hsbc-predicts-gold-prices-to-hit-new-highs-amid-political-uncertainty,"['Analysts at HSBC foresee geopolitical risks and the U.S. election potentially driving gold prices higher until 2025. However, they anticipate that the rally may slow down later next year due to increased supply and high prices dampening demand.', ""According to an HSBC report, gold is currently enjoying significant momentum, which could continue into next year. Analysts suggest that due to geopolitical risks and economic uncertainties sparking 'safe-haven' demand, gold prices might remain above $2,200 per ounce. The growing fiscal deficit and expectations for further monetary easing are also fueling speculative gold demand."", 'HSBC analysts predict a slowdown in the gold price surge after 2025, influenced by both physical and financial market factors. By the end of 2025, gold prices might moderately decline due to decreased demand for jewelry and coins, as well as an increase in global gold production, driven primarily by mining activities.', 'Furthermore, elevated gold prices are boosting the supply of scrap gold, creating potential resistance from weak jewelry and coin demand alongside rising mining and recycling levels. Analysts also caution that gold-backed ETFs may continue to liquidate holdings, and central bank demand for gold might slow down in the face of high prices.', ""We'd love to learn more about your experiences on GuruFocus.com and how we can improve!""]"
Gold Price Forecast: Retains Strength but Remains Rangebound,https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-forecast-retains-strength-but-remains-rangebound-1471576,"['Gold’s bullish setup suggests potential for higher targets if resistance at 2,758 breaks.', 'Gold', 'Gold remained stuck within a relatively tight five-day price range from 2,709 to 2,758 on Friday as it continued to push up against recent highs. Notice that the price range for each of the five days, including today, is contained within the high to low range from Wednesday.', 'On that day gold crept to a new record high of 2,758 before encountering resistance that turned the price back down. The day ended in a bearish posture with a reversal day that closed below the prior day’s low. Nonetheless, gold has managed to strengthen somewhat the past two days off that low close but remains inside the range and therefore may yet again be impacted by the bearish implications of that day.', '', '', 'Resistance has been seen around the completion of a 250% extended retracement measuring the March 2022 downswing. Also, the top line of a rising trend channel marks a similar price area. But given the signs of continued strength, it seems like gold may yet want to go higher before a notable pullback. Regardless, a signal is needed before anything is indicated. A bullish signal occurs on a decisive rally above the 2,758-record high.', 'If price continues to strengthen from there, gold is likely heading towards a price range from 2,797 to 2,815. The range consists of a 200% extended retracement of the decline that began from the 2011 peak. Next is 2,808, the 261.8% extended retracement from the decline off the March 2022 peak. Finally, the price range ends with an estimated target of 2,815 from the bull flag pattern that triggered last week.', 'On the downside, a breakdown below 2,758 may lead to a test of support at lower prices. The last breakout level was at the prior trend high of 2,686 and it may now see support. Subsequently, the critical 20-Day MA for the short-term trend is at 2,674. Notice that the 20-Day line was tested on the initial flag breakout day before the rise above the top flag boundary line. A break below the 20-Day line may see the 50-Day MA at 2,599 eventually being tested as support.', 'For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.', ""Bruce boasts over 20 years in financial markets, holding senior roles such as Head of Trading Strategy at Relentless 13 Capital and Corporate Advisor at Chronos Futures.
