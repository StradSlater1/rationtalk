Harris Will Campaign in Texas to Call Attention to Abortion Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/harris-texas-abortion-trump.html,"['', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'The vice president will head to Houston on Friday, hoping to use the issue to peel moderate voters away from Donald J. Trump, who is almost certain to win the state.', 'By Nicholas Nehamas', 'Reporting from Washington', 'Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Texas on Friday to campaign on abortion rights, an issue that has energized Democrats and that she hopes she can use to peel moderate voters away from former President Donald J. Trump.', 'Ms. Harris plans to hold a rally in Houston and also sit for an interview with the popular podcaster Brené Brown, a researcher who studies vulnerability. The interview will give the vice president access to a broad, nonpolitical audience that most likely includes many undecided voters.', 'Mr. Trump is almost certain to win Texas, which bans abortion in almost all circumstances, making the state among the most restrictive in the nation. In Houston, Ms. Harris will have a ready-made platform to castigate Mr. Trump — who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade — and to warn that a second Trump administration could threaten abortion access nationwide. She also has the chance to amplify the campaign of Representative Colin Allred, a Democrat challenging Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, in a race that has shown signs of being competitive.', '“We think this will obviously be a setting and a message that will reach a national audience,” said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to the Harris campaign. Her goal, he said, would be to “paint the picture of what could happen in this country — in the rest of the states — if Donald Trump is elected president.”', 'Ms. Harris’s decision to spend a day outside one of the top battleground states this close to Election Day reflects just how important reproductive rights have become in the race, which is breaking down along gender lines. Ms. Harris is receiving substantial support from women, while men favor Mr. Trump. She has campaigned hard on the issue in an effort to win over moderate Republican and independent women, especially in the suburbs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has tied himself in knots trying to avoid taking a firm position on the degree to which abortion should be restricted.', 'The Harris campaign has shared the stories of several Texas women who were denied medical care because of their state’s abortion ban, including Amanda Zurawski and Kate Cox.', '', '', '']"

But the focus was mainly to bring the spotlight back on reproductive rights — in the place Harris has called ""ground zero"" in the fight to restrict abortion rights in the country.', 'The Lone Star State may seem like an unusual stop with less than two weeks until voting closes — it is not a swing state and former President Donald Trump is all but certain to carry it. But Trump and Harris both campaigned there on Friday, and the messages they each brought to the state highlight the urgency of their closing themes.', '""I know sometimes in Texas, folks are like, \'Is it worth it? Doesn\'t make a difference,\'"" Harris said, nodding to the fact that she is unlikely to take this red state. ""You are making a difference. And momentum is on our side.""', ""Harris focused on Texas' strict abortion ban at her rally in Houston, as Democrats have spent years hammering Republicans over unpopular crackdowns on reproductive rights — to great success at the ballot box."", 'The rally featured dozens of OB-GYNs in white coats and women who told their personal stories about how their lives were endangered by abortion bans — and blaming Trump for the trauma.', '""This is not just some theoretical concept. Real harm has occurred in our country, a real suffering has occurred,"" Harris told reporters traveling with her on Friday.', 'Harris underscored that the kinds of restrictions seen in Texas could happen in any state if Republicans were to pass a national abortion ban. Trump said this month that he would veto such a ban.', 'Supporters look on as Harris at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston. The Harris campaign said 30,000 supporters were at the rally, her largest campaign event to date.', ""Harris was introduced by hometown superstar Beyoncé, whose song Freedom has been Harris' campaign anthem, and Kelly Rowland, who rose to fame with Beyoncé as part of the group Destiny's Child."", '""I’m not here as a politician. I’m here as a mother. A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in,"" Beyoncé said.', '""It’s time to sing a new song, a song that began 248 years ago,"" she said. ""The old notes of downfall, discord, despair no longer resonate.""', '', 'Former President Donald Trump gives remarks on border security inside an airplane hanger at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas, on Friday.', 'Trump started his Texas pit stop in Austin, where he largely focused on immigration, baselessly blaming Harris for crimes committed by undocumented migrants. ""Kamala refuses to stop importing these killers into our country. Every day she brings in more,"" Trump said. ""She\'s got no remorse at all for the innocent blood that\'s on her hands.""', 'At one point, he invited Alexis Nungaray to speak. Nungary is the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was allegedly killed by two men accused of entering the country illegally earlier this year.', 'Trump repeated inflammatory attacks against immigrants, calling America a ""garbage can for the rest of the world to dump the people that they don\'t want.""', 'He also criticized a federal judge\'s decision Friday to restore the voting rights of more than 1,600 people in Virginia who had been purged from the state\'s rolls, calling the ruling ""un-American"" and ""election interference.""', 'While in Texas, Trump taped a podcast with Joe Rogan, who has millions of followers and an audience overwhelmingly younger and more male — a key constituency for the former president. The interview lasted three hours, making Trump three hours late for a rally in Traverse City, Mich.', 'The interview touched on a wide range of topics — from Trump’s past appearances on The View and his years on The Apprentice to his thoughts on extraterrestrial life and whether he would bring Robert F. Kennedy into his administration.', 'Trump also spoke about tariffs, saying they’d be a better incentive to promote chip making in the U.S., rather than the federal subsidies that the Biden administration has promoted.', 'At one point, Trump was asked about his recent suggestion that the U.S. could eliminate income taxes altogether and replace them with tariffs. Pressed by Rogan on whether he was serious about that, Trump responded, ""Yeah, sure, but why not?""', ""Trump's media strategy this election cycle has relied heavily on these social media-friendly, male-heavy podcasts and influencers that largely eschew probing policy questions and paint the former president as a friendly, accessible figure."", 'The two appearances in Texas also underscore what could potentially be the largest gender gap in a recent presidential election, with Trump increasing support among men and Harris among women.', ""That gender split is reflected in the audiences each candidate will be reaching through interviews they held Friday. While Trump had Rogan, Harris spoke with Brené Brown's Unlocking Us, a podcast popular with women."", 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Ted Cruz, for a rally that will mark the duo's first joint appearance on the campaign trail this election cycle."", ""The surprise visit, Harris' first trip to Texas since she officially clinched the Democratic presidential nomination more than two months ago, comes in the closing weeks of a campaign that has seen the vice president largely focus her efforts on other states seen as more competitive. Her appearance with Allred signals national Democrats’ renewed interest in the Texas Senate race, which Democrats see as one of their few viable options to pick up a seat in the upper chamber."", 'The location of Harris’ rally has yet to be announced.

But Allred has fueled optimism among Democrats by consistently outraising Cruz and narrowing the polling gap in recent weeks, attracting multimillion-dollar investments from national Democratic groups and prompting two leading elections forecasters to shift their outlook for the contest from “Likely Republican” to “Lean Republican.”"", 'The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors.

""By supporting an abortion ban that makes no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother, Ted Cruz has put women at risk.""', ""Texas' abortion ban does contain an exception to save the life of the mother, though critics say the law's language is unclear and has led to women — some of whom Allred has featured in his ads — leaving the state to access life-saving care. Cruz, meanwhile, has repeatedly declined to say where he stands on the question of rape and incest exceptions, arguing the matter should be settled at the state level."", ""Allred's joint appearance with Harris comes after he has spent the last couple months generally keeping his distance from the vice president. He offered a cautious embrace of Harris' candidacy after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her, then briefly voiced his explicit support for Harris in a speech at the Democratic National Convention that otherwise focused on going after Cruz."", '', ""Allred has focused on courting moderate voters, seeking to portray himself as a centrist who would work across the aisle and take a stricter approach to border security and immigration than other Texas Democrats. Cruz has disputed the authenticity of Allred's moderate posture, often by tying him to Harris and the more liberal stances of the Biden-Harris administration."", 'Public polling has consistently shown Harris trailing Republican nominee Donald Trump by several percentage points in Texas, with the Allred-Cruz margin typically a few points closer.

Beyoncé has officially endorsed Kamala Harris. Will it matter?,https://www.vox.com/politics/380268/beyonce-kamala-harris-endorsement,"['The US presidential campaign is in its final weeks and we’re dedicated to helping you understand the stakes. In this election cycle, it’s more important than ever to provide context beyond the headlines. But in-depth reporting is costly, so to continue this vital work, we have an ambitious goal to add 5,000 new members.', 'We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'The superstar’s backing comes with massive reach and influence.', 'by Li Zhou', 'Beyoncé wasn’t just on the playlist at Vice President Kamala Harris’s Houston rally on Friday, she was also a special guest.', 'The question is just how much Beyoncé can help Harris. The rally in deep-red Texas comes as the vice president finds herself in a dead heat nationally (and in most swing states) against former President Donald Trump, and as Democrats’ Texas Senate candidate Colin Allred narrows the gap with his GOP rival, Sen. Ted Cruz.', 'Friday, Beyoncé became the latest influential celebrity to make a splashy endorsement of Harris — someone she’d already implicitly backed by allowing Harris to use a track from her album Lemonade as her campaign song. She joins the likes of Taylor Swift and Oprah, both of whom threw their weight behind the Harris campaign earlier this year, alongside other celebrities like Megan Thee Stallion, Quavo, and Charli XCX.', 'While celebrity endorsements haven’t necessarily been found to sway voters from one candidate to another, Beyoncé’s endorsement could motivate her fans to participate in the election. That could come in the form of increased voter registration, or higher turnout among young voters, women, and Black voters — all of whom are both key members of Beyoncé’s audience and critical Democratic constituencies that the party needs to show up in large numbers.', 'Given how closely contested this election has been, any advantage — including just the boost in attention from a Beyoncé endorsement — could prove important. More than others in recent memory, polls suggest this race could come down to small numbers of votes in key states.', '“Even though the effects are generally thought of as modest, in elections that turn on a small number of votes in a handful of swing states, any effect could be significant,” Bowling Green State University professor David J. Jackson previously told Vox.', 'Celebrity endorsements haven’t necessarily been found to persuade voters — though they can gin up enthusiasm among people who follow them.', 'Oprah Winfrey’s support of former President Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary is the rare example of a specific endorsement having a tangible, scientifically studied impact on candidate choice. According to a 2013 Northwestern University study, her endorsement — one of just a few political statements of support she’s made — translated to an uptick in turnout, donations, and approximately a million votes in favor of Obama.', 'A key caveat of that study is that it centered on a Democratic primary, when voters were choosing from candidates with the same party affiliation, rather than a general election, when candidates tend to have major partisan differences. Additionally, experts note that endorsements could provide voters with more useful information in a primary when there may be a broader mix of new and familiar options. In a general election, if the candidates are more well-established, endorsements could be less likely to offer novel insights.', '“That was a different environment because that was a primary election between Democrats where Oprah weighed in to that contest,” University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist Barry Burden previously told CBS 58, a regional affiliate in Wisconsin. “So everyone participating is essentially a Democrat or sympathetic to a Democrat and that’s where an endorsement could really matter.”', 'That case study, though, shows how a prominent celebrity could wield their cachet. They might strengthen a candidate’s connection with a specific age group or demographic, and they could help pique people’s interest.', '“If you suddenly see it in your social media feed or on TikTok or wherever, and see your favorite celebrity has done an interview or had a conversation with a politician, that politician is much more likely to get traction just by having that entry into people’s attention spans,” Josephine Harmon, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in London, previously told Northeastern Global News.', 'Beyoncé’s endorsement could bolster Harris’s credibility among her listeners and add to her appeal given the singer’s popularity and clout. A fan who was already leaning Democrat could be motivated to register to vote, or attend a rally, because of her endorsement.', 'Swift’s September endorsement made some of these effects clear. Following Swift’s Instagram endorsement of Harris, which urged people to register to vote, 406,000 people clicked on the link to Vote.gov, which directs people to different state voting websites. It’s not clear how many followed through with their registrations, but the spike in interest, alone, was notable.', 'Beyoncé, given her sizable following and reach (she boasts 314 million Instagram followers to Swift’s 283 million), could well have a comparable effect.', 'YOU’VE READ 1 ARTICLE IN THE LAST MONTH', 'Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

It’s a message that she’s championed as vice president after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And now, it was a message she was leaning into as she is locked into a razor-thin race against Republican Donald Trump.', 'With Texas as the backdrop, Harris called on voters to head to the ballot box to vote for her — and other Democrats — to help restore abortion protections. ', '“You are ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom,"" Harris told the crowd after global superstar Beyoncé Knowles-Carter introduced her to the crowd. ""We must be loud, we must organize, we must mobilize, we must energize the people.""', 'Beyoncé, a mother to three children, announced her support for Harris because she believes the vice president will bring progress to the country and give Americans the freedom to make their choice on their own bodies.', 'Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.', '""I\'m not here as a celebrity. I\'m not here as a politician. I\'m here as a mother,"" Beyoncé said, ""A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in, a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we\'re not divided.""', 'But Harris’ message comes as the divide among men and women — from how they view the state of the nation to which candidate they’re voting for — has grown wider. A majority of women (53%) back Harris while 36% back Trump, according to the the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll. Those numbers are almost identical to the amount of men who support Trump over Harris, 53% to 37%. ', 'And abortion and women’s rights don’t rank high with men — only 2% said it was their top issue — the poll found. For women, 17% said it was the most important policy. The economy and inflation were the most common top issue among both genders, but for a higher percentage of men.', 'President Joe Biden on Saturday told reporters that men who supported his candidacy and aren\'t supporting Harris are ""making a mistake in my humble opinion.""', 'Still in the sweltering and humid Texas heat hours before Harris took the stage, Gilbert Landry joined his wife, Karen, to witness Harris’ historic nomination.

He said Trump is appealing to men, and young Black men in particular, because he portrays an opportunity message.', '“There’s a lot of pressure on men. Period,” he said. “Especially men that don’t have the opportunities to stand up and do what they need to do for their own survivorship in this country.” ', 'But he believes that men need to “do their own thing” and learn more about the government to make an informed decision on who to vote for. ', 'Landry and his wife, Karen, also have two daughters and are concerned about the rights they have.', '“I don’t think the policy that Trump put in place and signed off on saying that you don’t have say-so about your bodies,” Karen said about the overturning of Roe v. Wade. “I don’t agree with that.”', 'In another line snaking around the stadium, Houston resident Joel Avendano was waiting to enter with his partner. Avendano, 40, said he believes that Harris can unify the country.', '“She’s here to unite us,” he said. That’s the main reason why men shouldn’t be afraid of voting for her. He also believes that women’s reproductive rights should matter to men.', '“Even women issues are men’s issues,” he said.', 'Rueben Butler, 65, of Houston, stood inside the arena waiting to see Harris, who he already early voted for days ago. ', 'Butler, donning a striped green and pink shirt to represent the sorority Harris is a part of, AKA, isn’t concerned with men moving away from the Democratic Party. The important thing to him is that they are informed about who they are voting for and the policies the candidates stand for.', '“Everybody is entitled to their own opinion and their own choices,” he said. “But don’t make it because you didn’t do any research. Don’t just be ignorant about it.”', 'While Harris made her pitch to women not just in the stadium, but to those watching online, that it’s time to pick a candidate who will protect women’s health, she also called on their husbands, fathers and brothers to do the same.', '“I see the men here, and I thank you,” Harris said during her rally. “The men in America don’t want this.”']"

', '“Texas, what we’re experiencing here is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of it,” Harris said. ', '“We know freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right, and we are prepared to fight for it,” she added. “We must be loud. We must organize. We must mobilize. We must energize.”', 'The largest event that Harris has held during her abbreviated run for president featured cameos from Houston native Beyoncè Knowles-Carter and Texas legend Willie Nelson.  ', ""Beyoncé sent the stadium into a frenzy when she took the stage with Kelly Rowland, who was in the group Destiny's Child with her.

"", '“Imagine our daughters growing up, seeing what’s possible, with no ceilings, no limitations,” she said, adding that she wanted a world where “my children and all of our children, we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we’re not divided.”', '“It’s time for America to sing a new song. Our voices sing a chorus of unity. They sing a song of dignity and opportunity. Are y’all ready to add your voice to the new American song?” she said to cheers before introducing Harris to the stage. ', 'With just 11 days left in the race and Democrats and Republicans competing to break through to voters, Harris’ team saw the Friday rally as a way to capture the attention of voters across the country. ', 'At the same time, the vice president used the event to underscore what she said is the serious choice for Americans at the ballot box, and that included sending former President Donald Trump a message for pushing through Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Choosing the red state of Texas as the stage for the event was meant to highlight that it has some of the most stringent laws restricting abortion in the nation. ', 'The evening was partly somber, focusing heavily on the subject of reproductive rights and first-person stories about how restrictive laws nearly caused women’s deaths — or had caused them. At one point taking the stage was a large group of doctors wearing white medical coats who said they were on the front lines of reproductive care.', 'They said women’s health was at stake and urged the crowd to vote. In between speakers, clips were played of Trump taking credit for the fall of Roe, which elicited boos. ', 'Harris’ team believes that the focus on reproductive rights also speaks to men, citing a campaign ad that tested well with men.', 'On Friday, Harris specifically called out men, saying they didn’t want to see their daughters or wives’ lives put at risk because of limited health care choices. ', '“I see the men here and I thank you!” Harris said. “The men of America don’t want this.” ', 'Harris at one point noted that Trump has refused to disclose his medical records but some places like Texas, after Roe was overturned, wanted to enact requirements that women must report if they have an abortion or miscarriage. ', '“Simply put, they are out of their minds!” Harris said. ', 'Part of the night was meant to shine a light on Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who is in a tight race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. ', 'Chants of “Beat Ted Cruz! Beat Ted Cruz!” erupted after the congressman asked the crowd for their vote. ', '“Everything is big in Texas, but Ted Cruz is too small for Texas,” he said to another crowd eruption. ', 'The tens of thousands streamed into the arena for hours and transformed the venue into a massive dance party, moving along to a DJ. The campaign estimated that roughly 30,000 people showed up. ', 'In the crowd, Vicki Lewis was wearing a red, white and blue shirt that read “Vote” in large letters. Lewis said her message to other voters was to vote early.', '“You have no right to be on the fence. You should already know. You should vote for who represents you and your future,” said Lewis, who already voted for Harris. She cited health care, reproductive rights and concern about her retirement. “I need somebody who is going to fight for me and represent me.”', 'She took issue with Trump bashing Harris and calling her “dumb.” ', '“She has a resume.

US presidential election updates: Joe Rogan and Beyoncé take centre stage as campaigns make final pitches,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/us-presidential-election-updates-joe-rogan-and-beyonce-take-centre-stage-as-campaigns-make-final-pitches,"['Donald Trump and Kamala Harris appear in Texas with just days to go until polls open in the 5 November 2024 presidential election', 'Kamala Harris and Donald Trump centred their attention on Texas on Friday, with both presidential candidates holding events there. In appearances on opposite sides of the staunchly Republican state, the nominees set out their contrasting visions for the country – with the content of their pitches underlining recent polling data which shows the gender gap among voters widening to historic levels.', 'In Houston, Harris was joined by Beyoncé, with the Democratic candidate telling the Texas crowd that they were “ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom”. She went on to call out Texas for having one of the most restrictive bans in the country, adding “now one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban”.', 'Meanwhile, an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan in Austin created another opportunity for Trump to highlight the hyper-masculine tone that has defined much of his 2024 White House bid. A Trump victory could hinge on men turning out to vote for the Republican nominee, according to Politico, which highlighted Rogan’s podcast as a good place to reach them. With an audience in the tens of millions, The Joe Rogan Experience has built a massive, mostly male, audience.', 'Here’s what else happened on Friday:', 'At the conclusion of her Houston rally, Harris called on voters to cast their ballots early. “Do we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America, and are we ready to fight for it?” Harris said, before concluding by saying, “When we fight, we win.”', 'In Houston, Beyoncé was joined by her former Destiny’s Child bandmate, Kelly Rowland, in front of an audience of 30,000 people. “I’m not here as a celebrity. I’m not here as a politician. I’m here as a mother,” Beyoncé said. “Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what’s possible with no ceilings, no limitations.”', 'While Beyoncé appealed to a younger crowd, 91-year-old Willie Nelson showed earlier in the event that he still has cachet in his native Texas. “Are we ready to say Madam President?” Nelson asked the crowd before launching into Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys, to which the audience sang along.', 'Colin Allred, the Democratic congressman running to unseat Texas senator Ted Cruz, used the rally to denounce his opponent. “I believe in a very different Texas than Ted Cruz does,” Allred said. “My time in Congress, I’ve been the exact opposite of Ted Cruz, because I never forgot where I came from, never forgot the folks who gave me a chance. He went on to lead the crowd in a chant of “You gotta lose your job.”', 'Tim Walz delivered a rousing pep talk in Scranton, Pennsylvania, telling voters the race was “going to be tight”. “It’s the fourth quarter. We have got the best team on the field,” Walz said. “We have got to do this one inch at a time, one yard at a time, one door at a time, one call at a time, one dollar at a time, one vote at a time.”', 'Donald Trump ran hours late to a rally in Michigan, causing thousands of his supporters to leave while others huddled in cold weather to await the former president at an outdoor rally in the battleground state. The Republican presidential nominee was delayed by his interview with Rogan, which stretched to three hours. In Michigan, Trump said “we’ve got a war going and she’s out partying,” a reference to Israel’s attacks on Iran.', 'Chinese government-linked hackers are believed to have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, as part of a larger breach of US telecommunications networks, according to a New York Times report. Investigators are working to determine what data, if any, was accessed by the “sophisticated” hack, sources said.', 'There was uproar and outrage among the Washington Post’s current and former staff and other notable figures in the world of American media after the newspaper’s leaders on Friday chose to not endorse any candidate in the US presidential election. The newspaper’s publisher, Will Lewis, announced on Friday that for the first time in over 30 years, the paper’s editorial board would not be endorsing a candidate in this year’s presidential election, nor in future presidential elections. The decision, according to some staffers and reporters, was allegedly made by the Post’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos.', 'Russian actors were behind a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania, US officials confirmed. The video had taken off on social media but was debunked within three hours by local election officials and law enforcement after members of the public reported it.', 'Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has called for the defence department to investigate a report that Elon Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Politico reports. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee, said “Elon Musk, who has billions in contracts that support some of our most sensitive military operations, reportedly has an open line to Putin.” Musk’s spacecraft company SpaceX has multiple contracts with the defence department and Nasa. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the billionaire has had previously unreported discussions with Putin since 2022.', 'A fresh group of “lifelong Republican” former aides to Donald Trump added their voices to the chorus of criticism of the Republican nominee, speaking out in support of John Kelly, who earlier this week called his old boss a fascist. “The revelations General Kelly brought forward are disturbing and shocking. But because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say,” a letter from more than a dozen staffers who worked in Trump’s administration says.', 'Read more about the 2024 US election:', 'Presidential poll tracker', 'Harris and Trump policies', 'What to know about early voting']"

Beyoncé brings star power to Harris rally in Texas with abortion law in the spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/beyonce-brings-star-power-to-harris-rally-in-texas-with-abortion-law-in-the-spotlight,"['Singer says America is on the ‘brink of history’ as Kamala Harris said Trump would seek to make state’s abortion ban nationwide', 'Beyoncé lent her star power to Kamala Harris at a high-octane rally in Texas on Friday, declaring that the America was on the “brink of history” as the vice-president warned the state’s near-total abortion ban could become the law of the land if Donald Trump is elected.', '“For all the men and women in this room, and watching around the country, we need you,” Beyoncé told a roaring crowd of 30,000 people at the open-air Shell Energy stadium in her native Houston.', 'With the presidential race effectively deadlocked, Harris detoured briefly from the seven battleground states to appear in deep-red Texas. Here in a place she called “ground zero for the fight for reproductive freedom”, Harris sought to lay out the stakes in November for voters who have yet to make up their minds about the candidates – or whether to cast a ballot at all.', '“Let us be clear: If Donald Trump wins again, he will ban abortion nationwide,” Harris told the audience, her largest to date. She walked on to the stage, as she has ever since she became the presumptive nominee roughly 100 days ago, to Beyoncé’s hard-charging anthem, Freedom.', 'Harris has framed her campaign on the theme of freedom, painting Trump as a threat to hard-won progress advancing personal liberties and to American democracy itself. Earlier this week, Harris agreed that Trump was a “fascist”.', 'The crowd that turned out for Harris on Friday night was exuberant. Thousands lined up for hours in the sticky Houston heat to attend. Rally-goers wore flashing wristbands in all different colors added to the concert-like atmosphere. A group of women in cowboy hats and boots danced and sang as a DJ spun pop ballads before the event began.', 'But the message Harris came to deliver was sobering. In her remarks, she detailed the cascading effects of abortion bans like the one in Texas, which prohibits physicians from performing abortions after cardiac activity is detected, as early as six weeks. Doctors were being driven out of states, leaving women, particularly in the south, with fewer healthcare options. But it wasn’t just Republican-led states at risk, she said, warning that a second Trump administration would seek to outlaw abortion in every state, even New York, Michigan and California, where it legal.', '“All that to say, elections matter,” she said.', 'Despite the speculation, the megastar did not perform, but she did offer her endorsement of Harris, a woman “standing in her power”.', '“I’m here as a mother,” Beyoncé said. A mother who cares deeply about the world my children, and all of our children, live in. A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies.”', 'In the final days before the election, the Harris campaign is tapping the star power of the party’s most popular figures and celebrity supporters. On Friday night, Willie Nelson, the country music star who was introduced as a “Texas voter”, performed a handful of his best-known songs, including On the Road Again and actor Jessica Alba urged women to vote. Beyoncé was joined by her mother, Tina Knowles, and her former bandmate Kelly Rowland, who gave a rousing call to action on Harris’s behalf.', '“We are grabbing back the pen from those who are trying to write an American story that would deny the right for women to make our own decisions about our bodies,” Rowland said. “Today that means grabbing that pen and casting my vote for Kamala Harris.”', 'The night before, Harris held her first campaign event with Barack Obama. They were joined onstage in Atlanta by rocker Bruce Springsteen, who played a three-song set and branded Trump an “American tyrant.” On Saturday, Harris will rally with Michelle Obama in Michigan.', 'Trump was also in Texas on Friday, where he taped a lengthy podcast interview with Joe Rogan. And, at an earlier stop, he repeated his assertion that migration had turned the US into a “garbage can for the world”. Before sitting for her own podcast interview with vulnerability researcher Brené Brown, Harris responded to Trump’s remark, calling it “another example of how he really belittles our country”.', 'Harris does not expect to win Texas. But Democrats here are suddenly hopeful after polls suggest an unexpectedly close senate race between the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, and the Democrat, Dallas-area congressman Colin Allred.', 'Senate Democrats face a daunting map this cycle. With a loss in West Virginia all but certain, and Montana slipping away, their hopes of maintaining narrow-control of the chamber increasingly rest on an upset in the Lone Star state.', 'In his remarks, Allred taunted his opponent for supporting Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which led to the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, and for fleeing to Cancún, Mexico, during a winter storm that devastated the state.', '“Everything is bigger in Texas. But Ted Cruz is too small for Texas,” Allred said, holding his hand low for emphasis.', 'The emotional heart of the evening was the personal stories of Texas women who had nearly died from pregnancy-related complications because they did not receive proper care.', 'Ondrea Cummings, a Texas woman who appeared in a new Harris campaign, became emotional as she shared her harrowing experience after a miscarriage at 16 weeks and needing an emergency abortion that she was denied under the state’s law. A video played before her remarks showed her with a wound and scars that stretched down her body, from her breast to her pelvis, after a six-hour surgery in which she said doctors had to cut open her torso in order to save her life.', '“Texas’ abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life and have left me with physical and emotional scars,” she said.', 'Amanda and Josh Zurawski, residents of Austin, Texas, also shared their story. At 18 weeks pregnant with a girl she planned to name Willow, Amanda Zurawski began to suffer complications and needed an abortion. There was no chance the fetus would survive, but doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy until she eventually developed sepsis, days later.', '“I was finally close enough to death to deserve healthcare in Texas,” said Amanda Zurawski, who has been a powerful surrogate for Harris on the campaign trail.', 'Todd Ivey, an OB-GYN in Houston, addressed the crowd surrounded by a team of doctors and medical professionals in white coats.

The 32-year-old said she considers herself an independent and in 2020, wrote in a candidate for president. But the political stakes changed, Gonzales said, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, and Texas enacted its near-total ban on abortion. She plans to vote for Harris in the 5 November election.', '“Being a woman in Texas right now, it’s not OK,” she said. “I should have freedom over my own body.”']"

The party is defending seats in close races across the country – and they have little if any margin for error.', 'Their slim hopes in the upper congressional chamber - gatekeeper for substantive legislation and responsible for confirming Supreme Court justices and senior presidential administration appointees - may hinge on their hopes of unseating Senator Ted Cruz in Texas.', 'Texas is certainly an unlikely place for Democrats to be placing their faith. A Democrat hasn’t won a contest there in three decades. The Lone Star State seems perennially just out of reach for Democrats, raising their hopes only to resoundingly dash them on election day.', 'The Texas government churns out a steady stream of right-wing policies on immigration, abortion, education and other hot-button cultural issues. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win there was Jimmy Carter in 1976.', 'Cruz is a two-term incumbent with a national network of support dating to his 2016 bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He won the Iowa caucuses that year with the backing of evangelical voters and went on to finish second behind Donald Trump.', 'The former corporate lawyer and Supreme Court clerk has built a reputation as a conservative firebrand in the Senate, pushing for government shutdowns to advance his political priorities and often engaging in heated exchanges in committee hearings and media appearances.', 'Despite all this, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is in Houston on Friday, holding a rally with the party’s Senate candidate, congressman Colin Allred.', 'And for the first time this campaign, she will appear alongside pop star Beyoncé, who will perform at the city’s Major League Soccer stadium.', 'It’s a notable investment in precious time and resources just over a week from election day. Public opinion polls, however, show a tight race between Allred and Cruz – within the margin of error in some surveys and markedly closer than the contest between Harris and Donald Trump in the state.', 'Allred, a three-term congressman from the Dallas area, is a former NFL player and college football standout at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He worked in the Obama administration before running for public office and is running as a political moderate.', 'Meanwhile Cruz, for all his political strengths, is not universally well liked even in conservative Texas. He defeated Democrat Beto O’Rourke by less than 3% when he ran for re-election in 2018.', 'And in 2021 he was criticised for travelling to Cancun, Mexico, while swathes of Texas had power outages due to a record-setting winter storm.', 'The matchup is enough to get Democratic hopes up – again.', 'At the Cactus Jack Cagle Community Center in Spring, Texas, on Thursday afternoon, a steady stream of Texans turned out to vote early in the 5 November election. Many said they were supporting Trump and Cruz, primarily because of the economy and their views on limiting undocumented migration. Those backing Harris in this northern Houston suburb were cautiously optimistic, however.', ""“Cruz is wishy-washy,” said Leona Fuller. “He called Trump all kinds of names [in the 2016 presidential race], and now all of a sudden, he's pro-Trump. You can't do that and expect to lead people and be effective in your leadership.”"", 'Floyd Guidry III, voting in his first election since turning 18, said he wrote a high school report on Allred’s policy proposals and was particularly drawn to his calls for criminal justice reform.', '“It’s time for change,” Floyd’s father, who came with him to vote, said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat.""', 'Many political experts, however, have their doubts.', 'Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, has the race rated at “likely Republican”.', '“Texas is going to be a toss-up state one day,” he said, citing demographic shifts as the state becomes younger and more diverse. “But I don’t see it happening for Democrats this year.”', 'If the Democrats want to hold control of the Senate, however, the opportunities to do so are few and far between.', 'They currently hold 51 seats in the 100-person chamber. If they win the presidency (a big if) they can only afford to lose one seat. If Trump wins, any net loss for the party will deliver the chamber to Republicans, with Vice-President JD Vance providing a tie-breaking vote.', 'The map for Democrats this year is bleak.', 'Thirty-four of the chamber’s 100 senators, who serve six-year terms, are up for election this year. Democrats are defending 23 seats – in part the result of the party’s overperformance in 2018 and 2012.', 'In three of those states – Ohio, Montana and West Virginia – Trump comfortably won in 2016 and 2020.', 'The West Virginia seat being vacated by centrist former Democrat Joe Manchin is a virtual lock to flip to the Republicans. In Montana, three-term incumbent Jon Tester has been trailing in the polls for months.', 'Five other Democratic-controlled seats are in states that are considered toss-ups in this year’s presidential race – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. In three of those states, Democratic incumbents are seeking re-election. In the other two, a new candidate is trying to replace an outgoing senator.', 'Meanwhile, most of the Republican-held seats on the ballot are in deeply conservative states like Mississippi, North Dakota and Wyoming. Only in Florida and Cruz’s Texas are Democrats anywhere near striking distance.', 'In another state, reliably conservative Nebraska, an independent candidate – Dan Osborne – is in a tight race with incumbent Republican Deb Fischer. It’s not certain, however, whether Osborne would vote to give the Democrats a functioning majority if he wins.', '“Sometimes in safe states you get incumbents who get lazy,” Mr Coleman said. “Deb Fischer hasn’t had a tough race since she was first elected.”', 'Of greater concern for Democrats is the fact that only once in the past two presidential election years – in Maine in 2020 - has a state voted for a president from one party and a senator from the other.', 'If that trend away from ticket-splitting continues, said Mr Coleman, Democrats have little hope. It could explain why the party is dedicating more resources to incumbents in battleground states, rather than supporting challengers in Republican-friendly Texas and Florida.', 'This week alone, the Democratic Senate majority leader’s political action committee spent more than $15m (£11.5m) in advertising for the Ohio and Pennsylvania races. In Texas, it spent $60,000.', '“If you look at how Democratic groups are spending their money,” said Mr Coleman, “they’re more interested in maximising the number of seats that they could hold after the election, rather than maximising their potential targets.”', 'The money the party has moved into Texas so far, he noted, is just a “drop in the bucket” in such a large state.', 'So then what are Harris – and Beyoncé – doing in Texas? According to Mr Coleman, it gives the Democrats a chance to place the national focus on to the state’s strict anti-abortion laws – an issue where polls show the party has a decided advantage over the Republicans.', 'And even if Allred doesn’t win, a strong showing against Cruz could help the state’s Democratic party build infrastructure that would allow them to be more competitive in the future.', 'That may not be what Texas Democrats longing for a win this year or party faithful looking to hold on to the Senate want to hear.', 'But it may be the cold, hard reality facing the party as election day approaches.', 'North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

Why Beyoncé's Harris rally appearance is sure to get under Trump's skin,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-harris-rally-texas-endorsement-trump-houston-rcna177281,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By Ari Melber', 'This is an adapted excerpt from the Oct. 24 episode of ""The Beat with Ari Melber.""', 'Presidential campaigns try to reach voters any way they can: rallies and news interviews for the faithful or ads, direct mail, and other methods to break through to people who don’t follow politics and news. ', 'Donald Trump has long used PR tactics and celebrity to burnish his brand and it’s clearly bothered him when those same celebrities and artists embrace his opponents over him. It’s something he has referenced in years of campaigning. ', 'Musicians and stars have long been part of presidential campaigns, but they matter even more now because they can directly reach their fans online.', '“We don’t need Jay-Z or Beyoncé,” Trump told a crowd in Michigan in 2016. “We don’t need Jon Bon Jovi. We don’t need Lady Gaga.”', 'However, this year, Trump was clearly rattled by losing the Taylor Swift endorsement to Kamala Harris, declaring afterward that he “hates” her — a kind of visceral response to rejection familiar to anyone with high school experience. Meanwhile, his eldest daughter appears to be a Swiftie, drawing new headlines and hitting a show during the campaign homestretch. ', 'Since entering the presidential race, Harris has snagged far more high-profile endorsements from entertainers than Trump. On Thursday, the vice president hosted a star-studded rally in Atlanta featuring Bruce Springsteen, Samuel L. Jackson, Spike Lee and Tyler Perry.', 'Musicians and stars have long been part of presidential campaigns but they matter even more now because they can directly reach their fans online. The Swift endorsement came with a call for voter registration that directly led to over 400,000 visits to Vote.gov in less than 24 hours. ', 'Earlier this week, Eminem rallied for Harris in Detroit, where he is far more popular than any politician. The vice president’s campaign hopes the endorsement will help boost turnout in the rapper’s hometown. ', 'The cultural and political impact of Beyoncé personally campaigning for Harris is widely understood as huge.', 'But one artist has loomed above virtually all others: Beyoncé. Her song “Freedom” became the Harris campaign’s anthem — with approval, of course. Beyoncé and her husband, Jay-Z, have backed Democrats before. In 2008, she had the special role of singing “At Last” at President Barack Obama’s first inaugural ball.', 'Despite allowing the vice president to use her music on the campaign trail, Beyoncé has not actually appeared with Harris yet. In August, rumors that she might perform at the Democratic National Convention upended political and pop culture news after the website TMZ said she would appear. Those rumors turned out to be false but the speculation ignited an instant frenzy.', 'The cultural and political impact of Beyoncé personally campaigning for Harris is widely understood as huge. She has more Instagram followers than Swift, with over 300 million. Her tours reveal a remarkably committed fan base — the new one, the “Renaissance World Tour,” reportedly boosted the U.S. economy by $4 billion. ', 'And now, after all the intrigue in this critical homestretch, the Harris campaign has announced Beyoncé will appear with Harris in person at a rally in her hometown of Houston on Friday. The appearance is already making headlines, prompting excitement that the campaign views as critical to its get-out-the-vote efforts around the country. Outlets are already slugging the news alongside other major campaign developments.', 'So as Beyoncé says in the theme song of the year, “I’ma keep running / ‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.” ', 'Ari Melber, an Emmy Award-winning journalist, writer and attorney, is the host of “The Beat with Ari Melber” airing nightly at 6 p.m. ET on MSNBC. He also serves as MSNBC’s chief legal correspondent and an NBC News legal analyst. Before joining MSNBC, Melber practiced First Amendment law and served as a legislative aide in the U.S. Senate.

Meanwhile, Trump showed off the scar on his ear from the assassin\'s bullet to podcaster Joe Rogan during a chat ranging from UFOs to JFK last night.

Imagine our grandmothers. Imagine what they feel right now—those who have lived to see this historic day.', '""Even those who are no longer physically with us, imagine all of their sacrifice—the sacrifices made so we can witness the strength of a woman standing in her power.""', ""An analysis of recent polling by the election website 538 released on Saturday gave Harris a 1.4-point lead in the popular vote, with 48 percent versus 46.6 percent for Trump.
