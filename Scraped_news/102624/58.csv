The game, until the first goal, was very even and we had more chances. The formation was 4-4-2 and I think we did well in the first half.”', '“It was a very even match, even in the first half. We played an intense first half. We lacked a bit of accuracy. We could have taken the lead and they scored two goals, which took the energy out of us. That’s when another match started. They had space, we risked at the back and they created a lot of chances for us. I liked the first half. We’re hurt, it’s a tough moment, but I want to thank the fans for their support. We don’t have to throw everything away, because there’s nothing to throw away. We have to forget the last 30 minutes. The season is very long, we don’t have to give up. We have to learn.

We’re not going to be far from last season.”', '“On August 23, the team played without energy and today they did. The problem is that when you concede two goals, you take risks. It’s normal. Taking risks against a team that is doing well is more dangerous than usual. If we had scored 1-2, it would have changed. There are problems that we have to solve. Today we had intensity in the first half and we started well in the second. But the goal changes everything.

With the lopsided loss, Real Madrid saw their 42-game unbeaten streak in LaLiga ended."", 'Veteran striker Lewandowski scored twice in three second-half minutes to set Barça on their way, with Yamal firing the third into the roof of the net and Raphinha lofting the fourth over the head of goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, who was filling in for injured Thibaut Courtois.', 'The win comes just three days after Barça trounced Bayern Munich 4-1 in the Champions League, and it moves them six points clear of rivals Madrid at the top of the LaLiga table after 11 games.', ""Madrid had not lost in the league since falling to Atlético Madrid at the beginning of last season, and even a draw here would have seen them draw level with Barça's LaLiga record 43-game unbeaten streak."", ""However, after a scoreless first half in which Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid wasted a slew of chances, Carlo Ancelotti's side were torn apart by a ruthless Barça side, whose incredible start to the season under new coach Hansi Flick continued at the home of their biggest rivals."", 'Here are the big talking points from El Clásico:', 'This was supposed to be the Clásico of Mbappé, his first since joining Madrid from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer in the biggest blockbuster move of the summer transfer window. He has always enjoyed playing Barça, scoring six times against them in four appearances with the French side, but his luck was out on Saturday.', 'An early miss, later ruled offside, set the tone for an evening of misses and offside calls. One of those calls was given after he thought he had opened the scoring, dinking the ball over Iñaki Peña, but VAR revealed he mistimed his run behind Iñigo Martínez.', 'In total, Mbappe was caught offside six times in the first half, more than any game previously in his career, before another two offside calls in the second half. His eight offside calls in a single game is tied for the most of any player in the last 15 LaLiga seasons.', ""His first official shot on goal didn't arrive until the 61st minute in the end. More followed, as well as another offside goal, but his finishing left something to be desired. Peña denied him on every occasion. He could have learned a thing or two from Lewandowski at the other end."", 'It has not been a disastrous start to his Madrid career by any means, but these are the games on which he was signed to have an impact.', 'He has eight goals in all competitions so far, but the feeling is Madrid fans are still waiting for him to click in a new-look attack alongside Vinícius Júnior and with Jude Bellingham behind.', 'There was palpable frustration from supporters as more offside calls followed in the second half and the game, perhaps fittingly, ended with another offside flag and another save from Peña as Mbappé raced through.', 'Barça fielded their second-youngest team in a Clásico fixture in 80 years and their youngest since 1956. The difference-maker, though, was 36-year-old Lewandowski, who wrestled the game away from Madrid with a masterclass in finishing at the start of the second half.', ""The Poland international, played onside by Ferland Mendy, finished brilliantly in the 54th minute after being played through by Marc Casadó and then, three minutes later, guided a superb header past Lunin from Alejandro Balde's left wing cross."", ""Lewandowski's form was criticised at times last season, but he has been brilliant under his former Bayern boss Flick. He has now netted 14 goals in LaLiga in just 11 appearances this season -- and 17 in all competitions. He is benefitting from staying more central, getting more of the ball in and around the area and letting the youngsters do the running around him."", 'It was one of the youngsters, 17-year-old Yamal, who took the game away from Madrid late on. Predominantly left-footed, he perhaps caught Madrid out by taking his chance early on his right foot, blazing the ball past Lunin as a stunned silence fell around the Bernabeu. In doing so, Yamal became the youngest scorer in the Clásico.', ""Raphinha, fresh from a midweek hat trick, added the fourth and Barça will look back at missed chances before Yamal's goal -- one absolutely glaring miss from Lewandowski especially -- and wonder if they might have scored even more on the night."", ""A theme of Barça's season has been their aggressive high line, along with their relentless pressing. Before the Clásico, they had the highest defensive line in LaLiga at 61 yards when the ball is in the opposition half. As a result, they have drawn over 70 offsides this season -- more than double any other side in the top five European leagues."", 'After coming though the Bayern test in midweek, the big question was whether they would pull it off against Madrid, Mbappé and Vinícius?', 'Ale Moreno pours praise on Hansi Flick and his young Barcelona team for demolishing rivals Real Madrid 4-0 away from home.', 'There were some hairy moments in the first half, not least the disallowed goal from Mbappé, but Pau Cubarsí and Martínez stuck to their task, stuck as close to the halfway line as possible and caught Madrid offside time and again. In the end, Los Blancos were offside 12 times in the game -- and eight in the first half alone.', 'The offside trap was helped by the relentless pressing in midfield and further forward from the likes of Casadó, Fermín López and Raphinha, with the former rewarded with an assist for the opening goal. It feels as if this team under Flick could go far now.', 'Whatever way you look at it, it was a disastrous night for Madrid. Not only did they lose their long unbeaten run and fall six points behind Barça in LaLiga, but they suffered their third-largest loss in LaLiga of all time. They have not suffered a larger defeat at home in the league since 1974.', ""It brings back to the the surface a number of issues that have been present throughout this season, even if they have often been papered over by brilliant individual displays, such as Vinícius' hat trick in the midweek comeback against Borussia Dortmund."", 'However, they deeply miss Toni Kroos. What Mbappé and Vinícius would do to have his passing in behind. There is still something lacking in attack, despite the obvious quality, and there is the Bellingham issue. He is without a goal in 11 games this season after registering a career-high 23 last term.', 'To cap it all off, with Courtois and David Alaba missing, they collapsed defensively in the second half.', 'The season is still young, and Madrid have a habit of peaking when it matters, but Ancelotti has work to do.', '', '', '']"

Then Yamal, becoming the youngest Clásico scorer at 17, and Raphinha completed the rout.', '""Until the goal, it was an even game,"" Ancelotti said. ""We had chances and could have scored, but we weren\'t clinical. When they score, it saps some energy from you and it becomes another game. They did a lot of damage on the counter.', '""I liked the first half, we have to follow that line. We don\'t have to throw everything away, we just have to forget the last 30 minutes. We can\'t give up, we just have to learn. We came out of the last defeat well against Atlético Madrid last season and we have to do the same. I am certain we will do better.""', 'Craig Burley sounds off on a nightmare second half from Real Madrid as they slump to a 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in El Clasico.', 'It proved a tough introduction to the Clásico for Kylian Mbappé, who had two goals ruled out for offside and missed a slew of chances.', ""In total, Mbappé was caught offside eight times -- tied for most in a LaLiga game in the past 15 seasons -- as Los Blancos, who had 12 offside calls in total, struggled to get in behind Barça's high line."", '""We took risks with his position,"" Ancelotti added of Mbappé\'s performance. ""They have a high line and due to fine margins we have not been able to take advantage of it. He has also had three or four chances and has not taken them when we need a little more.', '""The result doesn\'t reflect what happened on pitch. Barça go ahead and then the confidence that came from that changed the game. We took risks and they\'re a team in form who were dangerous on the break. The defeat worries me, but we have to pick ourselves up quickly. We have to keep fighting. We\'re not going to be that far away this season from what we did last season.""', 'The result capped a remarkable week for Barça, coming just four days after they demolished Bayern Munich 4-1 in the Champions League.', 'Under Flick they have now won 12 of 14 games in all competitions, but the German coach refused to get carried away.', '""We start the journey and we\'re doing really well,"" he said. ""Like I always say, we have to make things better and we do it also, but today was not easy. We keep going with our idea, we have a flow at the moment and we have to keep going.', '""I\'ve always said I\'m really happy to work for Barça and also to live in Barcelona. It\'s an amazing job, it\'s a new part of my life and it feels really good. Today we made a fantastic match and I\'m really proud about the team. And how we play is very important as well.', '""This will give the players more confidence. The celebration in the dressing room was good to see. Now we have a recovery day, then I give the players two days off and after the focus is on Espanyol next weekend.""', '', '', '']"

Three questions and three answers from Real Madrid 0-4 FC Barcelona,https://www.managingmadrid.com/2024/10/26/24280046/three-questions-and-three-answers-from-real-madrid-0-4-fc-barcelona-la-liga-2024,"['FILED UNDER:', 'A night to forget for Los Blancos', 'Real Madrid suffered a humiliating 4-0 home defeat to FC Barcelona to further condemn a disappointing start to the season, showing little sign of fight after going down to the opening goal from Robert Lewandowski early in the second half and then collapsing to another goal from the Pole, and strikes from Lamine Yamal and Raphinha.', '', '1. Would Carlo Ancelotti surprise everyone?', '“I have something in mind, but I don’t think it’s right to explain it to you today,” Carlo Ancelotti joked in his pre-match press conference. While the starting line-up seemed predictable to almost everyone, expecting a four-man midfield, it opened the door to a possible surprise from the coach. In the end, there wasn’t any surprise. The line-up was exactly as everyone had expected, despite some suggestions that Ancelotti could experiment with the back line, and Barcelona also set out a team that was just as everyone had expected. This was a match-up of talent on the field, rather than tinkering from the coaches. Perhaps Ancelotti should’ve made some changes to what was expected. Lucas Vázquez has looked defensively vulnerable since replacing Dani Carvajal and Barcelona exploited that, without any additional protection. This isn’t the first time Ancelotti has been outsmarted tactically, and his frustration at the final whistle showed.', '2. How would Kylian Mbappé play in his first Clásico?', 'Even before Saturday night, Kylian Mbappé was no stranger to taking on FC Barcelona after scoring six goals in four games against the Catalans with Paris Saint-Germain, but this was his first Clásico in the white of Real Madrid. On the night, he thought he’d made the difference and got the opening goal before VAR ruled him offside, but it didn’t count for anything and he had only 27 touches in the 90 minutes, the lowest of any outfield player to last the full 90 minutes. Mbappé’s arrival has been underwhelming, and the failure to capitalise on his 0.58 xG here further adds to that feeling that he is yet to show his world class quality since arriving in La Liga.', '3. Would Andriy Lunin be able to fill Thibaut Courtois’ shoes?', 'With an unexpected injury to Thibaut Courtois against Borussia Dortmund in midweek, Andriy Lunin was thrown into the spotlight for this game as he became the number one between the sticks. Injury to Courtois is no longer the cause for panic that it once was, but any change from the best goalkeeper in the world is always going to be a downgrade for Real Madrid and in games like this one, fine margins can make all the difference. Those fine margins are visible in both the third and fourth goals. Perhaps Courtois wouldn’t have been able to do much more with the first two, but Lunin was beaten at his near post by Lamine Yamal and then rushed out for Raphinha’s goal. A world class goalkeeper could’ve made a substantial difference, even if the main mistakes lie in the defence.', '', '1. Is the title race over?', 'It’s very early to be talking about a title race being over, but Barcelona now sit six points, a head-to-head 4-0 victory, and 17 goals on goal difference ahead. With 27 games to go, there’s plenty to play for, but it’s not looking pretty for Real Madrid. The team has not looked comfortable all season, frustration is beginning to boil over as shown by the whistles and boos of Mbappé from certain sections of the Bernabéu, and it’s hard to imagine that things are going to get better before they get worse. Bottom-placed Valencia, Osasuna, Leganés and Getafe are as kind a next few fixtures as Real Madrid could hope for in La Liga, and the failure to take maximum points from those four games could see the season over well before the halfway point.', '2. Is Lucas Vázquez the solution at right-back?', 'Lucas Vázquez has long been a reliable back-up for Real Madrid and filled in at right-back whenever needed, but his performances in the three games since Dani Carvajal’s injury have been concerning to say the least. He captained the team in his 19th Clásico, but won only three of his eight duels, completed only 77% of his passes, and was easily beaten for pace too often by Raphinha on the left flank of Barcelona’s attack. In fairness to Lucas, it wasn’t his fault. His physical shape wasn’t up to this battle and he couldn’t keep up with his rivals. This one could easily be pinned on Ancelotti. But if Ancelotti is to consider his options, what are his alternatives in this squad? Éder Militão has not played there in many years, nor has Antonio Rüdiger, and the options from Castilla are not good enough for Primera.', '3. When does patience run out with Kylian Mbappé?', 'For the first time, the Bernabéu began to show signs of frustration with Kylian Mbappé. As a super star, he suffers from the same burden as David Beckham and other Galácticos before him. He arrives with a reputation and a wage slip which is hard to justify, and anything but the best will fail to live up to those standards. It’s true, it’s incredibly harsh to question a player with eight goals in 14 games, but he has now underscored his expected goals by 1.74 xG this season. That’s not what is expected by Real Madrid from a marquee signing and a world class player. Whistles and boos of Real Madrid’s own players are not uncommon during a sticky run of form, but in Mbappé’s case there is work to do to turn this around as the likes of Vinícius Júnior turn up, while he continues to go missing on the big occasions like Saturday night’s Clásico at the Bernabéu.', '', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

However, the match ended up being one that Mbappe would want to put out of his mind quickly."", ""Not only did Barcelona thrash Real Madrid 4-0, the Frenchman himself had a forgettable outing.

Halloween came early to the Bernabeu.”', 'A reminder also that Real Madrid’s unbeaten La Liga run has come to an ignominious end. They made it 42 matches unbeaten, but that’s one shy of Barcelona’s record of 43, set between 2017 and 2018. Hey, nothing lasts forever, and if you’re going to come up painfully short, you may as well do so in style.', 'A dream clásico for Barcelona! They extend their lead over Real Madrid at the top of the table to six points, and make huge goal-difference gains as well. This isn’t their biggest win at the Bearnabeu – they won 5-0 in 1974 – but it’s big enough, though given the chances spurned by Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, it could easily have been more. Much more. Having said that, Kylian Mbappé had plenty of good opportunities as well, but a combination of the Barca offside trap and a none-shall-pass performance from Iñaki Peña kept Real’s star man out. On this evidence, Barca look a shoo-in for La Liga already, even though we’re just 11 games in. They might take some beating in the Champions League as well. What a performance!', 'It’s a rout. It could have been more.', '90 min +1: Incidentally, Gavi was booked a couple of minutes ago for wrestling with Vinicius, who was risking a second yellow himself. A red card really would put the tin lid on it for Real.', '90 min: Mbappe shoots. Pena parries. The offside flag pops up. This is getting old. Thankfully for Real, there are only two extra minutes to play.', '89 min: Carlo Ancelotti wasn’t happy with the Barcelona celebrations, and went over to Hansi Flick, wagging his finger in the headmaster/policeman style. Flick was at pains to calm his opposite number down, palms front-facing.', '88 min: Lewandowski delivers a low cross from the left for Raphinha, who can’t get a shot away from six yards. Modric nips in to stop a certain fifth. From the resulting corner, Olmo blazes over the bar.', '87 min: It all calms down, allowing both teams to make a change. Garcia comes on for Mendy, then Gavi replaces Pedri.', '86 min: A brouhaha in the dugouts as the Barca squad celebrate this rout, the hosts not taking things well. At all.', 'This is too easy for Barca now. Martinez launches a long ball down the middle. Vazquez is ahead of Raphinha, but the winger sprints past the dozing defender, and having got in ahead, gently wedges over the out-rushing keeper and into the net. Lovely finish, comically poor defending.', '83 min: Valverde creams a low drive towards the bottom-left corner, but Pena has refused to be beaten in one-on-ones with Mbappe, and he’s not going to be beaten by that.', '82 min: Vinicius slaloms past Kounde and Cubarsi, entering the box from the left only to be relieved of possession by Martinez’s last-ditch lunge. Great football all round. Then Pena is needlessly booked for unnecessary flapping of neck.', '80 min: Vinicius is booked for a frustrated and petulant clip on the heel of Pedri. He’s not happy with the referee, but can have little complaint.', '79 min: That’s Yamal’s first clásico goal. It won’t be his last.', 'This is an outrageous finish. Raphinha drives hard, left to right. He slips the ball to Yamal, who steps into the box down the inside-right channel. He looks to have taken himself a little too far wide right, but that’s not a problem, as he lashes a vicious rising shot into the top-right corner. Lunin with no chance, such was the velocity of that strike! What a goal.', '76 min: Militao wins the ball off Olmo in the midfield and attempts to lob Pena from inside his own half. The arcing hoof sails wide left. Then Brahim comes on for Camavinga.', '75 min: Martinez high-kicks Militao in the chest, and has the chutzpah to complain about the yellow card he receives.', '73 min: Lunin clanks a clearance straight to Balde, 30 yards out, and the Real keeper is extremely fortunate the Barca defender doesn’t launch an immediate attack. Barca get patient and Real get away with one.', '71 min: Modric sends Mbappe clear down the middle. The usual story unfolds: Pena saves the shot; the flag pops up for offside anyway. No idea how this match is still 0-2. It could be 0-4 or 2-2 or 4-4 or 4-2 or anything either side or in between.', '69 min: Kounde is booked for a late flip on Vinicius, out on the left flank. Modric takes the free kick, and finds Bellingham, free, six yards out. He’s onside, having timed his spurt forward to perfection, but miscontrols and bundles the ball wide left of the target. A huge chance to haul Real back into contention goes begging.', '68 min: This one would have counted, though! It’s Yamal out on the left again. He crosses low. Lewandowski leans back and larrups a shot over the bar. What a miss! This game should be done and dusted.', '67 min: … but no, that’s all academic, too, because turns out Yamal was just offside in the build-up.', '66 min: Lewandowski misses an open goal! Yamal sprints down the left and squares a pass to tee up his pal, eight yards out. Lewandowski opens his body and steers towards the bottom right, but this time gives it too much, and the ball pings off the outside of the post and out. He’ll not get an easier chance to complete his hat-trick tonight! Could that end up costing Barca certain victory?', '66 min: Mbappe sashays down the right, enters the box, and lashes an unstoppable shot across Pena and into the bottom left. But he doesn’t bother celebrating, because he knows full well he’s a mile offside. And then, up the other end …', '65 min: Olmo comes on for Casado.', '64 min: Something nearly happens quickly for Madrid. Mbappe is sent clear down the middle, the offside trap circumvented, but he stabs his shot straight at Pena. Modric tries to return the rebound into the unguarded net, but shanks it wide.', '63 min: Real need something to happen quickly, and so here comes Modric. He replaces Tchouameni.', '62 min: If this match were to end now, the top of the table would look like this …', '… while Real’s unbeaten La Liga run would end at 42 matches. One shy of Barcelona’s record, set between 2017 and 2018. It’s going pretty well for the Catalans right now.', '61 min: Another corner for Real, Vinicius winning it out on the left. It’s worked out to Mbappe, after a fashion. He sends a weak bobbler towards the bottom left. Easy for Pena.', '59 min: Valverde swings a free kick into the Barca mixer from the left. Who rises to bash a header clear? Lewandowski.', '58 min: Real, along with nearly everyone else in the Bernabeu, can’t believe what’s just happened. A big double-whammy is what’s just happened. The hosts try to bounce back by winning a couple of corners, but the Barca defence deals with them easily enough.', 'It’s two in two minutes for Lewandowski! Balde, tight on the left touchline, swipes a delightful cross into the box. It drops exactly onto Lewandowski’s head, six yards out. Lewandowski gives it the glancing eyebrows, and steers a brilliant header across Lunin and in!', '56 min: It was tight, but Mendy was playing the Barca striker on. The Bernabeu stunned. And not half, because now …', '55 min: Real Madrid’s offside trap not quite as fit for purpose as Barcelona’s, then.', 'Lewandowski is sent clear down the middle by Casado’s simple defence-splitting pass. He’s got all the time in the world to size up the situation on the edge of the box. He lines himself up and dispatches a low drive into the bottom-right.

Bellingham tries to meet the set piece, but falls over, claiming he’s been impeded. The referee shows no interest.', '51 min: Yamal tries to beat Lunin from the centre circle. Full marks for ambition if nothing else. An easy gather for Lunin.', '50 min: Raphinha, quarterbacking from deep, launches long down the middle for Lewandowski, who is denied by Lunin, the keeper racing from his box to clear. The hosts haven’t started this half particularly well.', '49 min: Vazquez dinks a cross in from the right. Mbappe, initially in space to the left of the D, takes an uncharacteristically clunky touch and can’t get a shot away, but his presence is enough to force a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. A fairly scrappy start to the second period.', '47 min: Kounde receives the ball this time, out on the right. His cross nearly finds Lewandowski in the middle, but Militao reads the danger and nips in to head clear.', '46 min: The first act of the half, and under no pressure whatsoever, Casado sends a simple pass towards Kounde out of play. Onwards and upwards.', 'Barca get the second half going. They’ve made a change, replacing Lopez with De Jong.', 'Half-time entertainment. There’s top-of-the-table action going on everywhere.', 'Some reasonably entertaining attacking by both sides, and an offside-trap masterclass from Barca.', '45 min: The corner’s a waste of time. There will be two additional first-half minutes.', '44 min: Bellingham slides a pass down the right towards Mbappe, forcing Martinez to whack out for a corner. Vazquez to take.', '43 min: Vinicius spins Casado deep inside his own territory, but isn’t able to start a counter as the Barca man brings him down. Casado goes into the book.', '41 min: Lamal, calling the shots from deep, very nearly threads a ball down the inside-left channel to release Raphinha clear on goal. Rudiger reads the situation expertly to intercept. Typically, the game being goalless, that move wouldn’t have been offside.', '40 min: Some pinball on the edge of the Real box suddenly releases Lewandowski into the area down the right. Lewandowski whistles a fierce rising shot wide and high, then the flag goes up for offside. I hope George Graham is watching this match, he’ll be in hog heaven.', '38 min: Bellingham slides in late on Casado and is fortunate not to be shown a yellow card. It looked for a second like the referee was going to produce one, running up to the player in determined fashion, but in the end a finger-wagging lecture sufficed.', '36 min: Vinicius is caught offside down the left. That’s the eighth time Real have been flagged off. “I think on 19 minutes you meant: ‘Hansi Flick delivering a PHD level coaching refresher class in playing a high line to Postecoglou’,” writes Ben Barclay, for whom recent events are very much his friend. I admit defeat.', '35 min: Lewandowski goes down in the environs of Rudiger. Not sure what happened, but he’s not happy. A sly knee in the coccyx? Ooyah, oof. The striker’s fine after some regenerative rolling about.']"

Barcelona played the clásico atop a high-wire, a fearless plan executed with perfect precision, and finished at the top of the table, six points clear. Three days after scoring four against Bayern Munich to exorcise European ghosts, Hansi Flick’s team came to the Santiago Bernabéu and scored four more, their wonderful week complete. Robert Lewandowski, at 36, got two; then Lamine Yamal, 19 years his junior, became the youngest ever to score in this fixture; before Raphinha lifted in the last, history written.', 'The risk Barcelona supposedly ran was the one that undid Madrid, players in blue and red streaming into the space behind that line of white, Carlo Ancelotti’s team sliced apart by a team that started with six under-21s. “There are games in Germany they call clásicos but it’s not the same,” Flick had said, and he was right. And yet even the real one isn’t always quite like this; what the German described as “the start of a journey” was as good as it gets. It also ended Madrid’s unbeaten run at 42, conserving a record for his new club.', 'Kylian Mbappé’s was not: he had three shots without scoring, chances wasted, his big moment missed, and that’s just the ones that counted in the stats: repeatedly caught in an expertly laid trap, there were many more that did not, including the two times he “scored”.', 'That so much attention had been on Flick’s offside trap was justified; less justified was that it had been considered reckless rather than genius, his philosophy a central feature of this clásico and Barcelona’s success. The team that apply the highest line in Europe, forcing more than twice the offsides of anyone on the continent, did it again.', 'That speaks to the coordination, bravery too; it also comes with risks, especially against forwards as fast as Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior, and that was played out immediately, Mbappé dashing clear after just 85 seconds.

Madrid had been caught offside six times inside half an hour of an enjoyable, wildly open game. By the end, that figure was 12.', 'It wasn’t entirely one way, either: an outrageous back-heeled assist from Lewandowski sent Lamine Yamal clean through but he scuffed the shot – he might have been offside too – Raphinha fired high, Iñigo Martínez headed over and Andriy Lunin saved from Pedri.', 'And then, on 30 minutes Mbappé scored, dashing through to lift it int the net. VAR called him offside, though; it was the fifth time he had been caught. Instead, it was Barcelona who found a way through into the space beyond to open the scoring. Madrid’s line was broken by Ferland Mendy – it’s not so easy, see? – and Lewandowski was ready, arching and timing his run the way Mbappé had not, to curl in a superb low finish.', 'Sign up to Football Daily', ""Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football"", '', 'Two minutes later, Lewandowski scored again, heading in Alejandro Balde’s cross.

Onside this time, he was denied by Peña. Soon after he dashed clear again but, knowing that he was offside, his shot lacked conviction. Madrid were in pieces, lacking in a plan. A mad, open game would have suited them but Barcelona weren’t prepared to give it to them; instead, they took advantage of Madrid’s search for it, one long ball seeing Raphinha sprint into space and lay on into the path of Lamine Yamal to smash into the roof of the net and another allowing him to lift over Peña to end it.', 'There was just time for Mbappé to run free once more.

Los Blancos have now fallen six points behind their rivals in La Liga play as the Hansi Flick era at Barcelona couldn't have gotten off to a better start. After Real Madrid had a mentally exhausting match against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League midweek, some regression was expected but not to this degree."", ""In the first half, it felt like Los Blancos would be the side more likely to break down Barcelona but the introduction of Frenkie de Jong at half was a masterstroke from Flick to get the game going. Real Madrid weren't able to respond, leading to the loss, but it's one that could send ripple effects. Here are takeaways from the match:"", ""From scoring a goal that felt like it happened in slow motion to then celebrating by showing his braces to Santiago Bernabeu Lamine crowd, Yamal has the it factor but now he also has another record to his name. At 17, he became the youngest player ever to score in El Clasico. Already a key player for Barcelona and Spain, he's got six goals and six assists on the season and he's loving life under Hansi Flick as Barcelona are evolving back into being a true global superpower team."", 'LAMINE YAMAL BECOMES THE YOUNGEST PLAYER TO EVER SCORE IN THE HISTORY OF ELCLÁSICO!!!\n\nBARCA ARE 3-0 UP ON REAL MADRID AT THE BERNABEU 😳 pic.twitter.com/ykIvehYUaU', ""Yamal isn't even the only teenager in the squad performing, he's just leading the charge. Pau Cubarsi had another strong performance in defense to help keep a clean sheet while four 21-year-olds started and made an impact. Xavi Hernandez helped bring these young players into the first team but Flick is pushing them forward to unlock their next levels."", ""Kylian Mbappe's first Clasico was one to forget and not just because of the result. Mbappe took three shots, putting them all on target but none of them particularly troubled Inaki Pena in the Barcelona net. The Frenchman was unable to get into a proper flow and if he did get the ball into the back of the net, the offside flag was raised to deny him of glory. Caught offside eight times, Mbappe couldn't adjust to Barcelona's high line when his team needed him the most. "", ""Mbappe has eight goals and two assists in all competitions for Real Madrid but as a marquee signing for a team of their stature, he has to show up in the biggest games possible. Not performing in his first Clasico doesn't mean that Mbappe won't perform for Los Blancos, but it's not something that can become a trend for the Frenchman. "", ""With his brace in the match, Lewandowski became the highest-scoring player in all of Europe's top five leagues in all competitions netting his 17th goal to go along with two assists. Raphinha also kept his hot form going and Barcelona finished a week that also saw them defeat Bayern Munich."", ""ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI WITH A WORLD CLASS HEADER FOR HIS SECOND GOAL IN JUST A FEW MINUTES!\n\nHE'S SINGLEHANDEDLY GIVEN BARCA A 2-0 LEAD IN ELCLÁSICO 🔥 pic.twitter.com/mQQDuLeCQy"", ""This is what world-class teams do but it's what Barcelona haven't been able to do until recently. Flick's tactics and the team returning to health at the right time keep Barcelona moving forward.
