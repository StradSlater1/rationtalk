NASCAR Miami Odds: Who’s the Favorite in South Beach for the Straight Talk Wireless 400?,https://www.bleachernation.com/betting/2024/10/26/nascar-miami-odds-bets/,"['Some links on this page are affiliate links, meaning we may earn a commission if you click and buy. This helps keep the great content coming! We only recommend products we believe in.', 'The NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs continue from Homestead-Miami where “wall ripping” is the fastest way around and tire preservation is key. So before they take the green flag for the Round of 8’s penultimate race, let’s take a look at the post-qualifying NASCAR Miami odds and who the books think will be partying on South Beach afterward.', 'Homestead-Miami Speedway is a 1.5-mile long track and is possibly the most unique among the track type. Not only does the track eat tires alive, at a much faster rate than all other similar tracks, but its preferred line on the wall, is closer to what we see at Darlington than any other 1.5-mile track. This makes practice here very important as teams test their race pace and if their car is able to rip the wall like the best at that skill.', 'Watch the Straight Talk Wireless 400 from Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday, October 27th starting at 2:30 PM ET on NBC. Subscribe to fuboTV or check your current cable/satellite TV subscriber to catch the action.', 'Topping the group of drivers who stand out here are Kyle Larson and Tyler Reddick who are known for their ability to wall ride. Reddick had the fastest single-lap speed and kept the pace up finishing top-4 in every 10-lap or more average in his session. Larson meanwhile, was good, not great during Group B’s 20 minutes, but he’ll be fine come race day. The big surprise of practice was Noah Gragson, who topped the charts from 10-lap to 30-lap averages despite posting just the 11th fastest single-lap speed. ', 'Qualifying saw many of the fast cars in practice impressing with the two pre-qualifying favorites on the front row. Grabbing the Straight Talk Wireless 400 pole by almost a full tenth over Kyle Larson was Tyler Reddick with a 32.248-second lap. He’ll have the ever-important no.1 pit stall for the 23XI driver’s must-win race.', 'Joining the two favorites near the front are JGR teammates, and fellow NASCAR Playoffs drivers Christopher Bell and Denny Hamlin on row 2. Qualifying wasn’t without its surprises, as Ricky Stenhouse Jr and Daniel Hemric grabbed their 2nd, with Justin Haley his first, starting spot inside the top 10 this year. The practice and qualifying sessions had a decent impact on the NASCAR Miami odds so let’s take a look at the updated outright numbers.   ', 'Much like last week with my South Point 400 bets, I already have exposure to some of the best cars at better prices than currently available. This makes finding value with the post-qualifying NASCAR Miami odds difficult but we only have three races left and scared money doesn’t win money. So I’ve shopped the board and found my favorite current Straight Talk Wireless 400 markets to hit.', 'I bet this before cars hit the track for practice and qualifying at +400 and despite what I saw in practice, I’m doubling down. Yes, Noah Gragson and Chase Briscoe were awesome in practice, and they along with A.J. Allmendinger have nice histories in South Beach themselves. But Dillon’s resume and affinity for Homestead-Miami speak for themself.', 'AD3 has run 10 Cup Series races in Miami and his only finish worse than 14th came in his first race in NASCAR’s top level. Dillon is also no stranger to starting back in the pack here, and still having success. He finished 4th after starting 32nd in 2022 and has an average finish of 8.7 in the seven races he’s started 16th or worse since 2016.', 'Austin clearly has a TON of ground to make up here, and this could simply be dead as the green flag drops. However, if we believe some drivers are made for certain tracks, and tracks for drivers, this definitely fits the mold.

Who will join Logano in vying for the championship? Or will someone play spoiler? We’ll cover it all with our NASCAR best bets for the week.', ' ', 'In addition to Logano stealing a spot in the championship 4, Vegas was a nightmare for multiple playoff drivers. Tyler Reddick went for a flip in the infield with Chase Elliott involved as well. Defending series champion Ryan Blaney also crashed while Denny Hamlin had trouble in the pits and failed to score any stage points.', '', 'These four now face an uphill battle of advancing, sitting at least 27 points out of the top four, meaning a win will likely be necessary. Which of these four has the best shot to win and should be backed in online betting?', 'That honor clearly goes to Reddick, who has been downright phenomenal at Homestead. While yet to win a Cup race, he has three top-fives in four starts and has two wins in the Xfinity Series. The playoffs have been a disaster for the regular season champ, with his lone top-10 coming at the opener in Atlanta.', 'In spite of that, we are going to pick Reddick for the win at +700, posing great value. Homestead comes at the perfect time as Reddick’s season hangs in the balance. And with that said, we are throwing a low-stakes wager on his +1000 NASCAR futures odds to win the series championship.', 'Meanwhile, Homestead has not been particularly kind to the other three. While Blaney had a runner-up finish last year en route to the championship, he only has one other top-10 since 2017. Elliott’s most recent top-10 came back in 2020, en route to his own championship. Hamlin won that 2020 race, but his next best finish since 2017 is seventh.', 'Fade these three drivers with your NASCAR picks as their championship hopes come to a close.', 'NASCAR Pick: Tyler Reddick +700 to win the Straight Talk Wireless 400.', ' ', 'After Vegas, Kyle Larson, William Byron and Christopher Bell all sit comfortably above the cutline. Larson is the favorite and in three Homestead races since missing in 2020, he has one win and another top-five, though he crashed out last season. While he looked poised to dominate last week, he fell multiple laps down after even worse pit road woes than Hamlin.', 'When Larson is good, he is good, but his only non-drafting oval top-10 in the playoffs was his win at Bristol. We are surprised that NASCAR oddsmakers have him as such a strong favorite. We much prefer his Hendrick Motorsports teammate in Byron, who has quietly been red-hot of late.', 'While he hasn’t won since Martinsville in April, Willy B has four-straight top-fives, all on different kinds of tracks. While not one of his best tracks, he has been solid at Homestead, winning in 2021 and adding a fourth last season. He has incredibly appealing odds to win at +700, but we will bet on his top-five streak continuing at +125 for our NASCAR predictions.', 'As for Bell, his charge to the lead ran out of laps at Vegas, narrowly missing the coveted spot in the championship 4. Though he did win this race last season, Homestead hasn’t been one of his best, with only one other top-10 in three starts. We are only comfortable picking Bell for a top-10, but his -280 odds aren’t appealing enough.', 'NASCAR Top-5 Pick: William Byron +125', ' ', 'Join BetUS and bet now! Get a $450 NASCAR Bonus Available for $200 Bets on your first time deposit!', ' ', 'Now that we’ve covered the playoff field, let’s see which of the remaining drivers pose a strong top-10 value. Martin Truex Jr. made good on our pick last week, just his second top-10 in his last 12 races. Though his NASCAR lines sit at -125, we are confident in Truex’s consistency at Homestead, with five top-10s in his last seven starts.', 'The disastrous year for Richard Childress Racing has been well-documented, though they showed some signs of life late in the regular season. But we are actually in on both Kyle Busch and Austin Dillon for a top-10 this week.', 'While it seems Busch’s record of 19 straight seasons with a win will be snapped, Homestead is one of his best tracks, with six-straight top-10 finishes prior to 2023. Even though he has cooled off considerably from his four-race top-10 streak, including nearly two wins, we will bet on Busch’s history at +120.', 'Dillon has also cooled off following his stunning and controversial win at Richmond, scoring just one top-10 in the 10 races since. But Homestead might be his best track, outside of Richmond. Dating back to 2017, Dillon has four top-10s in seven starts. But even when he was outside the top-10, he finished no worse than 12th.', 'Despite his struggles this season, Dillon always seems to find his way toward the top-10 at Homestead and we think his +360 odds makes for a great low-stakes pick in NASCAR prop betting.', 'NASCAR Top-10 Picks: Martin Truex Jr. -125; Kyle Busch +120; Austin Dillon +360', ' ', 'Odds and information are accurate at the time of writing.

Its old surface age means it’s abrasive on the tires and causes plenty of tire wear, much like Darlington, which is Homestead’s best comparable track.', 'Much like Darlington, being able to analyze long-run speed in practice is key to a successful DFS day.', 'Before we jump into my picks, don’t forget all my NASCAR projections can be found in the NASCAR Models on FantasyLabs, complete with floor, ceiling, median, and ownership projections.', 'Let’s not skip the best part — my Perfect% metric — a metric that tells you how often certain racers appear in the optimal lineup when running 10,000 race simulations.', 'And don’t forget about the tools that FantasyLabs has to offer, like our Lineup Optimizer to effortlessly create up to 300 lineups, or our Lineup Builder if you like to hand-build your lineups.', 'Here are my NASCAR DFS picks for the Straight Talk Wireless 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.', 'Homestead DraftKings DFS Cash Game Picks', 'Kyle Larson ($11,000): Larson has led 40% of all laps he’s run for Hendrick Motorsports at Homestead. He starts second. Don’t overthink this.', 'Ross Chastain ($8800): Chastain is in a great spot in all formats, as there are several big-name drivers that will draw usage in both tournaments and cash games that could cause Ross to go overlooked.', 'However, these steep, slick tracks are right up Chastain’s alley, and while he’s yet to lead a lap, he does have a second-place finish here on his resume.', 'Noah Gragson ($7400): I know Gragson starts a bit farther forward than we’d ordinarily like for cash games, but that just makes me like him even more in that format.', 'Barring a problem, Gragson is almost surely going to have a top-10 car after topping the field in practice on every long-run metric from 10 to 30 laps — the maximum average NASCAR scores in practice.', 'If we can get a driver and car combination with some of the best speed at both a price and usage discount because people are worried about place differential, we should get after it.', 'Gragson will likely be overrostered in tournament formats, so considering an underweight angle on him in tournaments given his youth and middling equipment isn’t a bad idea.', 'Austin Cindric ($7000): Cindric starts 36th, meaning aside from the two trash cars of J.J. Yeley and Chad Finchum that start behind him, his only avenue is forward.', 'Homestead has been a great track for Cindric, with finishes of 19th and 12 in his two Cup starts. That comes in addition to his two most recent Xfinity Series races here, where he led the most laps in one and finshed second in the other.', 'He may not have the best short-run speed, but I noticed all the Team Penske Fords improved relative to the field on the long run in practice.', 'Homestead DraftKings DFS Tournament Strategy and Picks', 'Denny Hamlin ($9800): Hamlin has dipped below the $10k price range, so it’s probably time to buy in. Should Larson falter, Hamlin is right in a group with Toyota teammates Christopher Bell and Tyler Reddick for the next-most likely driver to dominate and win.', 'Those other two will come with a cost and ownership premium, so I’ll buy the discount on Hamlin. He also comes with the added upside of going for the win, since racing his way in on points seems unlikely, which gives him (and Reddick) an advantage over Bell when it comes to having the ability to go on an alternate strategy since they likely need to win to advance.', 'In lineups with Larson, you’ll want to negatively correlate Hamlin with Reddick and Bell (especially Reddick) since they’ll pull secondary dominator points from each other. However, if Larson has a problem, then there’s room for more than one of these drivers to dominate.', 'Brad Keselowski ($8800): If we’re thinking about a potential late-race caution that could cause some chaos, look no further than Brad Keselowski.', 'Kez set the fastest five-lap average in practice, so in a chaos-type lineup, you’ll want to add some extra Keselowski in.', 'Other drivers that may pair well with him in a chaos line include William Byron, Bubba Wallace, and Zane Smith, who all displayed short-run speed and are projected to be in fewer lineups than optimal.', 'John H. Nemechek ($6000): JHN is a pivot off his teammate Erik Jones, who figures to be more highly rostered thanks to his better name recognition.', 'But my model has these two drivers pretty equal here, and Nemechek has actually picked up more top-10 finishes than his teammate including Vegas just last week — which is a secondary comp to Homestead — as well as Kansas and the first Bristol race that also required tire management.', '']"

Just as was the case at Las Vegas last Sunday, Homestead offers a chance for one of the eight remaining playoff drivers to lock their way into the championship round at Phoenix International Raceway on Nov. 10.', ""Homestead actually hosted NASCAR's championship weekend up through 2019, but no longer does. Now the individual event is no longer forced to take a backseat to the title race. With that in mind, here are three drivers to watch — a favorite, a contender and a dark horse — for Sunday's Straight Talk Wireless 400."", 'Some weeks, you don\'t want to pick the favorite because they just don\'t offer enough value. Others, you simply can\'t overthink it. This is one of those ""others."" It might be the closest thing to a slam-dunk you\'ll get all year. Larson has only won once in his career at Homestead, in 2022, but he was likely on his way to a repeat a season ago before a late crash entering pit road took him out.', ""Homestead is a venue that fits perfectly into Larson's wheelhouse, as he can effortlessly rim-ride around the top of the track to gain speed down the straightaways. He's in a solid points position to advance to the championship as it stands, but a win would ease any pressure at Martinsville a week from Sunday and you can bet on it happening. Even at those unappealing +330 odds, Larson is the guy."", ""Like Larson, Reddick just has a knack for Homestead, where he's finished in the top five in three of his four starts. Unlike Larson, he's on the outside looking in when it comes to the fight to make the Championship Four after a wreck at Las Vegas in which his car flipped over in the infield grass. Reddick figures to be extra motivated this week and Homestead might represent his best shot to advance to Phoenix."", ""Given Larson's status as the heavy favorite, anyone else in the field is better value than you would usually get. Reddick is listed with the third-best odds at +650. If you're taking the field against Larson, the 28-year-old is probably your best bet."", 'Keselowski has been dreadful for the past several months, with his runner-up finish at Talladega serving as his only top-10 finish since the playoffs started. However, ever since joining Roush-Fenway-Keselowski Racing in 2022 as driver and co-owner, he has been awesome at Homestead. Keselowski finished fifth in 2022 and had a fast car last season, leading 16 laps and running in the top-five most of the race before issues dropped him to 28th.', ""If Keselowski is going to make any more noise this season, this would be the place for it. He's been eliminated from the playoffs since the opening round, but he could still play spoiler as he looks to improve upon his 14th-place points standings position. Keselowski's +2200 odds look very enticing."", ""Hamlin these past few seasons has been inseparable from the narrative of whether or not he will ever win a Cup Series championship.

The good news for half of the drivers below the elimination line is that Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday (2:30 p.m. ET, NBC, MRN Radio, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio, NBC Sports App) is among their best tracks on the schedule. Meanwhile, the drivers above the elimination line will be vying for every point they can get to potentially seal a spot for the championship race at Phoenix Raceway.

Larson stands above the pack at Homestead, despite having just one victory to his resume. The 2021 Cup champion has led at least 96 laps in four of his last seven races, including both Next Gen races. As long as the No. 5 car can avoid the sand barrels on pit-road entry, he should be a factor.', '3 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'MUST START:\n\nTyler Reddick | View stats\n\n23XI Racing, No. 45 Toyota\n\nOdds: 6-1\n\nThe apple doesn’t fall far from the tree here. Reddick rivals Larson as the driver who can rim-ride the outside wall better than anybody in NASCAR. Racing within an inch of the powdery blue wall, won Reddick two Xfinity Series championships, and he has seen that success translate to the Cup Series with three top-five finishes in four starts. With Reddick’s struggles at Martinsville, his championship aspirations could ride through Homestead. ', '4 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'MUST START:\n\nWilliam Byron | View stats\n\nHendrick Motorsports, No. 24 Chevrolet\n\nOdds: 7-1\n\nThis lineup is beginning to look a lot like last weekend’s suggestions leading into Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Byron scored his first victory with crew chief Rudy Fugle at Homestead in 2021, and he has three top-10 finishes in the last four starts at the 1.5-mile track. The No. 24 team is heating up at the right time, scoring top-five finishes in the last four races, their longest streak since the spring of 2023. ', '5 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'MUST START:\n\nChristopher Bell | View stats\n\nJoe Gibbs Racing, No. 20 Toyota\n\nOdds: 6-1\n\nOK, is this Vegas? Not exactly, but a lot of the same drivers that performed well in Sin City are also among the best in South Beach. Prior to last year, it wasn’t Bell’s best track on the circuit. Even well into last year’s race, the No. 20 car faded outside the top 20. But with a few adjustments, Bell soared to the front and locked up a Championship 4 spot by collecting the checkered flag. Arguably, Bell currently has the most speed in the series and will look to capitalize on that this weekend. ', '6 of 16', 'James Gilbert | Getty Images', 'SLEEPER PICK:\n\nKyle Busch | View stats\n\nRichard Childress Racing, No. 8 Chevrolet\n\nOdds: 18-1\n\nIf you’re into theories, then consider this: Homestead is the 34th race of the season, which will tie the deepest into a season Busch has gone without visiting Victory Lane (2020 at Texas). The No. 8 car has shown speed on intermediates this year, though they underachieved last weekend at Las Vegas. Prior to an 18th-place finish in his first Homestead race with RCR, Busch has eight straight top-10 finishes here. ', '7 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'SLEEPER PICK:\n\nAJ Allmendinger | View stats\n\nKaulig Racing, No. 16 Chevrolet\n\nOdds: 45-1\n\nWant to have some fun with your lineup? Can you guess who is the only driver to have the top five finish in both Next Gen races at Homestead? Waiting, waiting… If you thought of Allmendinger, you’re correct. Dating back to his days with Richard Petty Motorsports, the road-course ace has always excelled at Homestead. With Kaulig Racing’s performance in 2024, this is a risky choice, but Allmendinger can wheel a car around Homestead with five top-10 finishes in 12 starts. ', '8 of 16', 'James Gilbert | Getty Images', 'SLEEPER PICK:\n\nAustin Dillon | View stats\n\nRichard Childress Racing, No. 3 Chevrolet\n\nOdds: 100-1\n\nOutside of Dillon’s victory at Richmond, it’s been a disastrous season for the No. 3 team. However, he has cracked the top 10 in both Next Gen races at Homestead and soared to fourth in the finishing order in 2022. Dating back to 2016, Dillon has eight straight finishes of 12th or better in South Beach. ', '9 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'STAY AWAY FROM:\n\nRyan Blaney | View stats\n\nTeam Penske, No. 12 Ford\n\nOdds: 12-1\n\nWe listed Blaney in this spot last year and he went on to have the best race he’s ever had at Homestead with a runner-up finish. For all you No. 12 fans, maybe that will apply again this year. But if we go by the numbers, that is an anomaly. Blaney has two top 10s in nine Homestead starts, with just one additional finish better than 17th. It’s highly likely Blaney will be in my lineup for the final two races of 2024, though.', '10 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'STAY AWAY FROM:\n\nChase Elliott | View stats\n\nHendrick Motorsports, No. 9 Chevrolet\n\nOdds: 14-1\n\nSitting a distant 53 points below the elimination line, Elliott’s strategy must be focused on winning one of the next two races. That isn’t ideal from a fantasy perspective where every point matters. Then, take into account that Elliott has never had a standout race at Homestead – he has three top-10 finishes in eight starts and an average finish of 10.4 – and it leads me to thinking it would be a good week to sit the No. 9 car. ', '11 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'STAY AWAY FROM:\n\nChase Briscoe | View stats\n\nStewart-Haas Racing, No. 14 Ford\n\nOdds: 55-1\n\nThe last time the Cup Series visited a worn-out track similar to Homestead, it was Briscoe who found himself in Victory Lane at Darlington Raceway in the regular season finale. Don’t count on that this weekend. Sure, he has an Xfinity win at Homestead, but he’s never finished better than 17th in three Cup tries.', '12 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'FEATURED MATCHUP:\n\nKyle Larson vs. William Byron\n\nComing out with a bang this week, with the two Hendrick Motorsports teammates being a heavyweight bout. Both drivers escaped Las Vegas with solid points days and have good buffers over the elimination line. It’s very likely both drivers will also be strong this weekend, as we went over their respective stats earlier. Larson is consistently the best driver at Homestead, however, and gets the nod. ', '13 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'FEATURED MATCHUP:\n\nTyler Reddick vs. Christopher Bell\n\nThese two Toyota drivers might have different mindsets entering the weekend. Bell is 42 points above the elimination line after a strong Vegas performance. Reddick flipped on the track and rolled through the standings, and he likely needs a win this weekend to advance to his first Championship 4. Not sure if Reddick will score that coveted victory, but I do like him in this matchup for his boldness of running within centimeters – millimeters? – of the wall. ', '14 of 16', 'James Gilbert | Getty Images', 'FEATURED MATCHUP:', 'Ryan Blaney vs. Martin Truex Jr.\n\nEven though Blaney is listed as a driver to avoid this weekend, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the defending champion rise to the pressure, sitting 47 points below the elimination line. But he will likely be chasing the win. So will Truex, who would love nothing more than to feel the high of Victory Lane one final time in his last full season. Truex has had funky occurrences the last two Homestead trips, blowing an engine last year and missing his pit box while leading in 2022, yet he still has four top-five finishes in the last seven Homestead races. ', '15 of 16', 'James Gilbert | Getty Images', 'FEATURED MATCHUP:', 'Denny Hamlin vs. Chase Elliott\n\nHamlin leads the way with three victories at Homestead, most of all active drivers. Elliott has been consistently in the back half of the top 10 at Homestead, pacing the field for just 31 laps across eight starts. Both drivers need big days on Sunday, but Hamlin seems to be a gimme this weekend.', '16 of 16', 'Sean Gardner | Getty Images', 'MY LINEUP: Kyle Larson, Tyler Reddick, William Byron, Christopher Bell, Denny Hamlin\n\nGARAGE: Martin Truex Jr.', 'FACEBOOK', 'X', 'INSTAGRAM', 'SNAPCHAT', 'TIKTOK', 'YOUTUBE', 'DISCORD', 'NASCAR® and its marks are trademarks of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, LLC.

"NASCAR Cup Series playoff odds, expert predictions for Homestead-Miami race: Kyle Larson, Tyler Reddick shine on this track",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5870228/2024/10/25/nascar-cup-series-playoff-odds-expert-predictions-homestead-miami/,"['Sports Betting', '', '', '', '', '', 'As always, we’re bringing our questions about the upcoming race and the NASCAR landscape to our experts, Jeff Gluck and Jordan Bianchi.', '', '', 'Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.', '', 'What an exciting weekend U.S. motorsports just had! Jeff, you that NASCAR’s Vegas playoff race got around 2.3 million viewers on NBC and F1’s race in Austin got around 1.3 million viewers on ABC. Curious to hear you guys weigh in about the state of motorsports in the U.S. right now and NASCAR’s viewership victory over F1 (playoff impact? Just more popular with American racing fans?).', 'Jeff: This has to come as a giant relief for NASCAR after the F1 Miami race in May significantly out-rated that day’s Cup Series race in a head-to-head battle. My theory is a lot of the U.S. audience for F1 are newer/more casual fans, and those people were more likely to be pulled away to football on a Sunday fall afternoon (1.8 million fewer people watched the Austin race than Miami) — whereas NASCAR’s audience in the U.S. is much more dedicated and loyal, and many of the hardcore fans watch NASCAR no matter what else is on. Of course, F1 has a vastly larger international audience — but given that these races ran at the same time, it’s a reminder NASCAR is still king among American motorsports fans, for now.', 'Jordan: It’s notable for all the reasons Jeff laid out, and surely a rating that has NASCAR execs smiling. From the 30,000-foot perspective, how F1 goes about retaining so many of its new/casual fans is going to be something to watch going forward. Having a compelling championship battle as opposed to Max Verstappen dominating every week certainly helps, but sometimes that’s not enough.', '', '', 'Jeff: It depends on your perspective. Newer NASCAR fans who may be pulled in from following other major sports are familiar with playoff systems that see underdogs go on a run and upsets occur frequently. But even in Year 11 of this elimination-style format for NASCAR, many longtime NASCAR fans still have a hard time accepting how the champion is determined. And frankly, they have good reason: Until NASCAR came up with the “Chase” in 2004, every form of motorsports for all of time had awarded the championship to whoever scored the most points over an entire season.', '', 'Jordan: It’s always best to take anything said on X with a big grain of salt. This is particularly true when it comes to what constitutes a good or bad race, as at no point in the history of the poll has a race ever received 100 percent of the votes. There is always someone who will vote “No” for some inane reason. This is a long way of saying let’s not try to dissect too much from what this means in the grand scheme of things.', '', 'Jeff: Define “successfully.” No offense to Muniz, but even he would agree there hasn’t been much success for him in stock cars yet. Muniz started racing in the American open-wheel racing ladder, but then had to step out of the seat after a serious 2009 crash nearly ended his career. He did not resume racing until last year with an attempt to climb the NASCAR ranks, and it’s been a steep learning curve since then. But after failing to secure enough sponsorship to race consistently this season, Muniz apparently now has the funding for a full-time effort in 2025. Clearly, he’s taking the effort seriously — but that also underscores how difficult all of this is. And it won’t get any easier next season: The ride Muniz is getting into, Reaume Brothers Racing’s No. 33 truck, has one top-10 finish this year in 20 starts with driver Lawless Alan, who ranks 24th in the Truck Series standings.', 'Jordan: It’s not unusual at all to see a celebrity moonlight in racing — albeit not often in NASCAR. Just a few weeks ago, Keanu Reeves made his racing debut at a sports car race at Indianapolis. (He ended up crashing out.) What differentiates Muniz from most other celebs who’ve crossed over is how dedicated he is to the craft and how willing he is to invest the time to be better. Now that he has secured a full-time ride, let’s see how much he improves over the course of an entire season.', '', '', 'Jeff: This is one of the most beloved tracks in the garage because it’s a racer’s track that offers a straight-up race. Homestead, close enough to Miami to stay in the city’s hotels but far enough to draw a crowd from the metro area, was the track that determined NASCAR’s champion from 2002 to 2019 before the title race moved to Phoenix. So the place is dripping with NASCAR lore, and you can feel echoes of some of the all-time great NASCAR moments when you walk into the place (Tony Stewart’s 2011 championship over Carl Edwards in a tiebreaker, Jimmie Johnson’s record-tying seventh championship in 2016). Homestead has a worn-out surface that rewards running the high line right against the wall, which takes a special skill set that not all drivers can master. It’s not always the most entertaining race, but it rewards the best — which is a key feature for the playoffs, considering there’s a Championship 4 berth on the line for the winner.', 'Jordan: Homestead is the epitome of a “driver’s racetrack,” a place that allows them to fully demonstrate their skill set like few others. A by-product of this is that rarely will you see a fluke winner emerge, meaning whoever wins on Sunday will have certainly earned it.', '', 'Jeff: The two drivers to focus on most are Larson and Tyler Reddick, both of whom are experts at running within inches of the fence. Although Larson only has one Homestead win, he has led the most laps in a race there four times and is generally considered the driver to beat during each visit. That said, you never know what can happen; last year, Larson was running second and in contention for the win when he made a mistake and smashed into the sand barrels protecting drivers from the pit road wall. Reddick can also be mistake-prone, but is great at Homestead — he has three top-five finishes in four career Cup starts (the other was a crash) and also won two Xfinity Series championship races there. Given that Reddick’s championship hopes may well rest on the outcome of this race, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him with a big performance on Sunday.', 'Jordan: Larson is the favorite for all the obvious reasons, and Reddick deserves to be slotted in second. But let’s also not overlook Christopher Bell, who just so happens to be the defending race winner and comes in with some obvious speed on mile-and-a-half tracks after dominating — and nearly winning — last week’s race at Las Vegas.', '', 'Jeff: This isn’t really the type of race a long shot can win, but here’s a little note for you. The only driver with top-10 finishes in both of the Next Gen car’s races at Homestead is — wait for it — Austin Dillon! What? Yes! He finished fourth in 2022 and 10th last year. His odds are +400 to get a top-10 again on Sunday, so maybe that’s worth taking a small risk. You can also get plus-money for a Bubba Wallace top-10 (+135), which seems like a good deal considering he finished sixth last year and led nine laps early in the race.', 'Jordan: Stay away from picking a long shot to win. It’s not happening. Go spend your money on something else.', 'Odds, via BetMGM, update live.', '', '', '']"

Toyota teams grabbed four of the top six spots.', 'Reddick was also atop the charts in practice with a best lap of 167.770 mph, besting Ross Chastain by a mere 0.001-second margin.

It’s the largest gap between the provisional last driver in and the first driver out after a round-opening race in playoff history.', 'That margin, of course, is subject to change in Sunday’s 400-mile South Florida showdown, where only Logano can truly consider his postseason status safe.', 'There’s room for three more title hopefuls in the Nov. 10 season finale at Phoenix Raceway, and Sunday dawns with another opportunity for the remaining playoff-eligible seven to lock in with a clinching victory. The third and final chance in the round comes next weekend at Martinsville Speedway.', 'For Hamlin and fellow drivers among the bottom four — Tyler Reddick (-30), Ryan Blaney (-47) and Chase Elliott (-53) — all hope is not lost. At least one driver below the elimination line after the Round of 8 opener has reached the Championship 4 in each of the last five seasons. A victory at Homestead would be the most straightforward route, one that would also shift the complexion of the bubble for Martinsville.', '“I mean, if we have pretty calm races from here to the last lap of Martinsville, I would say it’s probably not too great a deficit, but every freaking race in this playoffs, something crazy has happened,” said Reddick, who barrel-rolled his No. 45 Toyota on the frontstretch at Las Vegas last weekend, but who starts first Sunday. “So I wouldn’t rule it out, but I think for us to advance, today we have to be top three and score a lot of points, and if we want to win this race, we’ve got to do the same thing. Hopefully, we get some things to go our way along the way, but we’ve got to focus on just going into this weekend with the intent of winning.”', 'Logano’s No. 22 Team Penske group has the luxury of putting extra focus toward the Phoenix finale, given the team’s newfound playoff immunity.
