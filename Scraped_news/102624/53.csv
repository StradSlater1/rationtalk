The Nittany Lions (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) remained undefeated behind a stingy defense and an offensive attack that came alive in the second half. Before leaving the game at halftime with what appeared to be a left knee injury, Allar completed 14 of 18 passes for 148 yards and a score. He was on the sideline in the second half, but Pribula took the reins of the offense and threw for 98 yards and rushed for 28 on six carries. For Pribula, a redshirt sophomore who has seen action in 18 games in his career, his passing total was a career high. The touchdown was his seventh through the air. Kaytron Allen ran for 86 yards and a score for Penn State, while Nicholas Singleton and Khalil Dinkins hauled in receiving touchdowns. Wisconsin (5-3, 3-2) got its lone touchdown of the game from running back Tawee Walker, who ran for 59 yards on 22 carries. Braedyn Locke completed 22 of 42 passes for 217 yards. The Badgers had a 10-7 lead at home at Camp Randall Stadium at halftime, but the game swung when Penn State's Jaylen Reed picked off Locke's pass and returned it 19 yards for a touchdown midway through the third quarter. Penn State then padded its lead in the fourth quarter with long drives -- 13 plays then nine plays, which ate up nearly 13 minutes of clock -- that ended with touchdowns from Pribula and Allen. Penn State has now won six straight against Wisconsin in a streak that began in 2012. The Nittany Lions face a big test next Saturday when they host No. 4 Ohio State.

Maalik Murphy threw 25 yards to Eli Pancol on Duke's first snap of overtime before the Blue Devils opted to go for the win. SMU blocked Todd Pelino's 30-yard field goal attempt on the last play of regulation, the third kick to go awry for the Blue Devils in the second half.

Murphy threw for three touchdowns and 295 yards on 27-for-48 passing. Duke's Ozzie Nicholas recovered Jennings' fumble and returned it 21 yards to the SMU 14 with 58 seconds to play before the blocked field goal. Tre Freeman's interception gave the Blue Devils the ball at SMU's 37, but Pelino's 42-yard field goal attempt was wide left with 5:38 to go.

Jennings connected with Roderick Daniels Jr for an 81-yard touchdown play as the margin grew to 21-7.

In the fourth quarter, Hunter got free for a 45-yard touchdown run to give the Tigers a 24-10 lead with 12:11 left in the game. The Wildcats had a chance to cut their deficit, but Wimsatt had a fourth-down throw intercepted by Lee at the goal line and returned to the Auburn 9 with 4:39 remaining.

Miami (8-0, 4-0), which entered the game ranked No. 2 in the nation in scoring (48.3), was forced to settle for three Andres Borregales field goals. Florida State, meanwhile, was held to 248 yards of total offense, 75 of them on its final drive.

The Hurricanes scored a touchdown on the game's first possession, traveling 67 yards and capping the march with Mark Fletcher Jr.'s 1-yard run. Ward went 4-for-5 for 53 yards on that drive.

FSU cut its deficit to 14-7 on Caziah Holmes' fourth-and-goal run from the 1-yard line with 6:44 left in the second quarter. The key to the drive was FSU's fourth-and-1 conversion from its own 45 as Luke Kromenhoek ran 42 yards on a quarterback sneak in which he appeared to have been stopped at the line of scrimmage but kept going.

Texas tied it when Ewers hit Matthew Golden with a 3-yard scoring strike. The Longhorns took the lead on its next trip when Ewers found Moore with a 27-yard scoring toss with 1:13 left in the first quarter.

Vanderbilt's Sedrick Alexander fumbled at the Texas 43 with a minute to play in the half, but the Commodores forced a punt and ended the half with Brock Taylor's 54-yard field goal.

Why Hugh Freeze didn’t travel with Auburn to Kentucky on Friday,https://www.yardbarker.com/college_football/articles/why_hugh_freeze_didnt_travel_with_auburn_to_kentucky_on_friday/s1_17125_41126260,"['', 'Carrying a dismal 2-5 record into Week 9, a road win over Kentucky would do wonders for Auburn’s 2024 campaign. However, the team is facing a potentially major roadblock with the health of head coach Hugh Freeze.', 'Freeze did not travel with the team to Lexington on Friday due to an illness but will join them Saturday morning, per Pete Thamel of ESPN. Freeze intends to coach the game despite his delayed arrival. Thamel reports that his illness is due to a suspected food poisoning.', 'Auburn is coming off a narrow 21-17 loss to No. 19-ranked Missouri in Week 8. The team entered that game off their bye week but was listless on offense and out-gunned by a hobbled Brady Cook.', 'The veteran head coach is in his second season leading the Tigers after four successful years at Liberty. He was previously the head coach of Ole Miss from 2012 to 2016 before an infamous scandal forced him to resign.', 'Despite a 2-1 start to the year, Auburn has not won a game since their Week 3 game against New Mexico State. The Tigers have since lost their last four outings, all of which were SEC matchups.', 'However, Auburn appears to have their best chance to change the course of their season in Week 9 against Kentucky despite Freeze’s health concerns. The Tigers are just one-point underdogs in the game, their closest spread since being a three-point favorite over Arkansas in Week 4.', 'While their record suggests a lost season, Auburn was realistically a couple of plays away from potentially securing two ranked wins. They were solidly in control against Oklahoma in Week 5 before a late collapse and entered the fourth quarter against Missouri with a double-digit lead before giving up the go-ahead score with less than one minute remaining.', 'This article first appeared on NCAA Football on ClutchPoints and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', 'The rivalry game Saturday between Michigan and Michigan State ended in utter chaos. The Wolverines led the Spartans 24-17 and had possession with just over a minute left in the contest at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Mich. Facing 3rd-and-5 at their own 44, Michigan quarterback Alex Orji rushed for eight yards to ice the game. But after Michigan went for the kneel-down to run out the clock, Wolverines tight end Colston Loveland got into it with Spartans defensive end Anthony Jones. Loveland and Jones first exchanged shoves. Loveland then headbutted Jones, who immediately responded by grabbing his aggressor by the helmet. Players in both yellow and green swarmed the two as the game clock trickled down to zero. The referees eventually got the game back under control, but not before both sidelines emptied out onto the field. On-field fracas aside, Michigan has dominated its matchups against Michigan State over the last few years. The Wolverines have won the last three contests and five of the last seven overall in the rivalry. Michigan leads Michigan State all-time 74-38-5. Michigan State wasted a golden opportunity down 24-17 with 3:02 to play. The Spartans had 1st-and-10 at Michigan’s 21 but were unable to find the end zone and eventually turned it over on downs.', 'The Leafs suffered a big loss at the hands of the St. Louis Blues last night, and Craig Berube wasn\'t in a festive mood, as he ripped into captain Auston Matthews. During the game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the St. Louis Blues, there was quite a heated exchange between head coach Craig Berube and Auston Matthews that only served to distract from the game at hand. Down by 5-1, when the third Blues goal was counted, Berube could be seen involved in an animated argument with Matthews on the bench. The moment really begged questions about the message that Berube was trying to get across to the Maple Leafs captain. Was this a release of frustration, or was there something more to what Berube was doing with such an intense show of emotion? Berube is known to be very straightforward in his method of coaching. He will not hold back from lacing into guys, even star players like Auston Matthews. On one hand, sometimes these situations wake up players and get them to raise their games in big moments. That could spur an element of urgency in Matthews, who will then take ownership and try to prevent further defensive breakdowns. After all, Matthews is one of the leaders of this team, and perhaps coaches like Berube think a little tough love is what he needs to sharpen his focus at those moments, but it seems all has smoothed over with the two. There\'s a possible down side, too, to Berube\'s aggressiveness. For a player as skilled and composed as Matthews, who leads more by example than by heated passion, such an in-your-face tactic might be counterproductive. If it\'s not presented well, the pressure could be put on Matthews and hurt his confidence or affect team chemistry. Not everyone responds well to hard-nosed coaching, and this sort of public call-out could very well create tension rather than cure what ails. ""I mean, I don\'t know. I mean, it\'s hockey. You get yelled at sometimes. Coach yells. You just kind of take it as it goes,"" Matthews said. ""I don\'t know. There\'s obviously an impact. We obviously all respect him and his presence and everything on the bench. Yeah, so it\'s not anything you take personally."" Postgame, and on the day after the game, Matthews was relatively quiet on the matter, offering little initial comment and speaking on the situation the next day. His measured response may suggest that he understood where Craig Berube was coming from, even if those types of things aren\'t exactly his cup of tea when it comes to being critiqued. The always-chatty Mitch Marner, lined up next to Matthews often on the ice, was also understanding of Berube\'s perspective. It would suggest that the Leafs are prepared to take this altercation on the chin, as it were, heading into tough matchups with the Boston Bruins and Winnipeg Jets. ""I mean, you\'re pissed off if you\'re on the ice against a goal. So, you\'re already pissed off,"" Marner said. ""We need to be more direct with that puck. We need to be better with it. We\'ve got to be at the five as a unit, and, you know, you expect it when you get back it wasn\'t the prettiest of plays out of the five guys on the ice."" Berube\'s hard-nosed approach might become the reason for the overall change in Matthews\' game, but it does have the tendency to push the star player further away if it becomes too much. That is a rather delicate tightrope to walk: calling out athletes to be more intense without having that turn into a cancer within the locker room dynamic. Because of this strategy going down the stretch run, it will be really interesting to see how things pan out for Matthews, Berube and the Leafs.', 'Montreal Canadiens defenseman Arber Xhekaj has been out of the lineup for a bit, but now, head coach Martin St. Louis is giving him another chance. In an announcement, it was revealed that Xhekaj would be back in the Montreal Canadiens lineup when the team takes on the St. Louis Blues on Saturday. This should be a huge game for Xhekaj, who has been a healthy scratch more often than not to start the year. Interestingly enough, Martin St. Louis did offer what appears to be a final warning to the defenseman. Essentially, he wants to see some consistent play with no turnovers. He acknowledged that Xhekaj is no longer a rookie and that he needs to leave those rookie mistakes in the past. ""I expect a better version. Being staying alert, consistent,\' St. Louis said. ""You should be worried about making some mistakes. He\'s not a rookie anymore. So you should say: I gotta be better.\' Very simple. It\'s not like we nitpick everything he does. But he\'s gotta be better. I expect Xhekaj to be a better version."" It will be fascinating to see how this all shakes out for Xhekaj. He and many other Habs players need to take a leap. Something has to give and Xhekaj will want to be the solution, not the problem.', 'Over the 76-year history of NASCAR, retaliation for transgressions on the racetrack have always been prevalent. Plenty of drivers have used the chrome horn to show their displeasure after a competitor roughed them up, and from time to time, competitors crossed the line. The invisible line of conduct was clearly crossed and abused in Saturday\'s NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, when driver Conner Jones intentionally crashed fellow competitor Matt Mills after Jones was upset with the way he was being raced. On lap 76, Jones\' frustration boiled over, as he sent Mills\' Chevrolet hard into the outside wall in turn four, with Mills\' truck spewing flames from the rear of the vehicle. The incident was bad enough on its own — intentionally wrecking a fellow driver is never acceptable — but the optics were made even worse when it was announced that Mills had to be transferred to a local hospital for further evaluation. Jones has been the subject of several smaller incidents over the course of the 2024 season, and in 12 starts — all of which have come in championship-caliber ThorSport Racing trucks — Jones has yet to finish inside the top 10, with a season-best finish of 11th coming at Charlotte on May 24. Jones\' reputation as a pay driver — a distinction given to drivers who bring funding and sponsorship but lack results — certainly doesn\'t help him in this situation. Nor does his past history in the series, which has been marred by smaller incidents with other competitors. Jones refused to talk to the media after the race, choosing instead to issue an apology via social media. ""I have not yet had the chance to personally apologize to Matt for the incident that took place during today\'s race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but I intend to do so,"" the statement read. ""Matt and I have encountered several on-track incidents this season, and I let my frustration get the best of me."" The apology is both a nice sentiment and a necessary PR move, but it rings hollow on an afternoon where Jones made an incredibly poor judgement call. It\'s not a crime for athletes to let their tempers get the best of them, but in a sport that is inherently dangerous, using 3,400-pound vehicles as weapons is inexcusable.', 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
