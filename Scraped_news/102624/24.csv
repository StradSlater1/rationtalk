Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) plans on launching its potentially game-changing Blackwell architecture in the weeks to come. Blackwell includes the most powerful chip ever along with five other major innovations, and investors have been closely watching the development and launch timeline.', ""Meanwhile, even as it plans this big launch, demand for Nvidia's current architecture, Hopper, has continued to soar. And the tech giant has delivered excellent earnings results with profit and revenue climbing in the triple digits quarter after quarter. The stock has soared 190% so far this year, but valuation actually remains reasonable considering the company's leadership in the market and long-term prospects."", ""So, Nvidia looks like a buy -- but should you make the move before or after the Blackwell launch? Let's find out."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""First, let's summarize the initial chapters of this exciting story that has unfolded over the past several years. Nvidia built a solid position as a seller of graphics processing units (GPUs) to the gaming market -- but it soon became clear that these powerful chips with the ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously could be useful in many other industries too."", ""The company developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this happen, and as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom accelerated, Nvidia began generating more and more sales from AI customers. Today, though video game revenue still is growing, Nvidia generates the lion's share of growth and revenue from its data center business -- the unit that includes its AI products and services."", ""Now, let's consider the introduction of Blackwell. Nvidia says it aims to ramp up Blackwell production in the fourth quarter and even generate several billions of dollars of Blackwell revenue during the period. Demand has surpassed supply, and the company sees this as continuing well into next year."", ""At the same time, as mentioned, customers continue to order Hopper too -- Nvidia says all of its systems work together, and the company develops new algorithms on a regular basis to improve its already existing products. This means if you already are working with Nvidia, you don't have to worry about your current system becoming obsolete just because new products and services are launching. All of this keeps demand growing for current and future products."", ""Nvidia's earnings strength has helped the stock to climb 2,800% over the past five years, and today the stock trades for 50 times forward earnings estimates -- this isn't ridiculously expensive considering Nvidia's leadership in the high-growth field of AI and its focus on innovation."", ""Now, let's get back to our question. Should you buy Nvidia today or after the Blackwell launch? As mentioned earlier, Nvidia's earnings have climbed in the triple digits in recent times, but the company is forecasting double-digit growth for the third quarter. That report is set for Nov. 20."", ""Before looking at this as a slowdown, it's important to note that quarterly comparisons are getting tougher and tougher for Nvidia -- because quarterly revenue as of last year reached extremely high levels. So double-digit growth from those levels would be fantastic. And if Nvidia meets or beats expectations and offers more positive commentary about the Blackwell launch, the stock could climb."", ""That said, considering the stock's gains this year and in recent years, even fantastic news may not result in explosive share performance overnight. We might see waves of increases here and there during the Blackwell launch or even a bit later -- investors may wait to hear about the sales levels in the fourth quarter report."", ""All of this means it won't matter much if you buy Nvidia before or after the Blackwell launch, and this is especially true if you hold onto the stock for the long term. Near-term movement won't make much of a mark on your five or 10-year returns. So you can go ahead and buy Nvidia now or wait until after the Blackwell launch, and thanks to the company's great prospects, in either case you may score a win over the long haul."", 'Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

NVIDIA Blackwell AI Chip Shortage: Sold Out for Next 12 Months Due to Skyrocketing Demand,https://www.eweek.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-ai-chip-shortage/,"['eWEEK content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.', 'Chipmaker NVIDIA recently announced that its latest Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) are sold out until the end of 2025, snapped up by the customers—including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Oracle. The AI leaders’ deep pockets and large-volume orders make it difficult for smaller companies to compete and relegating them to a year-long wait. It’s too early to know the effect this shortage will have on the tech industry—especially now, with the GPU-heavy development of artificial intelligence booming—but it might lead to competitive disadvantages, a possible black market, or an opportunity for NVIDIA’s rivals to gain ground on the longtime leader. ', 'TABLE OF CONTENTS', 'NVIDIA has grown to prominence over the last couple of years due to heavy demand by AI developers for its H100 and GH200 chips. The company designed its next-generation GPUs, Blackwell B200 and GB200, for demanding data center, AI, and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The B200 improves on the previous generation’s 80 billion transistors and 4 petaflops with more than 200 billion transistors and 20 petaflops, and packs in almost 200 GB of HBM3e memory to deliver as much as 8 TB/sec of bandwidth to provide the processing power required by high-end data applications like AI.', 'The NVIDIA Blackwell’s sheer power is an obvious factor in the heavy demand for the chip, but other elements are also at play. Chipmakers have been on a headlong rush to push the thermal design power (TDP) limits for microchips. Interest in AI is booming in parallel, popularized by the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications over the past two year, and data centers are scrambling to upgrade facilities in preparation for demand.', 'They need GPUs, high-powered CPUs, as much memory as they can assemble, the fastest possible interconnects, and immense amounts of networking bandwidth to be able to facilitate AI workloads. The entire technology stack will need to up its game to avoid becoming a bottleneck for large language model (LLM) processing, but GPUs—which lie at the core of the data center infrastructure required to serve the needs of AI—are critical components. Demand just outstripped supply.', 'Current market conditions for NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs are grim for many potential customers. The cozy relationship between hyperscalers, tech giants, and NVIDIA is leaving smaller companies a year or more behind in implementing and executing AI and data center upgrade plans. This could lead to competitive disadvantage for smaller companies and greater dominance for current big players.', 'A GPU black market might emerge, or NVIDIA rivals might gain market share with Blackwell alternatives. NVIDIA has long been the dominant chipmaker, but this could potentially be the point that makes or breaks the company as a market force. If it can’t scale up and maintain quality to meet demand, it could falter in the market or open itself to a takeover. It remains to be seen how this abrupt cessation in GPU to delivery to all but the privileged few will play out, but it’s clear that too much is at stake for the rest of the market to sit idly by for a year in the hope of obtaining some precious NVIDIA treasure.', 'According to the latest projections, NVIDIA AI chips won’t be back in stock until the end of 2025. However, if Meta or one of the hyperscalers suddenly decides it needs another 100,000 GPUs, they could buy out stock before a smaller company even has a chance. Whether NVIDIA would serve smaller companies first or push them down in the queue if more large orders come in from tech giants and hyperscalers remains to be seen.', '“As we progress to meet the increasing computational demands of large-scale artificial intelligence, NVIDIA’s latest contributions in rack design and modular architecture will help speed up the development and implementation of AI infrastructure across the industry,” said Yee Jiun Song, vice president of engineering at Meta.', 'Another factor to consider is certainty of delivery. After a recent shopping delay for the Blackwell chip due to a packaging issue, the company had to redesign how its GPU was integrated with other components within the chipset to avoid warping and system failures. Only time will tell whether the current design will stand up to the rigors of mass production while maintaining quality.', 'A number of competitors are standing in the wings, ready to capitalize on customer frustration about long lead times, including Intel and AMD. Earlier this year, Intel introduced a new AI chip that it claims rivals the performance of the NVIDIA H100 processor for AI workloads. Intel claims its Gaudi 3 chip can exceed its NVIDIA rival in the training and deployment of generative AI models with 40 percent more power efficiency, 50 percent more inference speed, and more than one-and-a-half times the training speed for large language models (LLMs). ', 'Instead of packing more punch into every square millimeter of silicon to produce the biggest LLMs around, some manufacturers are taking a different approach. AMD, for example, has released a small language model called the AMD-135M trained on AMD Instinct MI250 accelerators based on the AMD Ryzen AI processor. ', 'Similarly, ThirdAI trained its Bolt LLM using only CPUs—instead of using 128 GPUs as GPT-2 does, for example, the company used 10 servers each with two ThirdAI Sapphire Rapids CPUs to pretrain Bolt on 2.5 billion parameters within 20 days. That makes Bolt 160 times more efficient than traditional LLMs, according to Omdia analyst Michael Azoff. “Smaller models mean lower cost and lower power and cooling demands on the data center,” he said.', 'NVIDIA is king of the castle at the moment, dominating the market for compute-intensive processing—but with much of the IT and business world being forced to wait a year or more for its in-demand product, rivals are lining up to try to fill the delivery vacuum. Some are already not far behind NVIDIA’s AI chips, and they’re closing ground fast. While demand remains high, NVIDIA may prove to be a victim of its own success. It remains to be seen whether the company will further assert its dominance or if others will take advantage of the delivery delays to serve AI demands with alternative solutions.', 'See how two of the most popular generative AI art tools compare in our head-to-head comparison of Runway vs. Midjourney.', 'Subscribe to Daily Tech Insider for top news, trends & analysis', 'Subscribe to Daily Tech Insider for top news, trends & analysis', 'eWeek has the latest technology news and analysis, buying guides, and product reviews for IT professionals and technology buyers.

Let's find out."", 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', ""First, let's summarize the initial chapters of this exciting story that has unfolded over the past several years. Nvidia built a solid position as a seller of graphics processing units (GPUs) to the gaming market -- but it soon became clear that these powerful chips with the ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously could be useful in many other industries too."", ""The company developed the CUDA parallel computing platform to make this happen, and as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom accelerated, Nvidia began generating more and more sales from AI customers. Today, though video game revenue still is growing, Nvidia generates the lion's share of growth and revenue from its data center business -- the unit that includes its AI products and services."", ""Now, let's consider the introduction of Blackwell. Nvidia says it aims to ramp up Blackwell production in the fourth quarter and even generate several billions of dollars of Blackwell revenue during the period. Demand has surpassed supply, and the company sees this as continuing well into next year."", ""At the same time, as mentioned, customers continue to order Hopper too -- Nvidia says all of its systems work together, and the company develops new algorithms on a regular basis to improve its already existing products. This means if you already are working with Nvidia, you don't have to worry about your current system becoming obsolete just because new products and services are launching. All of this keeps demand growing for current and future products."", ""Nvidia's earnings strength has helped the stock to climb 2,800% over the past five years, and today the stock trades for 50 times forward earnings estimates -- this isn't ridiculously expensive considering Nvidia's leadership in the high-growth field of AI and its focus on innovation."", ""Now, let's get back to our question. Should you buy Nvidia today or after the Blackwell launch? As mentioned earlier, Nvidia's earnings have climbed in the triple digits in recent times, but the company is forecasting double-digit growth for the third quarter. That report is set for Nov. 20."", ""Before looking at this as a slowdown, it's important to note that quarterly comparisons are getting tougher and tougher for Nvidia -- because quarterly revenue as of last year reached extremely high levels. So double-digit growth from those levels would be fantastic. And if Nvidia meets or beats expectations and offers more positive commentary about the Blackwell launch, the stock could climb."", ""That said, considering the stock's gains this year and in recent years, even fantastic news may not result in explosive share performance overnight. We might see waves of increases here and there during the Blackwell launch or even a bit later -- investors may wait to hear about the sales levels in the fourth quarter report."", ""All of this means it won't matter much if you buy Nvidia before or after the Blackwell launch, and this is especially true if you hold onto the stock for the long term. Near-term movement won't make much of a mark on your five or 10-year returns. So you can go ahead and buy Nvidia now or wait until after the Blackwell launch, and thanks to the company's great prospects, in either case you may score a win over the long haul."", 'Adria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This boost is driven by high demand for its new AI supercomputing chips.', 'Nvidia’s AI chips, notably the A100, H100, and the upcoming Blackwell series, are specialized processors designed to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including deep learning, natural language processing, and generative AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4.', 'The next expected release is called Blackwell and is  expected to further enhance Nvidia’s capabilities in high-level AI processing and model training.', 'While exact prices aren’t confirmed, they are likely to be priced similarly or higher than the H100, possibly $30,000 or more per unit.', 'The largest individual shareholder is Jensen Huang. Huang is known for his charismatic style, frequently seen wearing his signature leather jacket at product launches and events. His approach blends technical expertise with a deep understanding of the business landscape, making him not only an engineer but also a visionary business leader.', 'Nvidia’s market value reached $3.53 trillion, slightly above Apple’s $3.52 trillion, as per data from LSEG.', 'Back in June, Nvidia briefly held the top spot as the world’s most valuable company but was soon surpassed by Microsoft and Apple. For several months, these three tech giants have had very close market values. Currently, Microsoft’s market value is $3.20 trillion.', 'Nvidia’s stock has climbed about 18% in October, partly due to OpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding announcement. Nvidia supplies the chips that power AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which are increasingly popular as more companies adopt artificial intelligence.', 'Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta (includes Facebook and Whatsapp) has said: “AI already powers everything from our large language models to our content recommendations, ads, and safety systems, and it’s only going to get more important in the future. We’re looking forward to using NVIDIA’s Blackwell to help train our open-source Llama models and build the next generation of Meta AI and consumer products.”', 'Nvidia dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company on Friday, following a record-setting rally in the stock powered by an insatiable demand for its new supercomputing AI chips.', '“More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.', '“It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia.”', 'Nvidia’s shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI.', 'The next big test will be when Nvidia reports third-quarter results in November. Nvidia in August forecast third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with the current average analyst expectation of $32.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.', 'Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note dated Oct. 10 that he remains “very bullish” about the company longer term, but the recent rally “raises the bar for earnings somewhat”.', 'After meeting with Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, Moore observed that production of the new Blackwell chips was ramping up significantly and was fully booked for the next 12 months. Nvidia’s stock faced some pressure in August when the company confirmed that Blackwell chip production had been delayed to the fourth quarter.', 'Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft hold significant sway over the tech sector and the broader U.S. stock market, making up roughly one-fifth of the S&P 500 index.', 'The excitement around AI, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower interest rates, and a strong start to the earnings season pushed the S&P 500 index to a record high last week.', 'Nvidia’s impressive stock gains have increased its popularity with options traders, with its options ranking among the most actively traded in recent months, according to Trade Alert.', 'The stock has surged nearly 190% so far this year as a boom in generative AI prompted the company to issue a series of blowout forecasts.', '“The question is whether the revenue stream will last for a long time and will be driven by the emotion of investors rather than by any ability to prove or disprove the thesis that AI is overdone,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.', '“I think Nvidia knows that near term, their numbers are likely to be quite remarkable.”', 'Local News', '', '', '© 2022 St Kitts Nevis Observer / Nevis Printing Ltd.

Will Nvidia Stock Hit the $200 Mark?,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/29155133/will-nvidia-stock-hit-the-200-mark,"['Share', '', ""Nvidia (NVDA) stock has been trending steadily higher over the past couple of years, delivering stellar capital gains of about 1,053% for its shareholders since October 2022. The company is a leader in the graphics processing units (GPUs) central to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With soaring demand for its AI offerings, Nvidia is the market's top-performing mega-cap stock."", ""However, like any high-flying stock, Nvidia recently faced some turbulence. Concerns have emerged around a potential slowdown in AI spending, delays in the release of its much-anticipated AI GPU, “Blackwell,” and mounting pressure on profit margins. These issues led to a temporary pause in the stock's meteoric rise."", 'Despite these short-term concerns, Nvidia’s rally has resumed. In just one month, the stock has surged by nearly 24% - far outpacing the broader market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). This impressive bounce-back showcases investors’ confidence in the stock and the strong underlying demand for its products.', 'Year-to-date, Nvidia stock has now climbed about 190%. Interestingly, at least one Wall Street analyst believes Nvidia stock could still go higher, setting a price target of $200 per share - which is the highest on the Street.', 'With Nvidia continuing to lead in the AI market and the demand for advanced GPUs only growing, let’s explore the factors that could push Nvidia stock even higher.', 'Nvidia will release its Q3 earnings numbers next month on Nov. 20. Despite the short-term concerns, the solid demand for NVIDIA Hopper, Computing, and Networking platforms could help the company post strong Q3 results that will likely boost its share price.', 'A significant factor in Nvidia’s success is the booming growth in its Data Center revenue. Since the beginning of fiscal 2024, this segment has consistently added approximately $4 billion in revenue each quarter. In Q2 of fiscal 2025, Data Center revenue reached $26.3 billion, marking a 16% sequential growth and an impressive 154% increase year-over-year. Notably, its computing revenue has more than doubled in Q2, and its networking revenue has more than tripled compared to last year.', 'Nvidia’s strength in the Data Center space is driven by surging demand from cloud service providers (CSPs) and major companies across the consumer, internet, and enterprise sectors. Looking ahead to Q3, Nvidia’s management has guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, which represents an 8% increase quarter-over-quarter and 79% year-over-year. This positive outlook suggests that the company’s Data Center segment will continue to flourish, fueled by growing customer adoption of its Hopper architecture.', 'It’s worth noting that the Hopper H200 platform began ramping up in Q2. The platform builds on the success of its predecessor with improved memory bandwidth, making it highly attractive to large CSPs and enterprise companies. With improving supply, Nvidia expects Hopper demand to remain strong, especially in the second half of fiscal 2025.', 'Additionally, Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform is expected to make a significant contribution starting in Q4. The demand for Blackwell already exceeds supply, and Nvidia is poised to generate several billion dollars in revenue in Q4 from this platform. This strong demand is expected to carry over into the next fiscal year, providing a solid foundation for future growth.', 'Beyond its Hopper and Blackwell platforms, Nvidia’s Networking segment is also performing well, thanks partly to the strong demand for Ethernet for AI. This is expected to further boost the company’s top line in Q3.', 'While the company is likely to deliver solid top-line numbers, the Data Center mix continues to shift to new products, which could impact its margins in the short term. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s bottom line could continue to grow at a solid pace. Analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.69 per share, compared to $0.38 in the prior-year quarter.  ', 'Nvidia’s solid financials in Q3 and upbeat Q4 guidance could significantly boost its share price. To reach the $200 mark, Nvidia stock would need to rise by about 39% from current levels — a target that appears achievable, given the company’s leadership in AI and the increasing adoption of generative AI across industries.', 'Generative AI is opening new revenue streams for Nvidia’s customers, allowing them to enhance productivity and expand their businesses. This, in turn, has prompted data center operators to increase their capital spending on accelerated computing, with a particular focus on GPUs, further supporting Nvidia’s growth.', 'Nvidia’s large installed base, constant innovation, new product launches, and expanding software offerings position the company for continued growth. As a result, analysts maintain a “Strong Buy” rating on NVDA stock, with an average price target of $150.99 - which may soon be revised upward.', 'Stocks: 15 minute delay (Cboe BZX is real-time), ET.

Microsoft isn't too far behind at $3.11 trillion."", 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', ""It might seem far-fetched to predict the first company to reach $10 trillion, but it's more likely to happen than it may seem. Apple became the first U.S. company to reach a valuation of $1 trillion, which at one point seemed impossible, in August 2018, and it only took the iPhone maker another five years to reach $3 trillion -- becoming the first to pass that milestone as well."", 'If Apple was able to reach $1 trillion and then triple its valuation in just five years, it might not be as difficult as it might seem for Nvidia or one of its peers to triple in valuation, say within the next five to 10 years, to reach a market cap of $10 trillion.', 'In addition to the three $3 trillion companies, there are also five more stocks with market caps of $1 trillion or more. Those are Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Taiwan Semi, and Berkshire Hathaway.', 'In order for any of these companies to achieve a $10 trillion valuation, they will have to deliver strong growth on the top and bottom lines and likely expand their addressable markets along the way.', 'Berkshire Hathaway, the only non-tech company on the list, seems unlikely to get there as it mostly operates mature businesses that grow at a pace similar to the overall economy.', 'The rest of these businesses have faster growth rates, but the ones that are already above $3 trillion are significantly closer to the goal than those valued at around $2 trillion or less.', ""Out of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Nvidia is by far the fastest-growing. The company has reported five straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth, and while that streak is expected to end in the third quarter, analysts still expect Nvidia's blistering revenue growth to continue. The consensus calls for Nvidia to report 82% revenue growth in the third quarter and 43% in 2025 to reach $182 billion."", ""In addition to outgrowing its big tech peers, Nvidia also seems better prepared to capitalize on the next big innovation in technology, much as it has with generative AI and cryptocurrency before that. Nvidia figures to be a winner from emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles and robotics as it's established a significant competitive advantage in AI GPUs, which will be necessary to power those technologies."", 'Investors should also be mindful that the innovation that leads to the first $10 trillion company may not even be visible now.', 'The growth possibilities at Apple and Microsoft seem more constrained. Both companies dominate their respective subsectors, Apple with consumer electronics and Microsoft with enterprise software. But those categories offer less growth. Smartphones are already a mature market. Apple can coax its customers to spend more on iPhones and sell more services and accessory devices like AirPods and Apple Watches, but people generally only need one phone each.', ""Microsoft's business is more connected to enterprise tech spending, but again the upside potential is not as large as Nvidia's. It's rare for a company to, say, double its software spend in a year."", 'Whether Nvidia is able to grow to a $10 trillion valuation will depend on its ability to fend off competition, capitalize on the AI boom, and maintain, or even expand, its huge profit margins.', ""Doing that won't be easy, but it is possible, especially over a horizon of five or 10 years."", ""Apple's surge from $1 trillion in 2018 to $3.5 trillion today is a reminder that there's no strict upper limit on stock market valuations. Even as Nvidia has already delivered monster gains for investors, there's still more upside potential for the stock."", ""A $4 trillion market cap isn't too far away for Nvidia now, and over a longer time frame, $10 trillion is achievable."", ""John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia Market Cap Closing in on $3.5 Trillion: Will It Surpass Apple Soon?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/21/nvidia-market-cap-closing-in-on-35-trillion-apple/,"['', '', '', 'KEY POINTS', ""Can Nvidia's Blackwell chips propel it past Apple to become the world's most valuable company?"", '$15.7 trillion. That\'s how much PwC, one of the ""big four"" accounting firms, believes artificial intelligence (AI) could add to the global economy annually by 2030. That sort of boost doesn\'t come along very often. The technology has true revolutionary potential that we probably haven\'t seen since the introduction of the internet.', 'As the company helping drive this AI revolution like no other, Nvidia (NVDA 0.80%) has already captured a significant share of that growing market. Since the AI boom took off in late 2022, the company has added more than $3 trillion in market capitalization, currently sitting just shy of $3.4 trillion and only $190 billion or so from overtaking Apple (currently at $3.57 trillion) as the most valuable company in the world.', 'Can it pull ahead of the iPhone maker?', ""Nvidia's dominance in its industry is due largely to its superior technology. The company's chips are consistently faster and more efficient than what its competitors have to offer, which has led to its control of roughly 90% of the market. It means that last quarter, Nvidia's net income from its AI chip market was roughly 25 times that of its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices."", ""Nvidia knows this advantage is fragile, and it must do everything it can to maintain its edge. To do this, it has committed to updating its chips every year (rather than every 2-3 years), which is a tall order to be sure. At present, the company's current Hopper chips are still selling like hotcakes -- Elon Musk ordered 100,000 of them not long ago to build the world's fastest supercomputer -- but Nvidia's new Blackwell chips will begin shipping soon."", 'CEO Jensen Huang says demand for the new chips is ""insane,"" and, according to some reports, they are already sold out for the next 12 months. Nvidia is attempting to expand production, partnering with Foxconn to build the world\'s largest Blackwell production facility in Mexico. Incredibly, analysts at Morgan Stanley project that Blackwell could bring in $10 billion in added revenue before this year ends. That is much higher than the company\'s own guidance, so take this forecast with a grain of salt, but it\'s clear that demand is very strong. We\'ll see how many chips the company can actually ship.', 'Apple is growing, especially in its services segment, and Wall Street seems relatively bullish. However, reports of less-than-stellar sales of its latest iPhone model are cause for concern. There are indications that sales may have slipped in China, a key market, and at home, the company is banking on its AI integrations -- called Apple Intelligence -- which require a newer iPhone to spur upgrades and boost sales. The jury is still out on whether the changes will be impressive enough for consumers to justify an upgrade.', ""We'll learn a lot in the company's upcoming earnings release later this month. Hopefully, the company has been able to improve its iPhone sales while continuing to take advantage of its service segment, which includes things like Apple TV, Apple Music, and the Apple Store."", ""Given Nvidia's Blackwell roll-out and credible reports of demand echoing the demand from last year that spurred its incredible sales growth, I think Nvidia's share price will rise faster than Apple's, and it will take the lead position in the race for world's largest market cap."", ""However, there is a wrinkle here. The valuations of the two stocks need to be factored in. Take a look at this chart showing the two companies' price-to-earnings ratios (P/E)."", '', 'NVDA PE RATIO DATA BY YCHARTS', ""Nvidia stock trades at quite a premium, and that needs to be kept in mind. With a valuation like that, investors expect major growth. If Nvidia can't maintain its outsized growth rate, its stock price may come back down to earth. So far, it doesn't look like that growth will slow anytime soon, and since Nvidia is in high-growth mode, a different metric may be needed to gauge the stock's potential."", ""The PEG ratio -- a company's PE divided by its expected growth rate -- attempts to account for growth and is a better metric here. Conventional wisdom suggests that stocks with a PEG ratio of 1 or lower are trading at a discount. Nvidia's PEG ratio is 1.1 while Apple's is 2.4, suggesting Nvidia is the bargain here. If Nvidia continues growing as it has, its high PE is easily justified, and Apple will struggle to hold the No. 1 position."", 'Johnny Rice has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Technically, Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya used the phrase ""generational opportunity"" to describe what lies ahead for Nvidia in AI accelerators -- chips used to speed up the performance of AI tasks. However, this massive opportunity for Nvidia also presents an equally great opportunity for investors.', ""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in accelerating AI applications.

Bank of America analysts wrote to investors last week: ""We continue to see the pace of new model development increase. LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity.""', ""Unsurprisingly, Bank of America upped its price target for Nvidia. Its analysts now expect the GPU maker's share price to reach $190 within the next 12 months. That translates to a market cap of roughly $4.7 trillion.
