"3 Must-See Earnings Reports Next Week (GOOGL, META, AAPL)",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-must-see-earnings-reports-next-week-googl-meta-aapl,"['October 25, 2024 — 01:42 pm EDT', 'Written by Ethan Feller for Zacks ->', 'Next week, three of the biggest names in tech are set to report earnings, and investors will be watching closely. Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL) remain stalwarts of this market, and their quarterly earning reports not only affect their stock prices but also the broader market.', 'During this year we have seen an interesting divergence in performance among these stocks, although even the worst performer, Alphabet, has still put up a decent return. Meta Platforms has been the clear outperformer year-to-date (YTD) more than tripling the returns of the others and Apple has slightly underperformed the market.', 'The near-term outlooks for these companies are also varied, although frankly, their business supremacy is still evident, and the long-term outlooks are still very bright in my opinion. Let’s dive deeper into the details below.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Meta Platforms has been one of the best performing stocks in the market since the 2022 bear market. In terms of large cap stocks, only Nvidia has been better. Over the last two years META stock has rallied an incredible 346%. But that strong performance shouldn’t shake investors’ confidence, because it seems likely that the stock will continue to perform well.', 'META enjoys numerous bullish catalysts that should make the stock a must watch. Currently, it enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.83%. Earnings are forecast to grow at an impressive 19.15% annually over the next three to five years, while the company also has a reasonable valuation of 26.5x forward earnings, just above the market average.', 'Looking at META’s stock chart, I also see a compelling technical setup. We can see just a few weeks ago the stock broke out from a clear bull flag, which sent it to new record highs. Today, there is a very similar pattern building. If the stock can break out above the $580 level, it should send it again to new highs. However, the market may wait until the earnings report to make the move.', 'Image Source: TradingView', 'Although Alphabet stock has struggled this year when compared to Apple, Meta and the broad market, it remains one of the premier assets in the market. Its entrenched business model and growth catalysts, combined with a relatively cheap valuation, make it a must watch stock as well. GOOGL also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.', 'The growth catalysts are, I think, very exciting and surprisingly overlooked by most market participants. Self-driving cars is one of the hottest topics out there today, and Alphabet’s Waymo seems to be quietly winning the race. The self-driving technology has already been deployed in several cities across the country, completing some 100,000 rides per week by partnering with Uber Technologies (UBER). It also seems that Waymo’s technology, which uses a suite of sensors, rather than camera’s, is a superior approach. This approach will also give it a business advantage as it may be able to be implemented through software, rather than having to develop entire vehicles.', 'What is crazy to me is that even with these factors, GOOGL trades at a forward earnings multiple of 21.3x, below the market average and its 10-year median of 25.8x. It also forecasts earnings to grow 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. Finally, its Zacks Earnings ESP is 0.4%, meaning it is expected to beat earnings estimates slightly at the next report.', '', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Apple, of course one of the great stocks and companies of the world, has a slightly worse near-term outlook than the other two. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating and a worrying Zacks Earnings ESP of -17.7%. It also has the richest valuation at 30.6x forward earnings, and the lowest earnings growth projections, at 12.7% annual growth over the next three to five years.', 'However, you should never count this stock out. Because Apple’s products are so widely used, its foray into AI may become the most effective and widely used option out there. Apple Intelligence will enhance user experiences in areas like Siri, camera capabilities, health monitoring, and app functionalities, making its devices even smarter and more intuitive. I believe every incremental improvement in its products further increases our reliance on the product, deepens its moat and improves selling points.', 'Especially notable is the technical setup in AAPL stock. Although we have seen the price action trade in a sideways and volatile manner over the last four months, it has formed a very large and compelling bull flag. I would not be surprised if Apple surprised investors at its upcoming earnings and blasted higher through the breakout level. However, investors should be cautious here, as we noted the risks which could easily send the stock through the support level as well.', 'Image Source: TradingView', 'While each of these tech giants faces unique challenges, their long-term growth prospects remain strong. Meta’s robust earnings growth and favorable technical setup make it an intriguing opportunity, especially if it breaks out above key levels. Alphabet stands out for its relatively low valuation and the potential of Waymo’s self-driving technology to drive future growth. Apple, despite near-term concerns, could see upside if its AI initiatives boost user engagement and enhance product capabilities.', 'It is always hard to say if investors should buy a stock before earnings, because the results are difficult to predict, and the stocks can be extremely volatile. Nonetheless, each of these stocks offers compelling long-term opportunity and can fit into nearly any investors portfolio.', '', 'Just released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers ""Most Likely for Early Price Pops.""', 'Since 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +23.7% per year.

Worse, CVS stock has underperformed the S&P 500 by wide margins over pretty much every standardized return period you care to measure.', 'American Express (AXP) stock slid 3.2% after the payments company reported mixed results for its third quarter and raised its full-year profit forecast.', 'As a result of its strong financial performance in the first nine months of 2024, AXP now anticipates earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $13.75 to $14.05, up from its previous forecast of $13.30 to $13.80. It still expects revenue growth of around 9%.', ""AXP stock is up almost 50% for the year to date, which has some analysts becoming more cautious on the name at such levels. The Dow Jones stock carries a consensus recommendation of Hold, partly as a function of valuation. However, as a long-term investment and dividend payer, AXP has been tough to beat. That's why AXP has been one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks for half a century."", 'Netflix (NFLX) stock surged 11.1% after the streaming giant beat on all major metrics for its third quarter (revenue, earnings and paid memberships) and issued a strong outlook for its fourth quarter.', 'NFLX now anticipates Q4 revenue growth of 15% and paid net additions to be higher than in the third quarter.

For 2025, the company anticipates revenue in the range of $43 billion to $44 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 11% to 13% from its 2024 revenue forecast of $38.9 billion.', 'UBS Research analyst John Hodulik, who rates shares at Buy, said Netflix is ""planting the seeds for double-digit growth.""', ""Netflix stock was the S&P 500's top gainer on Friday, but then long-time shareholders should be used to such remunerative – if volatile – returns.

As earnings season heats up, several companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange are under the microscope. From emerging innovators to established market leaders, each faces unique challenges that will be revealed in their quarterly reports. The stakes are high, with market sentiment, stock prices, and future growth trajectories hanging in the balance. This quarter, Siyata Mobile (NASDAQ: SYTA), Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are at critical junctures that could shift the momentum of their stocks and influence broader market trends.', ""Siyata Mobile (NASDAQ: SYTA), a growing micro-cap, is set to take center stage on November 14 when it releases earnings. The company's aggressive strategy of partnering with major wireless carriers is being put to the test following a recently inked deal with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS). Siyata’s push-to-talk (PTT) technology promises to disrupt traditional communication methods, and investors are watching closely to see if these efforts result in significant revenue growth. CEO Marc Seelenfreund has touted the potential for transformation, but the company now faces its most pivotal moment. The upcoming earnings will reveal whether the capital raised to meet carrier demands will pay off or leave investors disappointed. To read a recent MicroCapReports article on Siyata Mobile, please visit: https://microcapreports.com/lander/siyata-mobile/"", 'Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) is a company striving to balance growth and cost control. As a prominent name in the electric vehicle (EV) market, Rivian has rapidly scaled its operations, but the rising costs of production are raising questions about long-term profitability. This quarter, the pressure is on for Rivian to deliver strong financial results that reassure investors about its capacity to manage expenses while continuing to grow its EV footprint. Rivian’s performance will be scrutinized as the company seeks to maintain its valuation and prove it can stand alongside giants like Tesla in the competitive EV space.', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), a leader in the global EV market, faces increasing competition from both established automakers and new entrants. Despite being a market darling for years, Tesla’s margins are under pressure due to the rising costs of materials, increased production, and the need to invest in new technologies like autonomous driving and battery development. Investors will be looking for signs of resilience in Tesla’s earnings report, particularly in how the company manages competition and continues to grow its international market share while staying profitable.', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a heavyweight in the tech sector, has enjoyed an extraordinary run as demand for its advanced chips surged alongside the rise of AI applications. However, recent regulatory pressures and slowing growth in consumer-facing products have placed Nvidia at a crossroads. This quarter, Nvidia must demonstrate that its strength in AI and data centers will continue to drive revenue growth, even as global chip demand cools. Investors are particularly eager to see whether Nvidia’s strategic investments in AI can maintain its dominant position in the semiconductor industry.', 'For each of these Nasdaq-listed companies, the upcoming earnings reports are far more than just financial check-ins—they are critical milestones that could determine the trajectory of these businesses in the near term. Whether they meet or exceed expectations will shape not only their individual stock movements but also broader market trends in sectors like technology, EVs, and AI.', 'As investor sentiment builds, market participants should prepare for a high-stakes season filled with opportunity, risk, and potential surprises.', 'About FN Media Group:', 'At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #tickertagpressreleases #pressreleases', 'Follow us on Facebook to receive the latest news updates: https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmedia\nFollow us on Twitter for real time Market News: https://twitter.com/FNMgroup\nFollow us on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/', ""DISCLAIMER: MicroCapReports is the originator of the content set forth above.

He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.', '“Huge opportunity,” he said. “Just please remember, the first move’s been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger.”', 'Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford\n. Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles.', 'Tuesday brings McDonald’s earnings report, and Cramer said to expect “a full airing of the e-coli situation,” but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states.\n\nCramer predicts Royal Caribbean\n, Reddit\nand PayPal\nto all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance.', 'Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth’s stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been “rarely in a good way.” He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn’t seem to prioritize what investors want to hear.\n\nCramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices\nwill do well enough to take parts of Nvidia’s\nbusiness. Chipotle\nwill report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol’s left the helm to run Starbucks\n, and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock.', 'Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar\nand Eli Lilly\n. Cramer said he saw the former’s machines all over Chevron’s floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn’t sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit.\n\nMeta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn’t too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding\nand DoorDash\n, will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report.', 'The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch, Cramer said ″we’ve seen this movie before″ with the company and the best strategy is to hold on.\n\nAnother moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck\nand Bristol-Myers\n, are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought.', 'On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he “can’t stress how important this number is.” He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day.\n\nCramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron’s returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition, even as Exxon doesn’t have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides.', 'Click here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.', 'Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer’s every move in the market.', 'Disclaimer', 'Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC', 'Want to take a deep dive into Cramer’s world?

Last week, the S&P 500 reached a new all-time high, marking a 23% year-to-date gain, while the Dow Jones closed above the 43,000 mark for the first time, signaling continued optimism about market growth.', 'According to Bank of America, as earnings season kicked off, 30 companies in the S&P 500 surpassed earnings expectations by an average of 5%, up from 3% at the start of the last quarter. An additional 41 S&P 500 companies reported results last week. However, with the S&P 500 currently trading at around 21.8 times forward earnings—well above its long-term average of 15.7—some analysts caution that stock valuations may be stretched. Any disappointment in these reports could trigger a market correction as investors reassess valuations.', 'As we look ahead to big tech’s upcoming releases, here’s what to watch for:', 'Microsoft delivered stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, with total revenue rising 15% year-over-year. Net income climbed to $22.04 billion, up from $20.08 billion in the same quarter last year, translating to $2.69 per share.', 'While these results were solid, investor attention was focused on Azure’s performance, which fell below expectations for the first time since 2022. Azure and other cloud services posted 29% revenue growth, but this missed consensus estimates, sparking concerns about whether Microsoft’s cloud unit is losing momentum in an increasingly competitive market.', 'Despite the Azure miss, Microsoft’s management remains optimistic about future growth, suggesting potential acceleration in the coming quarters. However, investors remain cautious, as Azure’s performance is now a critical driver of Microsoft’s overall growth, especially as cloud computing continues to gain importance across industries.', 'As Microsoft prepares to release its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings on Tuesday, Oct. 22, after market close, all eyes will be on Azure once again. Analysts are forecasting a profit of $3.10 per share, with total revenue expected to dip slightly from $64.73 billion to $64.54 billion.', 'So far this year, Microsoft shares are up 12.75%, hovering around $418.', 'IBM has made notable progress in its business, particularly with its focus on generative artificial intelligence, which played a key role in its strong performance last quarter. In its second-quarter earnings report from July, IBM exceeded analysts’ expectations, reporting a 1.9% revenue increase to $15.48 billion compared to the previous year. Net income also rose significantly to $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, up from $1.58 billion, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier.', 'Despite these gains, IBM faces several macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainties, which may impact its growth. Still, the company remains confident in its tech-driven approach, particularly in AI and cloud computing, which it believes will fuel future success.', 'As IBM prepares to release its Q3 2024 earnings on Wednesday, Oct. 23, investors are eager to see if the company can once again exceed expectations. Analysts forecast a slower profit of $2.22 per share, down from $2.43 in the previous quarter, and a slight revenue dip from $15.77 billion to $15.06 billion. If IBM delivers a strong performance—boosted by AI adoption or robust hybrid cloud growth—it could reignite investor confidence and push the share price to new highs.', 'So far this year, IBM shares are up 43.78%, hovering around $232.', 'Amazon reported softer-than-expected revenue for the second quarter, alongside a disappointing forecast for the third quarter. Net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $148.0 billion, up from $134.4 billion in the same period last year, but fell short of the $148.56 billion projected by analysts at LSEG. Despite the revenue miss, Amazon saw a significant boost in profitability, with net income climbing to $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $6.7 billion, or $0.65 per diluted share, a year ago.', 'The underwhelming revenue performance is largely attributed to sluggish growth in Amazon’s core retail business, where competition from discount platforms like Temu and Shein has intensified. These rivals, which allow Chinese merchants to sell low-cost products to U.S. consumers, are eating into Amazon’s market share. Sales in Amazon’s online stores segment grew just 5% year-over-year, reflecting consumers opting for cheaper products and leading to a decline in the company’s average selling price (ASP).', 'On the cloud front, Amazon Web Services (AWS) performed well, growing 19% year-over-year and generating $26.3 billion in revenue, surpassing estimates of $26 billion. However, AWS is expanding at a slower pace compared to its major competitors, Microsoft and Google, whose cloud divisions are growing more rapidly.', 'As Amazon looks ahead, the company faces the challenge of balancing slow retail growth with rising competition in both e-commerce and cloud computing, adding pressure to innovate and find new growth opportunities in the next quarter.', 'So far this year, Amazon shares are up 26.05%, hovering around $188.', 'Disclaimer', 'CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.

Tech Earnings Could Spark These ETFs,https://www.etftrends.com/etf-education-channel/tech-earnings-could-spark-etfs/,"['Third-quarter earnings season is in its early innings and thus far, results from the financial services sector have been solid. Soon, technology, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, will deliver widely awaited results for the September quarter to investors.', 'Those earnings reports could be the next catalysts for the already high-flying sector and could spark further upside for exchange traded funds such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM), both of which allocate about half their rosters to tech stocks.', 'Obviously, earnings are a “show me” concept, meaning positive speculation isn’t enough to satisfy investors. They want to see results. When it comes to the technology sector, it appears as though the third-quarter results are on pace to be encouraging.', 'As of Oct. 14, 110 S&P 500 companies issued third-quarter earnings guidance, with 60 of those updates being negative and 50 being positive. While that breakdown doesn’t sound appealing, some good news, particularly for QQQ and QQQM: Tech accounts for the bulk of the positive updates.', '“What is driving the higher number of S&P 500 companies issuing positive EPS guidance? At the sector level, the Information Technology sector has the highest number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance of all 11 sectors at 25,” noted FactSet’s John Butters. “This number is above the 5-year average of 19.9 and above the 10-year average of 16.5 for the sector. In fact, this is the highest number of companies in the Information Technology sector issuing positive EPS guidance for a quarter since Q3 2021 (27).”', 'Butters added that tech is the only sector to notch an increase in its bottom-up earnings per share (EPS) guidance during the third quarter. That could be indicative of good news to come for QQQ and QQQM as this earnings season unfolds.', 'In fact, the number of S&P 500 tech companies issuing positive guidance for the just-completed quarter is at its highest level in three years. It is well ahead of the sector’s five-year average for bullish earnings revisions. Another potential assist for QQQ and QQQM could come in the form of tech earnings depth, meaning multiple industries are seen contributing to the sector’s third-quarter EPS growth.', '“At the industry level, the Software (8) and Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (7) industries have the highest number of companies issuing positive EPS guidance within the Information Technology sector,” added Butters.', 'For more news, information, and strategy, visit the ETF Education Channel.']"
