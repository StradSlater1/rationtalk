The editors here at Condé Nast Traveler largely rejoiced. Few components of travel these days are as reliably lawless as the boarding process, where passengers feel compelled to stand, en masse, around the gate desk the moment boarding begins, regardless of whether or not it's their turn. Airline employees have long referred to them as “gate lice.” The assignment of boarding zones, meant to quell the crowd, has heretofore been unsuccessful due to a lack of enforcement on the part of the airlines. You cannot operate on the honor system within a system that lacks honor."", 'But what does utopia look like? Is it as simple as a quick and easy boarding process where everyone stays in their lane? Can we ignore the extenuating circumstances that drive those in later boarding groups, who refuse to pay a premium for “early” boarding, to gather so impatiently in the wings? Why are travelers so anxious to get on the plane? Below, staffers Matt Ortile, Hannah Towey, Meaghan Kenny, and Jamie Spain join me to discuss.', 'WATCH THIS', 'Only 70 People A Day Can Eat This $10 Michelin Star Ramen', 'Charlie Hobbs: Before we get into technologies being used to control the boarding process, I want to get your gut reactions to the current state of boarding, and in particular to this term “gate lice” that refers to people crowding the boarding gate before it’s their time. What do you feel when you see this?', 'Meaghan Kenny: My first thought when you asked us to debate gate lice was, “What do I think of somebody boarding a flight knowing they have lice?”', '[Laughter]', 'Now that I know what that term means, I would put them in the same category as people who, as soon as you land, jump up to grab their bags and try to get ahead of everybody. It creates chaos, people can’t see or hear what’s going on. It’s not like there’s open seating on the plane, just relax, you’ll get to your seat.', 'CH: Even Southwest has done away with its open seating.', 'Jamie Spain: I find the gathering and crowding to be a problem when it obstructs people whose turn it actually is to board, which slows everyone down—why are you doing this?', 'Hannah Towey: Here’s why, I think: you desperately want your carry-on bag to have the overhead bin space. It’s another situation where the airlines are pitting us against each other when it’s really their fault, because why should passengers have to fight for overhead bin space? There should be enough for everyone—it should be guaranteed.', 'When I don’t have a carry-on bag, I’ll just sit during boarding til everyone’s on the plane. It doesn’t matter. But I have lost a bag before and so I do understand the stakes of wanting to be first in your group so you don’t have to check your bag at the gate. You pay for everything else, you pay to check your bag, so you shouldn’t have to also pay by way of priority boarding just to make sure your carry-on can make it on the plane.', '[Murmurs of agreement]', 'CH: Not to defend the airlines, and they probably have some hand in this as well, but the inefficiency of boarding is also an airport scale problem, though. This past weekend, coming back from Montreal, I landed at LaGuardia and disembarked but once we got into the airport proper, there was no getting through. The gates on either side of mine had flights boarding, and the two crowds were so chaotic that there was no room for the people getting off my flight to even move through the airport.', 'HT: Airport design definitely contributes to the chaos. I was just at Heathrow, and they had this weird situation where there was nowhere to sit outside the gate. Instead, they unlocked the door to a separate boarding area down the hallway fifteen minutes before boarding. But that was also annoying because I had a few hours to burn and hundreds of travelers were packed into this one communal area instead of waiting by their respective gates.

The technology will play an audible noise whenever a passenger tries to board before their group is called, notifying agents to ask the passenger to step out of the boarding order until it’s their turn. ', 'The airline currently boards passengers in nine groups, starting with First Class passengers and top-tier frequent fliers, and slotting in the rest by seating upgrade, holders of credit card holders, passengers who pay extra for priority boarding, and others. Passengers who have purchased American’s no-frills Basic Economy fare board in Group 9. ', 'Most other carriers follow the same procedure, and many airlines—including American—are dogged by passengers who aren’t aware of or don’t follow the boarding order. This creates congestion in the gate area and onboard the aircraft, and dilutes the benefit of priority boarding for passengers who have paid for it or earned it with frequent flights. ', 'Earlier boarding is a sought-after privilege, because it’s more comfortable to board early in the process before overhead bins are full of carryon bags, and already seated passengers must be asked to move so later-arriving passengers can take their seats. On full flights, the latest boarding passengers are often unable to find space for their carryon bags, and they must be checked at the gate, delaying passengers on arrival who must now wait for their bags to arrive on the carousel.

Agents could check the group number or seat assignment to verify whether a passenger was boarding early. Now, with the rise of boarding passes on mobile devices, which passengers scan on their own, agents don’t have the time to turn passengers away before they can scan their device. Once they’ve scanned, passengers should continue boarding to allow for correct boarding counts. ', 'The new system will not only play a sound alerting agents that a passenger is attempting to board early, it will also reject the boarding pass from boarding, and alert the agent which group the passenger should board with. This system is already common in Europe, where many airlines use automated boarding gates similar to those used on US mass transit systems. At Oslo Airport, for example, the boarding passes won’t scan to open an automated boarding gate if a passenger attempts to board early, while an automated message displayed advises them to wait their turn. ', 'Airlines have long looked for ways to manage the boarding process, which is one of the most stressful points in the journey for modern air travelers. Early jets boarded First Class and Economy Class via two separate sets of stairs at the back and front of the aircraft, but as flights grew more crowded after deregulation in 1978 (when airfares dropped to within the means of the vast majority of travelers) and aircraft began boarding only from forward doors via jet bridges, it created a bottleneck.', 'Airlines used to manage the process in rows, from the back of the aircraft toward the front. But as frequent flier programs grew more complicated and extra fees in addition to fares grew more complex, they needed a way to stratify passengers by status. Now, airlines essentially board passengers in order of importance, although many make exceptions, allowing families, passengers with disabilities, and active-duty service members to board first, regardless of which group they’ve been assigned. ', 'American’s new system could alleviate frustrations among travelers over those who attempt to skirt the rules and board early, and that could make travel easier for everyone—except those who try to break the rules.', 'It is utterly ridiculous to make everyone in the back of the plane struggle past the front of the plane, who are blocking the aisle trying to put their luggage away and get seated. Perhaps in the future the priority seats could be built in the back of the plane, where they could be seated first and not have the cheap-seat passengers stare at them as they hit their armrests wirh oversize carry-ons and Hannah Montana pillows on the way to their seats.', 'It used to be that way until the airlines figured out how to monetize seating.
