The inconvenient truth about Trump and Musk’s bromance,https://www.the-independent.com/voices/editorials/donald-trump-elon-musk-b2633001.html,"['', 'Editorial: A US administration headed by the disgraced former president and bankrolled by the SpaceX billionaire hardly bears contemplation. Far from being ‘America First’, it would be ‘Donald and Elon First’', 'T\no borrow the question famously posed by the late Caroline Aherne in character as Mrs Merton: “What first attracted Donald Trump to the multi-billionaire Elon Musk?” And, indeed: “What first attracted Elon Musk to the next prospective president of the United States?”', 'These are legitimate questions, and their implications should trouble anyone concerned about the future of democracy in the United States, and, by extension, where freedom has so far managed to survive elsewhere on the planet.', 'To be fair to this odd couple, they have some things in common. Both have outsized egos, with that of Mr Musk now grown too large to be accommodated on a single planet, Earth. In normal circumstances, the collision of two such over-confident, self-obsessed and sometimes deranged personalities would cause something of an explosion.', 'But in this case, there seems only love, tendresse and, certainly in Mr Musk’s case, a near-slavish devotion, witnessed by anyone with the inner emotional resilience to have made it through their lengthy “conversation” on Mr Musk’s very own social media channel, X (now a MAGA propaganda machine, as well as host to some troubling racism).', 'Areas where there might have been some conflict, such as electric vehicles – ridiculed by Mr Trump, manufactured by Mr Musk – were smoothed over. After the first assassination attempt on Mr Trump, Mr Musk has gone “all in” for him.', 'The man behind SpaceX and Tesla, previously a mildly progressive Democrat who mostly steered clear of politics, is now posting frequent support for the Trump campaign, has appeared jumping for joy at a Trump rally, and is now organising a contentious million-dollar-a-day lottery aimed at mobilising the Trump “base”, to get out and vote in Pennsylvania, a swing state. A million bucks may be life-changing for many Pennsylvanians; yet it hardly registers for a man worth some $257bn.', 'Ideologically, the primary bond is a shared revulsion at so-called “woke” culture and an abhorrence of trans rights. Quite why a sense of social and racial injustice, which is all “woke” amounts to, should drive these comfortable, wealthy men to distraction isn’t entirely clear, but it is very real. Mr Musk calls it “the woke mind-virus” and views it as an existential threat to civilisation in America. He shares with Mr Trump a taste for slashing the size – and budgets – of the federal government.', 'Mr Musk, himself an economic migrant, shares the disgust that former president Trump (who happens to be married to another economic migrant) evinces at the arrival of the murderous pet-eaters at the border. Mr Trump’s protectionist, tax-cutting, expansionist economic policies would probably balloon the deficit, inflate the currency, and trigger a trade war with China, but both men prefer to gloss over such inconvenient truths.', 'They are, then, broadly united in their outlook, albeit with some suppressed differences, but this partnership is also driven by a confluence of mutual self-interest – a relationship thoroughly corrosive to good governance. Mr Trump has, as ever, an insatiable demand for flattery and campaign funds, and the $45m-plus per month Mr Musk is giving to the Trump cause is obviously coming in handy.', 'It can’t disguise the alarming and mysteriously sudden decline in Mr Trump’s cognitive performance, but, combined with the backing of X and the lottery, might well make the difference between winning and losing in places such as Pennsylvania. Put at its crudest, Mr Musk is helping Mr Trump buy and bribe his way to the White House in a manner unprecedented in the history of the Republic.', 'In return? Nothing so crude as a quid pro quo, but it would be a surprise if Mr Trump, the proud author of a bloviating book entitled The Art of the Deal, wasn’t going to look after his ally. He has already suggested that he would appoint Mr Musk to his administration to carry out, presumably, the same erratic, wild cost-cutting he has periodically inflicted on Tesla and Twitter.', 'It would equally be a surprise if Mr Musk didn’t find a way to advantage his own commercial interests, via trade policy towards China, the relaxation of federal oversight and regulation of SpaceX and, perhaps, a reliable flow of federal contracts. From what we know of Mr Musk’s views, he would have no objection to Mr Trump’s policies on abortion, trans rights and consigning millions of settled but undocumented migrants to concentration camps to await deportation.', 'The reality of an American government headed by Mr Trump, propagandised by Steve Bannon and JD Vance and run by Elon Musk, hardly bears contemplation. With the restructuring of the Supreme Court, emasculation of the Federal Reserve, the promise to clear out the civil service and wreak revenge, there would be virtually no guard rails on a second Trump administration. Far from being “America First”, it would be “Donald and Elon First”.', 'Mr Musk would be allowed to conduct any number of crazed experiments on the US government, regardless of the law or the consequences for average Americans. It would be a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, for the billionaires. American democracy itself, at least as we have come to know it, might not survive.', 'The sooner the pair head off to Mars, the better.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

In this election cycle, it’s more important than ever to provide context beyond the headlines. But in-depth reporting is costly, so to continue this vital work, we have an ambitious goal to add 5,000 new members.', 'We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'When it comes to politics, Elon Musk’s ideas are utterly, revealingly conventional.', 'by Zack Beauchamp', 'I write a newsletter called On the Right, which covers the often-complicated and compelling political ideas driving the modern conservative movement. This week, I thought it’d be important to cover Elon Musk, a man who is single-handedly bankrolling much of Donald Trump’s ground game. What are the ideas that drive an engineering titan to make such a sharp turn into politics?', 'But reporting on Musk’s worldview led me to a perhaps surprising conclusion: His politics are boring.', 'His social politics are taken straight from the X replies he frequents — a specific type of edgelord bigotry that drifts frequently into debunked conspiracy theories. His economic views are even less interesting — the same tired hostility toward taxation and regulation that you hear from most people of his economic strata. For someone who has done such innovative work on cars and rocket ships, his politics could scarcely be more conventional.', 'Yet for all their boringness, I realized Musk’s ideas were worth writing about anyway.', 'The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.', 'This is true, in part, because of his sheer financial investment — one that Trump himself estimates at roughly $500 million in total. The eye-popping sum together with stunts like the possibly illegal million-dollar-a-day raffle for registered swing state voters demand some scrutiny of the man behind it all. While Musk may not successfully buy the election, he has succeeded in purchasing our collective attention.', 'Perhaps more importantly, the unoriginality of Musk’s politics is revealing in itself. In Musk, we see Trumpism as it truly is: not a war between populists and small-government types, but a marriage of them.', 'In the conventional picture of the modern GOP, the Trumpian culture warriors are described as “populists” comfortable with big government who are being held back by their super-rich allies. The super-rich, in turn, are described as cultural libertines who put up with the race-baiting and xenophobia to get their tax cuts.', 'Yet this picture is misleading, capturing only part of the dynamic. And no one shows why more clearly than Elon Musk.', 'He is a gullible conspiracy theorist chummy with white nationalists, true — but he is also a plutocrat who believes that the greatest kind of freedom is letting big corporations do whatever they want.', 'In this, he exposes the flaw in the popular analysis the new GOP is beset by a fundamental contradiction between populists and elites when, in fact, the priorities of the culture warriors and the wealthy are often one and the same.', 'Musk’s town hall in Pittsburgh on Sunday — which began with about 30 minutes of Musk free-associating on politics followed by an hour and a half of questions — provided one of the most unvarnished looks yet into his political worldview. In front of a friendly audience, with all the time in the world, Musk was free to say whatever he wanted.', 'He sounded exactly like the person he is on X.', 'When warning about the risks of a Kamala Harris presidency, for example, Musk dismisses the vice president as an irrelevancy. “There’s almost no point in attacking Kamala personally because she’s just a puppet of the Dem machine,” he says.', 'Many of his fears about this machine’s agenda — like “wide-open borders” and “freedom of speech taken away” — are classic Trump-right themes. But his crowning fear, the one that he says pushed him into investing so heavily in the Trump campaign, is that the Democrats are importing “illegals” to replace native-born American voters.', '“There’s a massive increase in the number of illegals being put in swing states,” Musk said. “The goal will then be, over the next four years, to legalize all of those illegals. … Every swing state will be blue. America will be a one-party state forever, just like California. And that will be a nightmare — democracy gone. That’s what I think will happen with a Kamala presidency.”', 'This, as my colleague Li Zhou explains, is top-to-bottom nonsense.', 'Musk’s claim that the undocumented population in swing states is surging, sourced to unspecified “government data,” appears false: Data from both Homeland Security and Pew Research Center debunks Musk’s claim of a Biden-era surge in undocumented immigrants to swing states. (In a few swing states, undocumented populations have shrunk, whereas in others, they’ve increased slightly or been stagnant.) Migrants aren’t being “put” in those states by anyone, let alone Democrats — that’s not how undocumented migration works. Nor is there any evidence Harris has a viable plan to grant them all citizenship in four years or proof they’d all vote for Democrats forever once given the franchise.', 'Really, what Musk is doing is taking a hoary old white nationalist trope — the “Great Replacement” mainstreamed by X’s most prominent talk show host, Tucker Carlson — and reiterating it with dubious swing-state demographic data. More or less what you’d expect from the guy who once told an X user ranting about Jews that “you have said the actual truth.”', 'Musk had one other big policy theme throughout the town hall: deregulation. Again and again, he returned to his fervent desire to shrink government so that private industry can work its alleged magic — employing tired anti-government rhetoric that could have been cribbed from any national Republican campaign since Ronald Reagan.', '“The larger government gets, the less individual freedom you have,” Musk said. “They’re currently making new agencies at a rate of two per year, and every one of them is chipping away at your freedom. It’s essential for us to unwind that process and restore your personal freedom — and with that will come great prosperity and personal happiness.”', 'One might note the irony of a man whose companies benefit immensely from subsidies and government contracts proposing to starve the beast. But Musk, for his part, seems unconcerned.', '“Rich guy supports Republicans to eliminate regulations and increase profits” is a tale as old as time. But what’s interesting about Musk is that he pairs it with an almost naive faith in the rankest culture war conspiracies: the sorts of thing the ultra-wealthy aren’t supposed to believe.', 'Theoretically, the Republican Party is torn between its “populist” and “establishment” wings. The populists are culture warriors who take a more government-friendly line on the economy; the establishment are elite cultural squishes and free market dogmatists.', 'Yet this stylized description has never really captured the reality on the ground. Trump, the populist-in-chief, is a billionaire whose sole first-term legislative accomplishment was a tax cut for the wealthy. And many of the party’s big-money elite — including Musk, Rebekah Mercer, and Bill Ackman — are all-in on the culture war.', 'In emerging as Trump’s leading surrogate, Musk helps bring this reality to the fore. His unoriginality, cribbing equally from X trolls and hoary anti-government cliches, shows us what the true priorities of a second Trump term might be. Not the faux populism of JD Vance and staged McDonald’s shifts, but the co-equal prioritization of culture and class war — both waged on the wealthy’s behalf.', 'This story was adapted from the On the Right newsletter.

Jumping Sycophant’s Support Made Some Young Men Less Likely to Vote for Trump,https://www.jezebel.com/jumping-sycophants-support-made-young-men-less-likely-to-vote-for-trump,"['In July, Elon Musk formally endorsed Donald Trump, who once said Musk would “drop to his knees and beg” at his direction—turns out Trump was right! Not only that, but Musk dumped over $70 million into a super PAC for Trump and, as of this weekend, is using the PAC to give out $1 million per day until Election Day to newly registered swing state voters. Musk’s desperation for Trump’s approval is boundless: Earlier this month, at their first joint rally, he managed to debase himself further, becoming (even more of) a laughing stock as he hopped and skipped out on stage, twice leaping up into the air as Trump looked on with poorly concealed disgust.', 'But as Musk puts the full weight of both his bank account and his bizarre little leaps behind Trump’s presidential bid, he might be doing more harm to the former president than good. According to a new poll of 18 to 29-year-old men published on Tuesday by Blueprint, “70% of male voters, but just 61% of the youngest of them, know about Elon Musk’s endorsement of Trump.” Of these male voters 24% said Musk’s endorsement made them more likely to support Trump—but 28% said it makes them less likely. While 45% said Musk’s endorsement “has no impact” on who they support.', '', 'I’m no pollster, but I’m hardly under the impression that a serially accused sexual predator who publicly threatened to impregnate Taylor Swift improved Trump’s standing among women voters. Campaigning with Musk was probably meant to mobilize the men’s rights crowd that Musk has spent the last several years rising through the ranks of. But apparently that hasn’t translated into much, or any, added support among male voters.', 'If anything, Musk seems to be a liability in Trump’s quest to prove to young, male voters that he’s hip and cool instead of a 78-year-old man who goes nonverbal and sways to “Hallelujah” at campaign events. Former midwestern, high school football coach and current Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz also capitalized on Musk’s noted void of coolness at a Tuesday rally: “I will talk about [Trump’s] running mate. His running mate: Elon Musk. Elon is on that stage jumping around, skipping like a dipshit,” Walz said, to uproarious applause. A clip of this comment is now making the rounds as social media users join Walz in a laugh or three at Musk’s expense.', '', 'Trump’s certainly clocked Musk’s bizarre physical stunts at his rallies. During an October 9 rally, Trump said he “[thinks] Elon Musk is great,” nodding to Musk “jumping around” and “doing jumping jacks and stuff.” I imagine if someone were bank-rolling my entire field operation and attempting to bribe the entire electorate of swing state voters, I’d have to pretend to think they were “great” and tolerate their “jumping jacks and stuff,” too.', 'Except… Musk’s politicking has been unhelpful. Not only is Musk facing legal threats for appearing to illegally offer money to people who register to vote, but the super PAC he started to support Trump is reportedly faking voter contact data, which could seriously hurt Trump’s campaign in states like Arizona and Nevada in this final stretch.', 'Excellent gambit, sir. And an “excellent gambit, sir” to Trump, too, for always fully understanding what a fraud Musk is, and handing him such an outsized role in his campaign anyway.

His most commonly articulated reason is that it’s a hedge against existential risks on Earth, but the lack of a more affirmative case (aside from “we want Starfleet to be real,” as he added Saturday) reflects the core of his and some tech-world brethren’s increasing mind-meld with the former president: their belief that a kind of restless change, absent any inherent quality, goal or direction, is a virtue in its own right.', 'This was originally published on Digital Future Daily, POLITICO’s afternoon newsletter about the new forces and players shaping the world. Subscribe here.', 'Of course progress can mean connecting with people across the world instantly, or mapping the human genome, or wiping out polio. But there’s also a dark side: critics have pointed out that a faith in progress detached from any driving values or traditions can hollow out a culture — allowing for-profit companies to set the terms of how society interacts with their products. The critic Neil Postman, in his 1992 book “Technopoly,” saw a gullible public essentially allowing its own brainwashing. And he thought a country like America was particularly vulnerable — a country with “a democratic ethos, relatively weak traditions and a high receptivity to new technologies.”', 'But you don’t have to take Postman’s dark view of technology to acknowledge that Musk and his foes have a radically different view of its role in society. Musk believes that technological advancements are the catalyst to lead humanity into a glorious future, while their critics, including Democrats and many tech nonprofits (as well as some of the biggest tech firms), believe that without strong democratic control, they might create a self-justifying doom loop that serves only the interest of tech developers and their business partners.', 'President Joe Biden’s major AI executive order, which Republicans have vowed to repeal, stresses putting human values first. Leading figures like Stanford researcher Fei-Fei Li push for “human-centered” artificial intelligence. The European Union’s sweeping AI Act pledged to regulate AI in a manner consistent with “EU values and rules.”', 'The idea of directing technological development in accordance with any given group’s values — even at a societal scale — is anathema to Musk and Trump.', 'Musk’s tech-first values could take on outsized importance on the national stage. If Trump wins, the mogul has agreed to head up a new “Department of Government Efficiency,” something he insisted Saturday will be focused on “making sure that there are incentives for excellent work.”', '“Whatever you incentivize will happen,” Musk said, using the example of Hurricane Helene, which he claimed was poorly managed. “But if you have a failed response to the hurricane disasters, and no one even gets fired, well, okay, what do you expect? No one’s going to take action.”', 'The intersection of technology and the natural forces unleashed by Helene are a perfect example of how Musk’s “technopolist” politics might work, although one’s results may vary. There were two immediate, clear repercussions of the disaster for Musk’s business empire: One, his Starlink satellites provided much-needed internet and cellular coverage to those impacted by Hurricane Helene earlier this month — at least those who already owned a Starlink kit.', 'At the same time, his X social media platform and its hands-off approach to moderation meant that false information about outright warfare between North Carolinians and the Federal Emergency Management Agency spread like wildfire in that hurricane’s aftermath.', 'Both outcomes are neutrally downstream from the “incentives” created by the technology itself — in Starlink’s case reliable internet access to remote areas, and in X’s case a completely open and unmediated channel for global communication. One helped the public, and one hurt. But both benefit Musk, a perfect case study for the “neutral,” tech-first idea of progress he and Trump are touting.', '', '© 2024 POLITICO LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

I had predicted Elon Musk would end up a recluse living atop a Vegas penthouse within ten years. Watching Ice Station Zebra on a tape loop and urinating in bottles. Not quite a Bond quality villain but certainly Batman worthy. But who knew? Elon was playing footsie with his personal pal, Vladimir Putin.', 'The Soviet trained KGB agent who intrigued his way to the top of the heap versus Gomer Pyle. The lottery winner turned political genius. The curse of success is to feel you’re always right. Puffed up with bourgeois self-importance and wisdom just looking for new and fresher fields to share it all with us.', 'Elon is this century’s, Henry Ford. Henry once had his own newspaper “The Dearborn Independent.” Ford dealers were required to sell it. Henry just had so much wisdom to share and there just wasn’t enough room in all the other papers. Screeds so vile and anti-Semitic Adolf Hitler was a big fan and admirer. The Nazi warlord even sent Henry Ford a medal in admiration for his fine work. During the Great Depression Ford said the depression would all be worth it if it taught workers to be more responsible.', 'Ford managed to go from being one of the most admired Americans to one of the most despised, in just ten years. Things move faster today than in those quaint times. Ford was seen as a greedy money-grubbing Mr. Burns character’ cynical and awful. The symbol of ugly, ugly Capitalism. I think, therefore I am. I have money; therefore, I am important! Even if you don’t know your ass from a hole in the ground. With money, you too can be important and can be a player in world affairs.', 'For folks like you and me, and probably most of your friends, but you know them better than I do. Would take that wealth and screw off a lot. See the world. See how much cocaine and champagne it took to have a fun night in Paris or Monaco or Los Angeles. I’m just a man of simple tastes, I guess. A sailboat, a full larder and a full pipe and I’m good. Sail the world enjoying the luxurious fortuitous life of leisure and yacht racing or polo ponies or Arabian stallions.', 'Or when you get tired of masturbating on heaps of your own money you could get involved in politics. You could just dip your toes in. After all, what is wealth for if not to buy advantage. Like Citizen Kane, when you get tired of framing public opinion the megalomania made Kane try to become public opinion and brought about his downfall.', 'Capitalism is an illness. The more you have the sicker you become. Folks like you and me, and my friends,  don’t have enough money to suffer any serious symptoms. But give us a billion dollars or two and watch the symptoms bloom. I’d bitch about the airport fees parking my jet. And the high cost of Supreme Court Justices. It’s just so goddamned hard to be an honest billionaire in this country! No, Elon could just sit at home and watch his fortune blot out the sky. But no, Elon wants to be important. He wants to sit in chair number one in the center of the TV picture for all the SpaceX launches. He’s important! He’s vital, he signs the checks.', 'Elon bought Twitter to be his Dearborn Independent. To reflect Elon’s values as Elon’s free press. Twitter never made any money and under Elon’s stewardship it’s making even less. But why should Elon care, it’s only money. For Elon, money is like oxygen; there is an endless supply.', 'Elon recently said that if Donald Trump didn’t win the election, he Elon, would be fucked. His terminology not mine, and I took it as being hyperbolic. But maybe, Elon knew the Wall Street Journal story was about to break. If Elon’s been calling Vladimir on the sly, I bet I know who gave him the number. I bet I know the interlocutor between them.', 'Elon is giving money away in a petition drive turned voting raffle scheme. Phones have lit up in the Justice Department. Now with Elon’s covert conversations with a serial killer, mass murderer and funder of world terrorism, more phones will light up. SpaceX better speed up building the Starship (Pretentious much?) Elon might need a getaway rocket. Mars or bust! He could live like a Bond villain is his own secret space station behind the moon.', 'It’s true! Elon is correct. If Donald Trump doesn’t win the election, he Elon, is fucked. Destined for the Bernie Madoff Suite at the Jeffrey Epstein Arms. There’s a Japanese proverb which says. The nail that sticks up gets hammered down. Suddenly, all those juicy government contracts are in jeopardy due to security concerns. But wait! Those contracts are related to the military and national security, and we can’t just cancel them.', 'What to do, what to do? How can we maintain our SpaceX contracts and assure ourselves there will be no security leaks to our adversaries? Isn’t it obvious? Somebody has got to go. Either obscurity or prison. With Elon persisting in his vote raffle scheme, despite warnings, the decision might have already been made and the die cast.', 'You don’t tug on Superman’s cape; you don’t spit in the wind. You don’t pull the mask off the old lone Ranger, and you don’t mess around with the United States government. Stick your head up and watch what happens next. “Not me! I’m too important to get arrested! They wouldn’t dare!” Yes, they would.', '', '“The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerated the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself.

Musk’s appearance marked the first time a US billionaire so publicly showed support for a presidential candidate, signifying a full alliance between the two.', 'Musk is going all in with his support for Trump. Although his public endorsement came only in July, Trump’s Twitter (now X) ban partly motivated Musk’s acquisition of the platform two years ago. Musk viewed the ban as both an infringement on free speech, which he highly values, and a politically motivated move by the Democrats, fueling his shift toward the Republican Party.', 'If he could secure a million additional votes for Trump, it would almost certainly guarantee victory in the swing states and the presidency.', 'At the start of the new election cycle, Musk specially funded the America PAC (a super political action committee formed to raise funds and back Donald Trump). According to a report by political finance tracking and nonprofit organisation OpenSecrets, the PAC has spent over US$77 million as of October this year, with approximately US$41 million supporting the Republicans and at least US$35 million directly opposing the Democrats. ', 'On 7 October, Musk also posted a petition on his social media accounts supporting the First and Second Amendments of the US Constitution, which pertain to gun rights and freedom of speech, the main campaign propositions that differentiate Trump from the Democrats. Musk publicly promised a reward of US$47 for each referral of a registered swing state voter that signs his petition, with the goal of getting 1 million signatures.', 'This strategy cleverly circumvents US legal restrictions, as federal law prohibits the buying and selling of votes — but paying for signatures or recommendations for a petition is not illegal.

His conservative stance, consistently emphasised during his presidency and campaigns, includes policies favourable to the wealthy, such as tax cuts and trade protectionism. However, he has also been critical of big tech companies, accusing them of controlling speech and exaggerating environmental concerns.', 'Musk’s primary source of income comes from his electric vehicle company Tesla, and he needs the government to strengthen environmental efforts and support the use of new energy technologies.

', 'This arguably unprecedented, overt fusion of money and politics challenges established norms and backroom dealings, making it a moment worth remembering regardless of the outcome.', 'At the same time, mindful of the impact on Silicon Valley’s tech giants, Trump has softened his anti-monopoly rhetoric during the campaign. He now emphasises tackling government bureaucracy, supporting Musk’s proposal for a government efficiency committee, and has even hinted at the possibility of Musk leading it.', 'The Trump-Musk alliance in the US presidential election — regardless of its ultimate success — will have a long-term impact on American society, particularly its political landscape. It marks a shift in how the wealthy wield political influence, with a major financier openly entering the electoral arena.', 'This arguably unprecedented, overt fusion of money and politics challenges established norms and backroom dealings, making it a moment worth remembering regardless of the outcome.', 'Democracy could be an even more distant concept', 'This alliance also highlights the role of personality in American politics; both Trump and Musk are strikingly individualistic. Trump has maintained his image as a political outsider, defying conventions and distancing himself from traditional politicians to forge a unique campaign path.', 'Meanwhile, driven by immense confidence in his wealth and image, Musk openly champions Trump. While not representative of all wealthy individuals, his actions could embolden others to engage more directly in politics.', 'This alliance also tests the extent to which money, media and other means can influence US politics. Although its effects have been proven many times, Musk’s direct involvement might serve as a counterexample of whether money’s influence in American politics is limited or even ineffective.', 'In a media interview on 7 October, Musk joked that if Trump were to lose, he himself is finished, expressing concern that political persecution from the Democrats could land him in jail. This highlights how much he has invested in this endeavour as well as his willingness to bear the consequences.', 'When Trump and Musk join forces, they could be considered one of the most powerful alliances in the world.

Elon Musk has met with politicians from at least 13 different countries: Here’s what he has talked about,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/tech/elon-musk-political-meetings-influence-dg/index.html,"['Over the past three years, Elon Musk has met dozens of times with presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, government officials and political candidates from around the world.', 'Some of these meetings have been highly publicized, like his visit to Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following criticism over an antisemitic post Musk boosted on X. Other meetings, such as a recent conversation with Argentine President Javier Milei, the world only glimpses through the billionaire’s social media posts.', 'Known topics of conversation ranged from business opportunities for Musk’s companies to elections and policy issues such as trade, energy, education and population management, according to a CNN review of Musk’s meetings, calls and conversations with political figures around the world since August 2021. Although some of his relationships with those leaders go back even further, in that time, Musk has gone from being one of the world’s wealthiest and most influential businessmen to an increasingly powerful player in global affairs.', 'Taken together, the meetings show how Musk has been courted not only for his companies and deep pocketbook but also for his ability to impact the course of wars through his Starlink satellite service; his opinion on artificial intelligence, the next major wave of technology development; and his role in swaying public opinion through his platform, X.', 'On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials, including about Starlink, since late 2022. CNN has not independently confirmed the conversations, so they are not included in our analysis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN the report was “absolutely false.” He said Musk and Putin have only ever spoken once, adding that the conversation was over the phone and took place before 2022. Musk’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.', 'For Musk, conversations with world leaders are a virtuous cycle: The six prominent companies he owns or runs give him an in with those figures, whose support often fuels their growth. In turn, those leaders’ interest in attracting Musk’s business provides an opportunity for him to advise on some of his other pet interests, such as global birth rates and immigration.', 'At the same time, the South Africa-born billionaire has become a political power player in his adopted home, the United States. He held livestream campaign events on X for presidential hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who both later dropped out of the race, as well as former President Donald Trump. Musk has since thrown his weight — and tens of millions of dollars — behind Trump, attending and hosting rallies on his behalf and criticizing (and, in some cases, spreading false information about) his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on X.', '“He’s trying to be a global influencer, and I guess he’s decided he needs to do more than use X,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.', 'Of course, it’s not unusual for corporate leaders to sometimes meet with government officials, and Musk is not the only big business name to publicly weigh in on the upcoming US presidential election.', 'But the extent of Musk’s public political involvement is unusual for the chief executive of a public company like Tesla — as well as the owner of several powerful private firms, executive leadership experts told CNN.', '“What’s different about it is that there’s a political aspect, and most CEOs steer clear of politics,” Lewis said. “They’re going to the head of another state, basically, to make the commercial conditions better for their product, maybe to lobby on a certain point, but they don’t usually do politics,” he said, adding that with Musk, “there’s a political tone to everything he does.”', 'At least some of Musk’s political relationships appear to have benefited his companies. In May 2022, Musk met with the then-President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to mark the launch of Starlink in the country, a major new market for the satellite business. In February 2023, he held calls with then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about a new Tesla manufacturing plant in the state of Nuevo Leon, for which the company later received $153 million worth of incentives from the state. In May 2023, he held meetings with Chinese government officials shortly after Tesla announced plans for a new battery plant in Shanghai; Musk made a surprise return to China this April for a visit with Premier Li Qiang, weeks before the company broke ground on the facility.', 'Even more world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have met with Musk to ask Tesla to invest in their countries.', 'CNN’s analysis includes only meetings for which at least some information is publicly available. It’s possible the billionaire has calls or meetings with leaders that he does not post about.', '“One might say he doesn’t have to pay lobbyists, because he’s his own lobbyist, globally,” said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School who focuses on executive leadership. But, he added, “when you’ve got other people’s money at stake, you have to moderate your activities … when you get into these extremes, you can impact your business.”', 'Musk has not hesitated to deal in extremes. He’s warned of the downfall of America if Democrats are elected, pushed false conspiracy theories on topics such as mail-in voting and warned in public events of a “woke mind virus” that threatens society’s advancements.', 'Separately, Musk has also taken heat for boosting an antisemitic conspiracy theory, racist false claims about immigration and the dangerous ‘Pizzagate’ conspiracy, as well as posting a Holocaust joke on X.', 'Recently, Musk’s political activism has begun to have a tangible impact on his companies: Brands pulled their advertisements from X, tanking its value. And SpaceX earlier this month sued a California regulator after it allegedly denied a bid to allow more rocket launches over the billionaire’s controversial comments, claiming it had violated Musk’s freedom of speech. (The agency did not comment on the suit.)', 'CNN’s analysis also suggests that Musk has, in particular, worked to develop influence among a set of right-leaning world leaders, including Modi, Bolsonaro, Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.', '“He’s probably more comfortable with them … these are people who want to meet with him, and not everyone wants to meet with Elon Musk,” Lewis said. “It’s birds of a feather. He likes visiting people who are going to be pleased to be receiving Elon Musk.”', 'During a conference for Italy’s far-right Brothers of Italy party last year, Musk railed against “illegal immigration” and the “woke mind virus” that he said was gripping the US. Musk called it “evil” and warned of it moving to Italy.', 'India’s Modi, who was recently reelected for a rare third consecutive term, used his plans for electric vehicle manufacturing growth — including conversations with Musk about a potential Tesla factory — as a campaign talking point, although a meeting in India between the two men earlier this year where Musk was expected to announce the facility was rescheduled.', 'Musk has also met with Milei multiple times in his first year leading Argentina, during which time the president has faced protests over a huge spike in poverty rates as a result of austerity measures. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” Musk said in an X post following a May meeting between the pair. In another post last month, Musk said, “Milei is bringing prosperity to Argentina.” (Argentina is home to huge stores of lithium, an essential component in batteries like the ones used in Tesla’s cars.)', 'Now, as he campaigns for Trump, Musk may be setting himself up for his most prominent political role yet: a position in a possible future Trump White House. Musk and Trump have publicly discussed having the billionaire lead a new government efficiency commission — which Musk has jokingly referred to as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency — if the former president is reelected.', 'Methodology: CNN’s analysis is based on information compiled from news reports, X posts and press releases.

In the final days of a U.S. presidential election that may decide the fate of the republic, one player has emerged with a hand so large that his influence can no longer be ignored: Elon Musk.', 'On October 24, 2024, Tesla surged to its best day in many years, adding $26 billion to Musk’s net worth in the span of a single trading day. The financial windfall increased Musk’s wealth to stratospheric levels, but the implications of his newfound fortune extend beyond mere numbers on a balance sheet. This isn’t about just another billionaire getting richer. It’s about a man who has already poured over $100 million into Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, and who now, flush with even more cash, is poised to push his political influence to unprecedented heights.', 'The convergence of wealth and power in Musk’s backing of Trump isn’t just a subplot in the 2024 election—it’s a central theme. Musk’s political donations have raised eyebrows and sparked concerns across the political spectrum. The world’s richest man is now one of the largest financial supporters of a candidate whose rhetoric and policies threaten to undermine the very democracy that allowed Musk to amass his fortune.', 'Musk’s financial backing of Trump has grown in parallel with Tesla’s stock price. But there is more at play than a simple financial bet on a political candidate. Musk, who has increasingly aligned himself with Trump’s vision for America, is not just funding a campaign—he’s investing in a future where his brand of techno-libertarianism can thrive under an authoritarian regime.', 'For Musk, Trump represents more than just a candidate who will lower taxes and roll back regulations on businesses. Trump’s vision aligns disturbingly well with Musk’s ambitions to reshape the world in his image, a world where corporate power eclipses governmental oversight, and where billionaires like Musk can operate with near impunity.', 'As Musk’s wealth has swelled, so too has his desire to influence the political landscape. His support for Trump is no longer just about economics; it’s about power—a power that could reshape the future of American democracy.', 'But what is the cost of Musk’s support? Trump’s re-election campaign has been marked by authoritarian rhetoric, threats to jail political opponents, and promises to dismantle institutions that stand in his way. The billionaire’s backing of such a candidate sends a chilling message: that even the most powerful democratic institutions can be bought and sold in the marketplace of political influence.', 'Musk’s role in the 2024 election has become a lightning rod for criticism. Many see his support of Trump as emblematic of a larger problem—the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals who, by virtue of their vast fortunes, believe they can shape the future of the country to their liking. The danger here is not just that Musk is backing Trump, but that he is doing so in a way that gives him unprecedented influence over the political process.', 'As Musk’s fortune soared, Trump has leaned into his billionaire backer’s support. The former president has repeatedly praised Musk, calling him a “genius” and “one of America’s greatest entrepreneurs.” But the relationship between the two men is not just one of mutual admiration—it’s one of mutual benefit. Trump, who has long portrayed himself as a champion of the working class, has found in Musk a financial lifeline that allows him to push his campaign over the finish line.', 'Yet, for all his praise of Musk, Trump’s rhetoric has grown increasingly erratic. His speeches have become a jumble of conspiracy theories, personal grievances, and outright lies. His critics argue that Trump’s “weave” of disjointed thoughts and self-contradictions raises questions about his mental fitness to serve a second term.', 'During a rally, Trump declared that the United States has become a “garbage can” for illegal immigrants, a statement that drew immediate backlash from both sides of the aisle. Yet, for all his inflammatory rhetoric, Trump’s base remains fervently loyal—and Musk’s financial backing ensures that their voices will be amplified in the final days of the campaign.', 'As Election Day looms, one thing is clear: Elon Musk’s role in the 2024 election is no longer a side story—it’s a central narrative. His financial support of Trump has fundamentally altered the dynamics of the race, giving the former president the resources he needs to flood the airwaves, rally his base, and potentially sway undecided voters.', 'What kind of America will emerge if Musk’s financial backing helps propel Trump to victory? Will it be a country where billionaires call the shots, where democracy is weakened, and where authoritarianism takes root? Or will the American people rise up and reject a future where their voices are drowned out by the wealth and influence of a select few?', 'As the clock ticks down to Election Day, one thing is clear: Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has thrown his weight behind Donald Trump, and the consequences of that decision will reverberate for years to come.', 'The stakes have never been higher.', 'Elon Musk may have a “hand so large”….but that hand needs to be slapped down hard.  He has become a large menace to our countries democracy.', 'Thank you', 'Your welcome mdlm.  Musk has/is a huge risk o America’s safety with his chummy talks with Putin for the last 2-3 years, not to mention all his other weird actions these past few years.  Especially trying to bankroll tRump’d reelection and buying votes via “petition signing”.', 'Agreed', 'And then there’s that Putin thing.', 'Yes, great call out.', 'If Trump had half a brain left he\'d look at his ""weave"" and sue his stylist.  If these reports are true (and I suspect they are) Putin has added Musk to his collection of useful idiots.  At this point I suggest we bring back the Eisenhower tax rates, Elon is too big a parasite and if we can\'t cure ourselves of the infestation he represents we can at least stop feeding him so much.  ', 'Agreed', 'There appear to be manipulations going on in DJT’s stock price, and on the “election betting” platforms. I would be surprised if Tesla’s high stock price persists after a Harris win. I went to see a few EVs, and was not impressed by the model 3. With competition increasing (particularly in China), battery prices coming down, and the slowing transition (with many taking a step through PHEVs), Tesla’s stock price is loopy', 'Agreed. Tesla drops hard when Harris wins.', 'Agree on the stock price, someone is buying to keep the price up beyond all reason, that looks like a job for the Financial Crimes people.', 'So many in so many places. An array, phalanx against us.', 'The putin thing, stock manipulation, illegal lottery, satellite xxxxx, tre, tra, ', 'Godspeed america', 'The illegal lottery is insane: he’s just buying votes. Totally crazy.', 'Rules for thee but no morals for he', 'Given additional and much more widely spread than a couple isolated stories in the last year, it looks like Putin bought himself a billionaire who is funneling money to Trump and acting as his babysitter to keep him in line on the road.', 'Musk and Trump seem to be chatty with Putin and do him favors from time to time.  Makes it more understandable how Russian is getting so many Starlink terminals to the front in Ukraine in working order.  Those things can be turned off, as Musk demonstrated when he stopped the Ukrainians from using them to navigate for a naval attack on Russia.', 'Seems like we have a very active ‘Fifth Column in’ the US at this point.

Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that “the technological is political”, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by Nasa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon.', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", '', 'There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were “free”, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that?', 'It took an unconscionable time for this regulatory slumber to end, but end it finally did on Joe Biden’s watch. US regulators, led by Jonathan Kanter at the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), rediscovered their mojo. And then in August the DoJ dramatically won an antitrust lawsuit in which the judge ruled that Google was indeed a “monopolist” which had taken anticompetitive steps to preserve its 90% share of search. The DOJ is now proposing “remedies” for this abusive behaviour, ranging from obvious ones like barring Google from contracts such as the one it has with Apple to make it the default search engine on its devices to the “nuclear” option of breaking up the company.', 'The shock of this verdict to the tech industry has been palpable, and has led some movers and shakers in the Valley to think that maybe electing Trump might not be such a bad idea after all. Some of the loudmouths like Marc Andreessen – and, of course, Musk – have explicitly come out for Trump, but at least 14 other tech moguls are providing more discreet support. And although quite a few tech leaders have – belatedly – come out for Kamala Harris, some are doing so with some reservations. Reid Hoffmann, the founder of LinkedIn, for example, donated $10m to her campaign, but says he wants her to fire Lina Khan from the FTC.', 'The most dramatic evidence of how Silicon Valley lost its political virginity, though, comes from the extraordinary amounts of money that cryptocurrency companies have been putting into the election campaign. The New Yorker reports that crypto companies have already sunk “more than a hundred million dollars” into so-called SuperPACS supporting crypto-friendly candidates.', 'The interesting thing is that this money seems to be aimed not so much at influencing who wins the presidency as at ensuring that the “right” people get elected to the House and the Senate. This suggests a level of political nous that would have been disdained by the early pioneers of the tech industry in the 1960s. Technology might not have been political then; but it sure is just now.', 'John Naughton is professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University']"

And it goes beyond the estimated $75 million Musk has given to his Trump-supporting America PAC. More important, and unprecedented, are other factors: the immensity of Musk’s wealth, the scale of his power, the reach of his voice, the incoherence of his politics, the mercurial nature of his decision-making, the porcelain fragility of his ego. And if Trump wins, heaven forbid, Musk expects to play a major role in the next administration.', 'In the name of “free speech,” Musk paid $44 billion to buy Twitter and then squander three-quarters of its value turning it into X, a cesspool of far-right anger, grievance, misogyny, conspiracy theory, eighth-grade humor and Trump worship. In the name of “efficiency” — the task he wants to perform for Trump — Musk would be in a position to wreak similar havoc on our professional civil service, our best-in-the-world military, our majestic national parks and who knows what else.', 'Musk is an immigrant from South Africa who uses the megaphone of X to attack a daughter of immigrants — Vice President Kamala Harris — and to applaud Trump’s racism and xenophobia. Musk never hesitates to fuel the MAGA world’s raging transgender panic and has dismissed his own transgender daughter as “dead — killed by the woke mind virus.” He is the father of 12 children in all, and he proselytizes for procreation, saying on Saturday at a Trump rally that “I don’t think it’s cool to deliberately not have kids. It’s anti-human.”', 'Follow Eugene Robinson', 'Imagine how these views might be translated into policy if voters unwisely return Trump to the Oval Office.', 'Give Musk his due: He became the richest person in the world, worth more than $240 billion, by presiding over feats of engineering that can only be described as genius.', 'He revolutionized the auto industry, launching the electric-vehicle revolution and making Tesla the most valuable car company in the world, worth more than twice as much as second-place Toyota. SpaceX, the company he founded with the goal of sending humans to Mars, routinely does things that make you disbelieve your eyes, including, for example, a test flight earlier this month in which a booster rocket was guided back to its launchpad in a vertical position and then caught gently by giant mechanical arms.', 'And Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary, has launched more than 7,000 small satellites into low Earth orbit, where they circle in a choreographed space ballet, forming a global communications network. No nation-state has anything like it.', 'Governments, especially ours, are already dependent on Musk’s technology, which has been aided by federal subsidies. SpaceX vehicles are NASA’s only reliable way to get crews and supplies to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX also has contracts to launch Defense Department satellites and other classified payloads. And Starlink has been lifesaving at moments of crisis, allowing Ukrainian armed forces to coordinate their defense against Russia’s invasion and temporarily replacing cellphone networks in the southern Appalachians that had been destroyed by Hurricane Helene.', 'At the same time, Musk’s companies are regulated by the federal government and have been the subject of numerous investigations. In self-driving mode, his Teslas do not yet drive safely. Regulators want to make sure that water discharged at his SpaceX launch site in Texas is not polluted.
