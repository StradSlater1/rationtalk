'A defiant opponent': Jim Donovan’s battle with cancer in his own words,https://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/jim-donovan-battle-cancer-leukemia-cleveland-browns-wkyc-anchor-sports/95-c94a6545-14d2-467b-a361-9c05dc0cc390,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'CLEVELAND — For nearly a quarter century, Jim Donovan fought an incredibly brave, yet largely private battle with cancer. That fight ended on Friday as the former WKYC sports anchor and Cleveland Browns radio voice passed away at the age of 68.', 'In 2000, Jimmy was getting ready for his second season as the “Voice of the Browns” when he began to experience some stomach issues. After multiple blood tests, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).', 'The National Cancer Institute defines CLL as  “a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.”', 'After his diagnosis, Jimmy began a private, decade-long battle with the disease that ultimately resulted in a bone-marrow transplant in the summer of 2011. Through it all, Jimmy relied on the two most important people in his life: his wife Cheryl and daughter Meghan.', '“We did it together,” Jimmy recalled in a 2016 interview with WKYC’s Matt Florjancic. “There were a lot of really tough moments, but Cheryl was just amazing. Everybody needs an advocate when you’re doing that because there are certain things that you don’t want to hear and you don’t hear. You really don’t physically hear things, so you need somebody there with you and she was there.”', 'Cheryl fulfilled several roles as Jimmy was battling his way through the bone-marrow transplant and subsequent recovery process. And even before the transplant, Meghan would help Cheryl in getting Jim to and from appointments with the doctor.', '“She was a coach, she was a teammate, she was a great wife,” Donovan said. “It was just unbelievable. There were a lot of things that she had to do. She had to keep our life going at home, and I was stuck in a hospital for a long period of time. It was just amazing. She was absolutely just a real rock, and it was a tough thing for Meghan to go through.', '“She battled with us through it because there was a lot before the transplant. There were a lot of years of treatment and chemo, and before the decision was made that, ‘Hey, the chemo’s not working like we want it to and so, now, you have to have a bone marrow transplant.’', '“There were a lot of weeks of feeling awful when you would go through the treatment. Meghan would come and pick me up a lot from chemo, and you have to go through it together. We don’t have a big family, but the three of us really banded together and got through the whole thing.”', 'The key to Jimmy’s bone marrow transplant was finding someone who was just the right match. That match was a Virginia corrections officer named Dallas Gentry.', 'A native of Wyse, Virginia, which is located along the Kentucky and Tennessee borders, Gentry made a decision to register as a donor when he was just 19 years old, and 17 years later, he received the call to make a life-saving donation.', 'Gentry was a perfect 10-point match to Jimmy, but because of sleep apnea, he had to be treated at a hospital at Vanderbilt University in Nashville with medication for five days, which caused pain in every bone that has ever been broken. Despite the discomfort in his collarbone, shoulder and back and a bad reaction to the pain-relief medication, Gentry elected to go through with the procedure, which gave Jimmy a second chance at life.', '“When I went in to have the transplant, I was really lost,” Jimmy recalled. “I didn’t know what was ahead for me from one day to the next. You have a lot of time on your hands, so I said to myself in the hospital, I was sitting there, ‘I would really like to get ready to do the first Browns game,’ realizing the preseason was out of the question. I remember talking to my doctors, and I saw them every day. They said, ‘Kind of a longshot, but you should have goals, and if you really think you can do it, that would be an incredible thing to pull off.’”', ""Sure enough, just three months after his transplant, Jimmy “pulled it off” and made a triumphant return to the Browns broadcast booth in time for the start of the 2011 season. It wasn't an easy road back. In addition to battling multiple fevers, there was a diagnosis of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, on Jimmy's earlobe. Doctors performed surgery to remove the mole just days before the season opener."", '“When I did the game, as soon as the game was over, I was a wet dishrag. I had no energy left, but I felt like I didn’t have a bone marrow transplant. I just felt great up in the booth. For three-and-a-half hours, it just took my mind off of everything I had gone through and everything I still had in front of me to get totally better, and it was just great,” Jimmy said.', 'Two years later, Jimmy and his family would have another “great” moment as they welcomed Gentry to their home to in Hinckley to celebrate Thanksgiving.', '“When we finally decided that we would really get together, it was the most incredible holiday that you could ever have. It really is a holiday when somebody like that walks into your life and they gave you the thing that kept you alive,” Jimmy remembered.', 'During the next decade, Jimmy would closely monitor his condition. On May 31, 2023, he announced that his leukemia had relapsed. Although as he put it, the “trouble” had started a year and a half earlier.', '""I noticed something was amiss with my health. My concerns were confirmed to me and it was told to me that I had a relapse of leukemia,” Jimmy said on 3News at 7 that night.', 'Jimmy told viewers during the previous 18 months, he had been receiving treatment using various forms of chemotherapy, both intravenous and oral. ""For the most part, they worked pretty well, but things change, and so we\'re going to have to go with a different treatment plan — a more aggressive treatment plan, which has already started,"" he added.', '""This is going to be kind of a long and winding road through this treatment plan, because it is going to be aggressive. The goal is: gotta get better, gotta get healthy, gotta move on. I know the deal, I\'ve done it before, and I plan to do it once again,"" Jimmy explained. ""Through all of this, I will be here at Channel 3 and on the radio as much as I can be, but there will be periods of time that I might not be with you, maybe for a day, maybe for longer.""', 'Following the Browns’ 2023 season opener on Sept. 11, 2023, Jimmy announced that he was taking a medical leave from his radio and television duties as part of the next step of his treatment.', '""I promise I\'ll be a listener, and I\'ll be back as soon as I can,"" Jimmy declared before signing off.', 'Once again, Jimmy was right. Just over two months later, he made his triumphant return to the both the Browns radio booth and the WKYC anchor desk.', 'Before his first game back as the Browns radio voice on Nov. 19 against the Steelers, Jimmy was named the ""Dawg Pound Captain,” walking out of the tunnel to a thunderous ovation and smashing a black and yellow guitar. After Cleveland beat Pittsburgh that afternoon, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski gave Jimmy the game ball.', 'Jimmy continued his battle with CLL into 2024, ringing the bell at University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center in February to mark the completion of his treatment. Although he retired from WKYC in June, he was set to return to the Browns radio booth to start his 26th season behind the microphone. After announcing the team’s three preseason games, Jimmy announced on Aug. 29 that his cancer had returned “very aggressively” and he would be stepping down as the voice of the Browns.', 'His farewell letter to Browns fans was pure Jimmy, a testament to his courage, kindness, and loving heart.', ""“As many of you know I have been dealing with cancer for many years. I've gone through every treatment imaginable. But my cancer is a defiant opponent and has returned and very aggressively. This will require me to devote everything I have in me to continue the fight and my family and I are committed to doing that.”"", '“I have called Browns games for 25 years. Not a day has gone by when I haven\'t paused and been so proud to be ""The Voice of the Browns"". Cheryl, Meghan and I thank you for all the love, support and prayers during my rough patches. It\'s like having a huge family around us. And that\'s what makes the Cleveland Browns so special. You do.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Browns radio announcer Jim Donovan dies of cancer at 68,https://www.iosconews.com/sports/national/article_ba65e305-9163-5696-b61e-68c221c0d03f.html,"['', '', '', 'Jan 9, 2022; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Cleveland Browns radio color analyst Doug Dieken (left) is presented with a plaque by radio play-by-play announcer Jim Donovan for the radio booth dedication for his retirement from announcing Cleveland Browns football games during the first half against the Cincinnati Bengals at FirstEnergy Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Scott Galvin-Imagn Images', 'Jim Donovan, the longtime beloved radio play-by-play announcer for the Cleveland Browns, died Saturday at age 68 after a lengthy battle with cancer. ""This is an incredibly difficult day for us and the entire Cleveland Browns organization,"" Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said in a statement. ""His impact as the Voice of the Browns for 25 years is immeasurable as he touched the lives of our fans each and every Sunday with his love for the Browns and his brilliance at his craft. ""He will be greatly missed, but he cemented a legacy that will live on forever. The only thing that outweighed his love for this city and this team was the love he had for his family. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Cheryl, his daughter, Meghan, and everyone who was fortunate enough to call Jimmy family or friend."" Donovan had already been in the Cleveland market as the sports director at WKYC-TV Channel 3 when he was chosen to be the radio broadcaster when the expansion franchise began play in 1999. Donovan endeared himself to Cleveland sports fans with his infectious passion for the game and attention to detail, reportedly spending many hours preparing for each broadcast. He was first diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2000. He underwent a bone-marrow transplant in the summer of 2011. He took a medical leave at the beginning of the 2023 season to seek treatment for a return of the disease, getting back to the booth in November. However, the leukemia returned this year, forcing Donovan to retire in August. At that time, he penned an open letter to Browns fans to show his appreciation for them. ""I have called Browns games for 25 years. Not a day has gone by when I haven\'t paused and been so proud to be ‘The Voice of the Browns,\'"" Donovan wrote. ""Cheryl, Meghan and I thank you for all the love, support and prayers during my rough patches. It\'s like having a huge family around us. And that\'s what makes the Cleveland Browns so special. You do."" Although he was too ill to attend the events, Donovan was recently inducted into the Browns\' Legends Club and the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame. A Boston native, he leaves behind his wife Cheryl and daughter Meghan. --Field Level Media', 'Originally published on fieldlevelmedia.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.', '', 'The News-Herald mobile app brings you the latest local breaking news, updates, and more.

Beloved Browns broadcaster passes away,https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/beloved_browns_broadcaster_passes_away/s1_17114_41128340,"['', 'The Cleveland Browns have had a challenging start to the 2024 NFL season. Halfway into their campaign, the Browns have been hit with tragic news on team broadcaster Jim Donovan. Donovan has passed away at the age of 68 after a battle with cancer.', 'The Browns released a statement about the news on social media Saturday afternoon, via X (formerly Twitter):', '“We are heartbroken that Jim Donovan, the Voice of the Browns, has passed away. Jim provided so much joy and love to this city. His steady presence on the radio for Browns games and on television for nightly news made it feel like he was an extended family member for all those that tuned in. His signature calls will be forever embedded in Browns history.', '“Our thoughts are with Jim’s family and everyone who had the immense pleasure of considering him a friend,” the team wrote.', 'Jim Donovan’s Browns service made an impact on countless fans and members of the Cleveland community. Social media users wrote some heartfelt words in reflection of the legendary broadcaster.', '“What a huge loss. Just a wonderful guy, who loved Cleveland and loved what he did for a living. Nobody could call a game like him. And nobody will,” one X user wrote.', '“Prayers and my deepest sympathies to Jim Donovan’s family. He was such an energizing force for all of Cleveland and Browns fans throughout the country,” another user added.', '“Heartbreaking news. Jim was truly one of a kind, a voice & spirit that brought us all together. He’ll be deeply missed,” another added.', 'Furthermore, Donovan’s impact went beyond just Browns fans.', '“He was one of the best voices, and that’s coming from a Bengals fan. Thoughts and prayers go out to the Browns team,” another user wrote.', 'Jim Donovan’s contributions will be cherished by the football community for a long time to come.', 'This article first appeared on NFL on ClutchPoints and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', 'Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis on Saturday shared his definitive stance about all the trade rumors surrounding Maxx Crosby. Crosby has been linked to the Detroit Lions ever since the NFC powerhouse lost star pass-rusher Aidan Hutchinson to a gruesome leg injury. Davis tried to quash all the Crosby trade talks once and for all. Davis sent an email to ESPN’s Adam Schefter refuting the idea that the Raiders would entertain any kind of trade offer for Crosby. “We’re Not Trading Maxx Crosby,” Davis wrote in his email. “Before Or After The Trade Deadline!!!” Sports team owners and executives have reneged on their word before. However, Davis may very well hold firm on his stance given Crosby’s inherent value to the team. Crosby has been the heart and soul of the Raiders organization over the last few years. The three-time Pro Bowler has repeatedly expressed his commitment to the franchise both on and off the field. But that hasn’t spared Crosby from having to respond to speculation about him looking for a way out of Las Vegas. Through six games with the Raiders this season, Crosby has 6.5 sacks and 23 combined tackles. He also has 10 tackles for a loss, which is tied with Houston Texans defensive end Will Anderson Jr. for the most in the NFL.', ""One of the Edmonton Oilers' newest prospects is now cleared to start his 2024-25 season. The team announced that winger Roby Jarventie has recovered from his knee injury. As a result, he has been taken off season-opening injured reserve and assigned to AHL Bakersfield. The 22-year-old was the second pick of the second round by Ottawa back in 2020, going 33rd overall. He spent the majority of his first three professional seasons at the AHL level and was quite productive in limited action with Belleville last season, recording 20 points in 22 games. That earned Jarventie a look with the big club as he got into seven games with the Sens, picking up an assist while averaging 7:31 per game. Despite that, Ottawa elected to trade him along with a 2025 fourth-round pick to the Oilers back in July in exchange for prospects Xavier Bourgault and Jake Chiasson. Notably, Bourgault was a first-round pick in 2021, and while his stock has slipped somewhat since then, it’s clear that Edmonton feels that Jarventie has some upside. This move also helps the Oilers out a bit from a salary-cap perspective. Because Jarventie spent time on an NHL roster last season, he was counting against Edmonton’s cap at a prorated amount relative to the number of days he was up with Ottawa. Based on his $894K cap hit, that prorated amount checked in around $107K. That amount now comes off their books, giving them just under $1.15M in cap space, per PuckPedia, putting them around the middle of the pack leaguewide in that regard."", 'Montreal Canadiens defenseman Arber Xhekaj has been out of the lineup for a bit, but now, head coach Martin St. Louis is giving him another chance. In an announcement, it was revealed that Xhekaj would be back in the Montreal Canadiens lineup when the team takes on the St. Louis Blues on Saturday. This should be a huge game for Xhekaj, who has been a healthy scratch more often than not to start the year. Interestingly enough, Martin St. Louis did offer what appears to be a final warning to the defenseman. Essentially, he wants to see some consistent play with no turnovers. He acknowledged that Xhekaj is no longer a rookie and that he needs to leave those rookie mistakes in the past. ""I expect a better version. Being staying alert, consistent,\' St. Louis said. ""You should be worried about making some mistakes. He\'s not a rookie anymore. So you should say: I gotta be better.\' Very simple. It\'s not like we nitpick everything he does. But he\'s gotta be better. I expect Xhekaj to be a better version."" It will be fascinating to see how this all shakes out for Xhekaj. He and many other Habs players need to take a leap. Something has to give and Xhekaj will want to be the solution, not the problem.', ""The biggest story for the New York Yankees going into Game 2 of the World Series on Saturday is the continued postseason struggles of centerfielder Aaron Judge. After putting together another MVP-caliber regular season, Judge has had a miserable postseason that has seen him strike out 16 times in only 46 at-bats, hit just two home runs and hit under .200 for the playoffs. If that continues and the Yankees end up losing the series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, Judge is going to go from a hero to a zero in the eyes of Yankees fans with his legacy — at least for the short-term — taking a significant hit. Former Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez was once in this exact same situation with sky-high expectations and disappointing postseasons. Rodriguez finally changed the narrative around him in 2009 by helping lead the Yankees to a championship. Before Saturday's game, Rodriguez shared some advice that he would give to Judge to help him break out of his funk. Stop worrying about stats. Just focus on having a big moment. That is what he told Joel Sherman of the New York Post on Saturday before Game 2 of the series. “You have to divorce yourself from stats,” Rodriguez told The Post in the hours before Game 2. “That’s just a losing proposition. And one of the most overrated things in sports is October stats. Forget 4-for-10 with four singles. If Judge does that, the Yankees are going home. Better to be 2-for-14 and one is a three-run double and one is a two-run homer that changes games. You need moments, not stats. And once I realized that, it made it so much easier.” As great as Judge has been throughout his career, the playoffs have been a consistent problem for him. Entering play on Saturday he is hitting just .203 with only a .753 OPS in his postseason career. Just by comparison, his career regular season numbers have seen him hit .288 with a 1.010 OPS. Not even close to the same level of production. Judge has had chances for big moments in the playoffs, including a massive one on Friday when he came to the plate with two runners on after Juan Soto was intentionally walked to face him. Judge ended up popping out. Ultimately Rodriguez is right. If Judge delivers a big-moment home run or two over the next few games and changes the series in the Yankees' favor, nobody in New York is going to care what his overall numbers look like. He just has to actually deliver the big hit at some point."", 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily.

The two fell into a conversational rhythm.', 'Radio analyst Doug Dieken, left, is honored for his contributions to the Browns during a 2022 game. Jim Donovan is with him in the booth.Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com', '“Jimmy lived to do the games. That was Jimmy’s life,” Dieken said. “He was a perfectionist. He would listen to the games afterwards, critiquing himself. I never could do that. I didn’t want to hear myself. During the games, he would be standing up, jumping up and down like he had a snake in his pants. I’d be watching him and laughing ... I’d forget I was on the air with him. ... Then he’d say, ‘Doug, what about that play?’', 'Donovan had been rejoicing and commiserating with fans since the team returned from a hiatus in 1999. He was the sole play-by-play radio voice until he stepped down before this season.', 'He retired from WKYC in June after almost 40 years as sports and news anchor. Two months later, he announced his cancer had returned. Then, in August, he made the heart-wrenching decision to step away from the Browns gig.', 'In a note to fans this year, Donovan talked about vowing to continue the fight against cancer and wrote, “Not a day has gone by when I haven’t paused and been so proud to be ‘The Voice of the Browns’.”', 'He ended his note saying, “Here We Go Brownies ... Here We Go! It’s been an honor.”', '“There will never be another Jim Donovan,” said Nick Camino, who this year was named Donovan’s successor as sports director at WKYC. “His passion for the Cleveland Browns and all of our sports teams was unmatched. Getting an opportunity to work with Jimmy the last five and a half years is something I will never forget and will always cherish.', '“Cleveland has been blessed to have some great broadcasters, and Jim belongs at the very top.”', 'In radio and television, the difference between great and unlistenable announcing can be traced to the amount of preparation before the microphone is turned on. And Donovan came prepared.', 'He started his preparation on Wednesday, often putting in hours after getting home from the 11 p.m. newscast. On Mondays, he would listen to the game’s broadcast three times, each looking for different issues, ways to improve.', '“I always do the game like I’m doing it for two people driving in the car down the highway,” he said in a 2006 Plain Dealer story. “You want to bring the game to them and that’s how you do it.”', 'He also was solid in a variety of roles. He spent 10 hours on the air anchoring the Cavs victory parade coverage in 2016. Once, after an anchor became ill, Donovan wound up doing election coverage - seamlessly.', 'Donovan was born in Boston and raised in a working-class Irish Catholic family in Milton, Massachusetts. As a youngster, he dreamed of calling Boston Bruins games.', 'Before the days of streaming, when radio signals could pull in games on clear nights from all over the country, Donovan could listen to the men doing the job he aspired to do. Late-night out-of-town games filtered in to his transistor radio; he even recalled hearing Joe Tait call Cavs games.', 'He earned a degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University. His start in the business came at a station in St. Cloud, Minnesota, 1,500 miles from his home.', 'Donovan then swung back east, going to Burlington, Vermont, where he called St. Michael’s College basketball and Class AA baseball games for the precursor of the Akron RubberDucks.', 'His next stop would be Cleveland, then seen as a launching-point market for folks in the industry. NBC’s WKYC had the rights to a couple of Browns games, and Donovan found himself as the No. 3 man supporting Gib Shanley and Reggie Rucker. That was 1985, and Donovan’s career was about to take off.', 'He was versatile, never pigeon-holed in his work. He called both kinds of football – the American version with NBC’s coverage and World Cup soccer.', 'In 1986, The Plain Dealer’s James Ewinger reported Donovan was named 6 p.m. sports anchor at WKYC. Donovan, he wrote, “has given the station its most thorough and unembroidered sports coverage since he was hired a year ago.”', 'In 1999, Donovan was named voice of the Browns. In those 25 years, the Browns had 21 losing seasons.', 'He racked up accolades, too, winning Emmys, Cleveland Press Club All-Ohio Best Sportscaster and Cleveland Sports Awards Lifetime Achievement honors. He’s in multiple Halls of Fame for his broadcasting.', 'His football broadcasting drew positive reviews from media critics and fans. In 2005, a Plain Dealer reader poll asked which local sports anchor had the most credibility. Donovan came out on top.', 'His was as iconic a voice in the Cleveland sports world as anyone. As steady and prepared as Tom Hamilton calling Guardians games and a known figure as Tait on the Cavaliers sidelines, Donovan was a pro in the booth. He eschewed gimmicks and salacious behavior, instead relying on homework before he stepped into the booth.', 'His excitement grew every time Nick Chubb pounded through the line for a first down, or when one of the myriad of quarterbacks rolled out and completed a first-down pass. He knew football and he knew broadcasting but – as cleveland.com columnist Terry Pluto wrote in September - “He does bleed orange and brown.”', 'Donovan’s most famous call, arguably, came on Dec. 29, 2002, as the Browns hosted the Atlanta Falcons in the final week of the regular season. To reach the playoffs, the Browns needed to win.', 'Late in the game with a one-point lead, William Green took a handoff from Kelly Holcomb and juked his way through a hole, speeding down field, yard line after yard line. As he ran, Donovan’s voice rose excitedly.', '“He’s through, first down! Forty, Forty-five, Fifty, Forty-Five, Forty … Run William Run!”', 'The Browns won, 24-16.', 'Unfortunately, his parallel life to much of his time calling Browns games involved cancer.', 'After feeling tired in 2000 and being tested, Donovan learned he had CLL - chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He was familiar with it; his father and uncle were diagnosed with it.', 'After having cancer for two years he began enduring weeklong chemotherapy sessions for six months. It quashed the cancer – for a while. In 2005, it came back. He initially fought back when told he needed a bone-marrow transplant, but the tipping point came in 2009 before a Browns-Chiefs game in Kansas City.', 'Despite a temperature nudging near 103 degrees, despite feeling horrible, despite Andre Knott ready to step in if need be, Donovan pushed on. He did the game.', 'When he got home, he knew it was time for a transplant. A donor was found, and he had the transplant on June 7, 2011. Then if Donovan weren’t dealing with enough medically, a cancerous mole was found on his ear. For someone with an already weakened immune system, that’s dangerous. And he pushed on.', 'Andre Knott, on-field broadcaster for the Cleveland Guardians, previously worked with Jim Donovan. Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com', 'Those who worked with him like Dieken and Knott said how Donovan rarely complained. Saturday, Knott remembered Donovan as a kind mentor.', '“I did the Browns with him for seven years, the “Browns Red Zone” for 10,” Knott said. “I was in my 20s when I got the Browns job, rough around the edges. Jimmy taught me how to prepare. He taught me how to be humble, ask others for help in terms of how to pronounce names and get information. He never big-timed me, and he easily could have done that. That’s another great part of Jimmy ... how he treated others so well.”', 'On Sept. 22, the team honored Donovan and former kicker Phil Dawson into the Browns Legends. Donovan and pioneering Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown are the only non-players to be honored as Cleveland Browns Legends.', 'In a Faith & You column in September, Pluto succinctly summed his personal feelings about Donovan.', '“The man,” he wrote, “is a combination of courage and dignity.”', 'Fans heard a fun announcer. Anyone truly close to Donovan saw him as tough.', '“Jimmy is one of the best, one of the toughest people I’ve ever been around,” Dieken said.', 'Tom Hamilton, radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Guardians.Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com', 'That mirrors what Hamilton, Donovan’s counterpart on the air for the Cleveland Guardians, said Saturday: “I don’t know how anyone could have been more courageous and tenacious.”', '“Obviously, we knew the fight Jim was in for,” Hamilton said. “The thing about Jim that jumps out at you is what a fighter he was and he never really let you know how tough the battle was. It wasn’t about him; he didn’t want to make it about him. He fought that battle pretty privately. I have so much admiration for him not only as a broadcaster and what a pro he was and what a great play-by-play guy he was for the Browns but the kind of person he was.”', 'Donovan leaves behind his wife Cheryl and daughter Meghan.', '“I know how dedicated he was to Cheryl and Meghan; they were everything to him. As important as the Browns were, they never got close to what Cheryl and Meghan were to him,” Hamilton said.', 'Cleveland.com’s Terry Pluto contributed to this story.', 'In 2022, Terry Pluto wrote a three-part series on Donovan:', 'Jim Donovan Part 1: The kid with a dream and a cassette tape recorder', 'Jim Donovan Part 2: He gets the Browns job, and the fans love him', 'Jim Donovan Part 3: The Browns broadcaster’s huge heart and long battle with cancer', 'I cover restaurants, beer, wine and sports-related topics on our life and culture team.

This will require me to devote everything I have in me to continue the fight and my family and I are committed to doing that.”', 'On Sept. 22 of this year, Donovan and former Browns kicker Phil Dawson were inducted into the Browns Legends. Donovan was too ill to attend the ceremony. He was represented by his wife Cheryl and daughter Meghan.', '“He kept it real, but he kept a positive tone to it,” Dawson said about the way Donovan called a Browns game. “He just always could find that balance — authentic, real, accurate, but he was still supportive, even when there wasn’t a whole lot to support.', '“And I know the players appreciated that. I know I certainly appreciated that. He was always quick to try to provide context, rather than letting people just focus on an individual moment. He just really had a knack for seeing the big picture. It was always ‘Go Browns,’ yet he kept it real and accurate, so that everybody understood what was going on.”', 'Donovan was born in Boston.
