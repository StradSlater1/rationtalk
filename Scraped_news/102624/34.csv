Old and obscure video games and their history have a cult interest that has spilled over to mainstream interest and has arguably fueled the sales of whatever back-catalog these businesses do release.

But fans and researchers of gaming history might be forced to deal with hours of traffic every time they want to access these in person, The Verge reports. ', 'The decision comes after two non-profits, the Video Game History Foundation and the Software Preservation Network (SPN), spent three years campaigning for the US Copyright Office to grant an exemption to its rules governing old video games.', 'Under the Foundation’s proposals, researchers would have been able to access emulated copies of their chosen games remotely, just like how libraries can sometimes grant members e-book access from home.', 'In an official statement on the loss, the group blamed “lobbying efforts by rightsholder groups” such as the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the trade association of the video game industry that represents many of the world’s largest publishers, for holding back its ideas.', 'The statement read: “During our hearing with the Copyright Office, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) declared that they would never support remote game access for research purposes under any conditions.""', '""The game industry’s absolutist position—which the ESA’s own members have declined to go on the record to support—forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable.”', 'The news comes as game preservationists may have an increasingly indispensable role in preserving the cultural history of video games', 'The vast majority—87%—of games released before 2010 are ""critically endangered"" in the US according to the Video Game History Foundation, which means that they aren’t easily available in their original physical and digital forms.', 'Some platforms have had much better luck in terms of how their back catalog has been preserved.

Video game preservationists face setback as copyright office blocks remote access,https://www.techedt.com/video-game-preservationists-face-setback-as-copyright-office-blocks-remote-access,"['', 'Published:', '', '- Advertisement -', 'Preservation of classic video games has hit a significant roadblock. The U.S. Copyright Office has turned down a request from video  game preservation advocates to enable libraries, archives, and museums to lend older video games remotely. This decision means that scholars studying retro and out-of-print games must continue travelling to specific institutions to access these works legally. The ruling, viewed as a setback for preservationists, concerns copyright and market implications for the video game industry.', ""Advocates of game preservation have long argued that video games deserve the same access rights as other media, such as books and films, which libraries can lend to scholars remotely. Kendra Albert, representing the Software Preservation Network and the Library Copyright Alliance, explained the request: “It was the same as the process that's already in place for special collections in libraries: a library reviews the request, checks it's appropriate, and grants access if it meets requirements.” Albert and other preservationists argue this process would allow libraries to offer limited, remote access without risking copyright violations."", ""The Copyright Office permits libraries to lend out physical or downloadable copies of other media, provided they do not exceed the number of copies they own. However, video games are now treated differently. “It's frustrating that the widely used access process for various materials doesn't apply to video games,” Albert said."", ""The Copyright Office's decision to reject this request came in response to objections from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), representing major video game publishers. The ESA expressed concern that remote access might encourage individuals to play classic games for free, potentially harming the re-released market. The association argued that preservationists' proposal lacked sufficient restrictions to limit use strictly to educational, research, or scholarship purposes."", ""While preservation advocates countered that most classic games remain unavailable for purchase, with only a few exceptions where games are remastered or modified, the ESA remained unconvinced. The Copyright Office's final ruling echoed the ESA's concerns, stating that the proposed exemption lacked safeguards to prevent market impact. It also argued that allowing off-premises access to preserved video games could harm the legacy games market, especially as there is growing demand for re-releases of older titles."", ""Following the ruling, Albert voiced frustration, saying the Copyright Office disregarded testimony from some publishers who believed remote access would not negatively impact their sales. Albert expressed disappointment with the social platform Bluesky, stating, “This result guts me,” and suggested the Copyright Office's decision might have ignored relevant evidence supporting limited remote access."", 'This request, if granted, would have been temporary. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), groups can petition the Library of Congress every three years for specific exemptions to help institutions make preserved works accessible. Each exemption must then be reviewed and renewed. The Copyright Office did renew an existing exemption allowing libraries to preserve games on-site, enabling visitors to play them on-premises. In addition, it granted a separate exemption allowing for the repair of ice cream machines—a small victory for advocates seeking practical DMCA exemptions.', ""The denial has left the preservation community questioning the future of access to historical video  game content. The Video Game History Foundation, a prominent advocate for preserving classic games, issued a statement condemning the ESA's stance. The Foundation criticised the ESA's “absolutist position,” which forces researchers to use unofficial methods to access many out-of-print otherwise inaccessible games. “Lobbying efforts by rightsholder groups continue to hold back progress,” the Foundation's statement noted, criticising the ESA for blocking advancements in preservation efforts for the sake of commercial protection."", ""For its part, the ESA defended its position, emphasising the importance of balancing preservation with protecting copyright and industry interests. In a statement, the ESA acknowledged the cultural significance of video games and the need for preservation. However, it maintained that preservation efforts must uphold the market for current or potential re-releases. “We recognise the importance of preserving video games and protecting game hardware given their significance in culture and society,” the ESA stated. “With today's decision, the Copyright Office confirms the current level of video game preservation is appropriate.”"", 'The ruling underscores the challenges in balancing cultural preservation and copyright protection. Video game historians and scholars will need to continue in-person research at libraries and museums, at least until the next review period. At the same time, preservation advocates are expected to keep pushing for broader access rights in the face of copyright restrictions.', ""Tech Edition has partnerships that involve sponsored content.

Video Game History Foundation 'Disappointed' in DMCA Decision That Won't Grant Exemptions for Researchers,https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-history-foundation-disappointed-in-dmca-decision-that-wont-grant-exemptions-for-researchers,"['The US Copyright Office has declined to grant a new exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would allow libraries and archives to offer remote, digital access to out-of-market video games for verified researchers.', '', 'The proposed amendment, which we wrote extensively about back in May, was championed by the Software Preservation Network (SPN) as critical for game preservation. The group argues that due to equipment, technological, and supply limitations, the lack of digital availability of out-of-market games is a massive hindrance to researchers and academics, who may not live near a library that has a physical copy of a needed game available to check out.', 'However, groups such as the ESA opposed the amendment, claiming it would harm company\'s ability to make money off of retro games. In fact, one ESA lawyer argued that there was ""[no] combination of limitations [ESA members] would support to provide remote access."" In May, we reached out to every member of the ESA for comment on this matter, but only received one response back.', 'In the end, the Copyright Office sided with the ESA, stating that the SPN ""did not show that removing the singleuser limitation for preserved computer programs or permitting off-premises access to video games are likely to be noninfringing."" That doesn\'t mean the exemption is dead - there will be an opportunity to try again in three years, and the Copyright Office\'s response does seem to invite them to do so: ""She recommends clarifying the single copy restriction language to reflect that preservation institutions can allow a copy of a computer program to be accessed by as many individuals as there are circumvented copies legally owned. This clarifying text will address the perceived ambiguity in the current exemption, while maintaining the single-user limitation’s intended purpose to minimize the risk of substitutional uses of preserved computer programs.""', ""And in fact The Video Game History Foundation, which worked together with the SPN on the proposed amendment, has issued a statement expressing pride in the work advocacy groups did throughout the process, and indicating it's not giving up."", 'The Video Game History Foundation published a study last year revealing that only 13% of classic video games published in the US are currently in release. 87% are currently unavailable.', 'Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
