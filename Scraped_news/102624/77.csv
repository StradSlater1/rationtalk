Those people who were exposed to the infected cattle have been notified and are actively being monitored.', 'As of Oct. 18, the California Department of Health reported the number of humans with bird flu was 13. All of those individuals came into contact with infected dairy cattle.', 'Dairies in the Central Valley have been overwhelmed by the virus. In some cases, the situation is so severe that dairies have been inundated by the large volume of cattle carcasses.', 'The disease is also extremely contagious and highly fatal to birds. The virus renders all meat and eggs from the flock unsafe for human consumption. Because of the virus, millions of birds have been euthanized at poultry facilities in Merced County and California.', 'Humans can be infected with the virus by coming into direct contact with infected birds, cattle or other animals, even if they are dead.', 'It is also unsafe to come into contact with contaminated bedding, feed, water troughs, and other contaminated surfaces.', 'The risk of human infection of bird flu is low, and human-to-human transmission is rare, according to the release.', 'CDPH recommends that\u202fpersonal protective equipment, or PPE, such as eye protection (face shields or safety goggles), respirators (N95 masks), and gloves be worn by anyone working with animals or materials that are infected or potentially infected with the bird flu virus. Wearing PPE helps prevent infection.', 'Pasteurized milk and dairy products continue to be safe to consume, as pasteurization is fully effective at inactivating the bird flu virus.', 'CDPH has helped coordinate and support outreach to dairy producers and farm workers on preventive measures that have helped keep human cases low in other states with bird flu outbreaks. CDPH continues to support local health departments in distributing PPE from state and federal stockpiles directly to affected dairy farms, farmworker organizations, poultry farm workers, those who handle raw dairy products, and slaughterhouse workers. To protect California farm workers from bird flu, during the last four months CDPH has distributed more than 400,000 respirators, 1.4 million gloves, 170,000 goggles and face shields, and 168,000 bouffant caps. ', 'In addition, CDPH is working closely with local public health laboratories and local health departments to provide health checks for exposed individuals and ensure testing and treatment are available when needed. As one of the 14 states with infected dairy herds, California also received 5,000 additional doses of seasonal flu vaccine for farm workers from the CDC. Those doses will go to local health departments with the highest number of dairy farms.  ', 'CDPH has been tracking bird flu and making preparations for a possible human infection since the state’s first detection in poultry in 2022. CDPH partners closely with the California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA) on a broad approach to protect human and animal health. CDPH and the CDC use both human and wastewater surveillance tools to detect and monitor for bird flu, and work closely with local health departments to prepare, prevent, and lessen its impact on human health. ', 'People exposed to infected animals should monitor for the following symptoms for 10 days after their last exposure: eye redness (conjunctivitis), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, trouble breathing, and fever. If they start to feel sick, they should immediately isolate, notify their local public health department, and work with public health and health care providers to get timely testing and treatment. ', 'CDPH recommends that all Californians — especially workers at risk for exposure to bird flu — receive a seasonal flu vaccine. Although the seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against bird flu, it can decrease the risk of being infected with both viruses at the same time and reduce the chance of severe illness from seasonal flu.

', 'Meanwhile, human cases of bird flu have increased to 13 in California, with nine cases in Tulare County, according to the Tulare County Health & Human Services Agency’s Oct. 22 update.', 'Infections have also been reported in Kings and Kern counties.', 'H5N1 avian influenza, the formal name for bird flu, has been confirmed in 100 dairies in California in the past 30 days, as reported by the USDA on Oct. 23. That number, however, does not include the 31 dairies confirmed to have the disease in the first three weeks of the outbreak.', 'Tulare County dairies are impacted in several ways by bird flu, according to Tricia Stever Blattler, Tulare County Farm Bureau executive director and corporate secretary.', '“It can really pull a lot of human workforce power away from their other duties in trying to care for sick animals,” Stever Blattler said.', 'Outbreak spreads:US to double emergency bird flu vaccines as more people, herds become infected', 'Will bird flu be the next pandemic?Vaccines are prepped, just in case.', '“There have been some pretty large dairies that have hundreds of animals that are infected with the actual virus. They are trying to do things just like any of us would do if we were home with a flu. They\'re trying to get those animals to take on extra fluids and give them supportive medication to make them more comfortable.""', 'Dairy owners are also faced with a reduction of milk volume.', '“I know a couple of the creameries are reporting that their volume of milk is down because some of these dairies are seeing a big drop in the production of milk,” Stever Blattler said.', 'The weather has added to the impact of bird flu on local dairies.', '“The really hot weather that we had just up until the last couple weeks created another big factor that caused some of our dairies to have some higher mortality losses that were because of sick animals having to also survive in really, really high heat during this illness,"" Stever Blattler said.', 'Healthcare for dairy workers with bird flu is also becoming more of a challenge.', 'Is your cat at risk?Domestic cats in Colorado are dying of bird flu', ""“The county's health department is trying to make sure that those workers seek care through one specific medical provider to try to ensure continuity of care,” Stever Blattler said. “While that's probably appropriate from a human health doctor point of view, it's a little bit difficult because it means the dairy employer has to make sure that the employee goes to a certain location, even if that dairy employer has a different medical facility for their workers’ comp care."", '“The dairy community is being responsive to trying to protect animal health and human health of their workers, to the best of their abilities,” said Blattler, but she noted that a lot of dairy producers “have voiced the frustration that trying to get enough equipment, and veterinarian support for their livestock has been difficult.”']"
"Inside the Bungled Bird Flu Response, Where Profits Collide With Public Health",https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/inside-the-bungled-bird-flu-response,"['', '', 'The US Department of Agriculture’s headquarters are situated on a tony stretch of DC real estate, a world away from the nation’s farms. So when something goes seriously wrong on America’s plains and pastures, something that could threaten animal safety or food production, USDA officials rely on rural veterinarians to sound the alarm.', 'Those vets report findings to state veterinarians, whose doors and inboxes are always open. They even post their cell phone numbers online. The state veterinarians, in turn, utilize a network of diagnostic laboratories approved by the USDA, chief among them the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.', 'By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.', 'This close-knit network, with built-in redundancies, is primed to tackle the awful and unexpected, whether it’s foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever, or an act of agroterrorism. There’s little standing on ceremony, and state veterinarians generally feel free to reach out directly to leading USDA officials. “If we want information, we go up the chain to the top,” says Beth Thompson, South Dakota’s state veterinarian.', 'That, at least, is how it’s supposed to work. It’s how veterinarians responding to dairy farms in the Texas panhandle earlier this year assumed it would work when they stumbled upon hellish scenes out of a horror movie. Feverish cows in respiratory distress producing trickles of milk. Dying cats. Enough dead barn pigeons and blackbirds to suggest a mass poisoning. Living birds with twisted necks, their heads tilted skyward.', 'Worried vets enlisted help from colleagues in other states. In mid-March, one sent an email to an emergency address at the NVSL, urging the lab to test for something seemingly unthinkable: highly pathogenic avian influenza, which had never before been detected in cows.', 'Days went by in silence. Finally, on March 25, the USDA lab confirmed that dairy cows in Texas and Kansas had indeed been sickened by a form of bird influenza known as H5N1. Though versions of the so-called bird flu virus have circled the globe for almost two decades, spreading to species ranging from pelicans and polar bears to sea lions and skunks, the announcement stunned the scientific and agricultural communities. “Every honest virologist will tell you: We did not see this coming,” says Kimberly Dodd, dean of Michigan State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine.', '“We plan for every agricultural health emergency, but all of our red teaming missed this” scenario: an agricultural outbreak that potentially imperils public health and leaves cows sick but mostly still standing, says David Stiefel, a former national security policy analyst for the USDA.', 'With continued spread amongst cows, or to another “mixing-vessel” species like pigs, the virus “could mix and match, then you get a whole new genetic constellation,” says Jürgen Richt, regents and university distinguished professor at Kansas State University. Experts are hesitant to speculate about what could happen if the virus were to begin more widely infecting humans, for fear of spreading panic, but the toll could, in the worst case, dwarf that of COVID-19. If the virus “infects a person infected with a human flu strain, and something comes out that is reassorted and adapted to humans? I don’t even want to imagine,” Richt says. “Not good.”', 'The Institute for Disease Modeling, a research institute within the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has estimated that a global flu pandemic could kill close to 33 million people within six months.', 'At that existential moment back in March, when the virus was first detected in cows, veterinarians involved in the response had every expectation that a well-honed network of experts, led by USDA scientists, would immediately rev to life.', 'But it didn’t. “Nobody came,” says one veterinarian in a Western state. “When the diagnosis came in, the government stood still. They didn’t know what to do, so they did nothing.”', 'Now, H5N1 has spread to more than 324 dairy herds in 14 states and has sickened at least 26 farm workers exposed to infected cows and poultry. Those numbers are widely assumed to be vast undercounts, as there is no formal nationwide surveillance program, many dairy farmers oppose testing, and few farm workers are being screened.', 'While there are no known human fatalities, and the infections in people have been mild so far, the toll on cows appears to be intensifying. In California, farmers have reported that up to 15% of sickened cows have died—a mortality rate significantly steeper than in other states. As for humans, the FDA has warned that raw, unpasteurized milk may pose a health threat, though pasteurized milk is safe to drink.', 'This should be a story of heroism, cooperation, and an all-hands effort to defeat a wily virus that many scientists warn could mutate into a pandemic threat. Instead, it is a story of intimidation and obfuscation. The vets who sounded the alarm have been silenced, some even fired, and won’t discuss their experiences on the record for fear of reprisals. And the federal agency that was supposed to help thwart the virus instead has allowed for an unspoken “don’t test, don’t tell” policy among dairy farmers.', 'The USDA’s inaction, critics say, is attributable to its dual—and sometimes conflicting—mandates. It is responsible for the health and safety of the nation’s food animals, but it’s also in charge of promoting and protecting America’s $174.2 billion agriculture trade. And sick cows, with documented cases of a virus never before seen in cattle herds, could be very bad for business.', 'Shortly after the March 25 diagnosis, rather than urging transparency and cooperation, the USDA imposed an effective gag order on its employees, Vanity Fair has learned. On April 10, state veterinarians and diagnostic officials began getting furtive phone calls from longtime colleagues at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the USDA division responsible for protecting the nation’s livestock from diseases. Calling from personal cell phones, they confided that they’d been muzzled by their own agency.', '“They had been told to not discuss, not engage, to discontinue” even routine conversations with health officials in the field, “unless agendas and talking points were given prior clearance,” one state veterinarian says of the back-channel calls.', '“The functional intent was, nobody was allowed to talk to anyone,” says a Midwestern veterinary specialist. “That’s when our phones started ringing. That’s when we started putting it all together. It became very clear: Everything was on the down low, and that really hampered the response from the very beginning.”', 'Eric Deeble, the USDA’s deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, says of the perceived information clampdown: “If anything, it was an effort to ensure that the agencies were coming together, speaking with a single voice, regardless of who we were talking to. I guess to some folks that might have felt restrictive, but it wasn’t.”', 'In a statement, a USDA spokesperson said that “immediately following” confirmed detection of H5N1 in dairy cows, the agency began collaborating with the Department of Health and Human Services to better understand the virus and help halt its spread. Those efforts “have allowed us to protect farmworkers and farmers, the health and welfare of livestock animals, and reaffirm the safety of our nation’s food supply,” the spokesperson continued, adding that the USDA was leaving “no stone unturned in the fight against H5N1.”', 'For this report, Vanity Fair interviewed more than 55 people, including officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the USDA, HHS, and the White House.', 'In the wake of the badly bungled federal response to COVID-19, the Biden administration took steps to guarantee a swifter and more coordinated response to future outbreaks. In June 2023, it established the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR) and appointed the retired major general Paul Friedrichs, a former military doctor with a decades-long career in biosecurity preparedness, as director.', 'But when a black swan scenario materialized this spring—an unprecedented bird flu outbreak in dairy cows, originating in Texas, during an election year in which absolutely no one wants to talk about scary viruses—Friedrichs faced a jumble of state and federal agencies with overlapping jurisdictions. The Food and Drug Administration regulates milk, the CDC handles human infections, and the USDA oversees cows and farms, which are often staffed by undocumented immigrants who may be reluctant to interact with government officials. On a call with scientific experts this spring, Friedrichs said that holding “grown men in my arms while they died” in Iraq was easier than coordinating the federal response to the H5N1 outbreak.', 'Friedrichs tells Vanity Fair that the interspecies nature of the outbreak makes combating it a unique challenge that “requires a different response” from that of COVID-19. “We’re focused on protecting human and animal health, as well as [the] food supply.”', 'Perhaps the biggest wild card has been the USDA’s other mandate, to serve as the government’s chief dairy lobbyist. The agency’s secretary, Thomas Vilsack, 73, previously served as president and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council. At the recent World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin, he deflected a reporter’s question about whether he planned on rejoining the dairy industry after stepping down as secretary, telling reporters: “Nobody can promise where they’re going to be tomorrow.”', 'According to Jason Paragas, former director of innovation at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the USDA is “designed to support industry.” Its scientists—a number of whom departed during the Trump administration, weakening the agency’s analytic heft—are “trying to support science in a nonscientific organization.”', 'Looming over the USDA’s reluctance to conduct a more transparent and proactive campaign against H5N1 in dairy cows are export agreements worth more than $24 billion each year, which include 2.6 million tons of milk, cheese, and ice cream, not to mention more than 5 million tons of poultry and beef. For years, poultry trade agreements have stipulated that the birds be free of H5N1. No one ever considered that such a caveat was needed for the dairy and beef agreements.', 'If those products were to be returned to US markets, it could shrink key agricultural industries and threaten American jobs. “The fear boils down to: How will this affect us in trade?” says Alan Young, chief technology officer for Medgene, an animal-vaccine company. “Nobody knows what the effects are, but the concerns are business concerns.”', 'Rather than moving forcefully to contain and eradicate the virus in dairy cows, critics say, the USDA has tried to control the narrative and spread the message that everything is just fine, actually. In June, Eric Deeble of the USDA told scientific experts on a private phone call, “In the words of the secretary, ‘It’s just going to burn itself out,’” according to an attendee’s handwritten notes, which were obtained by Vanity Fair.', 'That phrase, says Deeble, a large-animal veterinarian by training, is commonly used among farmers to describe taking steps to clear a disease within a herd. He adds that it was “really a determination that USDA believes, and continues to believe, that we can eliminate this disease.”', 'However, in a worrying development, Missouri public health officials are investigating the case of a patient with no known exposure to susceptible animals who tested positive for the virus in late August. A close contact of that patient, as well as six health care workers who treated them, developed similar symptoms but weren’t tested at the time. The news raised fears that, having had the chance to mutate for months among thousands of mammals, the virus could be developing the ability to jump from cow to human, or from human to human—which could, in turn, spark a pandemic.', 'How exactly H5N1 is spreading between farms remains unclear. But the longer the virus “sits and spins and has an opportunity to jump back and forth between mammals and birds and people,” the greater the risk that it will become transmissible among humans, says Tom Halbur, chief operating officer of Medgene.', '“We are seeing a very dangerous virus doing new things in a wide-open space,” says Dr. James Lawler, associate director of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “It’s a ticking time bomb. It is probably not going to detonate. But right now, we are deciding not to look at the alarm clock and wiring attached to the device and just praying it doesn’t go off.”', 'Says Rick Bright, former Health and Human Services deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response: “This didn’t have to be a nationwide outbreak, but there was an intentional decision made by USDA, and the agricultural lobbying groups, to let it rip.”', 'When news of the H5N1 cases reached the White House, Friedrichs and other officials there began laying out an aggressive plan to counter the threat.', 'According to draft documents obtained by Vanity Fair, the plan included commissioning an “on-the-ground study of farms and infected animals” and urging “farmers, industry, and local and state agriculture and public health” officials to grant access to affected areas. The documents advised the USDA to take “aggressive biosecurity measures” to contain the virus, including ensuring surveillance of any livestock at risk.', 'But it soon became clear, as an administration official tells Vanity Fair, that Friedrichs’s OPPR and Vilsack’s USDA were reading from very different playbooks. The former was planning a public-health-directed response, while the latter was prioritizing the needs of the dairy industry.', 'A senior administration official denies this, saying the USDA has been a “critical player in outreach and communication.” The official adds, “Secretary Vilsack himself has made 25 personal calls to governors, advocates, and partners in industry to stress the urgency” of responding to the outbreak.', 'In April, a former USDA official says, there was an “uproar from industry.” Dairy representatives began calling their USDA contacts to sound the alarm that the White House was reaching out to them directly, without looping in the agency that was their champion and protector. Concerned that the White House was trying to circumvent them, USDA officials began circling the wagons.', 'According to the former USDA official, the White House alienated the agency by pushing too hard: “I think there was some very aggressive hand-waving at the beginning that made [the USDA] less inclined to assist.”', 'The agency also faced a stark reality, says the former official: “Everything they do relies on farmers, industry, and state and local officials letting them in.”', 'On April 10, five days after the White House meeting, state veterinarians began getting calls from their USDA contacts saying they had been directed to cut off communications. Even routine biweekly calls with USDA veterinary services were suspended.', 'On April 15, three national veterinary organizations wrote a letter to Secretary Vilsack, which Vanity Fair obtained, urging the agency to be transparent:', 'One way communication will not be effective in uniting regulatory and industry partners to mitigate and control the outbreak. Please encourage open communication, solicit feedback in the creation of guidance, allow access to data and results and continue to allow this coalition unfettered access to our APHIS and [Veterinary Services] Field Staff.', 'It took Vilsack more than a month to write back, saying that he was “absolutely committed to timely, accurate, ongoing and coordinated communications about this situation.”', 'By then, as more dairy cows fell ill, even some White House staffers suspected the USDA of protecting milk sales at the expense of public health.', 'In a statement, a senior administration official refuted this notion, saying the USDA immediately activated its state networks and laboratories, deployed epidemiology teams to six states on request, required testing of cows moving across state lines, and launched new programs to support dairy farmers. In addition, the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response has provided farm workers with protective equipment and ramped up production of human vaccines, says a spokesman there.', 'While it is hard to ever be “fully satisfied” with any outbreak response, says Cyrus Shahpar, OPPR’s director for pandemic and biological threats intelligence, “we take this seriously.”', 'On any given day, thousands of the nation’s 9.3 million dairy cows cross state lines to be raised, milked, fed, or slaughtered. Their movements ebb and flow based on factors including the shifting seasons and the fluctuating price of feed.', 'In late March, it fell to Texas state veterinarian Lewis “Bud” Dinges to decide whether to halt the traffic of cows back and forth across state lines. Scientifically speaking, the correct choice was obvious, says Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the US Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center. “The very core tenet of disease management is to not move it around, right?”', 'But Dinges declined to act, and cows soon carried the virus to other states. “We could have stopped this literally in its tire tracks in April,” says Richards. “We didn’t.”', 'Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller, who is reportedly on the short list to be US agriculture secretary if Donald Trump is reelected, takes the view that H5N1 is “not a big deal. It’s not even a little deal. It only affects 10% of the milking cows. I don’t even know anyone who lost a cow.”', 'Even as the cows kept moving, Miller refused CDC help to test exposed workers on Texas’s farms. “This was not going to end well,” he says, comparing the government’s plans to “show up on a dairy farm unannounced” and “stick a needle in all the employees” to the 2014 Cliven Bundy fiasco, when a Nevada rancher incited an armed standoff with federal officials who sought restitution for unpaid grazing fees.', 'The CDC’s principal deputy director, Nirav Shah, says that while the CDC did not deploy a team on-site, “we offered to send folks to support whatever types of endeavors Texas wanted support with: testing, laboratory assistance, epidemiology, data support. We opened our doors.”', 'On April 24, the USDA issued a federal order for limited interstate testing. Any farmer seeking to move lactating cows across state lines had to submit negative test results for 30 cows from a USDA-approved laboratory. But herds on the move often contain hundreds of cows, and the veterinary community was soon whipped by rumors that farmers were gaming the tests by prescreening their cows in private labs to determine which were healthy.', 'The Texas Animal Health Commission, which declined to make Dinges available for an interview, acknowledged that it did not restrict the movement of lactating dairy cattle on infected farms until after the federal order went into effect.', 'The level of vigilance has varied widely from state to state. This summer, Colorado determined that more than half of its 106 dairy herds had been infected, but that’s because it was looking. It became the first state to mandate the testing of milk in bulk tanks, where farms hold pooled milk.', 'In late August, the virus landed in California after cows from the state were shipped to Idaho and then sent back home. A spokesman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture tells Vanity Fair that the strain of the virus found there most closely matches the one from Idaho, though an investigation is ongoing. If the California cows were infected in Idaho, then it seems clear that the federal order on interstate testing has been insufficient in stopping the spread.', 'Says Idaho’s state veterinarian, Scott Leibsle, “That’s how the livestock business goes. We’re trying to keep our industries viable, and sometimes we find ourselves walking a tightrope with our regulations so they don’t restrain commerce but safeguard animal health.”', 'The virus is now ripping through California, the nation’s largest dairy producer, with 1,100 herds. As of late October, 124 dairy herds in the state have been infected. With the outbreak intensifying, photographs have circulated of dead cows piled outside dairy farms.', 'As the virus continued to proliferate—in Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Idaho, and beyond—fear spread with it. At least five veterinarians who had been outspoken, or simply principled, in responding to the outbreak, were fired from their jobs, Vanity Fair has learned.', 'One, who had initially been asked by her employer, an animal-health company, to speak publicly about the outbreak, was suddenly told she was a risk to the company’s shareholders. She was threatened with unpaid leave, then fired. Another veterinarian who had advocated for exposed farm workers was let go. Yet another, who refused, prior to the federal order, to give manifestly sick cows a clean bill of health, was also fired.', 'As word of the dismissals spread, rural veterinarians who had initially spoken with the press became unwilling to go on the record, fearful it would damage their reputations and employment prospects within the tight-knit communities they served.', 'Rural veterinarians today face a bleak landscape that is far from the cheery scenes of All Creatures Great and Small, the James Herriot book recently adapted by Masterpiece. Burdened with a crushing workload, veterinary school debt, and a dwindling number of farms in remote areas, they also log “a lot of windshield time” that can make starting a family challenging, says Joe Armstrong, a Minnesota veterinarian who has spoken about the toll of the outbreak on his bovine-themed podcast, The Moos Room.', 'Fred Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, says he is aware of vets being fired: “This disease sometimes put the veterinarian in the middle, between what they feel they should be doing and what the farmer wants them to do.”', 'One veterinarian in an impacted state, who knows several of the vets involved, says their firings could be “personality-driven.” He adds that they “have a high need for validation. They’re really high feelers. Maybe if they don’t get the response they need, they get louder.”', 'But the clampdown on vocal vets has been fueled in part by the growing consolidation of the dairy industry. Where there were once thousands of family farms, there are now a much smaller number of mega-farms. Atop those farms sit vast dairy processors, who control regional markets. One of the largest processors, Select Milk Producers, spun off a brand of milk drinks called Fairlife, which was purchased by Coca-Cola. Smaller dairy farms face little choice but to sell to the processors or perish.', '“The whole thing is just the perfect storm,” says Austin Frerick, author of Barons: Money, Power, and the Corruption of America’s Food Industry. “These dairy operators are essentially capital asset managers. It’s so consolidated. For family farmers, there are only one or two buyers of your milk. If you don’t go along with the playbook, your market access is cut off and you go bankrupt.”', 'And H5N1 was not in the corporate playbook. Dairy farmers, afraid their cows would be quarantined or that they would not be able to sell their milk, simply opted not to test. Some forced veterinarians off their property. “Everyone is so scared shitless. That is what is going on in the background,” says the Western-state veterinarian.', 'Meanwhile, the USDA was sitting on details about infected farms. Researchers rely on the international data-sharing platform GISAID to track the spread of worrisome viruses, and the USDA’s H5N1 submissions have been both late and frustratingly light on detail. The CDC submits H5N1 sequences and metadata within eight days. Countries like Vietnam and Cambodia move even faster. But the USDA has been sharing the genetic sequences of H5N1 samples an average of 24 days after collection, and those submissions don’t say on what date, or even in which state, each sample was collected. Only later, usually after three to six weeks, does the agency provide that additional information. As a result, the USDA’s data is effectively useless for monitoring in real time how the virus is mutating. “Why can the US CDC provide actionable information while the USDA cannot?” asks a GISAID staffer. “The withholding of such data by other nations would most certainly have triggered political outrage at the highest level in the US.”', 'A USDA spokesman defends the agency’s approach, saying it helps to ensure the accuracy of the data and “the high confidence currently placed in our published, curated sequences domestically and in the worldwide research community.”', 'In late May, trying to break this logjam, a Minnesota veterinarian and professor who studies the spread of influenza viruses, Dr. Marie Culhane, reached out to state veterinarians dealing with farm outbreaks to ask for more detailed information. At the very least, she hoped to obtain the date on which, as well as the region from which, samples had been taken.', '“We look at pathways of infection and then we can put in stop measures,” says Culhane. “I was trying to do it in a safe way” that would not identify the farms. “I wasn’t asking for GPS coordinates of a farm so that Vanity Fair could go there and bug them.”', 'In late May, a state veterinarian wrote back to her on behalf of colleagues from 10 states, giving a hard no: “We will be declining to supply the requested information at this time.”', 'In March 2020, as passengers stricken with COVID-19 were marooned on a cruise ship off the California coast, President Trump infamously announced that he didn’t want those infected to come ashore or be tested because “I like the numbers being where they are.”', 'Today, without nationwide surveillance or a clear understanding of the H5N1 outbreak’s scope, “we are repeating every single mistake” of the last pandemic, says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. “The whole adage of ‘don’t take a test because we don’t want to know what the answer is’ is really irritating.”', 'In May, Medgene informed the USDA that it had an H5N1 vaccine for cows and already had half a million preorders from desperate farmers. To develop the vaccine, the company relied on USDA regulations formulated in 2018 to accelerate vaccine approval in the event of an agricultural emergency.', 'But as it struggled to get sign-off, the company kept hearing that trade restrictions stood in the way. Meanwhile, the USDA kept stating that vaccine development was still in the early stages. Says Medgene CEO Mark Luecke: “We’re screaming at the top of our lungs, ‘We have an H5N1 vaccine for cattle ready to help farmers and ranchers today!’”', 'Deeble contends that USDA is “truly supportive” of the effort to develop an H5N1 vaccine for dairy cows. “We’ve invested an extraordinary amount of money into the research to develop a vaccine model” and the needed technology for manufacturers to show a vaccine is effective, he says.', 'Most cows that contract H5N1 eventually recover with treatment. The same cannot be said for chickens. In order to satisfy the letter of trade agreements that claim no avian influenza is present in America’s poultry stock, entire flocks are “depopped”—euthanized en masse—any time a single bird gets sick.', 'Since April, the avian influenza running rampant in dairy cows has led to the culling of at least 18.6 million birds, says Dr. Michelle Kromm, a poultry-medicine expert who analyzed data from the USDA and other sources to arrive at that number. Poultry veterinarians “cannot comprehend what is happening,” says Kromm. “With poultry being treated as less important than dairy, the mental health issues that come with killing animals for disease control, the [substantial] economic impact—to just allow it to continue with no end in sight, that’s an untenable situation.”', 'In July, the American Association of Avian Pathologists issued a statement calling for a national strategy that adheres to “science-based principles of disease control.”', 'Taking aim at the limited federal testing order, it said, “The narrow requirement of pre-movement testing of only lactating dairy cows moving interstate is inadequate and overlooks risks that other classes of cattle pose to poultry.”', 'Meanwhile, Europe’s top influenza researchers have watched the US response unfold with astonishment and dismay. “I thought at the beginning of the outbreak that surely a high-income country with a very good infrastructure, with very well-trained veterinarians and infectious disease people, would be able to contain this virus quite easily,” says Thijs Kuiken, an avian influenza expert at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “However, that is not the case.”', 'Deeble says the USDA has been moving as swiftly and aggressively as it can, given its limited authority, which does “not allow us to go and collect whatever information we might want to at any time.” He adds, “The USDA doesn’t own farms.”', 'It is unclear whether the virus, as it continues to spread and evolve, will ultimately pose a serious threat to human health.

Bird flu thought to have killed Californian cows,https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-41501675.html,"['Bird flu has been found in more than 300 dairy herds in 14 states. Picture: Crystal Heath via Reuters', ""There are signs of bird flu being much more severe in dairy cows in California, perhaps linked to very hot weather in the state's Central Valley, which has the highest dairy farming density in the USA."", 'Since last March, bird flu has been found in more than 300 dairy herds in 14 states, and since the end of August, it has infected 120 herds in California, the top milk-producing state. It was recently spreading in California at a rate of 15 farms per week.', 'There is an estimated 20% cut in production for some California dairy farmers, compounded by a recent milk price cut from $24 to $21 per hundredweight.', 'The Milk Producers Council, which represents dairy families throughout California, has warned fourth-quarter dairy industry output could plummet due to bird flu spreading rapidly in the state, which accounts for about 40% of the USA\'s milk production. This could have ""an explosive impact"" on dairy prices (with the state\'s all-year-round production, the last quarter is usually the lowest producing, but only by a small percentage).', 'Infected herds in California are seeing cow mortality rates as high as 15% or 20%, compared to only 2% in other states, the Reuters news agency was told by Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.', ""Farms that might normally lose one or two cows per month have had hundreds die, said Anja Raudabaugh, chief executive of Western United Dairies, which handles 75% of the state's milk production."", 'Cows suffering from the virus have fever, reduced milk production, and other symptoms. Due to the increased death toll, rendering plants struggled to process all the dead animals, and wildlife scavenging on carcasses, sometimes left lying around for days, may be facilitating the spread of bird flu. Recent temperatures in the main dairy areas exceeding 35C have exacerbated the situation.', 'Advice for farmers', 'To protect their herds, dairy farmers are advised to strictly quarantine new or returning cattle (including contract-reared heifers or show animals) for 30 days, paired with pre-movement testing, which is available for free. The isolation area must be separated from resident cows. Early segregation of infected animals can greatly limit within-herd spread.', 'Cleaning and disinfecting shared livestock transport vehicles before and after farm entry is seen as critical.', 'Employees should not be shared with other dairy or poultry operations, and their farm-specific boots and coveralls should never leave the dairy.', 'Delivery vehicles (feed, milk tankers, rendering) should not cross farm vehicle paths. Because infected milk is a primary method of disease spread, processors may have to dedicate certain milk tanker trucks for infected farms.', 'It is also recommended for workers to use personal protective equipment, such as eye protection (face shields or safety goggles), respirators (N95 masks), and gloves. These are being supplied for free to farms by milk processors such as Western United Dairies, and agencies such as Tulare County Health, and the Tulare Agricultural Commissioner.', 'The virus has also infected 25 Americans this year. All but one had exposure to infected cows or poultry. All those infected experienced only mild flu symptoms.', ""Of the 11 infected in California, most were from the Central Valley's Tulare County, the number one dairy farming county in the USA."", 'Dairy farmers are obliged to not deliver milk from sick cows for food processing, but consumers have been assured there is no safety concern with milk from infected cows, as long as it is pasteurised.', 'Devastating disease for cows', 'Meanwhile, a small-scale research study of only six lactating cows that had bird flu injected into their udders showed how devastating the disease could be. They had severe illness, including lethargy, high fever, inflammation, and reduced feed intake, and four had to be humanely euthanised.

The outbreak, primarily affecting agricultural workers who come into close contact with infected birds, has intensified concerns about the virus’s spread among humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the number of human infections has risen to 31, sparking discussions around containment and prevention strategies.', 'This week, Washington reported its first human case of avian influenza, with four additional individuals suspected to be infected after handling infected birds at an egg farm in Franklin County. The affected individuals are agricultural workers who experienced mild symptoms and received antiviral medication as a precaution. In response to the outbreak, approximately 800,000 birds were euthanized at the farm to curb further spread. Washington now joins California, Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, and Texas as states with confirmed human cases of bird flu.', '', 'The CDC has been closely monitoring the escalating situation, with confirmed human infections across multiple states. California has reported the highest number, with 13 cases among dairy workers, most of whom experienced mild symptoms. Although no hospitalizations have been reported, a concerning case from Texas involved a worker who developed an unusual symptom: bleeding in the eyes. The varying symptom profiles among infected individuals highlight the virus’s unpredictable nature, and the CDC has urged strict adherence to preventive measures among individuals in direct contact with birds.', 'Also Read:  Bihar Hooch Tragedy Claims 35 Lives: Uncovering the Dangers of Illicit Liquor', 'Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is highly contagious and primarily spreads through direct contact with infected birds. The virus is found in the saliva, mucus, and faeces of infected birds and can spread through various bodily fluids, organs, and respiratory secretions of other animals. Humans typically contract bird flu when the virus enters through the eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled, often during close interactions with infected animals. ', 'Transmission to humans usually occurs in environments where people are in close, prolonged contact with infected birds, such as farms or poultry processing facilities. The virus’s contagious nature makes it essential for those in high-risk environments to follow strict hygiene practices and use protective gear to prevent exposure.', '', 'Human symptoms of bird flu range from mild to severe. Common symptoms reported by infected individuals include:', 'In California, most infected individuals reported only mild symptoms, such as red eyes and discharge. However, the severity of symptoms can vary, as demonstrated by the Texas worker who experienced eye bleeding. Early detection and treatment with antiviral medication have proven effective in managing symptoms and preventing severe complications.', 'Also Read:  Bengaluru Sees Spike In Dry Eye Syndrome: How Pollution And Screen Time Are To Blamed', 'To address the outbreak, the CDC and state health departments have implemented containment strategies. In Franklin County, the decision to euthanize 800,000 birds was a preventive step to limit potential transmission to humans and halt further spread among avian populations. Health authorities are conducting regular testing of farm workers exposed to infected birds to detect and manage new cases promptly. They are also raising awareness about personal protective measures, such as wearing masks, gloves, and other protective gear, particularly among individuals working in poultry farms or areas with infected bird populations.', '', 'The recent bird flu outbreak underscores the potential risks of zoonotic diseases, where pathogens jump from animals to humans. The CDC continues to track cases and collaborate with state health departments to prevent further human infections. While avian influenza has not yet demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission, the rise in cases serves as a reminder of the need for vigilant monitoring and robust response strategies. Health officials are hopeful that proactive measures and public awareness will help contain the virus and prevent a wider outbreak.', 'As the CDC and health departments nationwide work to control this bird flu outbreak, individuals in affected areas, especially those involved in poultry farming and processing, are advised to remain alert and adhere to safety protocols.

At the same briefing, the USDA said it was confident of eradicating the viral disease in dairy herds despite the ever-rising number of outbreaks in California.', 'The No. 1 dairy state, California has accounted for 137 of the 339 infected herds nationwide, or 40%. In the past 30 days, it was home to 97 of the 101 outbreaks in 14 states nationwide. The other four were in Idaho. Some states have gone months without a new outbreak.', '“We have seen effective elimination of the virus in herds,” said USDA bird flu adviser Eric Deeble. He declined to say the virus was under control in cattle, but said that “we think it’s unlikely” it will persist in the face of efforts to isolate infected herds to prevent the spread of the disease. Asked about his expression of confidence early this month about eliminating the virus in cattle, Deeble said, “Yes, I stand by that.”', 'California also leads the nation in human cases of bird flu, with 15, all of them workers on dairy farms. The U.S. total was 31, with 10 infections in Colorado, two in Washington, two in Michigan, one in Texas, and one in Missouri. The Missouri case was a puzzle because the patient had no known contact with animals. The CDC also said it was conducting confirmatory tests on suspected cases in five poultry workers in Washington.', 'Extensive serological tests of samples from health care workers involved in treating the Missouri patient found “no evidence of person-to-person” transmission of the avian flu virus, said Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. A household contact became ill at the same time as the Missouri patient, suggesting a common exposure to the virus, he said. While the patient tested positive for bird flu, results were not definitive for the household contact. “This is sort of the end of what a lab can do,” Daskalakis said.', 'Serological tests look for antibodies that form in the blood following exposure to a virus. Public health officials say the risk of bird flu to the general population remains low. They are watching for changes in the makeup of the virus that would make it more infectious among humans, a potentially dangerous evolution.', 'Aside from the Missouri case, the human cases involved dairy and poultry workers employed on farms with infected herds and poultry flocks. All of the infected workers had mild symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, and none were hospitalized.', 'There have been reports of distressing death rates from bird flu among dairy cattle in California, several times higher than the 1 to 2% documented by the USDA earlier this year. “We have no specific evidence the H5N1 virus is acting differently,” said Deeble. A compounding factor in California might be the heat wave that has put additional stress on livestock, he said. At some farms in Tulare County, dead cattle are left along the roadside, said the Los Angeles Times earlier this week.', 'Two field trials for potential bird flu vaccines for dairy cattle are underway, said Deeble.

Video shows dead cows with bird flu. Is enough being done to stop the spread?,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/10/24/cows-bird-flu-response-california/75705572007/,"['Flies buzzed around a pile of about a dozen dead cows on a California dairy farm. ', 'This morbid image from a viral video in early October raised alarms about the dead heifers, half-covered behind barriers near a dusty country road. The cows were sick with bird flu, a virus that has spread among cattle in at least 14 states and has rapidly taken hold in California’s Central Valley, home to the nation’s largest dairy production.', ""An industry representative and state officials confirmed the scene of dead cattle was filmed outside a farm where there had been an outbreak of the virus. The arid region had experienced triple-digit temperatures, which officials believe may have been a factor in the cows' deaths."", 'The images illustrate the impact of the rapid spread of bird flu across American dairies since its spillover from wild birds in Texas nearly a year ago to industrial-scale farms in California. It is known to have infected dozens of farmworkers along the way, including 15 dairy workers in California as of Thursday morning.', ""Bird flu hasn't impacted the nation’s dairy supply. Milk is safe to drink once it's pasteurized, a process that kills pathogens. However, officials worry about the downstream effects on workers and farmers. Federal officials have offered financial assistance for farmers who lose products or livestock."", 'Officials continue to say in occasional briefings that the risk to the general public remains low. But it has been higher for farmworkers, most of whom are Latino immigrants and may be undocumented or have work visas. These workers often come into direct contact with infected cattle or poultry. Thirty have contracted bird flu across the U.S., as of Thursday.', '“It’s not yet a public health issue. It could be, but it’s not really yet,” said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health programs at the National Center for Farmworker Health, a nonprofit partnering in the federal bird flu response. “But right now, it is a worker health issue.”', 'California reported its first sick cow in August and the first human with the disease this month. Overall, 137 herds have become infected.', '“We’ve been watching it approach for some time,” Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, an association representing California dairy farmers, told USA TODAY. “Our additional biosecurity measures worked to a point until they didn’t. Now we have a lot of cow-to-cow transmission, and it’s been a big challenge for our dairy farmers in California.”', 'Over 330 dairy herds across 14 states have had infected cows, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. More than a third of infected herds are in California.', '“Do we, meaning California and the U.S., want to be the epicenter of the next pandemic?” Dr. Gail Hansen, a former public health veterinarian for the state of Kansas, told USA TODAY. “I don’t want to be. I don’t want to sound too alarmist, but it’s certainly possible.”', 'In early October, Dr. Crystal Heath, a California veterinarian who founded the animal welfare nonprofit Our Honor, recorded a video of dead cows in Tulare County, the California region with the greatest dairy production. There were no signs at that site that the dairy was preventing people or animals from getting near the infected carcasses, she said. She visited other farms and witnessed similar scenes, she said.', 'Dead cows infected with bird flu must be separated from their herds, which the video showed, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said in emailed responses. The cows must be stored on private property before being transported for “disposal” and should not be buried underground, the email said.', 'Raudabaugh, whose council represents the farm shown in the video, said the farm followed procedure, which requires separating the carcasses. Cows cannot be used for meat, she added. The carcasses instead go through “rendering,” in which they are incinerated and used for tallow or leather.', 'When the video was recorded, the rendering truck scheduled to collect the dead cows had been backlogged for several days, Raudabaugh said.', 'With severe infections, cows can die of bird flu. The mortality rate among cows is considered fairly low, at about 2%, by the American Veterinary Medical Association.', 'Raudabaugh’s dairy council estimated mortality rates from bird flu are closer to 10 to 15%. The region experienced a late-season heat wave, which made it trickier to discern whether temperatures contributed to the uptick in deaths.', 'There don’t appear to be dramatic changes in the number of cows dying from bird flu, said Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, an organization representing veterinarians who treat cows. ', 'Gingrich views the dead cows in the video as an isolated incident that served as a good biosecurity measure to reduce bird flu\'s spread on farms. He said rendering trucks that transport dead cows don’t enter farms because that could expose herds to diseases. Instead, they pick up dead cows at the nearest road. This process protects cattle but exposes farms to ""bad PR"" from activists, he said.', 'In a press briefing Thursday, Dr. Eric Deeble, a high-ranking USDA official, said there is no evidence of changes in the bird flu circulating in California cows when compared with the virus in other states. He said reports of higher death rates among cattle in the Central Valley could be attributed to environmental factors, such as excessive heat, farming practices and the density and proximity of animal populations to one another.', 'Dr. Elisha Frye, an associate professor at Cornell University, said it is important to note that U.S. dairy cows are typically the black and white Holstein breed, originally from cooler areas in northern Europe. ', 'The cows, which can weigh more than 1,500 pounds, produce around 100 pounds of milk per day, which is akin to a person running a marathon, she explained. In addition to working hard every day, cows are more vulnerable to heat stress when cows get sick.', ""The route of bird flu transmission among cows hasn't been established."", 'Initially, officials believed cows moving among farms and between states – a practice common in the dairy industry – was driving the spread. The USDA issued an order requiring that the milk of lactating dairy cows be tested for the disease before they could be moved across state lines, but bird flu continued to move across the country. The Los Angeles Times reported that bird flu had likely been introduced to California by cattle being transported.', 'In an email, the USDA said the virus is being transmitted through contact with objects, such as milking equipment or people’s clothes or vehicles and farm equipment, that have come into contact with infected cattle. It then spreads among herds.', 'The USDA strongly encouraged farmers to heed its recommendations, including limiting how often people move among farms, and how often they move cattle and equipment on and off worksites.', 'Gingrich said keeping this in check is difficult in large-scale operations in the Central Valley, where farming is ingrained in communities.', '“We really don’t have a good grasp of how many dairies have been affected,” Gingrich told USA TODAY. “Producers are hesitant to report and they remain so unless states mandate it.”', 'If Gingrich were a dairy farmer in an affected state, he said, he’d be bulk-testing the milk in his tanks, which is required in California farms with infected herds and other farms nearby.', 'Milk samples test positive long before cows show symptoms. If they did this testing, farmers could more quickly take steps to protect their cows, notify veterinarians and alert neighbors when there is an infection. National surveillance of bulk-testing milk is needed, he said.', 'Experts are still exploring the route of transmission to humans. Nearly all of the 31 reported cases this year were in poultry and dairy workers, and officials expect that cases will continue to increase. Officials say there is no evidence of spread from person to person.', 'At dairies, officials believe transmission to workers has happened when they have close contact with infected animals, for example, when people work near udders and raw milk, where traces of the virus are highest. Workers can be infected if they touch something contaminated or milk splashes on them and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.', 'Infected workers have had mild symptoms, including eye redness, and recovered, state and federal officials said.', ""The increase in confirmed cases probably reflects growing awareness and testing, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of the pediatric infectious diseases division at the University of California, Davis, Health. There don't appear to be changes in how the disease is transmitted from animals to humans."", ""In Fresno County in the Central Valley, no humans have been reported with bird flu. But Dr. Rois Vohra, the county's interim health officer, said he's not holding his breath."", '“Luck and fortune are smiling upon us,” said Vohra, who is also a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “These cases have been pretty mild, and people have recovered very quickly. But it does require vigilance and attention.”', 'Measures used during the COVID-19 pandemic translate well to the bird flu response, Vohra said. These include using personal protective equipment. While N95 respirators are a form of protection, they can be difficult to use in hot conditions in the Central Valley. However, he said goggles and face shields are necessary.', 'Seasonal flu vaccines are another tool. These vaccines don’t protect against bird flu, but officials are concerned if people become infected with both viruses bird flu could mutate into a more severe or transmissible virus.', 'Labor advocates worry about whether enough resources are provided to protect dairy workers. They, after all, are the front line in containing bird flu spread in the U.S.', ""“There seems to be all of these resources being invested to protect capital,” said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for the United Farm Workers, a union with a long history in California’s Central Valley. (The UFW doesn't represent local dairy workers.) “Precious few of those resources are actually being used in a way that meaningfully protects the health of the workers who we know who are at high risk.”""]"

None of the individuals have been hospitalized,”  the Center for Disease Control & Prevention said.', '(Beth Clifton collage)', 'But that supposed reassurance cuts both ways.  The less severe the H5N1 symptoms in most infected individuals,  the greater the risk that an H5N1 strain is evolving that can spread from person to person without killing the hosts.', 'Once such a strain emerges,  it can rapidly become widely distributed,  and can begin killing victims with weak immune systems,  much as do more familiar influenza strains,  and as did COVID 19,  which killed more than 1.2 million Americans before evolving into weaker varieties that are much less lethal to most victims.', 'Meanwhile in Michigan,  cows have developed H5N1 on 30 dairy farms.', '(Beth Clifton collage)', 'From Missouri,  New York Times reporters Apoorva Mandavilli and Emily Anthes recounted on October 24,  2024 that,  “A Missouri resident who shared a home with a patient hospitalized with bird flu in August 2024 was also infected with the virus,  federal officials reported.', '“Symptomatic health care workers who cared for the hospitalized patient were not infected, testing showed.

,https://www.thepigsite.com/articles/hpai-in-cattle-whats-next,"['Several speakers at the Second International Avian Influenza Summit held at the University of Arkansas addressed the recent spillover of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) into dairy cattle in the United States.', 'Dr. Erica Spackman, US National Poultry Research Center, USDA Agricultural Research Service, noted that HPAI outbreaks are now global and affecting species not traditionally associated with HPAI, such as dairy cows.', 'Almost all HPAI cases are from the H5N1 Gs/GD (Goose/Guandong/1996) lineage with clade 2.3.4.4 behaving in ways never seen before. This virus has become endemic in numerous wild bird species, particularly dabbling ducks and has the potential to adapt to new hosts.', 'These ducks are a reservoir for different genes that can reassort with highly pathogenic viruses and have low barrier to transmission among different species. This virus has caused great losses in the US poultry industry since 2022 and is still ongoing.', 'Historically, low pathogenic AI (LPAI) was transmitted from ducks to chickens and turkeys, becoming highly pathogenic and then transmitting back to ducks. Ducks are now virus factories, spreading HPAI not just LPAI.', 'LPAI, and now HPAI, can spread from wild birds to humans, pigs, dogs, horses, sea lions and other mammalian species. It has now infected dairy cows and these could evolve into a sustained reservoir for the virus, which calls for new control measures, Spackman concluded.', 'Juan Piñeiro, DVM, MS, PhD, assistant professor and dairy extension specialist, Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension, said that the outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle started in the Texas panhandle in February 2023 and has now spread to 14 states, affecting over 319 dairy herds (and counting). The outbreak caused a 10-11% decrease in milk production and dry matter intake. There was significant variation in how different dairies were affected, with some experiencing only a 4% decrease in milk production and others up to 20%, with some cows experiencing up to an 80% loss.', 'The disease was initially misdiagnosed but later confirmed as HPAI H5N1 clade B3.13. On March 25, 2023, USDA confirmed HPAI in samples from Kansas and Texas. Interstate movement restrictions were implemented for lactating cows, requiring negative test results for at least 30 cows before moving dairy herds. By the time of the USDA no-movement order was issued, infected cattle had moved across the country; in August 2023 there were 197 cases in 14 states.', 'Precision dairy technologies like wearable collars which measure rumination, activity, and feeding time, alerted producers that something was wrong. Initial investigations focused on mycotoxins, due to the high number of cases.', 'Collaboration with the Texas Animal Health Commission and the USDA highlighted the spread and impact of the outbreak. The diagnostic process was lengthy, requiring elimination of differential diagnoses and confirmatory tests from national laboratories.', 'The outbreak followed a sequential pattern, starting with individual cows, then spreading to pens, dairies, and eventually counties and states. The absence of a system to quickly investigate and respond to new diseases was identified as a key challenge.', 'The FDA and USDA provided evidence that commercial milk supplies remain safe due to pasteurization and separation of sick cows from the milk supply. Studies show that pasteurization effectively inactivates HPAI, alleviating public concerns about food safety.', 'Piñeiro emphasized the importance of improving timely communication and collaborative efforts from different agencies to stop the spread of this or other emerging diseases. While there is an official system in place to deal with foot and mouth disease, no system really exists for other infectious diseases.', 'Piñeiro concluded by highlighting the need for development of vaccines for dairy cattle to address HPAI. Vaccination is critical in preventing similar outbreaks in the future.', 'Dr. Kay Russo, DVM, MAHM, DACPV, RSM Consulting, Colorado, is a practicing veterinarian in dairy cattle and poultry. She was involved in the initial efforts to diagnose the mystery disease in dairy cattle in Texas in early 2023. There were many challenges in diagnosing and managing the outbreak. The suggestion to consider HPAI as a possible cause was initially met with skepticism.', '“There were just all sorts of rumors swirling about what this disease could be.” Dairy veterinarians in Texas had gone through a litany of tests which came up negative on all the usual diseases. Currently working as a poultry veterinarian, Russo was aware of the damage HPAI has done over the last two years in the US. “Since this strain moved into a lot of mammalian species… with the respiratory involvement, the digestive involvement…we ought to consider influenza.”', 'A Texas dairy veterinarian mentioned that all the birds on the farm were dead. That raised alarms with Russo. She asked the dairy to collect dead birds and submit them for influenza testing. Those samples came up positive for HPAI. But it took a lot of convincing to get dairy samples tested for HPAI.', 'Typically, about 30% of a dairy herd is replaced with heifers each year. Calves get fed waste milk and get infected. The USDA stop-movement order did not include replacement heifers. There is no clear playbook for handling the HPAI virus on dairy farms or potential for depopulation, which is the typical response on poultry farms.', 'Russo emphasized the importance of a cross-species approach to manage the virus and the need for better testing and reporting. The focus on lactating cows ignores the spread of the disease by calves. Wastewater monitoring is needed to detect the virus, along with better surveillance in general.', 'She concluded by emphasizing the need for a coordinated response to avoid another pandemic and the importance of public health measures in general.', 'Dr. Michelle Kromm, DVM, MPH, MAM, Diplomate ACPV, Food Forward LLC, noted that HPAI virus clade B3.13 presents unique challenges for all animal agriculture, including the need for a consistent national strategy, better science generation, and the exploration of vaccine programs to break transmission cycles.', 'The occurrence of genotype B3.13 HPAI in dairy cattle requires a reevaluation of traditional disease response strategies. Challenges include a lack of consensus by the poultry and dairy industries on the aim of the response programs, which is eradication in poultry but not in dairy cattle.', 'Additional resources are needed to minimize long-term impacts on human health, food security, and economic sustainability. Field-level data informing science-based policies is critical; policies must be based on good science to mitigate risks. Vaccine programs are needed for at-risk animal populations, including humans, to break transmission cycles.', 'Kromm’s conclusion reflects the comments of other speakers at this conference: HPAI in dairy cattle is a game-changer for animal agriculture and even poses the risk of causing a human pandemic.', 'Global Ag Media provides a knowledge sharing platform offering premium news, analysis and information resources for the global agriculture industry.', '', '', 'Sign up to our regular newsletter and access news from across the Global AG Media network']"

All of those individuals came into contact with infected dairy cattle.', 'Dairies in the Central Valley have been overwhelmed by the virus. In some cases, the situation is so severe that dairies have been inundated by the large volume of cattle carcasses.', 'The disease is also extremely contagious and highly fatal to birds. The virus renders all meat and eggs from the flock unsafe for human consumption. Because of the virus, millions of birds have been euthanized at poultry facilities in Merced County and California.', 'Humans can be infected with the virus by coming into direct contact with infected birds, cattle or other animals, even if they are dead.', 'It is also unsafe to come into contact with contaminated bedding, feed, water troughs, and other contaminated surfaces.', 'The risk of human infection of bird flu is low, and human-to-human transmission is rare, according to the release.', 'Symptoms are consistent with acute respiratory tract infections including, but not limited to cough, sore throat, fever, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue, muscle or body aches, conjunctivitis. shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.', 'Individuals who are exposed and develop symptoms should seek treatment as soon as possible through their doctor or the Merced County Department of Public Health.', 'For more information on bird flu visit the California Department of Public Health website.']"

In response to the recent spread of H5N1 in lactating dairy cows to California and the resulting human cases and the human cases in Washington resulting from an outbreak among poultry, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are working closely with the state and local counterparts to respond to the outbreak and protect public health. While CDC’s assessment of the risk of avian influenza to the general public remains low, USDA and HHS continue to take this outbreak seriously to protect human health, animal health, and food safety.', ""Animal Health \nAs of October 24, 2024, a total of 137 California dairy herds have tested positive for H5N1 since the initial detection in late August. USDA is collaborating with California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) to support ongoing epidemiological investigations, increased surveillance and enhanced biosecurity. USDA has deployed the following teams to assist California's efforts:"", 'USDA is also working with California animal health officials to support diagnosing and treating, particularly in regions like the Central Valley, where earlier excessive heat added stress to already affected animals. The USDA continues to emphasize the importance of producers working with their veterinarians to reduce the impact of H5N1 on dairy cattle, which generally recover with low mortality rates, especially with proper supportive care and particularly during times of excessive heat.\n \nCalifornia producers have access to five programs designed by USDA specifically to respond to this outbreak. USDA has transferred $824 million to fund these programs that help provide financial assistance to farmers to meet the biosecurity standards that are required to protect against continued spread of the disease and compensate farmers for lost milk production if they are impacted.  \n\nFor both affected and unaffected producers USDA is providing support and financial assistance\nfor:', 'For affected producers specifically, USDA will provide financial assistance for: \nMilk loss from eligible cows (under the ELAP program)', 'Producers and other interested parties can learn more about these programs at USDA’s HPAI Detections in Livestock\npage or contact their local Farm Service Agency county office\n. USDA has staff in nearly every county in the country. nearly every county in the country.', ""Human Health\nEven before this outbreak HHS was working with California to prepare for a potential outbreak. HHS’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has fulfilled PPE requests from California since May, 2024. To date, ASPR has sent 65,120 goggles and 2,201,000 gloves from the Strategic National Stockpile. ASPR continues to standby to meet additional needs. \n\nTo support California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in responding to human cases, CDC deployed a multilingual epidemiological field team to assist with the investigation of H5N1 infections in both dairy cows and farm workers who may have been exposed to infected cattle. CDC's efforts include:"", 'Over the summer, CDC announced a $5 million program to increase awareness and testing among farm workers and promote seasonal flu vaccine among farm workers that can help protect against the intermingling of the virus. CDC is collaborating with California to ensure that these resources reach impacted areas. \n\nIn collaboration with California, CDC is also promoting seasonal flu vaccination to protect farm workers, supplementing the state’s supply with additional doses and providing funding for vaccine administration.', 'Animal Health \nWorking closely with Washington State animal health officials, USDA is providing technical support and resources to help on-the-ground response efforts, following established processes for detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry. Depopulation of the flock is complete and surveillance in the area has detected no additional affected poultry flocks. While the epidemiological investigation is ongoing, USDA will continue to work closely with state partners to support disease response. ', 'Human Health\nCDC is deploying a team to Washington to support its response efforts at a commercial egg farm in the state. The agency is awaiting specimens from Washington for confirmatory avian flu testing and will then assess further action.', 'USDA and HHS continue to work swiftly to respond to infections across the country. Below are updates on a few of these efforts:\n\nBovine Vaccine Trials\nUSDA has approved two vaccine field safety trials for vaccine candidates designed to protect dairy cows from H5N1. These safety trials involve non-viable, non-replicating vaccines that do not cause virus shedding or transmission to humans, other animals, or the environment. USDA anticipates additional submissions and approvals for field trials as manufacturers pursue vaccine development.\n\nProtecting the Commercial Milk Supply \nAccording to the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the commercial milk supply remains safe. The pasteurization process effectively kills the H5N1 virus along with other disease-causing germs in milk products. However, the FDA continues to study the risk of H5N1 transmission through the consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk and milk products, and it continues to emphasize the longstanding recommendations\nregarding the consumption of such products.\n\nResearchers across the federal and state governments have been working to understand the prevalence of H5N1 in the U.S. milk supply. On Oct. 3, states were invited to participate in a new study (the “silo study”) that will generate data to aid in the understanding of H5N1 in raw cow’s milk received by dairy processing facilities across the nation. \n\nThis silo study will inform and further enhance collective efforts that state and federal agencies and industry are engaged in to help inform the national strategy to control the spread of the virus, identify any viral transformations, and help ensure safety of the milk supply.  \n\nState participation in the silo study is voluntary, but it is hoped that states will want to contribute to this important project. The FDA, National Conference of Interstate Milk Shipments , external link\n(NCIMS), and USDA will review the results of the silo study and are committed to providing study results in the near future.\n ', 'Receive the latest updates from the Secretary, Blogs, and News Releases', 'Receive latest updates', '', 'For general media inquiries, please contact media@hhs.gov.', 'Receive the latest updates from the Secretary, Blogs, and News Releases.', '200 Independence Avenue, S.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20201\nToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775', '']"
