The country, where Hezbollah effectively operates as a state within a state, has been without a president for two years while political factions fail to agree on a new one.\nBut the international conference comes as critics say French President Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic approach in the Middle East has been blurred by his apparent evolving approach and sometimes chaotic communication.\nStill, France’s historic links with Lebanon, a former colony, and its influential diplomacy give Paris momentum to coordinate “a proper response to the massive challenge that the war in Lebanon now poses,” said Middle East expert Rym Montaz, editor in chief of Carnegie Europe’s blog Strategic Europe.\nThe French “are trying to make sure that international donors get to hear firsthand from the actors on the ground in Lebanon who can best describe the most immediate needs caused by the Israeli aggression that has forcibly displaced 20 percent of the Lebanese population over the course of two weeks,” she said.\nIsrael in the past month has launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as it targets Hezbollah, with strikes hitting the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere.\nThe International Organization for Migration has said about 800,000 people are displaced, with many now in overcrowded shelters, while others have fled across the border into Syria.\nThe cash-strapped Lebanese government is ill-prepared to deal with the crisis or the increased demands on its health system. A number of hospitals have been evacuated because of nearby airstrikes and fears that they might be targeted.\nIn recent weeks, Macron appeared to toughen his stance against Israel while repeatedly calling for a ceasefire in both Lebanon and Gaza, condemning the “unbearable human toll.” He reiterated his call on Monday while speaking by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his office said.\nThere have been recent tensions between the French and Israeli leaders, especially after Macron called for a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza.\nMacron has also strongly condemned the “deliberate” targeting by Israel of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, which Israel has denied.\nThursday’s conference will include ministers and officials from over 70 countries and international organizations, including the European Union and regional partners, Macron’s office said. Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who met with Macron on Wednesday, will attend.\nFrench organizers said they hope the expected financial pledges of humanitarian aid will meet the United Nations’ call for the $426 million it says is urgently needed in Lebanon.\nFrance also aims at coordinating international support to strengthen Lebanon’s armed forces so they can “deploy more broadly and efficiently” in the country’s south as part of a potential deal to end the war. Such a deal could see Hezbollah withdraw its forces from the border.\nInternational support may include equipment, training and financial aid to hire troops and ensure the army’s daily needs, Macron’s office said.\nLebanon’s army has been hit hard by five years of economic crisis. It has an aging arsenal and no air defenses, leaving it in no position to defend against Israeli incursions or confront Hezbollah.\nThe Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The militant group’s arsenal — built with support from Iran — is more advanced.\nConference participants also will discuss how to support the UN peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, possibly giving it a stronger role. France and other European nations provide a third of its troops.\n“What we do know is that without a strengthened Lebanese armed forces and UNIFIL, there can be no sustainable peace and stability at the border between Lebanon and Israel,” Montaz said. “As such, the French efforts are important and crucial for the way forward.”', 'BEIRUT: Inside what was once one of Beirut’s oldest and best-known cinemas, dozens of Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians displaced by the Israel-Hezbollah war spend their time following the news on their phones, cooking, chatting and walking around to pass the time.\nOutside on Hamra Street, once a thriving economic hub, sidewalks are filled with displaced people, and hotels and apartments are crammed with those seeking shelter. Cafes and restaurants are overflowing.\nIn some ways, the massive displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs has provided a boost for this commercial district after years of decline as a result of Lebanon’s economic crisis.\nBut it is not the revival many had hoped for.\n“The displacement revived Hamra Street in a wrong way,” said the manager of a four-star hotel on the boulevard, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the problems the influx has caused for the neighborhood.\nFor three weeks after the war intensified in mid-September, his hotel enjoyed full occupancy. Today, it stands at about 65 percent capacity — still good for this time of year — after some left for cheaper rented apartments.\nBut, he said, the flow of displaced people has also brought chaos. Traffic congestion, double parking and motorcycles and scooters scattered on sidewalks has become the norm, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. Tensions regularly erupt between displaced people and the district’s residents, he said.\nHamra Street has long been a bellwether for Lebanon’s turbulent politics. During the country’s heyday in the 1960s and early 1970s, it represented everything that was glamorous, filled with Lebanon’s top movie houses and theaters, cafes frequented by intellectuals and artists, and ritzy shops.\nOver the past decades, the street has witnessed rises and falls depending on the situation in the small Mediterranean nation that has been marred by repeated bouts of instability, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. In 1982, Israeli tanks rolled down Hamra Street after Israel invaded the country, reaching all the way to west Beirut.\nIn recent years, the district was transformed by an influx of Syrian refugees fleeing the war in the neighboring nation, and businesses were hammered by the country’s financial collapse, which began in 2019.\nIsrael dramatically escalated its attacks on parts of Lebanon on Sept. 23, killing nearly 500 people and wounding 1,600 in one day after nearly a year of skirmishes along the Lebanon-Israel border between Israeli troops and the militant Hezbollah group. The intensified attacks sparked an exodus of people fleeing the bombardment, including many who slept in public squares, on beaches or pavements around Beirut.\nMore than 2,574 people have been killed in Lebanon and over 12,000 wounded in the past year of war, according to the country’s Health Ministry, and around 1.2 million people are displaced.\nMany have flooded Hamra, a cosmopolitan and diverse area, with some moving in with relatives or friends and others headed to hotels and schools turned into shelters. In recent days several empty buildings were stormed by displaced people, who were forced to leave by security forces after confrontations that sometimes turned violent.\nMohamad Rayes, a member of the Hamra Traders Association, said before the influx of displaced people, some businesses were planning to close because of financial difficulties.\n“It is something that cannot be imagined,” Rayes said about the flow of displaced people boosting commerce in Hamra in ways unseen in years. He said some traders even doubled prices because of high demand.\nAt a cellular shop, Farouk Fahmy said during the first two weeks his sales increased 70 percent, with people who fled their homes mostly buying chargers and Internet data to follow the news.\n“The market is stagnant again now,” Fahmy said.\nSince many fled their homes with few belongings, men’s and women’s underwear and pajama sales grew by 300 percent at the small boutique business owned by Hani, who declined to give his full name for safety reasons.\nThe 60-year-old movie theater, Le Colizee, a landmark on Hamra Street, had been closed for more than two decades until earlier this year when Lebanese actor Kassem Istanbouli, founder of the Lebanese National Theater, took over and began renovating it. With the massive tide of displacement, he transformed it into a shelter for families who fled their homes in south Lebanon.\nIstanbouli, who has theaters in the southern port city of Tyre and the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest, has turned all three into shelters where people, no matter their nationality, can take refuge.\nThis week, displaced people in the Beirut movie theater sat on thin mattresses on its red carpeting, checking their phones and reading. Some were helping with the theater’s renovation work.\nAmong them was Abdul-Rahman Mansour, a Syrian citizen, along with his three brothers and their Palestinian-Lebanese mother, Joumana Hanafi. Mansour said they fled Tyre after a rocket attack near their home, taking shelter at a school in the coastal city of Sidon, where they were allowed to stay since their mother is a Lebanese citizen.\nWhen the shelter’s management found out that Mansour and his brothers were Syrian they had to leave because only Lebanese citizens were allowed. With no place to stay, they returned to Tyre.\n“We slept for a night in Tyre, but I hope you never witness such a night,” Hanafi said of the intensity of the bombardment.\nShe said one of her sons knew Istanbouli and contacted him. “We told him, ‘Before anything, we are Syrians.’ He said, ‘It is a shame that you have to say that.’”\nIstanbouli spends hours a day at his theaters in Beirut and Tripoli to be close to the displaced people sheltering there.\n“Normally people used to come here to watch a movie. Today we are all at the theater and the movie is being played outside,” Istanbouli said of the ongoing war.', 'Israeli strikes on the Syrian capital Damascus and a military site near the western city of Homs early on Thursday killed one soldier and injured seven, the Syrian defense ministry said.\nThe attacks targeted the central Damascus neighborhood of Kafr Sousa and a military site in the Homs countryside, the ministry said in a statement, adding the strikes caused “material damage” without elaborating.\nEarlier in the day, Syrian state media said explosions were heard in Damascus after Israel struck a residential building in Kafr Sousa.\nIsrael typically does not comment on specific reports of strikes in Syria.\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes against Iranian-linked targets in Syria for years, but it has ramped up raids since last year’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas.', 'WASHINGTON: US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told his Israeli counterpart on Wednesday that Washington had concerns about strikes against the Lebanese armed forces while urging Israel to take steps to ensure the safety of the Lebanese army and the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, the Pentagon said.\nAustin also told Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that Washington welcomed the movement of humanitarian assistance through the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and urged Israel take steps to address the dire situation there, the Pentagon’s summary of the call said.\nThree Lebanese soldiers were killed in an Israeli strike on an army vehicle in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese military said on Sunday. Israel, which says it is targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants, apologized and said its military was not operating against the Lebanese army.\nThe UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon also says its troops have come under Israeli attack several times. Israel has disputed accounts of those incidents.\nAustin “expressed his deep concern about the reports of strikes against the Lebanese Armed Forces,” the Pentagon said, adding he urged Israel “to ensure the safety and security of the Lebanese Armed Forces and UNIFIL forces.”\nWashington wrote a letter to Israeli officials last week demanding concrete measures to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, or face potential restrictions on US military aid.\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza and caused a hunger crisis.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

The escalation follows a pattern of tribal and retaliatory violence, sparked just three days after the commander of the Rapid Support Forces in Gezira defected to the Sudanese military.', 'Factions loyal to RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo responded to Abu Agla Keikel’s defection with ethnically motivated attacks on villages and areas in eastern Gezira, where Keikel is from. While clashes are ongoing, the RSF claimed in a Tuesday Telegram statement that they recaptured Tambul after the Sudanese military had taken it earlier in the day.', 'On the political front, tensions between Sudan and the United Arab Emirates resurfaced with a new twist, after Sudan’s ambassador to Abu Dhabi defied a summons from the Sudanese Foreign Ministry to return to Port Sudan. The ministry responded by reassigning his duties to the acting ambassador and dismissing him, according to a Foreign Ministry source who spoke to Mada Masr. A source at the Sudanese embassy in the UAE said that Ambassador Abdel Rahman Sharafi had given no explanation for his refusal to comply, noting instead that he was focused on manufacturing closer relations with Abu Dhabi under the pretense of strengthening ties between the two nations.', '***', 'RSF retaliatory campaigns in eastern Gezira following Keikel’s defection', 'The fighting in Gezira State has escalated to the brink of civil conflict just three days after RSF commander in the state Abu Agla Keikel defected to the military. Other factions loyal to RSF leader Hemedti launched retaliatory attacks on areas in eastern Gezira, Keikal’s home region.', 'Tambul in eastern Gezira has seen control alternate between the military and the RSF amid intense fighting. The chief of the Shukriya tribes in Kassala and Gadarif states, Ahmed Mohamed Hamad Abu Sen, called on his followers to immediately mobilize and support their kin in eastern Gezira. He urged them to stand with the Sudanese Armed Forces “to repel the brutal aggression and defend our people in Refaa and Tambul.”', 'Youssef Abu Sen, a fighter in the ranks the military forces stationed near Tambul, told Mada Masr that the military, alongside Keikel’s Sudan Shield Forces and mobilized fighters from the Butana plain garrison, defeated the RSF in a battle that lasted from 6 pm Monday to 5:30 am Tuesday. ', 'With the support of air and artillery units, the military and its allied forces entered and secured Tambul’s market and destroyed RSF strongholds in the market and in eastern and southern areas.', 'According to Abu Sen, the RSF had prepared for the battle by amassing 82 combat vehicles from Bashagra, Khartoum’s East Nile and Madina Arab, all of which were destroyed in battle. Pursuit operations are ongoing as remnants of the RSF retreat toward the Edd al-Khedr barricades, 7 km south of Tambul.', 'However, on Tuesday, the RSF gained the upper hand over the course of the day. ', 'A military source told Mada Masr that Brigadier General Ahmed Shaeddin al-Mansour, the military commander of the Rawa camp in the Butana area, was killed in fighting in Tambul that lasted for hours on Tuesday, adding that the RSF surrounded the military forces, forcing them to disperse and subsequently withdraw from the city with the Popular Support Forces. The source also confirmed that Keikal’s forces fought alongside the military ranks in this battle for the first time after their defection.', 'A local source confirmed to Mada Masr that the popular support forces withdrew outside Tambul after a larger RSF deployment arrived from east of the Nile in Khartoum and Gezira. In fear of revenge campaigns carried out by the RSF, which have already begun looting shops and homes in the city, thousands of its residents fled. ', 'RSF spokesperson Al-Fateh Qarashi released a statement saying that their forces were able to inflict a severe defeat on the military, killing as many as 370 soldiers, including the commander of the force with the rank of brigadier general. The statement claimed that the RSF seized more than 60 combat vehicles with full equipment and destroyed large numbers of others, in addition to seizing various weapons and quantities of ammunition.', 'While the battle played out in Tambul, the RSF has been conducting what several sources described to Mada Masr as a “retaliatory campaign” in response to Keikal’s defection.', 'A military source, a market trader and a local resident told Mada Masr that RSF forces raided villages in eastern Gezira, leaving dozens killed or wounded. Refaa’s resistance committees also reported the attacks. ', 'The military source told Mada Masr that since Sunday evening , RSF forces have been targeting towns and villages in eastern Gezira, including Gneid al-Hilla, Aziba, Aak and Baidaa, where over ten civilians were killed, including the director of a kidney dialysis center.', 'In Dindar in Sennar State, another RSF faction also surrendered to the military. The city is now under military siege. Singa, the capital of Sennar, is also under siege, while the military continues its advance toward Wad Madani, the capital of Gezira State.', 'Further weakening the RSF after Keikel’s defection, part of the forces previously commanded by Abdel Rahman al-Bishi, the RSF commander in Sennar State and the Blue Nile region who was killed in an airstrike by the military in July, also surrendered, according to a field source in Sennar who spoke to Mada Masr. ', 'The source added that Bishi’s forces now split into three groups. The first is led by Bishi’s cousins, the second joined Keikel’s forces, while the third fell under the command of local field leaders who control certain areas in Gezira.', 'The source said that more than eight villages in eastern Gezira have been subjected to violations in attacks carried out by some RSF forces from the third group. ', 'A local source in Tambul added that a group of these forces, led by RSF commander Ahmed Adam “Gogga,” besieged and attacked the city.', 'Sudanese Ambassador in UAE defies Sudanese Foreign Ministry summons', 'A source from the Sudanese Foreign Ministry told Mada Masr that the Sudanese ambassador to the UAE Abdel Rahman Sharafi ignored a summons issued by the ministry on October 15. The letter, sent by the ministry’s undersecretary, called for Sharafi to return to Port Sudan. The ambassador did not respond, prompting the undersecretary to issue a follow-up letter on October 19, warning that the ambassador’s allocations would be withheld at the prime minister’s office unless he complied. ', '', 'Sharafi served in several Sudanese embassies, including in Venezuela, from which he was transferred to Canada. According to the source, he caused a scandal within the Sudanese Foreign Ministry when he left Caracas for Canada without notice. He was reinstated during the transitional period after being dismissed under the ousted regime.', 'A diplomatic source speaking to Mada Masr criticized Sharafi’s behavior, saying that it is not reflective of the ethics of professional diplomacy, noting that he could have followed a set of established professional procedures. ', 'According to another diplomatic source, this marks the second such defiance from a Sudanese ambassador in the UAE , following Mohamed al-Kareb, who, in October 2021, following the coup against Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s government, refused to comply with the foreign ministry’s orders. Kareb also declined to return to Khartoum or respond to the ministry’s summons.', 'The source added that the ministry plans to assign an acting ambassador to the UAE and dismiss Sharafi for violating administrative regulations. ', 'Mada Masr contacted Sharafi for comment, but, as of the time of writing, he did not respond. ', 'A source at the Sudanese embassy told Mada Masr that Sharafi provided no justification for his refusal to comply with the ministry’s orders. The source said that Sharafi’s stance stems from his disagreement with the Foreign Ministry’s escalatory measures against the UAE, adding that he is leading an attempt at manufacturing a popular rapprochement between Sudanese citizens in the UAE and the Emirati government.', 'You have a right to access accurate information, be stimulated by innovative and nuanced reporting, and be moved by compelling storytelling.\n\nSubscribe now to become part of the growing community of members who help us maintain our editorial independence.\nKnow more']"
