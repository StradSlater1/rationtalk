Take Samsung for example; despite releasing the OneUI 6 (based on Android 14) to the then-flagship Galaxy S23 range just weeks after Google did last year, this year’s OneUI 7 update has been delayed into 2025, likely alongside the reveal of the rumoured Galaxy S25 collection.', 'Samsung isn’t alone in this struggle either; big-name Android brands like Honor didn’t roll out the Android 14 update to its 2023 flagship Honor Magic 5 Pro until April 2024, six months after the software made its debut. ', 'It certainly makes the idea of OEMs promising multi-year OS upgrades feel hollow when you may not receive the update for many months after its release. ', 'OnePlus was in a similar position with the OxygenOS 14 update based on Android 14; the OnePlus 11 received the update in December 2023, but the top-end OnePlus Open didn’t get the update until May 2024, four months after the release of the OxygenOS 14-powered OnePlus 12.', 'It looks like OnePlus is looking to rectify things this year with a nice and timely rollout of its OxygenOS 15 update based on Android 15, however. Despite the latest Pixel range only getting the big Android 15 update earlier this week, OnePlus has confirmed that OxygenOS 15 will make its debut next week, Thursday 24 October 2024.', 'It’ll coincide with a livestream set to kick off at 3:30pm BST that I expect will outline the new features and functionality of the software, as the company has been pretty coy about what to expect so far.', 'Teasing that the update will offer a “perfect combination of speed, performance, and intelligence”, OxygenOS 15 is said to bring new AI features focused on productivity and creativity, as well as a generally faster and smoother experience courtesy of updated algorithms and animations. The software should also bring a refreshed design, though details of what’s new are yet to be revealed. ', 'The most important piece of information yet to be revealed, however, is the list of devices that’ll get the update next Thursday. ', 'It’s almost a given that we’ll see it on this year’s top-end OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R first, but I’m hoping that it’ll accompanied by other 2024 releases like the OnePlus Nord 4 and maybe even the OnePlus Pad 2 – though a tablet-optimised version may take a little longer to roll out. There are many magnitudes more OnePlus phones than OnePlus tablets in the wild, after all. ', 'What I’m more curious about is the rollout to slightly older devices like the OnePlus 11 and the top-end foldable, the OnePlus Open. ', 'If OnePlus manages to roll out the update widely on Thursday, it’ll be setting a new benchmark for Android OEMs rolling out major Android updates, one that’s only really matched by Google and Apple – and they are the companies behind Android and iOS respectively. ', 'The fact that OnePlus is even in the same conversation is a credit to OnePlus’ commitment to its fanbase. Let’s just hope that the OxygenOS 15 update is as exciting as OnePlus is making it out to be – though, thankfully, we don’t have very long to wait to find out.

OxygenOS 15 hands-on: Watch out Samsung and Google — OnePlus just caught up,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/oneplus-phones/oxygenos-15-hands-on-watch-out-samsung-and-google-oneplus-just-caught-up,"['All the new features coming to OnePlus phones', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""OnePlus knows how to make some of the best Android phones around, but its software has historically lagged behind Samsung, Google and Apple. That's been even more the case since these companies began to embrace the AI feature trend, with OnePlus deliberately avoiding major discussions of AI features. But things may be about to change."", ""OxygenOS 15, the OnePlus-flavored skin of Android 15, is entering open beta from October 30th, but I've been lucky enough to try it out on a OnePlus 12 early. And it looks like OnePlus has more than caught up with the competition."", ""A fully-fledged suite of AI features has been added to the incoming software update, but there are more upgrades and improvements besides that. So even if generative writing and image editing tools aren't your thing, you'll likely find something to enjoy in the changes OnePlus has made to its interface, animations or even just the software's overall size."", ""The OnePlus 13, the company's next flagship phone, isn't expected to arrive outside of China until the start of 2025, and it'll probably be another few months after that before we'll see another budget Nord handset. But with this update on the way, perhaps existing OnePlus owners will be happy to keep their current phone going, knowing that they're not being left behind."", ""Even before you make your first tap in the revamped OxygenOS 15 interface, it's given you a benefit. Thanks to optimization efforts and the removal of unnecessary files (such as default wallpapers you're not using), OnePlus has removed 5GB, or about 20%, from the storage footprint of OxygenOS 14, giving the user that space back for storing things they need and care about."", 'When you do finally wake up the phone, you\'ll first want to check out the new lock screen options, described as ""Flux themes"". These are designed to have beautifully smooth transitions from always-on-display to lock screen to home screen, and while it doesn\'t make a huge practical difference, it is nice to see the animations move smoothly between one another as you open up your phone.', '', 'Smooth animations is one of OnePlus\' main talking points this year, especially when it comes to opening, closing and switching between apps. OxygenOS 15 features a new ""Parallel Processing"" graphics system, which allows apps opening and closing (and their associated animations) to overlap. It\'s a solution to a very minor complaint (jittery animations when swapping rapidly between apps) but it certainly works as a party piece for OnePlus.', 'Here at Tom’s Guide our expert editors are committed to bringing you the best news, reviews and guides to help you stay informed and ahead of the curve!', ""If you're familiar with the OnePlus Open and OnePlus Pad 2, you will be happy to hear that their Open Canvas multi-tasking system has finally arrived on OxygenOS 15-compatible smartphones. You can only open two apps at a time, rather than the Open or Pad 2's three, but you still get the all-important ability to expand and shrink both apps as you see fit, and tap between them to multitask without compromising on in-app space. It's much better for immediate work or copy/pasting across apps than any other system I've tried, and I'm delighted to find it on a smaller, more accessible device."", '', 'As seems to be the trend among Android skins these days, OxygenOS 15 now offers an iOS-style split between the notifications shade and quick settings, which you access by swiping down from the top of the phone on the left side or the right. I never had a problem with the traditional Android all-in-one style, and that is still offered for those who prefer it. But it is weird how this is an interface style OnePlus and other brands are now all adopting, seven years after the iPhone X first introduced it.', '', ""Another iPhone-esque feature is the new Live Alert pop-ups for ongoing activities, like playing music or running a timer. It lives around the central punch-hole camera on the OnePlus 12, like a smaller version of the Dynamic Island it's aping. I do like this change, as it gives you immediate access to an ongoing task no matter where else you go on the phone. And if it's annoying you, you can swipe on the bubble to dismiss it."", 'Also on the topic of iPhones, OnePlus is trying to bridge the gap with its rival through the upcoming Share with iPhone feature. By downloading a to-be-release ""O+ Connect"" app, you\'ll be able to send your files to your friends with iPhones as easily as you can to those with Android phones.', ""I didn't get to try this one, but if it works as OnePlus says, then it's going to be a big moment for iPhone-Android relations, making it far simpler to send things to one another directly rather than through a messaging app or Google Drive."", '', ""OnePlus still isn't devoting its phone to AI in the same way that other brands have, but its new software adds a lot of the basic AI-driven services we have seen from other recent smartphones, plus some unique ones to let OnePlus flex its software talents."", ""On the photography side, the OnePlus Photos app now contains Image Unblur and Reflection Eraser tools for fixing up common problems with images. But another addition is Detail Boost, which is there to sharpen a cropped-in image with generative AI. It doesn't seem great if your image has text in it (see the street sign in my sample) but for larger, simpler elements, it does add back some of the definition lost in the crop."", '', 'For your productivity needs, you can now summarize writing, read it out or get some help with editing it with the AI Summary, AI Speak and AI Writer tools. These are available anywhere in OxygenOS 15 by swiping in from the side of the screen to access the relevant toolbar. The AI Writer tools can reformat your text, change its tone or just check your spelling and grammar, but there are also generative writing options to try too. This can either write something entirely new for you, such as a reply to a message, or be used to add to existing text, say if you need a few more words to round out a briefing.', '', ""If you save a lot of documents to your phone, then the new Intelligent Search for local files will work especially well for you. The home screen search menu will be able to look through the text of indexed files to help you find answers you're looking for without opening them. And for questions that have answers beyond the scope of your phone's storage, Circle to Search is available too, if you were jealous of Samsung and Google keeping it to themselves for the past 10 months."", 'One last feature before we round things up — the all-important new software easter egg. If you type 1+= in the Calculator app, you get a special animation displaying the company motto.', '', ""I'm glad that I didn't have to mention this little addition until the end, since OnePlus has made plenty of meaningful changes to OxygenOS to make it a more futureproof Android skin. I still want to see this running on a OnePlus 13 before I make up my mind in full, but I like what I'm seeing so far."", ""Samsung has yet to fully reveal its new Android 15 skin, One UI 7, and Google's no doubt cooking up some new features for future Pixel Feature Drops, so OnePlus' new software may start looking outdated faster than it might like. But right now we've got a proper three-horse race on our hands when it comes to Android phones, which must give OnePlus' faithful Never Settlers some comfort that they've bet on the right brand."", ""Richard is based in London, covering news, reviews and how-tos for phones, tablets, gaming, and whatever else people need advice on.

What OnePlus does differently with Open Canvas is that it lets you maintain an almost-full-screen window size on your primary app while keeping the second app also active for easy switching.

While last year's upgrade was built around a healthy amount of buzzwords, this year keeps things a whole lot simpler to understand.

After launching the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R last year — two phones that were largely lauded for providing excellent core experienceswithout being bogged down by too many AI tools — the company is going all in. OnePlus AI is the new name for the brand's toolset, and although many of these software features have been seen elsewhere, it'll be interesting to see if a new spin on some old ideas can deliver a breath of fresh air to OxygenOS."", ""These tools include AI Detail Boost, which sounds quite a bit similar to the Pixel 9 Pro's Zoom Enhance, allowing for auto-upscaling images; AI Reflection Eraser, for deleting reflections out windows and other mirrored surfaces; and AI Unblur, which — stop us if you've heard this one — unblurs an image.

On OxygenOS, square is still the default shape of the icons with no default circular option like on ColorOS.', 'The notifications and quick settings page has also received some attention. For one, you can now have the two split into two separate pages, much like on iOS and some of the other Android brands. However, that is merely an option and you can continue to have the two on the same page as before, which is nice for those who don’t like major changes forced on to them.', 'Notifications and quick settings', 'The design of the toggles has changed with more circular shapes for the sliders. However, you can change their shape in the settings to make them back to the way they were in OxygenOS 14.', 'Homescreen customization', 'For those asking for more home and lockscreen customization, OxygenOS 15 offers a lot more options. Starting with the homescreen, you can apply a style filter to the wallpaper, which produces a Nothing OS-like refracted glass effect, except with a lot more options. You can also add a blur filter to your wallpaper. The number of default wallpapers has been increased greatly over previous versions of OxygenOS and some of the live wallpapers are now in HDR.', 'Lockscreen and always-on display customization', 'For the lockscreen, you have the same options for the wallpaper as the homescreen. Additionally, you can customize the clock that you see with a very iOS-style menu, complete with clock fonts, sizes, and colors. Also like iOS, the lockscreen can recognize objects, animals, and people in the frame and apply a depth filter so that the object in the frame can overlap the lockscreen elements. Finally, you can also customize the always-on display screen by picking the one that came with your theme or one of the default options.', 'Aside from these major changes, there are also several minor ones peppered throughout. OnePlus has altered the weight of the default fonts, especially One Sans, which is now bolder in many places. By the way, we have chosen to use One Sans in these screenshots as it just looks nicer but the default font is still Roboto.', 'New font rendering and advanced visual effects', 'There is an advanced visual effects option in the settings, which claims to apply blur effects to the background of notifications, quick settings, and home screen folders. However, on the OnePlus 12 running the beta, this option just seemed permanently on and switching it off did nothing. This seems like an option more suitable to more budget devices where it may be set to off by default to save on performance but then you can optionally enable it to turn on some eye candy. Xiaomi has had a similar option on some of its phones.', 'Live Alerts', 'The Smart suggestions feature, which previously showed real-time notifications for supported cab hailing and food delivery apps has been altered so now instead of showing a standard Android notification, it turns the area around the front camera into a fake iOS-style dynamic island. You can tap that area to open the notification in the app or in a floating card. The feature has been renamed to Live Alerts and now also supports things like music playback, timers, hotspot, screen recording, and more.', 'Charging and fingerprint animation', 'There is now a new charging animation that plays when you plug the phone in. The animation varies based on what charger you use and is more vibrant for faster chargers. There is also a new animation for the fingerprint unlock called Halo, which looks a bit similar to the charging animation.', 'Unchanged app design', 'Getting back to the first party apps, one of the disappointing things about this update is that almost all of them look exactly the same as they did before. There are a few differences, such as the Calculator app gaining a number system converter, the Camera app getting a few items rearranged in the settings, and the Photos app gaining some AI features (more on that later) but aside from that they are unchanged.', 'Settings app', 'The only exception to this is the Settings app, which features new iconography, rounded corners on some elements, and certain menus being rearranged. The Settings app also shows off the new color theme called Two-tone, which gets rid of most of the colors and makes the entire app essentially monochrome.', 'OnePlus has overhauled the way animations are handled in OxygenOS 15. The previous version had animations for things like app launches, multi-tasking, etc. being handled serially, wherein the entire animation was intended to play out before the next would begin in a serial order. If the user were to interrupt such animation, it had to be abruptly ended before a second animation could be triggered. This resulted in a visual stutter as well as a minor delay before the next action could be performed.', 'With OxygenOS 15, OnePlus is introducing parallel processing, which it claims is an industry-first for this scenario. The animations can now be run parallel to each other, which means a user could trigger a second animation while the first is still being performed and the OS would transition gracefully as it no longer has to end one before starting the next as they can run parallel to each other. This results in less visible animation stutters and a more responsive interface. OnePlus has also altered many of the animations so they play out a bit differently than before.', 'In side by side comparisons, it was difficult to notice the improvement OnePlus was promising with this update. The change in some of the animations also made it difficult to ascertain if the changes were due to the parallel processing or simply a different animation. While there’s no denying that the underlying technology is superior, it doesn’t manifest itself in a way most users would readily notice. Rather, this seems like something that you may pick up on subconsciously over time, especially if you use OxygenOS 15 for a while and then switch back to 14.', 'The way OnePlus demonstrated this technology to us was also telling of the fact that it wasn’t something you’d notice in just everyday use. The company showed side by side videos of a OnePlus 12 running OxygenOS 14 and OxygenOS 15 and the user opening multiple apps in slow motion. It reminded us of those pointless videos on YouTube, where people open apps rapidly on two phones side by side as if it proves something. In reality, those videos have always been useless because no one uses their phones this way and it’s a bit unfortunate that OnePlus had to resort to that to show their phones are superior to the competition.', 'But as nuanced as this aspect of the OxygenOS 15 is, it is commendable that OnePlus is choosing to invest time and resources in it anyway. If anything, it shows a commitment to chasing the last mile when it comes to optimizing the performance of the UI and animations to attain the smoothest possible experience, even if it may not be immediately obvious in everyday usage.', 'While previous versions of OxygenOS included some AI features, the company has expanded that to a much broader portfolio that covers a lot more functions of the device.', 'AI Editor', 'Starting with the Photos app, many of the previous AI features have been upgraded and collated in a separate AI Editor option. Here, you have four options, AI Detail Boost, AI Eraser, AI Unblur, and AI Reflection Eraser.', 'AI Detail Boost: Original vs Edited', 'The AI Detail Boost is a cloud-based option that sends your low resolution images to the server and produces a sharper, more detailed image. In practice, it did look reasonably sharper with slightly better detail, more than you’d get with a simple sharpening filter. There is some garbling of texture that makes it clear it was AI enhanced but it’s only noticeable if you look closely. Overall, this feature is decent for those aggressively cropped or digitally zoomed in shots.', 'AI Eraser: Original vs Edited', 'The AI Eraser was hit and miss. The Smart Lasso feature rarely produced good results as the images often had obvious remnants of the things that were erased. Even when it did erase the object completely, the way it would fill in the blanks left noticeable blurred patches. The option to remove people would also fail to detect human subjects unless they were standing upright. However, this option did work better than Smart lasso or the Paint over options, with some decent results at times. The AI Eraser processing is done locally, and is perhaps the reason why it’s not especially good.', 'AI Unblur: Original vs Edited', 'Next is AI Unblur, which like Detail Boost also sends your images to the cloud. This option is designed to remove the motion blur for when the camera moves and creates a mess. Based on how bad the blur is, this mode produced some surprisingly usable results. It is important to note however that it is optimized to work on images where the blur is caused by the camera moving, not the subject, so you won’t get good results with the latter.', 'Finally, there is the AI Reflection Eraser. This was always going to be a tricky one and in the images we tried, it really did not work well at all. This option is also cloud-based.', 'Moving away from the Photos app, there’s also a new Intelligent Search feature, which uses on-device as well as the cloud to find information from across the apps on your device. You need to enter just your usual natural language query and the feature will help you find files that contain your query, even if it is phrased a bit differently. It can also provide you a summary for that query along with the files containing the answer. However, during our testing, this feature was not available.', 'Other AI features include Pass Scan (on-device), which scans your boarding passes through the camera or photo album and adds them to your Google Wallet. AI Notes (cloud) can format, clean-up, or polish your notes in the OnePlus Notes app. You can also use elaborate or shorten to increase or reduce the verbosity of the text, or change the writing style to casual or formal. AI Reply (cloud) can be used in messaging apps. It looks at the conversation you are having and generates various replies in different tones. And finally, there are some features based on Google services, such as Circle to Search and Gemini, the latter of which is now the default voice assistant on the phone.', 'Aside from the previous tentpole features, OxygenOS 15 also has a fair number of other assorted new features that are worth discussing.', 'For starters, OnePlus claims to have reduced the size of the operating system but it comes with a catch. OnePlus claims that OxygenOS 15 on the company’s next flagship (let’s just call it the OnePlus 13 for now) will be 20% smaller than OxygenOS 14 on the OnePlus 12. The catch is that this applies only to this and other upcoming devices, as there are no savings to be had for current devices. As a matter of fact, OxygenOS 15 took up an additional 4-5GB on our OnePlus 12 after installation. That’s not much but to go from “you’re not getting any size savings on your current device” to “actually we are going to take up even more space” isn’t very nice.', 'Open Canvas multitasking', 'Next, OnePlus has brought over its Open Canvas feature from the OnePlus Open to candybar devices. You now have more freedom in how you split two apps on screen, and a new Shrink feature will collapse one of the apps to a small portion so you can focus on the other. As before, you can easily drag and drop content between the two open apps, as long as they are compatible. This makes split screen much more usable on candybar devices such as the OnePlus 12 as you can have two apps on screen but also have a decent experience in each without splitting both into unusable sizes.', 'Send to iPhone', 'OnePlus has also added a new Share with iPhone option, where OnePlus devices running OxygenOS 15 will be able to send files to an iOS device. You will need to install the O+Connect app on the iPhone or iPad and you will be good to go. For whatever reason, however, the option does now show up if you use the search function in the Settings app, and you have to go find it in the Connections & sharing menu.', 'There are also some new security features on top of what Android 15 already brings. A new theft protection system uses information from gyroscopes to detect sudden device acceleration to lock itself from thieves. The device is also locked if the phone remains offline or the SIM is removed. The phone will then require biometric unlock so even if someone manages to nab your passcode, the phone will require a fingerprint to be unlocked.', 'Phone Manager app', 'Saving the worst for the last is the new Phone Manager app. It lets you clean the storage on your device, checks your payment apps, and scans for viruses. We have seen apps like these over the years on other Chinese phones and it’s the sort of thing OnePlus has always avoided in the past. These apps, at best, are borderline useless and at worst, create paranoia among the users about non-existent threats of viruses or having to neurotically clean your device’s storage and memory. Old OnePlus would have never had an app like this but if you needed any more proof that the old OnePlus is gone, just take a look at this app.', 'As an aside, we also ran some benchmark passes on the latest OxygenOS 14 and our OxygenOS 15 beta build and saw no notable improvement or regression in performance.', 'OxygenOS 15 brings some notable visual changes to the platform. It’s fresher and sleeker than before and while not all of the performance improvements are impactful in everyday use, it’s nice to have them anyway. The AI features are an acquired taste and range from actually useful to gimmicky to borderline tacky (please don’t send your friends AI generated replies). But the new Open Canvas multitasking mode is nice, as are the new security features and the Send to iPhone option.', ""But it's not all peaches and cream. There is a distinct lack of originality here, with an overwhelming number of UI elements and features borrowed heavily from iOS. The quick settings screen looks like iOS, the new lockscreen customization looks like iOS, and even the Live Alerts feature looks like the iPhone’s Dynamic Island. To see OxygenOS go from a cooler version of stock Android to a bootleg iOS has been a sobering experience."", 'Also, while we have been referring to it as OxygenOS, it is functionally identical to ColorOS in everything but the name. There are no exclusive features here nor any sort of unique identity. What exactly is ‘OnePlus’ about this, we are not sure. At this point, they may as well change the name so we can all stop pretending this imposter has anything in common with the original vision for OxygenOS.', 'If you are new to OnePlus, you probably don’t care about any of that. All you need to know is that the new update is decent and should make your phone look and feel a bit better once it starts rolling out later this year.', 'For Oneplus 12 it will be like january 2025 or later. Oneplus dont even has closed beta yet. So they need testing right now', 'Wrong. The most customizable of them all is Xiaomi operating system.

More info.', 'OnePlus is announcing its first Android 15 update today as a beta of OxygenOS 15. The new OS version is available first to the OnePlus 12 and should expand over the coming months.', 'For this Android 15 and OxygenOS 15 release, OnePlus is focusing on a few key areas that might sound familiar if you know the story of OnePlus and software. For one, they really want you to know how much work they put in to making this even faster and smoother, plus they’ve reduced a lot of the size/bloat of OxygenOS (for future devices), updated some UI design elements, and there is a bunch of AI going on, because of course there is.', 'OnePlus devices have always been some of the smoothest to use, yet OnePlus spent what appears to be a ridiculous amount of effort trying to make things even faster and smoother for Android 15. I’m not kidding here. I sat through a briefing on the new OxygenOS 15 and they ran a demo for something like 15 minutes on how smooth icon opening and closing can be. Just opening and closing. Opening. Closing. Over and over and over again. If they were trying to get the point across, they certainly did.', 'OnePlus has deployed something called Parallel Processing for this to happen and the explanation for how it works is probably far too technical for this blog. All you need to know is that your OnePlus phone should never slow and always look beautifully smooth no matter the load. So yeah – faster and smoother.', 'This won’t affect any of you at the moment, unless you end up buying the OnePlus 13 in the coming months, but OxygenOS 15 reduces the system storage by 20% compared to OxygenOS 14. That could be 5GB of extra space for you to use.', 'Again, this reclaimed storage space won’t magically appear when Android 15 lands on your OnePlus 12, but going forward, new phones should give you the additional space.', 'As a part of this update to Android 15, OnePlus is touching on a number of UI elements to make the experience at least feel somewhat new even if this isn’t a massive redesign. They’ve enhanced charging and unlocking effects, refined the Gaussian blur when in and out of the notification area, redesigned icons, and tweaked the quick settings area to make brightness and volume controls more prominent.', 'They are bringing over their Open Canvas idea from the OnePlus Open too. This is a multi-tasking feature that lets you run multiple apps at the same time, with quick swipes up or down to expand an app to an almost-full view. It’s a nifty idea that lets you run two apps at once without feeling cramped into square boxes.', 'Look, we don’t really hype AI that much around here because everyone is just repackaging the same AI tools over and over and most of them aren’t really that useful. Either that or they create a world that is not real and that’s not something we should all care that much about. Fake AI imagery and edited photos are bad. I’ve just got to say it.', 'Anyways, for OxygenOS 15 OnePlus is doing the following:', 'And finally, as a part of OxygenOS 15, OnePlus is hoping that you’ll convince your iPhone friends to install their new O+Connect app, so that you can easily share files between your OnePlus phone and their iPhone. Good luck with that, but it is a thing.', 'OxygenOS 15 will go into open beta on October 30.', '', '']"

The new operating system (OS) update for eligible OnePlus smartphones will introduce a redesigned user interface, artificial intelligence (AI) features, and faster processing. Based on Android 15, which was recently released by Google, the update also brings new security features such as Google Play Protect's live threat detection and theft protection features. Additionally, OxygenOS 15 will set Gemini AI assistant as the default virtual assistant on compatible devices."", 'The company claims that OxygenOS 15 was designed with a focus on fast performance, enhanced design, and AI capabilities. To improve processing times, OnePlus says it refined animation interactions via proprietary parallel processing technology. ', ""According to OnePlus, the new update adds comprehensive 'interruption animations' that are said to enable faster transitions between apps. The company claims it eliminates lag times even during heavy usage and maintains a stable experience."", 'Another way the company is speeding up the OS is by removing redundant features and increasing the storage space. OnePlus claims that the OxygenOS 15 will take up 20 percent less storage space on the OnePlus 12 compared to OxygenOS 14.', 'OnePlus has also introduced several new AI features with the OS update. For the camera, the company has added AI Detail Boost, a feature which transforms low-resolution or cropped images into 4K resolution photos. This feature is integrated into the gallery app and automatically identifies pixelated images.', ""Similarly, the company's AI Unblur feature improves blurry images natively and makes the photos sharper. Additionally, AI Reflection Eraser will help users remove reflections from images which are shot through glass."", ""While these features are powered by the company's in-house AI models, OnePlus is also adding several Gemini-powered features. The first of these is Circle to Search, which will now be available to compatible smartphones with the OxygenOS 15 update."", 'The visual lookup feature can be activated by long pressing the navigation bar or Home Button. Another is Intelligent Search which will let users run on-device searches by typing a query in natural language. Users can ask about a file, setting, or a note and the AI will return relevant results.', 'Apart from that, Gemini will also power a new Pass Scan feature which is integrated within the camera app. It can be used to quickly scan boarding passes. AI Notes is also making a debut with OxygenOS 15. Similar to the AI Notes in Samsung Galaxy devices, the tool can format, expand (or shorten) content written in the Notes app. AI Notes can also auto-transcribe voice notes into text.', 'Further, AI Reply has been added into the AI Toolbox and can be accessed from the smart sidebar. It can understand the conversations in messaging apps and can automatically generate contextually relevant replies that users can copy and paste into the app.', ""Google's Gemini AI assistant will be made the default virtual assistant with the new OS update. Users can also access the recently released Gemini Live feature which offers a two-way real-time voice conversation with the Gemini chatbot."", 'Coming to design enhancements, OxygenOS 15 introduces new boot animation, icons, more shelf card choices, and new fingerprint unlock style options. It also adds Shimmering Effects and Gaussian Blur across various system scenarios to offer a new visual experience. Some minor upgrades have been added to settings, notification bar, and control centre.', 'New design upgrades can also be seen while interacting with the OS. A new OnePlus OneTake feature now improves the phone unlocking animation. File sharing between OnePlus and iPhone devices has also been improved with a new “Share with iPhone” feature.', ""OxygenOS 15 will benefit from Android 15's Google Play Protect live threat detection feature that analyses app behaviour to detect potential malware and fraudulent apps. Similarly, new theft protection mechanisms have also been added to protect the user data in case their device is stolen."", 'The feature can detect movements associated with theft, such as someone snatching a smartphone and running away, and automatically locks the device to protect the data from the thief. Additionally, a remote lock feature has also been added with which a user can lock the device remotely with just their phone number. An offline lock has also been added that activates automatically if the handset remains disconnected from Internet for a prolonged period.', ""Finally, OxygenOS 15 also implements Android 15's biometric verification system for sensitive actions such as disabling theft-protection features or FindMyDevice, which the company says adds another layer of protection for users."", 'OxygenOS 15 will first be rolled out to OnePlus 12 5G starting October 30.

I tried Oxygen OS 15 and this is what OnePlus got right (and what it didn't),https://www.androidauthority.com/oxygen-os-15-review-3493444/,"['Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.', 'October 24, 2024', 'It’s officially Android 15 season. With Google’s latest and greatest already gracing Pixel devices, it’s time for other Android manufacturers to unveil their own takes on the update. Today, OnePlus pulled back the curtain on Oxygen OS 15, which is set to debut on the upcoming OnePlus 13. I have been using the Oxygen OS 15 beta on a OnePlus 12, and here’s how my experience has been so far.', 'One thing that immediately stands out is the strong family resemblance between Oxygen OS 15 and Color OS 15, OPPO’s latest take on its own UI skin. Given the increasingly intertwined hardware and software strategies of these sister companies in recent years, this convergence isn’t entirely surprising. However, what truly matters is that Oxygen OS 15 brings all the key Android 15 features to OnePlus phones. This includes features like Circle to Search, Theft Protection, Gemini as the default smart assistant, etc. Hit the previous link for extensive details on all of those features. In this hands-on, I’ll be running through all the specific changes OnePlus is bringing to the table that separates it from other Android phones.', 'OnePlus has a history of touting the speed and smoothness of Oxygen OS, and this time around, the company is emphasizing a shift to “parallel processing” as the key to even greater fluidity.', 'To break it down, Oxygen OS 14 used serial processing, meaning each app had to fully launch before the system moved on to the next one. With Oxygen OS 15, the process happens in parallel, so different parts of an app’s launch sequence can run simultaneously. The idea is that this change will make app switching and animations faster.', 'In my experience with Oxygen OS 15 on the OnePlus 12, the fluidity of animations was definitely noticeable, although perhaps not revolutionary. To be fair, Oxygen OS 14 was already a snappy performer, so the improvements in Oxygen OS 15 are more about refinement. There are subtle touches, like the app minimizing animation dynamically adjusting based on how forcefully you swipe up, but these are details you might not notice unless you’re specifically looking for them.', 'These performance enhancements might be more apparent in speed tests and app opening speed runs that tech YouTubers love to conduct. To give you some perspective, I used the OnePlus 12 running Oxygen OS 15 alongside my Galaxy Z Fold 5 running One UI 6.1.1, and the Z Fold 5 felt like a five-year-old device in comparison. So yeah, Oxygen OS 15 is smooooooth.', 'File transfers between Android and iPhones have long been a headache, but OnePlus is trying to bridge that gap with its new “Share to iPhone” feature in Oxygen OS 15. It operates similarly to third-party file transfer apps like Shareit, but the advantage here is that you don’t need to install anything on your OnePlus phone. The iPhone involved will need to download a separate app called “O+ Connect” and grant it the necessary permissions.', 'I tested this feature by sending a three-minute 4K video from one Android phone to another using Quick Share and then from the OnePlus 12 to an iPhone using the Share to iPhone feature. The actual transfer time was comparable in both cases (around 12 seconds). However, the Share to iPhone method takes an extra 10-15 seconds of setup time for every transfer to establish the wireless connection between the two phones.', 'While the overall experience is not quite as seamless as AirDrop, this is still a great feature that addresses a long-standing pain point. It’s a step in the right direction, and I hope we can eventually see a universal file transfer solution for Android and iPhone that works this effortlessly. On a side note, you can also use the O+ Connect app to send files from your iPhone to a OnePlus phone.', 'Another notable improvement that OnePlus has achieved with Oxygen OS 15 is the reduction in system storage size. OnePlus claims that system files on Oxygen OS 15 now take up to 20% less space, thanks to optimizations that eliminate redundancies. This could free up as much as 5GB of additional storage, which is a practical benefit, especially for users with lower storage configurations.', 'However, it’s worth noting that this storage-saving feature currently only applies to new devices launching with Oxygen OS 15, starting with the OnePlus 13. When I checked my OnePlus 12 before and after the Oxygen OS 15 update, I didn’t see any noticeable difference in system storage, and OnePlus hasn’t confirmed whether older devices receiving the update will also benefit from this change. So, for now, this feature seems to be a perk for new hardware only.', 'Open Canvas is making its way to OnePlus candy bar phones with Oxygen OS 15, and this was my first time getting hands-on with it. On the OnePlus 12, you get a scaled-back version of Open Canvas — only two apps can run at a time, unlike the three-app experience on the OnePlus Open or OnePlus tablets. Despite this limitation, it’s still a big improvement for multitasking on a standard slab phone.', 'Traditional split-screen multitasking on smaller screens often feels clunky, with two apps squeezed into small windows and users fumbling around to tap the right button.', 'With Oxygen OS 15, you can keep two apps open as multi-windows. However, instead of getting crammed into either half of the screens, one app takes up almost the full screen while the other waits at the top or bottom edge. Tapping the second app instantly switches them, shrinking the first app to the edge.', 'Featured Carrier Deal', 'US Mobile – Unlimited data plans starting at just $17.50/month\nUnlimited Data, Talk & Text, Int’l Calling and Texting and more.\nSee deals at US Mobile', 'For example, I was able to use this feature to search for a setlist on Google Chrome while simultaneously searching for those songs on YouTube and adding them to a playlist — far smoother than split-screen multitasking.', 'While its utility on candy bar phones is undeniably less than on foldables and tablets, it’s still a helpful feature. It can make multitasking on smaller phones much more functional, and I hope other Android skins start taking notes from OnePlus on how to implement split-screen features better.', 'It’s 2024, and no software update would be complete without a dose of AI features. Google and Samsung have already integrated comprehensive AI features into their latest Android skins, and OnePlus is evidently a bit late to the party. Nevertheless, Oxygen OS 15 brings some new AI-powered tools to the table, with the caveat that most of them rely on cloud-based processing instead of on-device processing.', 'One of the key AI features added is Detail Boost, which is available in the new AI Editor under the Photos app. Interestingly, it can also automatically pop up as a suggestion when you’re cropping an image, which is a neat touch. However, don’t expect miracles. In reality, it mainly applies noise reduction and smoothing without actually adding any real detail back into the image. While it can sometimes improve the look of photos, like in the cropped image of the Golden Gate Bridge I tested, the overall results are a hit-or-miss.', 'Similar to Magic Editor in Google Photos and Generative Edit on Samsung phones, this tool allows you to remove unwanted objects from images. It works surprisingly fast, with no loading screens to interrupt the flow, and the animation of objects being erased actually looks quite cool. In terms of effectiveness, it works well in most cases, although I’d still prefer Google’s Magic Editor, as it tends to be a bit more reliable in certain situations.', 'These are the other two features of the AI Editor. Unblur specifically targets people’s faces in photos and attempts to reduce blur by applying some noise reduction. Reflection Eraser, as the name suggests, aims to remove reflections from mirror selfies or photos taken through windows. They function as expected, though we’ve seen similar implementations elsewhere, and there’s nothing too groundbreaking here.', 'Oxygen OS 15 adds a new AI Toolbox 2.0 to the mix, which introduces some handy contextual AI features that appear in the Smart Sidebar. For example, when you’re in any chatting app, the Smart Sidebar automatically presents an “AI Reply” option. This feature reads through the on-screen text of your conversation and suggests AI-generated replies. You even have the option to choose different tones or writing styles for these replies.', 'I particularly liked this feature because it’s not dependent on any specific keyboard, unlike the reply suggestion features from Samsung and Google. I use Swiftkey, which means I can’t utilize those other AI reply options. That’s not the case here. That being said, the generated replies themselves can be a bit hit-or-miss, and I doubt if you’ll ever want to use them in an actual conversation.', 'AI Summary and AI Speak are two other options that pop up in the Smart Sidebar when you’re browsing the web. AI Summary is designed to summarize the on-screen text, while AI Speak is supposed to read it aloud. Unfortunately, I kept encountering a “language not supported” error when trying to use these features, even on English-language web pages, even though English is listed as one of the supported languages. This is likely a bug in the beta, and I’ve reached out to OnePlus for clarification on this issue.', 'Intelligent Search is one of those AI features that will definitely come in handy if it works as advertised. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to get this feature to work on my OnePlus 12. I’ve reached out to OnePlus for clarification and will update this section of the review when I have more information.', 'How it works is that instead of simply searching for file names or downloaded documents, you can directly type in questions using natural language (an example shown by OnePlus was asking for the price of a product, which was mentioned in an Excel sheet that was downloaded on the phone). The Intelligent Search feature is then supposed to provide you with answers based on the information present in your local files.', 'The Notes app has also gotten a sprinkle of AI, with several features powered by Google’s Gemini models. These include auto-completion, tone adjustment, and even automatic summarizing of long notes into bullet points. There’s also a voice transcription tool that cleans up fillers and expands text with a “Continue Writing” feature. Supported languages for these features include English, Hindi, Spanish, Italian, and more.', 'These additions to the Notes app are practical and helpful but nothing particularly new if you’ve used AI-powered writing tools before.', 'It’s important to highlight that to use these AI reply, AI summary, and AI speak features, you’ll have to grant OnePlus’s screen recognition app all the permissions it requests. From the screenshot below, it looks like OnePlus is taking the accessibility access route to analyze any and all of your screen content, not just limiting itself to analyzing text within certain apps. This might raise some privacy concerns for users, given that it is also reliant on cloud processing.', 'Another noteworthy aspect is the heavy reliance on cloud processing for these AI features. With the exception of Intelligent Search, which employs a hybrid approach, all the AI capabilities in Oxygen OS 15 are cloud-based. This means there are no strictly offline AI features, which could be a drawback for users concerned about data privacy.', 'Oxygen OS 15 also introduces several visual tweaks, and it’s hard to ignore that some of these changes feel heavily inspired by Apple’s iOS. The most noticeable one is the redesigned split-view for notifications and quick settings, which closely resembles what iOS 18 offers. It’s not unique to OnePlus though — Samsung is rumored to be implementing a similar layout in One UI 7, and Google could adopt a similar approach with Android 16. The good news is that OnePlus has made this optional, so if you prefer the old layout, you can easily switch back.', 'For me, the new design works quite well, as it offers more space for both notifications and quick settings. However, it does require a bit of muscle memory retraining. It’s worth noting that while the design resembles iOS, it doesn’t offer the same level of customization. You can’t add widgets, change icon sizes, or personalize the quick settings panel to the extent you can on an iPhone. It would have been fantastic if OnePlus had included those features.', 'The iOS-inspired design isn’t limited to just notifications. There are also new customizable lock screens with 3D depth effects, similar to what iOS 18 offers. But to be fair, Samsung introduced comparable lock screen customizations in One UI, so it’s more of an industry-wide trend than just an Apple influence.', 'One genuinely new visual element in Oxygen OS is called OnePlus OneTake. This feature offers customizable themes that apply a unified look to your Always-on Display, lock screen, and home screen. What makes them special are the animations that create smooth and natural transitions between these three stages. While the overall presentation has a distinct iOS vibe, I can’t fault OnePlus for it. The OneTake themes look fantastic and add a touch of personality to the phone. If you’d prefer a distinct approach, OnePlus also has some new “Flux Themes” for you to try out, complete with depth effect on the lock screen (which you can add to your images too).', 'OnePlus also revamped the volume panel in Oxygen OS 15, which now starts off as a thick slider but shrinks into a slimmer version when you adjust the volume. It’s not a bad addition, but again, it feels like another example of OnePlus leaning into that Apple-like visual language. There’s also a Dynamic Island-inspired floating bar that works similarly to Apple’s implementation.', 'In addition to these bigger changes, there are several smaller visual refreshes scattered throughout the UI. The settings menu, about phone page, and built-in icon styles have all received minor tweaks, contributing to Oxygen OS’s overall fresh look.', 'Oxygen OS 15 also brings back a beloved OnePlus easter egg that was absent for a while. Typing “1+=” in the calculator app now once again displays the “Never Settle” banner, a reminder of the company’s commitment to pushing boundaries. It’s a small detail but one that longtime OnePlus fans will surely appreciate.', 'From my experience so far, Oxygen OS 15 feels like a small yet reassuring step forward for OnePlus’ Android skin. It’s a visually appealing, clean, and mature operating system that delivers a delightful user experience. While the iOS inspiration is evident in certain design choices, this trend of feature homogenization is prevalent across the industry. I’m not opposed to it as long as it means we get the best features and most intuitive ways of interacting with our phones.', 'Performance remains a core strength of Oxygen OS. With smoother animations, faster app launches, and thoughtful refinements throughout, it easily stands out as one of the slickest Android experiences on the market. The system feels cohesive and responsive, reinforcing OnePlus’s reputation for nimble software.', 'I haven’t had the chance to test out everything that was announced, but it’s clear that the AI features here aren’t quite as comprehensive or polished as the competition. That said, it’s a start, and there’s potential for OnePlus to improve in future updates.', 'Overall, it seems that Oxygen OS is back on an upward trajectory after a rough couple of years. The UI feels lighter, more user-friendly, and relatively bug-free. Sure, it has grown more similar to OPPO’s ColorOS in many ways, but it still stands out as one of the smoothest Android experiences, particularly in markets like the US, where OPPO doesn’t have a presence.', 'The first open beta of Oxygen OS 15 will debut on the OnePlus 12, starting October 30, 2024. Oxygen OS 15 will also be present out-of-the-box on the OnePlus 13 when it launches globally.', 'OnePlus also says that AI features will begin rolling out by the end of November. Some AI features will be restricted to certain models to “ensure optimal performance.”', '']"

Google has finally pushed out Android 15 to Pixel phone owners, and now another of Samsung’s rivals has confirmed it will launch the newest operating system in the coming days.', 'OnePlus said it will unveil OxygenOS 15, its version of the new Android 15 mobile software, during an online event on Thursday 24 October.', 'Though the Chinese firm has been tight-lipped on exactly what is new in the free update, we have a pretty good idea already. That’s because Android 15 is made by Google as an open source operating system. That means all Android smartphone makers can use it for free, and most choose to add their own design, animations and general aesthetic to their version to help differentiate them.', 'Android 15 doesn’t bring many visual changes to Google Pixel phones, nor does it introduce many headline-grabbing new features. This is mostly because Android is such a mature operating system, and Google can no longer magic up huge beneficial changes for smartphone owners year after year.', 'Instead, Android 15 brings several theft protection updates, including AI that can tell if a thief has swiped your phone from your hand. This can lock your phone down so that they cannot access your personal data, including banking apps.', 'There are also new authentication demands when someone goes to turn off Find My Device or reset the phone, something thieves do to try and sell on phones after they’ve stolen them. Though this of course won’t stop phones being stolen, it’s hoped once criminals learn that it’s becoming harder to reset Android phones, it will lead to a decrease in phone theft.', ""“As one of the first operating systems based on the Android 15 update, OxygenOS 15 leverages OnePlus's extensive research and deep user insights to create a new generation of software that embodies the iconic Never Settle spirit,” OnePlus said. “Equipped with industry-leading Fast&Smooth experience, meaningful new AI features and a distinctive design style that highlights OnePlus’s personality, OxygenOS 15 is set to be the fastest and most user-friendly OxygenOS ever.”"", 'OnePlus has notably been slower to adopt AI software features than its rivals, but it sounds as though OxygenOS 15 will change that.', 'Which OnePlus phones will get Android 15 is yet to be confirmed, but we’re pretty sure the latest flagship OnePlus 12 will be the first to get the new goodies.

"I tried OnePlus’ OxygenOS 15, and it’s much better than I expected",https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/i-tried-oneplus-oxygenos-15-and-it-is-much-better-than-i-expected/,"['Ahead of OnePlus announcing OxygenOS 15, Oppo showed off ColorOS 15, which has taken quite a lot of inspiration from Apple’s iOS software. Given how closely the two pieces of software are related, I was suddenly concerned that OxygenOS 15 would follow the same path.', 'I’ve now had some hands-on time with OnePlus’ latest software. Is it as derivative as I feared? Surprisingly, no.', 'Thankfully, OnePlus has not adopted all the heavy-handed “inspired by iOS” features visible in ColorOS, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t taken a few of them on. Perhaps the most obvious is a Dynamic Island rip-off called Dynamic Cloud, where a pill-like floating window appears at the very top of the screen surrounding the front camera on my OnePlus 12. It works with some standard apps like the Recorder and with third-party apps like Spotify, but not with other logical apps like YouTube Music or OnePlus’ O Relax app (at least, not at this time).', 'You can swipe it away and swipe it back again while it’s active, which is nice. A tap expands the window to show Spotify music controls and actions for the Recorder app. It seems to work really well, and I like the small “music playing” animation, but it’s not the first time we’ve seen an Android phone with this feature.', 'The new dynamic lock screen is another iOS carryover, with the ability to create different custom lock screen and home screen styles and switch between them. Just like iOS, you can change the clock style and add a depth effect to make photos of people or pets stand out from the background.', 'There’s an odd Word Art feature for the wallpaper, which adds a word to the background or foreground, but you can only choose between a set few examples, made up of cringey phrases like Keep Movin’, Game On, Fast, and Cute. Not being able to add your own words is strange, but not being able to remove OnePlus’ silly words entirely is very annoying. This also continues in other new wallpaper styles, and the phrases get even worse. I will never, ever want to use a wallpaper with True to the Core or Be the Legend written on it, yet OxygenOS 15 assumes I will. Also, the fact the word Fast looks like “fart” and sits behind a photo of a man’s bottom is an unfortunate, but childishly amusing coincidence.', 'ColorOS 15 looks to have more customization features for the look of the lock screen and widgets, many of which seem to come directly from iOS, but these are missing on my version of OxygenOS 15. You can still switch up the look of the lock screen, but not as much as in ColorOS 15, and based on some of the awful options available, you’ll probably want to stick with a plain old background anyway. Elsewhere, Google Assistant is still the default assistant on my OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15, but for subsequent OnePlus phones, it will be swapped to Google Gemini.', 'OnePlus has always emphasized the speed and smoothness of its OxygenOS software as a big benefit, and for OxygenOS 15, it has introduced Parallel Processing. This technology is designed to keep animations and app switching operating without lag, particularly for heavy users who multitask often and need to access multiple apps very quickly. Whether you’ll notice the differences depends on if you make these demands on the system, closely observe animations in slow motion, or directly compare different phones together simultaneously.', 'I have used OxygenOS 15 normally, and it’s certainly fast, but whether you think it’s smoother than before will depend on your definition of the word. A tried-and-tested cliché is to compare smoothness with butter, and I find OxygenOS 15’s butter to be the kind that has gotten a little too cold in the refrigerator. In its quest for smoothness, the software can feel a little labored (even when set to fast in the Settings menu). When I compare basic animations and navigation with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the OneUI-equipped Samsung phone feels snappier and more directly in tune with my finger’s movements. I think OnePlus’s butter needs some time at room temperature before use, but not everyone will agree.', 'OnePlus has always pushed the speed and smoothness of its OxygenOS software.', 'The Games app has an updated Toolkit with a selection of new features, including the ability to increase the frame rate, a 4D vibration mode, a Quick Start feature, and a way to track the amount of time you play a game. When playing Asphalt Legends Unite, the 4D vibration feature was not available, but I used the Adaptive Frame Booster and the Hyper Resolution. The game plays well and looks fantastic on the OnePlus 12, but I’m not sure how much of that is down to the game mode tweaks or the stunning screen and powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. Either way, playing games is one of the OnePlus 12’s strong points.', 'Open the Gallery app, and you’ll find OnePlus’ new AI Editor tool, which includes an AI Eraser and three new features called AI Detail Boost, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Unblur. Using existing photos saved on my OnePlus 12, I gave the AI Eraser and the AI Detail Boost a try and was mostly impressed with the results from them both.', 'The AI Eraser tool successfully removed a person from a photo and filled in the background in such a way that you’d have to look hard to realize it was AI-generated. However, the tool only automatically recognized one person in a photo of two people, and there’s no way to add the other so the tool removes both. You have to use the Smart Lasso tool to do this. You can’t edit its selection either, so in this photo, it removed the dog’s lead. It’s not as smart as Google’s Magic Eraser.', 'To try the AI Detail boost, I cropped an existing photo down and ran it through the feature. It effectively sharpens the picture, removing the blur and pixelation introduced when you crop an image down. It’s most noticeable on the horse rider’s safety vest, where the text has lost all its fuzziness. The resolution jumped up to a full 4096 x 3072 pixels, so there’s more to it than just a few basic tweaks. It’s an effective tool that really does improve the look of cropped images.', 'What else is new in OxygenOS 15? There are new icon designs to try, a slight change to the Settings menu (which emphasizes space and minimizes clutter), and a choice to split the notification and quick access shades between the left and right of the home screen.', 'OnePlus’ Shelf has been redesigned with new colors and layout options. An unusual Share with iPhone feature has been added to seamlessly share files with the competing device, and the OnePlus Open’s photo attachment shortcut makes an appearance to speed up photo sharing, too. Theft Protection is an unusual new feature that uses the accelerometer and various other factors to assess if your phone has been stolen and then automatically locks it.', 'Aside from the photo-editing tools that use AI, OnePlus also uses Google Gemini models for various productivity tools. In AI Notes, it can generate summaries, change the formatting, enhance the copy, and even expand on bullet points. An AI Reply feature works in WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Instagram and can contextually understand messages and generate replies. Intelligent Search scans all local files on your phone from a single search phrase and generates an answer to your question, but it does not appear that it will work on all OnePlus phones. Circle to Search also arrives and is one of the most helpful AI features, but it is available on many other Android phones, too.', 'After using OxygenOS 15 for a few hours, it seems OnePlus has kept most of ColorOS’ iOS homage out of the software, and I’m very pleased about that. Most people will appreciate the speed and flow of the OS, but it may need refining, as I prefer Samsung’s approach to smoothness. The AI photo-editing tools are interesting, but the wallpaper and lock screen customizations are oddly restrictive, and most of the other AI features won’t be ones you use all the time.', 'One slight concern is OnePlus’s failure to confirm that all the features discussed will be available on the OnePlus 12, as it has stated that Google Gemini and Intelligent Search will be restricted to the OnePlus 13. This aside, and considering my trepidation when I started using it, OxygenOS 15 turned out to be a pleasant surprise — and I think you’re going to enjoy using it.', 'The OnePlus 12 is considered one of the best smartphones available today, so there is much anticipation for its upcoming successor, the OnePlus 13. This week, two critical leaks about the new handset were potentially revealed.', 'First, OnePlus China head Louis Jie took to Weibo to mention that OnePlus has nearly completed the outdoor lighting test of the BOE X2 display. Created in collaboration with BOE, the quad micro-curved display looks flat, but offers slight curvatures for comfort.', 'Other than a few deviations, OnePlus has a penchant for value products. The premium OnePlus 12 offers a (mostly) superior set of features and a refined experience over similarly-priced flagships such as the Galaxy S24 Plus or the Pixel 8 Pro. Similarly, the $500 OnePlus 12R offers exceptional performance and a flagship-like experience for its price. The OnePlus Nord 4, which sits in a price bracket right under the 12R, has its own benefits, but one that stands out is its metal back.', '', '""Wow, it really pops out,"" is what rang up in my head as I approached my desk where the new OnePlus Open\'s Apex Edition lay. Admittedly, this wasn\'t my first impression of the phone, and I only arrived a few hours after having fiddled with it, trying to inspect it for differences from the black variant I have been using since the launch last year. But given the spontaneity of the sensation, I took it as authentic. Perhaps that\'s what OnePlus aims with this phone: to make heads turn and eyes fixated.', '', 'Upgrade your lifestyle\nDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Let's start with the upgrades to the operating system."", ""OxygenOS 15 uses what OnePlus calls Parallel Processing, which allows multiple operations to run simultaneously. When you do, you'll see smoother animations rather than the juddering starts and stops in animation that you might have noticed before."", 'OnePlus also says OxygenOS 15 is 20 percent smaller than its predecessor, which can add up to 5GB of storage back for your access.

Known as “Share with iPhone,” the new feature aims to smooth out the often cumbersome process of sending photos, videos, and other files between OnePlus and iPhone devices. But while it promises more straightforward file-sharing, the process isn’t exactly friction-free, especially for iPhone users.', 'For OnePlus users, file sharing is as easy as it gets: no additional apps, no extra steps. The Share with iPhone feature integrates directly into OxygenOS 15, giving users the option to select a file and send it seamlessly. The experience aims to match the convenience of popular third-party apps like SHAREit, but iPhone users will need to jump through a few hoops. Here are the steps for sharing files on iPhones using your OnePlus phone. Before we talk about that, remember that the OxygenOS 15 will first be released to OnePlus 12, starting October 20. This will be accessible in the first open beta update and arrive to stable versions later.', 'OxygenOS 15: How to use ""Share with iPhones"" feature', '', '-First, the OnePlus phone users need to select the photo or video they want to share and then open the share menu. Here, you will find the ""Share with iPhone"" option.', '-For the connection to work, iPhone owners first need to download the “O+ Connect” app from the App Store.', '-Once downloaded, the app requires multiple permissions for it to operate correctly.', '', '-Additionally, the app needs to remain open for the file-sharing process to function.', '-Once set up, the OnePlus user selects the file they want to share, which triggers a Wi-Fi hotspot from the OnePlus device. The iPhone user then joins this temporary hotspot, allowing the file transfer to take place.', '', 'The time it takes to transfer a file is relatively short. For example, sharing a single photo generally takes between 15 and 20 seconds, which is manageable, albeit not as instantaneous as Apple’s AirDrop or Google’s Nearby Share. One could also experience delays in connecting with the secondary device, but it should get better with future updates.', '', 'For users seeking more straightforward solutions, cloud-based options like Google Drive remain popular alternatives. By simply uploading files to a shared Google Drive folder and sending the link, users across devices can access shared files without the hassle of downloading additional apps or joining a Wi-Fi hotspot. This approach is particularly useful for larger files or when sending multiple files at once, although it does require internet access on both sides.', '', 'With Share with iPhone, OnePlus has taken a step in the right direction by addressing a key cross-platform pain point. The feature certainly simplifies file sharing between OnePlus and iPhone users compared to previous solutions, but the need for an app download and temporary hotspot connection adds friction.', 'While it may not yet rival the ease of AirDrop, Share with iPhone signals a promising start in making OnePlus more interoperable with iOS, and it will be interesting to see how OnePlus and other Android manufacturers continue to innovate in cross-platform connectivity.', '']"

More specifically, OnePlus mocked Samsung\'s Android skin by demonstrating how sluggish it can be when opening and switching between 20 apps one by one.', 'While users are unlikely to do that in regular day-to-day usage, OnePlus wants to highlight how the OxygenOS 15 is ""effortlessly smooth under any load"" through this demonstration. Worth noting that the Samsung skin in this comparison is based on Android 14, and Android 15-based One UI 7 is on the way.', ""One UI 7 is expected to land in early 2025, and the Android 15 update for the Samsung Galaxy smartphones will reportedly bring revamped animations. However, it's unclear whether it will compete against the fluidness present in the app opening and closing animation of the OxygenOS 15."", ""Another thing to note is that it's not just the app opening and closing animation that determines how responsive the UI is. There are other factors like app load time and efficient memory management for running apps.

According to OnePlus, the new system includes major advancements in animation technology and AI features, marking a pivotal upgrade for the brand’s flagship devices.', 'Central to OxygenOS 15 is the new Parallel Processing feature, an industry-first technology designed to ensure seamless animation interactions. Historically, app transitions on smartphones have led to frustrating delays, especially when switching between resource-intensive apps. With Parallel Processing, OnePlus addresses this issue by allowing multiple animations to run simultaneously. This innovation eliminates the lag commonly associated with app switching, creating a smooth, uninterrupted experience even under heavy workloads.', 'OxygenOS 15 also introduces refined animations that add a new level of fluidity to the user experience, enhancing everything from app launches to dismissals. Based on feedback from the 2024 Open Ear Forum, OnePlus has prioritized faster animation speeds to not only improve visual appeal but to enhance overall usability.', 'OnePlus has also optimized system storage, reducing it by nearly 20% compared to the previous OxygenOS 14 on the OnePlus 12.

Just this week, OnePlus unveiled its latest OxygenOS 15 software, which packs a number of AI tricks like reflection removal, unblurring, detail boosting, and more. The Oxygen OS 15 update also expands the availability of three of OnePlus’ existing AI features — AI Speak, AI Summary, and AI Writer — to more devices.', 'AI Speak is a simple feature that reads articles out loud in either a male or female voice. It’s a bit like the read-aloud feature in Google Chrome, except it works with other web browsers like Firefox as well as with news apps like Google News. In the AI Speak window, you can change voices, restart playback from the beginning, move to the previous or next sentence, or adjust the playback speed between 0.5X, 1X, 1.5X, or 2.0X. You can minimize the window into a tiny pill that floats on the right side of the screen by tapping either the close button or by swiping down on the handle at the top. The pill can be moved up or down but not left or right, and it can be dismissed by tapping the X icon, which also ends playback.', 'AI Summary is another simple feature that summarizes articles for you. It uses a cloud-based generative AI model (though we’re not sure which one) to create a numbered list of sentences that summarizes whatever you’re reading. Like AI Speak, AI Summary works with not only Google Chrome but also other web browsers as well as with news apps. The AI Summary window has buttons to regenerate the summary, give a thumbs up or a thumbs down for the summary, copy the summary to the clipboard, share the summary with another app, or save the summary to the OnePlus Notes app.', 'AI Writer is a feature that helps you write some message you want to send to someone. It also uses some cloud-based generative AI model like AI Summary does, and like other AI writing assistants, it lets you generate responses in different tones. It works with many social media apps, shopping apps, email apps, and review editing pages. When you open the window, you first need to enter a prompt that’s up to 1,000 characters long, next you choose whether you want the tone to be “concise,” “detailed,” or “polite,” then lastly tap “generate.” After a few seconds, AI Writer will generate a response in the tone that you chose. If you don’t like the generated response, then you can tap regenerate to have it try again. If you do like it, you can tap copy to add it to the clipboard.', 'To use AI Speak, AI Summary, or AI Writer, you need to enable the Screen Recognition feature under Settings > Accessibility & convenience. Screen Recognition uses Android’s accessibility features to extract content from the screen for AI Speak and AI Summary to read and summarize, respectively. If you’re wondering why it needs to capture screen content, it’s because the content capture API that apps can use to provide content is not only rarely utilized but is also only accessible to the Android System Intelligence app. Thus, OnePlus essentially had to use a screen reading workaround in order to make its AI features work with a variety of existing apps.', 'Featured Carrier Deal', 'US Mobile – Unlimited data plans starting at just $17.50/month\nUnlimited Data, Talk & Text, Int’l Calling and Texting and more.\nSee deals at US Mobile', 'Once you’ve enabled the Screen Recognition feature, you can access AI Speak, AI Summary, or AI Writer by swiping open the Smart Sidebar while in a supported app. (The Smart Sidebar has to first be enabled under Settings > Accessibility & convenience.)

AI Toolkit was initially only available on the OnePlus Nord 4 and OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite because they ran Oxygen OS 14.1, the latest version of Oxygen OS prior to Oxygen OS 15. The features quietly expanded to the OnePlus Pad 2 (which also runs Oxygen OS 14.1) following an update earlier this month, and they’re all now part of the rebranded AI Toolbox 2.0 feature in Oxygen OS 15.0.', 'AI Toolbox 2.0 not only improves the AI Writer feature by letting you check or rewrite text instead of writing a new message, but it also adds a fourth feature called AI Reply. AI Reply, as we mentioned in our Oxygen OS 15 review, analyzes on-screen content to generate suggested replies in different tones while you’re using messaging apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, or Snapchat.

OnePlus’ clear Android 15 roadmap may coerce more phone makers to follow suit,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/oneplus-clear-android-15-roadmap-may-coerce-more-phone-makers-to-follow-suit-101729828404964.html,"['', 'There are two distinct sides to this fragmentation coin, as has always been the case. Earlier this month, Google officially rolled out the Android 15 update. Unless you have a compatible Google Pixel phone that is, you would still be waiting the latest Android on your phone. And that wait is likely to continue at least for the next few weeks, as phone makers speed up beta testing before a formal rollout. OnePlus, on its part, has laid out a clear roadmap for OxygenOS 15, the software their smartphones run, which will be based on Android 15. That is distinctly different from the ambiguity most other phone makers have served up thus far. Vivo, seemingly an exception to that observation.', '“With OxygenOS 15, we aim to create a product that resonates with our users, integrating advanced and meaningful AI features and a unique design that they helped to create,” he stated. “This release sets a new standard for software performance and productivity,” says Arthur Lam, Director of OxygenOS Product at OnePlus, in a statement shared with HT.', 'Also Read: Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is curiously versatile, as a phone and a small tablet', 'Of course, OxygenOS 15 running Android 15, will have a thick layer of artificial intelligence (AI) to talk about. Aside from Google Gemini model and assistant integration, OnePlus’ own AI Detail Boost and AI Unblur as well as AI Reflection Eraser should give smartphone cameras a few more performance muscles to flex. Alongside, incoming are very noticeable interface tweaks, including a specific mention for “Shimmering Effects and Gaussian Blur across various system scenarios”.', 'OnePlus will be adding smartphone theft protection mechanisms, something Google too had detailed for Android 15 in the months leading up to its release. The idea is that the phone, using a variety of metrics such as inputs from the gyroscope, the location as well as unknown locations, will lock itself to protect a user’s data. OnePlus says more protections will include a remote lock feature that’ll allow users to lock their phone using only their phone number, and without needing to log in to a Google account.', 'There will also be something called “offline lock”, which claims to protect the data in a phone, if a thief has turned off any wireless connectivity on a stolen device, to extract data — the specifics of the duration it needs to be offline for this mechanism to active, are yet to be clarified.', 'OnePlus says OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15 gets its first public beta version on October 30, with a planned release of the final version starting with the OnePlus 12 flagship phone, beginning before the end of November. Other phones, including the OnePlus 12R and the Nord phones join, in the weeks that follow. In parallel, they say AI features will begin rolling out to OnePlus products by the end of November. “To ensure optimal performance, select AI features will be made available exclusively on designated models,” they add in a statement, with further clarity expected in the coming days.', 'OnePlus’ roadmap for Android 15 is a positive contrast to everything we’ve heard till now, from other Android phone makers. Particularly for those users who spend top money on the flagship devices.', 'Also Read: OnePlus 12 is a refined flagship, bravely walking the path of conventionality', 'Smartphone maker Nothing, for example, a tech start-up that prides itself on being nimble with software updates, rolled out the first public beta for the Nothing Phone (2a) a couple of weeks ago. As of this moment, it is not clear if the flagship phone, Nothing Phone (2) and indeed the Phone (2a), previous generation Nothing Phone (1) and indeed the CMF Phone 1, will get the beta versions of Android 15.', 'A beta software may not be a palatable proposition for most users, in terms of reliability. Nothing says the Phone (2a) will get the final version of Android, called Nothing OS 3.0, at some point in December. Quite how their flagship phone buyers perceive this, remains to be seen. Motorola too, which has been rather lax with Android updates in recent past, is believed to have a beta test version in place for certain phones, but there is no further clarity on the release roadmap. Honor has unveiled the MagicOS 9.0 just yesterday, and while there is confirmation that phones in China will begin to get updates from next month with that carrying out for the best part of early 2025, there’s little in terms of clarity for the global markets including India.', 'For now, Samsung only says they are “preparing to roll out the much-anticipated Android 15 update with One UI 7.0 for its Galaxy devices later this year”. They haven’t given a date, for now. If the trend of the years gone by continues, they’ll likely roll it out for multiple Galaxy S series phones in the initial stage — the latest generation flagships, and perhaps even the tablets, should get the newest software update in the initial days. A stark contrast to Nothing, to note.', 'Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra review: AI bets, human nature and a generational shift', 'Xiaomi too has an Android 15 beta program in place, for devices including the flagship Xiaomi 14, as well as the Xiaomi 13T Pro.

HT has not had any real-world experience with Funtouch OS 15, and we will not be able to comment on the performance, aesthetics or how well the AI features work.
