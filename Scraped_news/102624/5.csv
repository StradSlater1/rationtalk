This is a violation of federal election laws, and he should be prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned for his numerous violations. Unfortunately, this is Elon Musk we’re talking about, and the person responsible for enforcing federal laws against him is Attorney General Merrick Garland—and all of that means that Musk will not be prosecuted, fined, or sent to prison. The rules, you see, are different for rich white Republicans who violate the laws than they are for anyone else. I thought everybody knew that by now.', 'What Musk is doing is not complicated, but there’s enough misdirection in his scheme that it can be confusing to see what he’s up to. So allow me to explain. Through his political action committee, Musk is offering $1,000,000, lottery style, to people in “battleground” states—specifically, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina—who sign his PAC’s petition. The petition is a general pledge to “support” the First and Second Amendment (because of course a white South African whose family benefited from apartheid is somewhat more interested in supporting the Second Amendment than, say, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which prevent people like Musk from doing here what people like Musk did in South Africa). If you sign the petition, you have a chance of winning a million bucks. Musk handed out the first check last weekend.', 'Paying people, or offering people a lottery ticket, to sign a petition is legal. That’s fine. It’s an exercise of free speech, at least in this ridiculous country that equates money with speech.', 'The problem with Musk’s scheme is that, in order to get the money, you have to be registered to vote. By making voter registration key to getting the money, Musk is trying to induce people who are not registered to register to vote. That is illegal. As the elections law expert Rick Hasen points out, paying people, bribing people, or giving people pretty much anything of monetary value to induce them to register to vote is a violation of federal law.', 'For those playing along at home, the law Hasen points to is 52 U.S.C. 10307(c), which states: “Whoever knowingly or willfully gives false information as to his name, address or period of residence in the voting district for the purpose of establishing his eligibility to register or vote, or conspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his false registration to vote or illegal voting, or pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” (Emphasis Hasen’s.)', 'The Department of Justice has clarified that this law does not apply to, say, giving voters a ride to the polls. But it does include giving people cash, or liquor, or food stamps, or… “lottery chances” to induce them to register.', 'Musk is violating the law, but for that to matter somebody has to prosecute him for his violations, and that job, unfortunately, rests with Merrick Garland. Garland sent Musk and his PAC a letter earlier this week in which he “warned” that they “could” be violating federal law. Garland is reportedly monitoring and investigating the situation. Musk ignored the warning and announced more winners.', 'I know there are still people who would like to defend Garland’s historic inability to enforce any laws against Republican political actors, but, honestly, Garland’s response is beyond pathetic. It takes a Google search and half an hour of Westlaw access to “investigate” whether “Hoo boy, register to vote and have a chance to win a million dollars” violates applicable federal standards. The Department of Justice’s own “Election Crimes Manual” explains that what Musk is doing is illegal. Garland need only “investigate” the rules written down by his own institution to figure out that Musk is in violation of the law.', 'The strongly worded letter Garland sent to Musk should have been a legal complaint, filed in court, and served to Musk while he was on stage handing out the freaking check.', 'But while Garland continues to be a national embarrassment, incapable of doing anything that might anger the Republican base, the sad reality is that even bringing the full force of the law against Musk would not stop his illegal actions. That’s because the full force of the law is incredibly weak in this instance and of little consequence to a rich white man.', 'Astute readers will have noticed that the penalty for violating the law at issue is a fine of “not more than $10,000” or imprisonment of “not more than five years, or both.” Musk is not going to go to jail because of this. We don’t put white people in jail for violating federal election laws, especially not when they are first-time offenders and the violation is as technical as this one is. (People, white people mainly, are going to object to my pointing out that Musk’s race is helping him get away with this, but please, how quickly do you think Oprah would find her ass in jail if she went to Houston and offered $1,000,000 to anybody who registered to vote and signed her petition saying “I support Black women”?) Also: Violations of this nature are always, or almost always (see the above Oprah thought experiment) addressed with a fine, in the first instance.', 'That fine should be $10,000. For Elon Musk. I’d say the fine is loose change for him, but the actual change you have rattling around in your pockets and hidden in your couch cushions is probably a greater percentage of your net worth than $10,000 is to Elon Musk’s billions. Even if you fined him $10,000 for every violation—that is, $10,000 for every voter who registered for a chance to win his lotto—the fine would not deter his behavior one bit.', 'And so, Elon Musk is paying Republicans to register to vote in battleground states, and there’s nothing we can really do to stop him.', 'With that brute reality in mind, my actual advice is that Democrats in battleground states should also register to vote and sign Musk’s petition. Maybe you will win the $1,000,000 bucks. Then you can get up on stage, get your check, and rip open your shirt to show that you were a Harris voter all along.

But as a private citizen, Musk has his own views, and he\'s sharing them widely.', 'Musk is now using his X posts, influence and money in a push to elect Trump. ', 'His enthusiastic support for the Republican nominee was perhaps no better illustrated than when Musk, a 53-year-old father of 12, gleefully jumped around on stage behind Trump as the candidate spoke at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, earlier this month. ', '""As you can see, I\'m not just MAGA, I\'m dark MAGA,"" Musk joked as he flashed his black ""Make America Great Again"" hat to a cheering crowd. ', ""Musk, the richest man in the world with a net worth of $242 billion, according to Forbes, has pledged to give away $1 million a day to voters for signing his political action committee's petition backing the Constitution, a pledge experts say raises legal questions. "", '""Though maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,"" wrote Rick Hasen, a UCLA Law School political science professor, at the Election Law Blog, about the $1 million per-day giveaway.', ""He's also donating an undisclosed amount of cash through that political action committee, America PAC, which he formed this summer to support Trump. Musk has contributed about $75 million to his America PAC since he founded it in May, including $30 million in September alone, according to Federal Election Commission filings. "", ""Musk hasn't always been so overtly political, although he did express support for former President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. He also made financial contributions to Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign, according to data from Open Secrets, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics. "", ""In more recent years, Musk's disdain for Democratic politics has been no secret. "", ""The Wall Street Journal analyzed Musk's tweets and found he rarely tweeted about President Biden or Trump before acquiring X, formerly Twitter, in October 2022, posting far more about his famous electric vehicle company, Tesla. "", 'But in 2023 and 2024, his posts began to mention Trump and Biden far more frequently, to the point that he has, in recent months, often written more posts mentioning one or the other than he has Tesla. In July, the Journal recorded 315 Musk tweets mentioning Trump or Biden, and 129 mentioning Tesla. ', ""White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on Musk's increased political involvement. "", '""I have no response, no comment on that at this moment,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters last Monday. ', 'X and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ', ""Musk's public messaging may help Trump even more than his fortune. "", 'When Musk took over Twitter, he said he did so because it wasn\'t living up to being a ""platform for free speech."" ', 'Since then, Musk has fired the teams tasked with combating deceptive content, and in the name of free speech, he reinstated accounts that were banned, like that of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. ', 'Not only is Musk using his platform to push for an ""absolutely decisive victory"" for Trump — he\'s been echoing the disinformation Trump and some Republicans are promoting. ', 'At a campaign appearance supporting Trump in Pennsylvania last Thursday, Musk repeated debunked claims raising doubts about the integrity of Dominion voting machines. Spreading misinformation about Dominion cost Fox News a $787 million settlement in 2023. ', '""When you have mail-in ballots and no proof of citizenship, it\'s almost impossible to prove cheating,"" Musk told the crowd. ""Statistically there are some very strange things that happen that are statistically incredibly unlikely. There\'s always this question of, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that, I think, they were used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County [in Arizona] but not in a lot of other places. Doesn\'t that seem like a heck of a coincidence?""', 'In September, Musk posted an AI-generated, obviously fake image showing a woman intended to be Harris wearing a red communist uniform, holding a hammer. ""Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one,"" Musk wrote. ""Can you believe she wears that outfit?"" The post appeared to violate his own company\'s rule on manipulated content. ', 'After the second apparent assassination attempt on Trump in September, Musk wrote on ""X"" that ""no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,"" with a raised eyebrow emoji. He deleted the post, later insisting his post was a ""joke."" ', 'Musk also came under fire in November 2023 for calling an antisemitic post on ""X"" the ""actual truth,"" prompting major advertisers such as Coca-Cola and Disney to pull advertising spending from the platform. The original X post claimed Jews ""have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.""', ""Musk has become increasingly vocal against Democratic politicians and their style of governance. He's shunned California's politics, and been shunned by California as well."", ""A California state commission recently rejected the Space Force's efforts to increase SpaceX rocket launches along the state's central coasts, citing environmental concerns. SpaceX has sued California regulators over the decision, claiming it was politically motivated. "", ""Musk has also decried the level of regulation and taxes in California, and announced in July that he would move both X and SpaceX to Texas in response to a law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that bans school districts from passing policies that require schools to notify parents about their children's gender identity or sexual identification."", ""But there may also be a more pragmatic reason for Musk's shift to Texas: The Lone Star state has no corporate income tax, while California imposes an 8.84% business tax, one of the highest in the nation."", ""Meanwhile, Musk's promotion of Trump and his policies may be turning away some would-be Tesla buyers, experts say. In the second quarter, Tesla's vehicle sales slumped almost 5% compared with a year earlier."", '""Musk doubling down on the Trump support is clearly not a huge positive relative to Tesla sales,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CBS News. ""It\'s on the edges, but it\'s definitely had an impact.""', ""That's because the biggest pool of potential electric-vehicle buyers are Democrats, with almost half saying they're likely to buy an EV, Pew Research data shows. But only about 1 in 10 Republicans view themselves as likely to shell out for an EV. "", ""And Tesla, one of the few EV choices when it started production in 2008, now has plenty of competition from major automakers such as Ford, Chevrolet and Volkswagen. That's giving people who are uncomfortable with Musk's politics but who want a green vehicle the option to shop elsewhere."", ""Musk may have been pushed toward Trump partly because of the Biden administration's snub of Tesla vehicles when it first rolled out its EV tax incentives. Its popular Model Y qualified for the $7,500 tax credit last year after the IRS broadened its vehicle classifications."", '""The Biden administration basically has viewed Musk as not relevant — he\'s been left out of the conversation,"" Ives added. ', ""In 2023, Musk cut a deal with the White House to open Tesla vehicle charges to other automakers, in exchange for being able to access federal funds. Tesla won $17 million in EV charging grants from the bipartisan infrastructure law Mr. Biden frequently touts. But earlier this year, Musk fired his Supercharger team, upending and undermining the company's charging strategy."", 'Tesla investors are concerned about Musk\'s political involvement because they\'d like to see him more focused on his businesses, Ives said. Trump told the Economic Club of New York in a recent speech that he plans to appoint Musk to lead a new government efficiency commission that would audit the ""entire"" federal government. Ives has doubts about how feasible this would be.""Unless he recreates an AI version of himself, I don\'t see how it\'s done,"" Ives said of Musk\'s ability to take a government job on top of his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX and X, as well as roles in other businesses such as Neuralink and The Boring Company. ', ""Ives was also suggesting that placing Musk in a government role could pose serious conflicts of interest, given Musk's vast business empire."", ""Trump, who cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from the prior 35% through his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, is now vowing to reduce the rate to 15% — potentially benefiting Musk's business empire. Changing the tax code would require congressional approval, however. "", 'Trump has taken on transgender issues as a central theme of his campaign, vowing to withhold federal funding from schools that teach transgender matters, and insisting on keeping the genders assigned at birth separate in sports. ', 'Musk has been vocal about his feelings on transgender matters, too. Reuters reported in 2022 that Musk has donated millions of dollars toward a group that runs ant-trans ads. ', 'Musk has come under fire for calling his child who is transgender ""dead."" Wilson transitioned several years ago, at 16, and has spoken out on social media condemning her father\'s comments and behavior. Musk told far-right online figure Jordan Peterson that Wilson\'s transition made him oppose gender-affirming treatments.

In sum, it is just hard to definitively know what is happening on X."", '""Is there more of it now or less of it now? These questions are just hard to quantify on Musk\'s Twitter,"" Berlin said.', ""And not everybody sees the same thing on X; the mix of posts a person encounters is based on their own past interactions with the site.

Those kinds of actions, Berlin said, are likely to result in the user seeing even more of that type of content, be it pro-Trump posts or anything else."", '""This is how Twitter has always worked: The longer you linger on it because you\'re curious about what you\'re seeing, the more the algorithm will think you want more of it,"" he said.', 'Musk is increasingly using his own feed on X as a megaphone for his political views.

Elon Musk’s $100 Million-Plus Gift to Trump,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/10/elon-musks-100-million-plus-gift-to-trump/,"['Mother Jones illustration; Evan Vucci/AP', '', 'Billionaire-troll Elon Musk is dumping untold millions of his $240 billion fortune into helping Donald Trump regain the White House. In the final sprint of the campaign, he’s doling out (perhaps illegally) $1 million checks to registered voters in swing states who have signed a petition sponsored by America PAC, which he created and funded with at least $75 million. It’s possible he’s contributed additional millions through untraceable donations to pro-Trump dark money groups (which he has done in the past). And there’s another way Musk is boosting Trump: He’s essentially providing him tens of millions of dollars’ worth of social media posts for free.', 'Every day, Musk, who tweets and retweets dozens of posts on X, the social media site he bought two years ago for $44 billion. (It’s now estimated to be worth $9.4 billion). In recent weeks, many of his X posts have been about the 2024 election and have avidly promoted pro-Trump messages. With Musk’s 202 million followers (more than twice the number of Trump’s followers on X) and with an algorithm Musk asked to be rigged to boost his own tweets, these posts have racked up a large number of impressions—the number of times a tweet is seen by a user on the platform. Each of his posts can draw tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, or tens of millions impressions. That’s a lot of reach.', 'I examined Musk’s timeline for several days this month (October 19, 21, and 22) and focused on tweets that explicitly advocated the election of Trump or that advanced pro-Trump themes—and that each drew at least 1 million impressions. These were posts that could have served as Trump campaign ads. This group totaled 54 tweets.', 'The posts in this subset covered various aspects of the election. Musk reposted a tweet that declared that if the Democrats win in 2024, there will be no “meaningful elections in the future” (17 million impressions). Another featured video of him saying the media was manipulating the government to help the Biden-Harris administration (23 million impressions). In one, Musk called for people to put up Trump yard signs and wear MAGA merchandise (38 million impressions). He retweeted former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard proclaiming a Kamala Harris victory will be “the end of democracy in the United States” (53 million impressions). One post exclaimed, “Kamala hates Christians” and amplified the baseless claim that she had disparaged rally attendees because these disrupters shouted “Jesus is Lord” (43 million impressions). Another featured video of Musk at one of his pro-Trump events in Pennsylvania (28 million impressions). A post spread the false assertion that Michigan had more registered voters than eligible voters (32 million impressions). In another, Musk shared a meme stating that the Republican platform included multiple issues—such as free enterprise, secure borders, honest elections, real journalism, and moral standards—and the Democratic platform had only one: “Hate Trump” (79 million impressions).', 'One popular Musk post featured an AI image of Donald Trump as a beefed-up Pittsburgh Steeler (83 million impressions). He retweeted a meme showing a Venn diagram for “[Jeffrey] Epstein’s Guest List” and “Diddy Guest List,” with the overlap labelled as “All the celebrities coming out to support Kamala Harris” (97 million impressions). He put up a photo of him, Trump, and a Tesla race car (75 million). He boosted a post with a chart predicting a Trump win (65 million impressions). In one post, Musk urged people to vote early (25 million impressions). He retweeted a post that assailed Minnesota governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz (18 million impressions) and one claiming the Democratic criticisms of Trump are “all basically lies” (24 million impressions).', 'The 1.2 billion impressions Musk’s posts gathered over those three days were worth about $6 million. Assuming these were normal days for Musk, he’s putting up about $2 million worth of posts a day to help elect Trump.', 'During these days, Musk also posted regularly about about many contentious issues and subjects—government spending and regulation, abortion, woke-ism, censorship, the media, vaccine skepticism, and transgenderism—in a manner that would bolster the case for Trump. As Bloomberg reported recently, Musk is now X’s “biggest promoter of anti-immigrant conspiracy theories” and “debunked theories of undocumented voters swaying the US election.”', 'What might be the financial value of all Musk’s tweeting for Trump?', 'Let’s start with the impressions Musk received for his posts. The 54 election-related tweets that each collected over a million impressions during these three days—and there were many other posts concerning the election that drew fewer impressions—totaled 1.273 billion impressions.', 'How much would it cost someone to obtain so many impressions? There are two ways for an X user to buy impressions. You can purchase ads or you can pay X to promote a post.', 'Ad rates may vary, depending on the customer and the nature and size of the advertising campaign. But there is a good point of comparison, and it involves Musk’s own PAC.', 'From early July through October 1, America PAC purchased 59 ads on X targeting swing states for more than $166,000, according to the social media platform’s political ad disclosure data. These ads yielded 32,058,424 impressions. Based on these figures, one can calculate that it costs about $5,000 to score a million impressions with a political ad. (Impressions will also be affected by how many users repost or engage with them.) This, of course, is a rough estimate. It’s possible that Musk’s super PAC got a family-and-friends discount or, on the other hand, that X charged it top dollar in order to transfer funds into the financially-challenged company.', 'There’s another way to calculate the cost of a million impressions. X offers users the opportunity to boost the reach of an individual post. You may have seen the “Promote” button that is attached to some tweets. When I recently clicked on it, I was informed that for $5,000 that particular post—which had political content—could be zapped to between 55,000 to 1.3 million people over the course of one day. That’s quite a spread, and the fine print read, “Estimated reach is approximate. Actual reach can’t be guaranteed.” But it seems that if I wanted to come close to placing my tweet in front of a million pairs of eyeballs, I’d have to part with $5,000. (Per the caveat, I might end up with far less.)', 'With these two calculations, it appears X views the monetary value of 1 million impressions as about five thousand smackers. X, which no longer responds to requests from journalists, did not reply to an email inquiring about this and Musk’s posts.', 'If that figure is approximately correct, the 1.2 billion impressions Musk’s posts gathered over those three days were worth about $6 million. Assuming these were normal days for Musk the tweeting-maniac, he’s putting up about $2 million worth of posts a day to help elect Trump. (That number would be much higher if you factored in the posts on the election that didn’t exceed a million impressions and the posts related to issues that are a boon for Trump.) Add this up over the entire election—Musk endorsed Trump in July—and the value of Musk’s pro-Trump tweets could top $100 million. It might even reach double that and approach a quarter of a billion dollars.', 'Media tycoons have always been able to assist their preferred candidates with endorsements and favorable coverage. (See Murdoch, Rupert.) What Musk is doing is of a different nature. He’s posting multiple endorsements a day and promoting disinformation that bolsters Trump on a site that claims to have no editorial or political position. While he once proclaimed Twitter should be politically neutral, his excessive, nonstop rah-rahing for Trump has tilted its playing field. Musk has also permitted prominent extremists, conspiracy theorists, and purveyors of disinformation once bounced from Twitter to return to the site, and this band of posters skews dramatically pro-Trump.', 'Musk’s posts are not technically ads or campaign donations. Nor are the millions of election-related posts tweeted by X’s users (myself included), which depending on their salience or creativity, might garner many impressions. And neither are the commentaries of cable news hosts or newspaper columnists who may favor or oppose a particular candidate. But Musk’s relentless posting for Trump—amplified by the algorithm of the platform he controls—functions as an ad campaign. In a way, he has turned X into his personal plaything, and he has been using it to influence the presidential race to benefit Trump, who has vowed to put Musk in charge of government cost-cutting and regulatory review if he wins the White House. This is oligarchy in action.', 'Musk is a fortunate fellow. He has the bucks that have allowed him to become one of the biggest donors of the 2024 campaign. The money he has poured into America PAC is financing what are supposed to be extensive get-out-the-vote operations for Trump in swing states. And there’s no telling whether Musk—a major government contractor who yearns for a federal government that will eviscerate regulations that affect his companies—is also slipping big amounts of dark money to other pro-Trump endeavors. Meanwhile, Musk is acting like Trump’s running-mate, leaping about at rallies and holding his own campaign events, as if he were on the ticket. He has broken new ground in American politics, for he has shown us what it might be like for a political candidate (or the backer of one) to control an entire social media platform. (Trump, with his flailing Truth Social site, doesn’t count.) In doing so, Musk has supplied Trump tens of millions of dollars—maybe much more—in free messaging. It might well be one of the biggest gifts in the history of US politics. Or is it more of a payment for future services?', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

He lambasted President Joe Biden’s administration and its handling of the immigration crisis and the southern U.S. border, and cast himself as a defender of the Constitution.', 'The visit was the first in a series of town halls Musk is holding across Pennsylvania through Monday. He’ll have a town hall in Montgomery County on Friday as the focus on the populous collar counties ramps up in the final weeks of the campaign.', 'Late in the presidential campaign season, Musk has emerged as a major backer of Trump’s campaign, donating nearly $75 million to his own America PAC, which fuels Trump voter mobilization efforts.', 'The event had some hometown appeal.', 'Speaking to his personal connection to Pennsylvania, Musk told the audience that he had spent three years in Philadelphia during his time attending the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School in the late 1990s and that he “knew Pennsylvania well.”', '“I lived in the city for three years, I went to school here,” Musk said. “I know the state — I’m not some just-arrived situation.”', 'Delco residents lined up outside Ridley High School hours before Musk’s arrival.', 'As school let out, high school students buzzed about the appearance; outside the entrance, some young male students goaded one another with laughter as they waved Trump-Vance flags.', 'Elizabeth Chartier, 28, a registered Republican who plans to vote for Harris in November but wanted to attend the event to hear Musk firsthand, said she’s not convinced Musk — who has a net worth of nearly $250 billion — will resonate with everyday Pennsylvania voters.', '“I feel like the biggest thing is like the middle class and their woes, and Elon is so far removed from the middle-class experience in life,” said Chartier, of Ridley Park. “I don’t know. Unless he’s got a really good PR team to tell him what things middle-class people want to hear, I still think it’ll come off disingenuous.”', 'Musk later blamed Democratic policies for what he described as Mad Max-style crime in the country’s major cities, and told audience members that their power would be greatly diminished if the government enacted gun-control measures.

"Justice Department warns Elon Musk his $1 million giveaway to swing state voters might violate law, CNN reports",https://www.yahoo.com/news/justice-department-warns-elon-musk-his-1-million-giveaway-to-swing-state-voters-might-violate-law-cnn-reports-195318099.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Elon Musk’s latest effort to get swing state voters to the polls is raising legal questions after he announced this weekend that he plans to give $1 million once a day to a random registered Pennsylvania voter who signs the petition for his political action committee (PAC).', 'CNN reported Wednesday that the Justice Department warned Musk and the America PAC, a political organization founded by Musk to help reelect former President Donald Trump, that his $1 million giveaway could violate federal law against paying people to register to vote. A day after it was reported the Justice Department issued a warning, the PAC awarded $1 million to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin.', 'Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder, announced the prize money at an America PAC event in Harrisburg, Pa., over the weekend. He said the money would be awarded every day “from now until the election” on Nov. 5. Musk even handed a giant check to a petition signer at the event.', 'Musk is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $242 billion. As of this reporting, he has already spent at least $75 million to help reelect Trump. Earlier this month, Musk offered supporters $47 for each registered voter they recruited in seven battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — to sign his petition.', 'Trump, who was campaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, was asked about Musk’s $1 million giveaway and said, “I haven’t followed that,” the Associated Press reported.', 'While Musk and his PAC have not publicly commented on the debate, Musk’s allies have argued that since Musk is not paying for voter registration, but for a petition signature, then it’s not illegal, according to the New York Times. But some legal experts suggest that Musk’s latest stunt is pushing the boundaries of election law.', 'As defined by the Federal Election Commission, PACs are tax-exempt committees that may receive unlimited finance contributions that go toward financing political activity, like campaigns. Super-PACs can also accept money from corporations and other entities that are usually barred from donating directly to candidates.', 'America PAC is categorized as a super-PAC, which means it can also get donations from other PACs.', 'Musk’s PAC aims to get signatures on a petition supporting the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms.', 'America PAC’s website also mentions supporting the “values” of secure borders, sensible spending, safe cities and a fair justice system. The supporting evidence for why each value is a priority is links to X posts — including some from Musk himself.', ""“One of the challenges we’re having is how do we get people to know about this petition,” Musk said at the town hall on Oct. 19. “The legacy media won't report on it; not everyone’s on X. So, I figure, how do we get people to know about it? This news, I think, is really gonna fly.”"", 'In a post on X, which Musk owns, he wrote, “The goal of the $1M/day prize is to maximize awareness of our petition to support The Constitution.”', 'As of Oct. 21, two people from Pennsylvania have won $1 million from the America PAC, according to the petition site. The America PAC filed its first mandatory contribution financial report in early October, The Hill reported, and is expected to file its second on Oct. 24.', 'Musk has not commented publicly on the debate over whether his PAC’s incentive campaign is legal or not. During an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called Musk’s efforts “deeply concerning” and “something that law enforcement could take a look at.” Musk simply responded with, “Concerning that he would say such a thing.”', 'A source familiar with the PAC’s effort told The Hill that they believe the PAC is in “full compliance with the law.”', 'Initially, Musk’s $47-per-referral proposal was within legal bounds because it’s not illegal to pay voters to sign a petition or to pay people persuading others to sign, campaign finance lawyer Brendan Fischer told the New York Times. But this new version, which requires eligible winners to be registered to vote, comes “much closer to the legal line,” Fischer said in a second interview.', '“There would be few doubts about the legality if every Pennsylvania-based petition signer were eligible, but conditioning payments on registration arguably violates the law,” Fischer said.', '“Though maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,” Rick Hasen, a professor of political science at UCLA School of Law, said in a blog post.', 'Hasen refers to subsections in Title 52 of the United States Code, an official list of federal statutes, published by the U.S. House of Representatives Office. He emphasizes a section that reads, “Whoever knowingly or willfully … pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both…”', 'In his blog post, Hasen also points out that the Department of Justice Election Crimes Manual states that it’s a violation to “bribe” with “anything having monetary value, including cash, liquor [and] lottery chances” — anything to “induce” people to vote. Any monetary benefits that violate the law “must have been intended to induce or reward the voter for engaging in one or more acts necessary to cast a ballot.”', 'Musk isn’t directly paying these residents to vote, but because the PAC’s prerequisite for winners is to be registered voters within specific states, and it’s happening so close to Election Day, it’s hard to argue that this isn’t financially incentivizing people to register to vote, Michael Kang, an election law professor at Northwestern’s School of Law, told CBS News.', ""In a social media post on Sunday night, America PAC reworked the language of the giveaway to state the winners would be an official “spokesperson” affiliated with the PAC. It's not clear whether the Justice Department's letter to the PAC was responsible for the change."", 'In terms of whether there can be this level of coordination between campaigns and super-PACs, that was illegal up until recently. Super-PACs, which were created in 2011, were required under campaign finance laws to operate independently from the candidates and their campaigns. However, in August, the FEC got rid of its anti-corruption law that prevents super PACs from coordinating with the political candidates they support.']"
Could Elon Musk face legal trouble for his $1 million lottery?

Critics said the giveaway could be illegal.', 'To qualify for the lottery, petition signers must be registered to vote in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, the seven states widely acknowledged as battlegrounds in the 2024 presidential election. Musk’s America political action committee said it had already given out the first two $1 million checks, to Republican voters who had already cast their ballots by mail, media outlets reported.', 'WATCH: What’s behind Elon Musk’s massive effort to elect Trump', '“I think it’s something that law enforcement could take a look at,” Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, said Oct. 20 on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”', 'Some election law experts, including Richard Hasen of University of California, Los Angeles, said Musk’s gambit could run afoul of 52 U.S.C. 10307(c), a federal law that says whoever “pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”', 'The Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that advocates for voting rights and campaign finance oversight, released a statement, saying, “It is illegal to buy votes, it is illegal to buy voter registration, and the Department of Justice has the power to enforce these important laws through civil or criminal action.”', 'Although the Justice Department has the power to bring a criminal case, legal experts told PolitiFact it’s highly unlikely Musk would be prosecuted, and certainly not before Election Day 2024.', 'The law’s enforcement could fall either to the Federal Election Commission or the Justice Department.', 'The FEC “can review whether there is a civil or criminal violation,” said Jerry H. Goldfeder, senior counsel with the law firm Cozen O’Connor. “Such a matter usually takes months and months, starting with an internal decision to open the matter, and then presenting Musk with an opportunity to respond.”', 'And that’s a best-case scenario for timing. In reality, FEC enforcement has been hobbled for years because its members are split between political parties, making it hard to reach the majority required to pursue enforcement.', 'The Justice Department could act before waiting for an FEC referral, but this poses prosecution challenges, too, experts said. Deciding whether to launch a Justice Department prosecution is a slow process, Goldfeder said.', 'And Musk’s case would be unusual, without a track record of successful, similar prosecutions or a playbook for how to mount them.', 'History suggests that a case such as this would have a low likelihood of prosecution, said Stanley Brand, a longtime Washington, D.C., attorney in political cases who currently serves as distinguished fellow at Penn State Law.', 'Most of the relevant statutes are misdemeanors with light sentences and fines, Brand said. “The significant resources needed to bring such cases and their minimal deterrent effect has often dissuaded the (Justice) Department from using them.”', 'If the Justice Department did decide to prosecute, Brand said, it would more likely build a felony case using the law on mail, wire and “honest services fraud.” However, the U.S. Supreme Court has in recent years repeatedly rejected the government’s use of these statutes in public corruption cases, raising the bar for a decision to prosecute.', 'In several cases involving political figures, including former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, the Supreme Court justices have characterized the activity in question “as conduct that is corrupt, tawdry and deceitful but outside the reach of criminal law,” Brand said.', 'Citing the pushback Special Counsel Jack Smith has faced in attempting to quickly bring cases to trial against former President Donald Trump, Brand said he doubts a prosecution of Musk “would pay a high percentage return to engage.”', 'Finally, prosecuting Musk would only be possible if Kamala Harris wins the presidential election and the attorney general she appoints decides to pursue it. If Trump wins, he almost certainly would appoint someone who wouldn’t bring the case against one of his closest allies.', 'Left: Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk, who supports Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, gestures as he speaks about voting during an America PAC Town Hall in Folsom, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 17, 2024.

We speak to Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Eric Lipton, whose new investigation at The New York Times looks at Musk’s multibillion-dollar contracts with the federal government and the many regulatory investigations his businesses are currently being subject to, both of which may be at stake with the results of the upcoming election.', 'AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.', 'With the presidential election just two weeks away, we look at the richest man in the world, one of Donald Trump’s biggest financial backers, tech billionaire Elon Musk. He has poured an additional $75 million into his pro-Trump super PAC. And at a campaign town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Saturday, Musk pledged to give away $1 million to voters who sign his super PAC online petition in battleground states. He pledged to give this every day, $1 million away, until Election Day.', 'ELON MUSK: I have a surprise for you, which is that we are going to be awarding a million dollars to — randomly, to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election.', 'AMY GOODMAN: To be eligible for the $1 million, petition signers must be registered to vote and live in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. Many say this is illegal. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was asked if Musk’s sweepstakes was legal during an interview with Meet the Press Sunday.', 'GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO: I think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians. That is deeply concerning. … I think it’s something that law enforcement could take a look at. I’m not the attorney general anymore of Pennsylvania; I’m the governor. But it does raise some serious questions.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, a new investigation by The New York Times looks at Musk’s influence over the federal government, with two of his companies, SpaceX and Tesla, accounting for at least $15.4 billion in government contracts over the past decade.', 'For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we’re joined by Eric Lipton, who co-authored the Times investigation headlined “U.S. Agencies Fund, and Fight With, Elon Musk. A Trump Presidency Could Give Him Power Over Them.”', 'We welcome you to Democracy Now! Can you start off by responding to this promise that Elon Musk has made, a million dollars a day to voters in battleground states who sign his super PAC petition, Eric?', 'ERIC LIPTON: I don’t really know the legality of that proposal. I suspect — I have to imagine that there lawyers that examined that before he made that proposal and that promise. But, you know, the fact of the matter is that’s a trivial amount of money for Elon Musk. He’s the richest person in the world. He’s presumably the richest person in the history of the world. So, that’s a pretty small amount to invest in this, in the final days of this election campaign. And he has, you know, literally billions of dollars at stake of his own business operations, both in terms of contracts that he has with the federal government and millions of dollars at stake in terms of the many investigations that are ongoing of his company. So, that’s kind of like pocket change — ', 'AMY GOODMAN: Right.', 'ERIC LIPTON: — relatively speaking, for him.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Well, of course, the significance is, it may be trivial for him, but for people who would receive it, that’s the question. Is it a payoff?', 'ERIC LIPTON: Right.', 'AMY GOODMAN: But, Eric —', 'ERIC LIPTON: Right, and I can’t — I can’t address the legality of that. That’s up to lawyers and regulators to address.', 'AMY GOODMAN: So, talk about this piece that you’ve just done. You’re a winner of the Pulitzer Prize. This investigative report is quite remarkable. Lay out his empire and the — but, most importantly, also, the contracts he gets from the U.S. government, and what a Trump presidency — he’s, of course, supporting Trump big time — would mean for him.', 'ERIC LIPTON: I don’t think that it’s reasonable to presume that he would get necessarily more contracting dollars if Trump were president. He is already incredibly popular because of SpaceX almost exclusively, really, the bulk of it. And it’s because his business has been so successful at transforming access to orbit and also communications in orbit. And so, both with NASA and the Department of Defense, they’re spending billions of dollars to buy services from him, because he’s delivering things that other companies aren’t delivering. So, on that side of the ledger, you know, I think he’s going to continue to see an increase in business with the federal government because of the services that SpaceX is providing.', 'But the real question is on the investigative side, because Elon Musk is so determined to get things done, and, ultimately, his real goal is to get humans to Mars, that he often likes to kind of, you know, cut corners when it comes to regulations. He wants to bulldoze his way through. And so, he has an incredible array of disagreements with federal agencies that oversee his operations, both from Tesla and from SpaceX. And so, it’s really all — you could go through the acronym soup of the United States government, and just about every major agency has some pending investigation, in many cases involving repeat offenses and multiple fines or ongoing investigations.', 'And so, the thing that is most, potentially, problematic is if he is in fact going to be appointed by Trump to be the head of some efficiency committee that’s going to examine federal regulators and the powers that they have and also examine their budgets. How is it possible that he could be simultaneously the subject of multiple investigations, the recipient of billions of dollars in contract, and the guy that’s going to be deciding how to curb regulatory powers and how to reduce the expenditures for these agencies? It’s just way too many roles that creates obvious potential or real conflicts of interest.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you — last year alone, Elon Musk’s company secured $3 billion in contracts from 17 federal agencies. Do you think we’re talking about, to say the least, an overdependence on Musk’s companies, which are private companies? And talk more about, you know, Tesla, about SpaceX, and how it’s intertwined with the government.', 'ERIC LIPTON: Yeah, the bulk of that money really is going to SpaceX. There’s a relatively small amount that goes to Tesla. And most of that money, the biggest chunk of it, it goes for launch. And the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, the two reliable rockets that Elon Musk and SpaceX have, are just the workhorses both for NASA and for the Department of Defense and for the intelligence community. And, you know, it’s a combination of factors, that he has been so successful in designing and engineering design on his rockets and the reusability of parts of it that no one else can really match him. And, you know, Lockheed and Boeing, and they have a consortium that’s called United Launch Alliance, that’s really struggled to get a new rocket going, still is not ready for national security launches.', 'So, the Department of Defense, in particular, is really reliant upon SpaceX. And I’ve written about this separately in another story earlier this year, just how completely dependent the United States currently is on him. And, I mean, it’s partially — it’s not as if they’re giving him contracts because of who he is; they’re giving him contracts because he can reliably get the NASA satellites and Defense Department and intelligence satellites into space.', 'AMY GOODMAN: So, if you could talk about, for example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opening five investigations into Tesla safety issues, and also Tesla’s ongoing legal battles with the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, including cases where the company tried to block rulings punishing Musk for anti-union tweets?', 'ERIC LIPTON: Right. I mean, there are so many of these investigations, I have a little cheat sheet that I kind of built as I was kind of scouring the reach of the federal government to look at all the dockets and pull together information about each of these.', 'But, yes, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has five different ongoing active investigations relating to things like unintended acceleration, steering wheel detachment, steering loss, and, of course, most popularly, the self-driving and the fatal accident involving self-driving. And so, that’s just at one division of the U.S. Department of Transportation.', 'Over next door at the FAA, they recently fined SpaceX about $600,000 based on their conclusion that SpaceX had improperly conducted two launches last year out of Florida that were not compliant with safety requirements. So, that’s two divisions of DOT.', 'There’s also a — the transportation also was investigating — this is the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, another division of transportation — so now it’s the three different agencies in the one Cabinet department — fined Neuralink, which is building implants into brains to help people who are either disabled to see again or maybe to walk again, but Neuralink was shipping hazardous materials without a hazardous materials permit. So, that was another investigation and fine.', 'So, I mean, that’s just one federal agency, but it goes on and on. There’s over a dozen.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Eric —', 'ERIC LIPTON: The Department of Justice is investigating — ', 'AMY GOODMAN: — we’re going to have to leave it there, but I want to thank you —', 'ERIC LIPTON: OK.', 'AMY GOODMAN: — for being with us.

That’s a distinction that legal experts have said is important, because it’s illegal under federal law to pay people to register to vote.

Musk has given nearly $75 million to the super PAC while campaigning in person for Trump in Pennsylvania and using his platform on X to do the same.', 'He said at one point Friday that he was trying to be the “anti-Soros,” a reference to financier George Soros’ support for progressive causes. Taking questions on a variety of subjects, he called for cutting government programs and reducing immigration.

He ""is a once-in-a-generation industry leader, and our broken federal bureaucracy could certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency,"" Trump told Newsweek.', 'But this mutual respect and admiration has not always prevailed. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk endorsed Trump as his choice for the next U.S. president as late as July 13. The former Democrat switched sides, pouring millions into his pro-Trump committee America PAC.', 'As recently as 2022, Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, that he had ""strongly supported Obama for President"" in 2007, having donated thousands of dollars to both Obama and fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that year. Additional donations to Clinton came during her 2015 campaign, and Musk criticized Trump\'s character in a 2016 interview with CNBC.', 'Having said he voted for Biden in 2020, his donations since have been to Republican organizations; although Musk said in 2021 that he ""would prefer to stay out of politics.""', 'Musk\'s more vocal support for a Republican agenda seems to have surfaced around the same time as his Twitter takeover in November 2022, posting on November 7: ""I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic.""', 'Before his official endorsement of Trump in July, Musk\'s support for the Republican presidential nominee began to publicly surface on X in March, 2024, when he referred to Trump\'s critics as having ""Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS)"".', 'So, why has Musk thrown so much money and effort behind a potential Trump presidency? From similar approaches to deregulation to aligning views on gender ideology and transgender rights, the Tesla CEO may feel his multi-billion investment on supporting a Trump win in November will pay off.', 'Newsweek reached out to Elon Musk via email for comment. Comments will be included as soon as there are any updates.', ""Elon Musk's support for Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election appears closely tied to his desire for significant government deregulation, particularly in the realm of space exploration. Musk has on several occasions argued that excessive regulations hinder innovation and impede what he sees as progress toward becoming a multiplanetary species—a central goal of his company, SpaceX."", 'In a series of posts on X, Musk has expressed his concerns about the impact of overregulation on America\'s future in space. ""Voting for Trump is voting for Mars! Unless we stop the slow strangulation by overregulation happening in America, we will never become a multiplanetary civilization,"" he said.', ""Musk's posts on this issue seem to stem from regulatory obstacles SpaceX has encountered in the past. These include delays in launch approvals and restrictions imposed by various federal agencies."", 'He believes that many of these regulations are outdated or unnecessarily burdensome, slowing down innovation within his companies and elsewhere. ""Unless there is significant government reform, laws & regulations will keep getting worse every year until every great endeavor, from high-speed rail between our cities to making life multiplanetary, is effectively illegal,"" Musk claimed.', ""Trump's platform of reducing government oversight appears to align with Musk's vision."", 'Musk has proposed the creation of a ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" or DOGE (a joking reference to Dogecoin, which Musk supports). Musk suggested such a department would audit federal agencies to identify and eliminate redundant regulations. Musk\'s potential role in this initiative could provide him with the influence to reshape regulatory frameworks that currently affect SpaceX.', '""With Trump in office, Musk may expect a more favorable regulatory environment for his ventures, including Tesla and SpaceX. Like many Silicon Valley billionaires, Musk resists any limitations on what he perceives as his personal freedom,"" Dr. Michael Breen, associate professor at the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University, Ireland, told Newsweek.', 'The alignment between Musk\'s ambitions and Trump\'s policy proposals is further highlighted by Trump\'s suggestion to appoint Musk as the ""secretary of cost-cutting."" ""He\'s dying to do this,"" Trump said during a recent Fox News appearance.', 'Such a role could make Musk eligible for a special tax benefit worth tens of billions of dollars. According to a report by Rolling Stone, a provision buried in the tax code could allow Musk to reap one of the largest personalized tax breaks in American history if Trump wins the 2024 election and appoints Musk to this proposed government post.', 'According to tax and ethics experts who spoke to the outlet, a little-known provision in the tax code could allow Musk to indefinitely defer capital gains taxes on any assets he would need to divest to comply with government ethics rules.', 'This special tax benefit, available only to federal officials, would come in addition to significant tax breaks Musk could gain if a new Trump administration further reduces income and other taxes for billionaires.', ""So Musk, currently the world's wealthiest person with a net worth of $243.4 billion, could potentially be worth billions more if he were to take a government position in a Trump administration."", ""Democratic candidate Kamala Harris might not suit Musk as much. During her 2019 presidential campaign, Harris advocated for raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 35 percent. While Harris supported President Biden's more moderate proposal for a 28 percent rate, she pushed for a steeper increase."", 'Later, when accepting the Democratic nomination for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Harris pledged to deliver tax relief to middle class Americans, promising her tax cut would help ""more than 100 million Americans.""', 'Newsweek reached out to Kamala Harris via email for comment.', 'Musk has a personal connection to transgender issues through his estranged daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson.', 'In an interview with NBC News in July 2024, Wilson said that Musk was largely absent from her childhood and would berate her for displaying feminine traits. According to Wilson, on one occasion Musk ""was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high.""', 'Musk has spoken about his daughter, deadnaming her, or calling her by her birthname instead of preferred name. In a July 2022 interview with conservative media commentator Jordan Peterson, Musk claimed his daughter was ""killed"" by what he termed the ""woke mind virus,"" vowing to ""destroy"" it.', 'Breen said: ""It\'s not just about business—Musk\'s political views also play a role [in his support for Trump]. He\'s been vocal in his opposition to what he sees as government overreach, particularly around censorship and gender identity laws.""', ""Trump has pledged to reverse the Biden administration's Title IX expansion that protects transgender students' rights to use bathrooms, locker rooms, and pronouns matching their gender identity."", 'In January 2024, he announced plans to push for a federal ban on gender-affirming care for minors and proposed restricting doctors who provide such care from Medicare and Medicaid participation.', 'This contrasts with Harris\' view on access to the care that it is ""a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary.""', 'Musk consistently uses his platform on X to criticize transgender rights. He has called gender-affirming care for minors ""pure evil""; said that ""sex/gender is literally true down to the bone""; argued that young children ""cannot understand the concept of \'gender\', and rolled back X\'s protections for transgender users after acquiring the platform.', 'His stance, aligning with Trump\'s position, comes despite his daughter\'s testimony that gender-affirming care was ""lifesaving"" in her case.', 'Wilson directly contradicted Musk\'s claim that he was ""tricked"" into authorizing her treatment, saying to NBC News: ""He was not by any means tricked. He knew the full side effects.""', 'Since acquiring Twitter (now X) in 2022, Musk has positioned himself as a ""free speech absolutist"" and has made significant changes to the platform\'s content moderation policies.', ""Musk rolled back the app's protections for various groups and eliminated much of the platform's trust and safety teams. This has led to what critics describe as an increase in hate speech and unchecked misinformation on the platform."", 'Musk has also tied in his views on free speech with America PAC. The pro-Trump political action group has been promoting a petition that pledges support for the First and Second Amendments.', 'The petition is targeted exclusively at registered voters in seven swing states: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, and the PAC is running a daily $1 million prize for one lucky petition signer, running from October 19 until Election Day.', 'During his presidency, Donald Trump frequently criticized what he viewed as censorship (particularly of conservative content) by social media companies and mainstream media outlets. This culminated in his executive order in May 2020 that sought to limit Section 230 protections for social media companies.', ""After being banned from X (then Twitter) following January 6, 2021, Trump launched his own social media platform, Truth Social, where he recently shared another user's crude suggestions about Harris. Trump was reinstated on X by Musk in 2023."", 'Most recently, Trump has been claiming that Google is censoring ""good stories"" about him, only showing results for ""bad stories.""', '""Both Trump and Musk use outrage to juice engagement, both lean into conspiracy lies, both use communication as a way of gaining and keeping power, neither are concerned with the ethics of responsible communication,"" Dr. Jennifer R. Mercieca, professor at the Department of Communication & Journalism at Texas A & M University, told Newsweek.', '""There\'s a clear business rationale behind Musk\'s support of Trump. His media company thrives on the attention and engagement that polarizing figures like Trump generate,"" added Breen.', ""As the world's richest person, and in control of a popular social media platform, Musk arguably has the financial means and reach to fund and spread whatever message he chooses. This power may be a driving factor in throwing weight behind a presidential candidate."", '""On the margins, Musk\'s belief in free speech, more stringent border controls, decreased economic regulation, and less progressive stance on trans issues may all factor into his decision to support Trump,"" Dr Thomas Gift, Associate Professor in Political Science and founding Director of the Centre on U.S. Politics (CUSP) at University College London, told Newsweek.', '""Yet while it may not be the most satisfying answer, why Musk is willing to invest so much money and energy into a Trump win may simply boil down to \'because he can.\' Musk clearly revels in being a contrarian, and nothing is more contrarian in elite circles than going full-on MAGA,"" he added.', '', 'Marie Boran is a Newsweek reporter based in Carlow, Ireland.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Musk’s political ambitions, explained.', 'by Lavanya Ramanathan and Whizy Kim', 'It’s not an overstatement to say that Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is former President Donald Trump’s biggest fanboy — and patron — in the 2024 election.', 'He’s literally, and comically, leaping at Trump’s side at rallies. He’s tweeting (including, frequently, dog whistles and misinformation). And to the dismay of some, he has let Trump tweet, too.', 'In the spring, Musk launched a political action committee, simply called America, lined up other high-profile rich guys from his Rolodex, and then threw an additional $75 million of his own money into the pot. According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, America PAC has spent more than $100 million on getting Trump re-elected, sending hundreds of canvassers out to talk to voters one-on-one in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.', 'And of course, this week, Musk pledged to give away a million dollars a day until the election to registered swing-state voters who signed his PAC’s petition, only to reportedly receive a letter from the Department of Justice warning that the contest could be in violation of federal voting law.', 'Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Sign up here.', 'As Musk’s politics move ever rightward — or at least, as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp writes, toward “a specific type of edgelord bigotry that drifts frequently into debunked conspiracy theories” — it’s worth asking what he wants to get out of the whole deal. An appointment to some unnamed new “government efficiency” commission? Untold power over the agencies that seek to regulate his companies? Or, improbably, a tax break?', 'What does loyalty to Trump net him — or anyone else courting the former president’s favor — in the end?\nI spoke with Vox senior reporter Whizy Kim, who has been reporting on Musk, his fans, lawsuits, and even his text messages since the months leading to his 2022 purchase of Twitter, to try to understand where Elon Musk the man, the media mogul, and the politically ambitious demagogue intersect. What does Musk really want? And if he gets it, what will it mean for the rest of us? (Our conversation has been condensed for length and lightly edited.)', 'Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day.', 'Lavanya Ramanathan: When you look back on the moment Elon Musk bought Twitter, and now consider it in the current context of how he’s now trying to invest heavily in politics, do you see parallels there?', 'Whizy Kim: I don’t think it is at all an accident that Elon Musk decided to buy Twitter, and then slowly became more politically vocal. He has a huge megaphone now. He’s the owner of a site that a lot of people still use, especially for stuff that’s related to the news. So I do think that there is a direct connection between him first talking about how Twitter should be this public “town square” where everyone can have their beliefs heard, where free speech is respected, to today, where he has reinstated a lot of banned accounts, including Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and other incendiary figures. There’s also much more right-wing content that you see on the site if you visit X today compared to a few years ago.', 'There’s been a big transformation in the way Americans perceive Elon Musk since then. Besides the fact that the value of Twitter has tanked and the number of users has declined, you’ve written about his fanboys, the people that really looked up him — predominantly young men. Is he still really influential with this set?', 'In the past, he was definitely seen as more of a liberal hero. Not that he was always supporting Democratic candidates and politicians, but he was a guy who had popularized electric vehicles. When I talked to his former fans for a piece, a lot of them talked about how they were drawn to his passion for climate change and the environment. He cared about the future of humanity. And they saw him as very much like a mythic heroic figure, kind of a Tony Stark. They admired how much he seemed to be in service of civilization, not just with Tesla, but even with SpaceX, and wanting to further humanity’s mission beyond Earth.\n\nAnd then the more he talked on Twitter, especially about his political views, they realized he could be very volatile. He could really lash out at anyone who criticized him. Several people told me that doesn’t seem befitting of a CEO of several major companies, acting childishly and immaturely in reaction to someone maybe making a good point.', 'I hear a lot of similarities between him and Donald Trump there. What do these two men have in common?', 'Personality-wise, and just in terms of their worldview, what I really noticed from the X conversation that they had in August was that they both come from a place of feeling personally aggrieved. Trump at many points talked about how his opponents had engaged unfairly against him, all of these criminal court cases against him, these trials, because they don’t want him to win the election. They’ve both frequently been critics of the media. Elon Musk has also talked about how legacy media is really biased and doesn’t platform the truth. They could sort of look at each other and say, “Yeah, you get me. We’ve both been unfairly attacked.”', 'And what is their end game here? What does Elon Musk stand to gain from an association with Trump, and now a financial stake in Trump’s victory?', 'Under the Biden administration, Elon Musk felt that a lot of these regulatory agencies are staffed with people who are keeping a close eye over corporate misbehavior. His companies have been investigated or fined by different government agencies, whether it’s the Labor Board, OSHA, the SEC, or the Department of Transportation, and Elon Musk sees this as unfair. Even if he acknowledges that his companies didn’t follow safety regulations, he’ll be like, well, those safety measures are stupid, anyway. I think I know best. I run my company. I am an expert in these fields. The government is just clunky and slowing us down.', 'One of the things that he proposed during the Trump interview was some sort of government efficiency commission. And Trump was kind of like, oh, yeah, that’s a good idea … and maybe you can help run it. Essentially, that kind of commission would slash the budgets of a lot of regulatory agencies.', 'Trump and Musk are sort of framing that as creating a government that’s more sensible and efficient about the budget, but really, it could also potentially serve as a way to flush the budgets of agencies that have been coming after his companies. If he has Trump’s ear, you know, he could say, “Well, maybe if you want to appoint a new person to the Labor Board, it should be someone more friendly to businesses, rather than to workers.” That’s a potential kind of alliance that they could form.', 'We know that billionaires, that Silicon Valley, are oftentimes more secretive about their involvement in politics. What Elon Musk has been doing is really shining a light on big business billionaire donors and the way they operate in the political sphere, so it’s easier to see. Where does this end for Musk, if Trump wins, or if Trump doesn’t win?', 'I do think that he will continue to be more politically vocal, because he’s opened up a can of worms. It’s harder to go back when there’s a long record of him coming out for a Trump crowd, officially endorsing him, and all of that.', 'Elon Musk is the evolution of what started from Peter Thiel. When Thiel first came out as this mega-conservative donor, people were like, wow, he’s so open and vocal in a world that tends to be more liberal. Now, we have Elon Musk, we have David Sacks, all these other Silicon Valley figures who are trying to elect Trump.', 'But obviously, one of the reasons why these wealthy, influential figures try to stay quiet is because they want to play both sides, right? Elon Musk has come out so vociferously as pro-Trump and criticizing Biden and criticizing Kamala Harris. If Kamala Harris wins, is there room for Elon to come back and say, “Hey, let’s still work together in some capacity?” That’s going to be a much harder road.', '', 'YOU’VE READ 1 ARTICLE IN THE LAST MONTH', 'Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.
