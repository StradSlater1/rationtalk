‘Conclave’ Takes Power—and the Papacy—Seriously,https://www.christianitytoday.com/2024/10/conclave-review-power-papacy-ralph-fiennes-stanley-tucci/,"['', 'KATE LUCKY', 'Starring Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci, the new film follows the process of choosing a leader of the Catholic church.', 'Ralph Fiennes stars as Cardinal Lawrence in Conclave', 'Political thrillers are studies in power. Macbeth and All the President’s Men and House of Cards pose similar questions. Who wants power, and why? What will they do to attain it? And which machinations will they come to regret?', 'The new film Conclave, directed by Edward Berger and based on the novel by Robert Harris, has all the hallmarks of this genre: whispers, sidelong glances, shifting allegiances, dialogue as sharp as the whetted edge of a knife. Its setting, however, is not Washington but Vatican City. ', 'The pope has suddenly died, and the College of Cardinals has gathered to elect his successor. Sequestered in the Vatican, they politick over meals and cigarettes in impassioned speeches and secret meetings before gathering each day in the Sistine Chapel to vote by secret ballot, praying their preferred candidate will secure a two-thirds supermajority. ', 'Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.', 'This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.', '', '', '', 'This election process is real. Happily for Berger, it’s also made for the movies, all gilded vestments and towering frescos and pomp and circumstance. Cigarettes burn. Nuns hand-pinch ravioli. Plumes of smoke issue into the sky when each round of ballots is burned. ', 'Conclave is a gorgeous film. It’s also a riveting one. The pope serves as the religious authority for nearly 18 percent of the world’s population. A papal election, it turns out, is the perfect place to apply those timeless questions about power.', '“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” and that fear has entered the hearts of some of the cardinals, particularly Cardinal Lawrence, manager of the conclave, brilliantly portrayed by Ralph Fiennes. Though Lawrence is undergoing a crisis of faith—in fact, he’d hoped to leave the college and join a monastic order—he takes extremely seriously the responsibility with which he’s been entrusted. ', 'Lawrence’s own doubt, he insists, disqualifies him to serve as pope. Or does his reticence make him just right for the position? As one of his colleagues puts it, “The men who are dangerous are the ones who do want it.”', 'That maxim is certainly true in more profane politics. People who want to be president are rightly assumed suspect. Absolute power, we know, corrupts absolutely. But what about power grasped in service of a higher authority? What about power for God’s sake?', 'That question makes Conclave an especially compelling movie, and different from others of its kind. In this setting, such struggles aren’t only about selfish striving; they’re about love for the church and deeply held desires for its future. Some of the cardinals are obviously craven. But most are more complicated. It’s difficult to tell where ambition ends and where conviction—about the return of the Latin Mass, or women in leadership, or sexuality, or radical Islam, or social justice—begins. ', 'Conclave offers an apt portrayal of the Catholic church’s factions, as well as how those factions muddle American political categories. The candidate who would be the first Black pope (Lucian Msamati) has traditional views on sexuality. The mysterious Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz) is a reformer, concerned for the plight of the poor. But he’s also very much religious, with a history of missions work in dangerous places. He wants to do his work within the church.', 'And though the film subtly advances progressive convictions, it gives cardinals of all ideological persuasions equal opportunity to fall short. Both the conservatives (Msamati, Sergio Castellitto) and the liberals (John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci) give in to their egos. They succumb to sin; they weep; they seek forgiveness. As Lawrence puts it, “We are mortal men; we serve an ideal. We cannot always be ideal.” Electing a pope, oftentimes, is a matter of choosing “the least bad option.” ', 'Still, the “least bad option” has that 18 percent of the world under his leadership. He’s responsible for preserving Catholic fidelity and orthodoxy. He’s not merely accountable to voters or the rule of law but to God. Conclave takes this seriously. Even when one cardinal quips that the former pope had his doubts—“never about God,” but about “the church,” with all its bureaucracy and abuse and corruption—there’s a sense that the loss of that church would be grievous. The answer isn’t to abolish but to reform.', 'By the end of its twisty plot, Conclave shows its cards about what that reform might look like—with an election (and a subsequent revelation) that feels extremely unlikely even for a thriller as dramatic as this one. ', 'It’s a rather didactic ending for a film so nuanced, so humanizing, and so accommodating of difference. At the conclave’s opening Mass, Cardinal Lawrence begs his brothers for unity, citing Ephesians 5:21. “God’s gift to the church is its variety,” he pleads. “There is one sin I have come to fear above all others: certainty. … Our faith is a living thing precisely because it walks hand in hand with doubt.” ', 'Different viewers might conclude that more certainty on any number of these issues—Islam, women in leadership, the church’s obligation to the poor—is precisely what’s needed to keep that faith alive. Nevertheless, it’s moving to see a varied group of men, doubts and all, muddling their way forward amid the clouds of cigarette smoke and plates of ravioli. Their attempt, Conclave recognizes, is worthy of being made: for the power and the glory of the One on the throne.', 'Kate Lucky is the senior editor of culture and engagement at Christianity Today.', 'KATE LUCKY', 'KATE LUCKY', 'KATE LUCKY', 'KATE LUCKY', 'KATE LUCKY', 'VIEW ALL', 'BEING HUMAN', 'STEVE CUSS', 'The therapist and author talks about coming home to God and ourselves.', 'NEWS', 'COMPILED BY FRANCO IACOMINI', 'How the Peruvian priest influenced the fathers of integral mission.', 'PAID CONTENT FOR SCIENCE MOMS', '', 'How pastors can reclaim the climate conversation.', '', 'BETHANY SOLLEREDER', 'The current environmental crisis is progressing fast and furiously.

Seminary rector responds to ‘Conclave’ movie: why only men can be priests,https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260039/seminary-rector-responds-to-conclave-movie-why-only-men-can-be-priests,"['By Jonah McKeown', 'CNA Staff, Oct 24, 2024 / 06:00 am', 'Arriving on moviegoers’ screens this Friday, the new movie “Conclave” bills itself as a star-studded mystery-thriller centered on the selection of a new pope for the Catholic Church. The film, which opens Oct. 25 in the U.S., is poised to make a splash at the box office and is already generating awards-season buzz.', 'In the weeks leading up to its release, however, the film has already garnered considerable controversy and biting criticism — with much of the ire from Catholics centered on the film’s twist ending.', 'Based on a 2016 novel by British author Robert Harris, “Conclave” follows a group of the Church’s cardinals as they navigate ecclesiastical politics, personal rivalries and scandals, and other obstacles as they seek to elect the Church’s new leader.', 'In the end, the cardinals inadvertently elect to the papacy a person who they believed to be a man — but in reality, the cardinal they elected was born a woman and raised as a male by her parents because she was born with an intersex condition.', 'Though not a new idea by any stretch of the imagination, the question of whether the Catholic Church could or would ever ordain women — either as deacons or as priests, bishops, or even pope — has been hotly debated lately, especially amid the ongoing Synod on Synodality, despite Church officials reiterating that women’s ordination is off the table.', 'To explore this question, CNA spoke with Father Carter Griffin, a Princeton graduate and former Navy officer who is today a priest of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., rector of St. John Paul II Seminary, and author of several books on priestly celibacy and other topics.', 'The Church’s constant teaching on this question, reiterated strongly by recent popes, is that the Church won’t — and in fact, can’t — ordain women.', 'Perhaps the best-known of these teachings is contained in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, an apostolic letter from St. John Paul II in which he stated categorically that “the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church’s faithful.”', 'Pope Francis has repeatedly taught the same, notably in October 2023 when he publicly reaffirmed the impossibility of women becoming priests, or even modern Church deacons, stating that “holy orders [are] reserved for men.”', 'Griffin acknowledged, however, that some women — especially those who feel drawn to the idea of becoming a priest — might view the Church’s prohibition on female ordination as sexist, discriminatory, and unfair, as well as a missed opportunity to put the gifts of women to work as ordained ministers.', 'Some might think, Griffin told CNA, that “limiting priestly ordination to men alone would be unfair and unjust if there were no rational basis for the distinction. After all, women and men are created in the image and likeness of God with equal dignity and with reason, freedom, and immortal souls.”', 'But, he stressed, equality doesn’t mean identical roles — men and women have different roles to play in the Church, as well as in life in general.', '“God created us differently in part so that we could exercise different roles and complement one another as mothers and fathers. This is true in the natural sphere but also in the order of grace,” he continued.', 'While the Church is unable to ordain them, there are countless ways that women have long served and continue to serve the Catholic Church, such as through religious orders, in parish life, education, health care, in other Catholic ministries, and within Catholic families.', 'It’s also vital, Griffin said, to recognize that one role in the Church is not necessarily “better” than another. Priesthood is, or at least ought to be, more about service to others than about power over them — the biblical image of Christ washing his disciples’ feet is a good illustration of this, he said.', '(Story continues below)', 'I agree to receive other communications from EWTN and consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy.', '“Inasmuch as some priests have historically failed to fulfill Christ’s command and his example of love — indeed, none of us fulfills it perfectly — we priests are partly responsible for these erroneous standards of power associated with the priesthood,” he added.', '“The fact that the priesthood has lost some of its social esteem in recent years, especially in the turbulent wake of the clerical sex-abuse crisis, is in some respects a blessing … The implicit claim that the priesthood is about wielding power in the Church seems less believable today than it has for many decades, perhaps centuries. That’s a good thing.”', 'Griffin also pointed out that the human being most highly revered in the Catholic Church was not a priest or a bishop but rather the Virgin Mary.', 'It goes to show, he said, that the priesthood is about far more than prestige and rather points to a deeper reality about Christ’s relationship with his people, the Church.', 'There are other scriptural reasons to support the Church’s teaching as well. By involving women in his ministry at a time of deeply entrenched discrimination, Jesus himself was clearly unafraid to celebrate women and challenge the social norms of first-century Israel — and yet his 12 apostles, the first bishops, were all male. ', '“If Jesus wanted to ordain women priests, he would have,” Griffin commented.', 'To better understand the Church’s teaching about the all-male priesthood, Griffin said it is vital to understand the “sacramental worldview” — a deeply Catholic recognition of spiritual realities hidden beneath visible signs. ', 'The sacraments “were instituted by Christ and make present his grace in powerful ways through ordinary signs,” Griffin said. For example, the water used in baptism is not “just” water but symbolizes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on a new Christian. ', 'The priesthood, specifically, is a visible sign meant to point to the invisible reality of Christ’s presence as the “spouse” of his bride, the Church, which has always been understood to be female.', 'In the Old Testament, God revealed himself as a bridegroom of Israel; in the New Testament, Jesus extends that teaching and reveals himself as the bridegroom of the Church, Griffin noted. ', '“Priests are conformed and united to Christ in such a way that they exercise their spiritual fatherhood in union with the feminine Church. Ordaining women would obscure that priestly paternity as well as the femininity of the bride of Christ.”', 'The fact that Jesus chose to become a man, then, is “not just one physical characteristic among many, such as his height or hair color, but an essential element of his revelation as spouse of the Church,” Griffin noted.', 'In priestly ordination, Griffin explained, a man is conformed to Christ in such a way that Jesus truly becomes present through him. Throughout his priestly ministry, but especially at Mass, the priest stands in the place of Christ who, as a bridegroom, lays down his life for his bride, the Church.', 'As for the question of women who feel that God is calling them to be ordained, Griffin — who works with discerning seminarians in his role as rector — pointed out that just because someone feels drawn to something, even deeply, that doesn’t mean they have a calling from God. ', 'The Church should treat those who feel hurt by the Church’s teachings with empathy while not reneging on those teachings, he said.', '“Today, when there is so much confusion about human sexuality and gender, the clarity surrounding priestly ordination is a healthy sign of contradiction. Precisely when so many are downplaying the differences between men and women or erasing objective gender distinctions altogether, the Church reaffirms in the male priesthood the gender differentiation willed by God,” Griffin said.', 'In the “Conclave” book as well as the film, the fictional cardinal who is ultimately elected pope is revealed to be a biological woman, born intersex, who was raised as a male and believed herself to be a male. In the narrative, it is also revealed that the late pope elevated the woman to a cardinal, even after learning her true identity. ', 'Statistics vary, but according to some estimates, about 1.7% of people are born intersex, which means they have reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t appear to fit the typical definitions of male or female.', 'The Catholic view of this phenomenon, as explained by Father Tad Pacholczyk of the National Catholic Bioethics Center, is that intersex people do not possess a “third sex” but rather exhibit variations within the male or female sex. While advocating for compassionate care for intersex individuals, Pacholczyk acknowledged that these individuals might face unique challenges in supporting their “intrinsic maleness” or “intrinsic femaleness.”', 'Any treatment that an intersex person undergoes should aim to restore bodily functions that align with a person’s underlying biological sex rather than affirming a different gender identity, Pacholczyk said.', 'For his part, Griffin explained that “a stable, secure, and well-ordered sexual identity is a necessary condition for priestly formation and ordination.” A biological female identifying as a male would not, in fact, be a male — and thus would be ineligible for the priesthood.', '“It is our individual and unique creation as either male or female that identifies us as man or woman, not our subjective feelings or choices,” he said.', 'While intersex cases like the one in the film are rare, Griffin said that as a seminary rector, he has had to grapple with the possibility that biological women who identify as men may seek entry, even secretly, into the seminary — a possibility that is not as remote as you might think. ', 'A couple of years ago, Archbishop Jerome Listecki of Milwaukee, then chairman of the bishops’ national canonical affairs committee, warned his fellow bishops in a memo that the committee had received multiple reports of women living under transgender identities being “unknowingly admitted” to U.S. seminaries or formation houses.', 'In one case, Listecki said, “the individual’s sacramental records had been fraudulently obtained to reflect her new identity.” At the time, Listecki suggested that bishops should consider requiring DNA tests or physical examinations to ensure that all seminarians are biological men.', 'Griffin said the question of how to make sure that women are not being clandestinely ordained is “an issue we’re all looking at more carefully.”', '“Among the many elements of an application for priestly formation, every seminarian receives a full physical examination from a medical professional to ensure that he has the necessary physical health for priestly ministry. While historically such an examination would not have included testing for biological sex, increasingly dioceses are requiring just that,” he continued.', '“In addition, an application for priestly formation includes references from individuals from different phases of a candidate’s life, including his family members, pastors, teachers, friends, and employers. No system is perfect, but if we take these precautions seriously it would be extremely difficult for someone who is not male to enter the seminary under false pretenses.”', 'Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.', '“I think we have to look at the question very much from … the Spirit. ‘Is the Spirit calling women?’” said Sister Mary Theresa Barron, OLA.', 'Will Heller, a 21-year-old from Toledo, Ohio, is a two-time Junior National Medalist and All American and a state record holder in weightlifting.', 'The bishop issued the letter as a follow-up to an August document in which he warned of attempts to “present an alternative to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”', 'CNA is a service of EWTN News, Inc.']"

“Conclave” Is a Mild Thriller About a Tense Papal Election,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/conclave-is-a-mild-thriller-about-a-tense-papal-election,"['', '', 'A reformist Pope who boldly leads the Catholic Church into controversial changes should be played by an actor of commanding presence. In “Conclave,” there is such a Pope—he’s seen early in the film and he’s the very cause of the drama—but he’s played by an actor, Bruno Novelli, with no other credits and no exceptional screen aura. The role is a very difficult one: when the action begins, that Pope is dead, and the actor has nothing to do but lie still. All the more reason that this character, who, even in death, exerts a powerful grip over his followers and allies, should be played by an international star of irrepressible charisma—a quality with religious connotations—so that the very sight of him, however brief, inspires awe.', 'This might seem a small matter of casting, but it typifies what this movie lacks. Its plot is as clever as its imagination is stolid, its subjects are as serious as its approach to them is bland. Adapted from a novel by Robert Harris, “Conclave” is a talk-driven thriller that takes place in the Vatican as the College of Cardinals assembles to elect a new Pope. The management of the papal election falls to Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the reform-minded Dean of the College of Cardinals, who is also a close friend of the late Pope’s close associate and Secretary of State, Cardinal Aldo Bellini (Stanley Tucci), a tart-tongued liberal of high principle and the natural successor to the papacy. But other cardinals have been politicking for the office, including a Nigerian cardinal, Joshua Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati), whose hostility to homosexuality rankles the liberals; Goffredo Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), an open reactionary who inveighs loudly against modern freedoms and wants to restore the Latin Mass; and Joseph Tremblay (John Lithgow), the late Pope’s chosen Camerlengo, or chamberlain, a seemingly evenhanded bureaucrat who, in fulfilling his responsibility for announcing the death of the Pope, has done so in ways that arouse suspicion.', 'As a result of Lawrence’s reformist preferences and personal loyalties, his management of the process proves to be more than merely ceremonial or administrative. The drama is anchored by the voting itself—the elaborate formalities with which the cardinal electors, of whom (in real life) there are a hundred and twenty-one, cast their ballots, requiring a two-thirds vote to yield a winner. The voting takes place in the titular conclave, the etymology of which means “with a key” and suggests the circumstances under which the election is held. The cardinals are secluded in hotel-like quarters in the Vatican and sequestered like jurors in newsy trials—insulated from all outside media. The likeliest candidates, none of whom prevails on the widely split first ballot, actively campaign, and Lawrence finds himself enmeshed in politicking, seeking first to promote Bellini and then, as support for Bellini dwindles, to form a coalition to keep Tedesco out.', 'VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER', ""A Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters"", 'The drama pivots on conflicts between sworn duties and moral responsibilities, between adherence to rules and fidelity to a higher law. As with many elections, this one has its own versions of October surprises, and its looming scandals involve the same things that roil secular politics—sex and money. The difference is that, far from being encouraged to bring such matters to light, Lawrence is bound by the media insulation of the conclave not to investigate the basis of suspicions. But hints of trouble reach as far as the nuns who staff the Vatican; one in particular (played by Isabella Rossellini) is paying close attention. There’s another surprise when a new cardinal whom nobody knew about, Vincent Benitez (Carlos Diehz), shows up at the last minute. Benitez is the Archbishop of Kabul, and the late Pope had appointed him in pectore—that is, in secret—a tactic likely used to protect him from persecution. He bears a letter of unimpeachable authority attesting to his nomination, and his mysterious presence becomes a subject of his colleagues’ increasing fascination.', 'In filming “Conclave,” Edward Berger (working with a script by Peter Straughan) offers piquant glances at the elaborate Vatican rituals, such as the sealing of the late Pope’s door with wax, the old-fashioned paper votes placed on a plate and tipped into a receptacle, and the mechanics of generating white and black smoke as a signal to Vatican-watchers. Berger clearly relishes displaying the material and procedural arcana of the Holy See, along with the Vatican’s magnificent settings, but he does so with an ahistorical incuriosity—with the anecdotal picturesqueness of a travelogue. The drama, of course, hinges on how all the coalitions and the maneuvers will shake out and who will ultimately be elected. The inconclusive first ballot hints at the many rounds that will be needed. And, even though anyone who has seen “Twelve Angry Men” knows how such a plot works, the suspense that arises as the backroom intrigues grow ever more ferocious and the schemes ever bolder is effective, if simplistic.', 'The filmmaking retains a steady, methodical placidity throughout—to match the plainness of everything but the suspense. Berger delights in showing the ordinariness of the cardinals’ extraordinary duties, in presenting the incense-shrouded mysteries of religion as a professionalized and rigorously practical realm, whose highest representatives are as hard-nosed and worldly as secular politicians. This mild skepticism, however, is in conflict with the story itself, which ultimately suggests—somewhat deferentially—that some spiritual illumination guides those who’ve made souls their business. This noteworthy assertion makes it all the more disheartening that, in a movie involving coalition-building and the changing of hearts and minds, hardly any of the run time is devoted to discussions among the many cardinals, outside the inner circle of officers and candidates, regarding the decisions at hand and what they think about them.', 'Even more crucial, the narrative’s creamy charm neuters the greater matters that the movie evokes: crises of faith. It’s the smoldering core of the action, disclosed in a few beats of dialogue, and enfolded in a homily—and more than one character, the movie suggests, may be afflicted by such fundamental doubts. The raw material of “Conclave” approaches the grandeur of the classic religious cinema, whether the spiritual severity of Dreyer or Rossellini or Bergman, or the anticlerical fury of Buñuel or Pasolini, but Berger films like a tourist. The superficial treatment of the movie’s sterner themes doesn’t help its splendid cast. Fiennes and Tucci, in particular, spin dialogue with athletic deftness, but they and the rest of the cast are burdened with embodying stock characters who exist only through a salient trait or two. Instead of rising to the awe-inspiring heights of their settings, the refinement of the performances is narrowed to monotony. ♦', 'A wedding ring that lost itself.', 'How the World’s 50 Best Restaurants are chosen.', 'Did a scientist put millions of lives at risk—and was he right to do it?', 'Linda Ronstadt has found another voice.', 'The Web site where millennial women judge one another’s spending habits.', 'The foreign students who saw Ukraine as a gateway to a better life.', 'An essay by Haruki Murakami: “The Running Novelist.”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2024 Condé Nast.

Conclave,https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/conclave-ralph-fiennes-film-review,"['Reviews', 'The performances and dialogue crackle like electricity in “Conclave.” Every frame is gorgeously composed, with stunning visuals that underscore the story’s surprising twists that thrill on two different levels. It takes us inside an ancient, mysterious process that has inspired endless curiosity for hundreds of years: the assembly of Catholic cardinals to select a new Pope. Here and there, it touches lightly on parallels to the less secret struggles for power and disputes about foundational values that are only too familiar to us. The chance to peek into the arcane details of the process is fascinating. Still, it is the universal humanity, the ambition, the manipulation, the grand visions, the pettiness, the disagreements about faith vs. doubt, progress vs. tradition, “we” vs. “they” that resonate most deeply. As Us Magazine would put it, “Cardinals! They’re just like us!” “Conclave” is smart, provocative, sometimes funny, and determined to make us rethink our initial impressions. It challenges us to challenge ourselves and is wildly entertaining, one of the year’s standout films.', 'It begins with some heavy breathing as Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) rushes, carrying a briefcase and his zucchetto, the red skullcap worn by cardinals as a matter of custom, not formal religious observance. The Pope is dying, and Lawrence takes his place beside the other clergy, praying at his bedside. Then, he is gone. The next task is to remove The Ring of the Fisherman from His Holiness’ hand so they can destroy the seal. This involves some ungraceful tugging, the first indication that the transition will not be an easy one. There will be many others, and we will hear more stressed breathing later.', 'Cardinal Lawrence, by virtue of his position as Dean, will preside over the College of Cardinals, sequestered in a special dormitory to select the next pope by vote. They meet in the Sistine Chapel. The ballots are filled out and counted by hand. Then, they are burned. The only communication during this process is by smoke, gray for a ballot that did not result in enough votes for any one candidate to make a selection, white when the selection is made.', 'It is sometimes said that positions of great power should go only to those wise and humble enough not to want them. That may apply especially to the position of pope, intended to be a lifetime appointment as head of the Catholic Church and Vatican City. Once selected, he is understood to be the ultimate authority, protected from error when he speaks on matters of faith and morals from the Chair of Peter, or ex-cathedra. As one of the cardinals points out, anyone who has risen to that position in the church has mused on which name he would select if he were selected. ', 'Lawrence, whose doubts about his role were great enough that he had planned to ask to leave his position, does his best to meet the conflicting needs of the cardinals. While he says at one point he does not want to hear about any concerns that might make a candidate unworthy, when he sees or hears an issue with suitability, he pursues it, even to the point of breaking a rule. Given that all of the candidates are limited in some way because they are humans, what is worse: a past sin, an unethical ploy to top the list in the voting, or a commitment to policies he and many others consider reactionary and harmful? Lawrence, after all, is very aware of the church’s past failings and the need to avoid any reputational damage.', 'The superb cast includes John Lithgow as a candidate whose currying of support may have crossed a line from unseemly to unethical, and Lucian Msamati as an African bishop whose selection could be an opportunity to send a message of inclusion, though a secret from his past might be disqualifying. Lawrence supports his friend, Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci, a standout even in this stellar array of performances), who is candid about his liberal views and thus scares off many potential supporters. At the other end of the spectrum is the Catholic version of fire and brimstone, Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), who wants to bring back Latin and kick out anyone out of the church who does not meet his limited ideas of suitability. Isabella Rossellini is formidable as a nun who, as she says, is supposed to be invisible but cannot help but have eyes and ears – and, though she does not add this, a mouth with something to say.', 'Cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine makes the most of the setting’s striking visuals: the rows of cardinals in their iconic red robes, the multi-color striped uniforms of the Swiss guards, and the magnificent architectural details of the Vatican. The contrast between the vibrant colors, the masterpieces of art and design, the representation of centuries of tradition, and the human failings and petty manipulations is utterly gripping.', 'The movie takes on an almost door-slamming farcical tone. Even in the sequestered quarters, rumors, revelations, and events take the characters on a breathing, Rubik’s Cube-style series of twists and turns. The final surprise may seem outrageous initially, but it is crafted to fit the story as satisfyingly as the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle.', 'Nell Minow is the Contributing Editor at RogerEbert.com.']"

Paul D. Scalia', 'SUNDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2024', 'We hear very little about the people our Lord heals. That’s not surprising. The miracles are to reveal and teach us about the Lord, not those He healed. So, when we hear about blind Bartimaeus in today’s Gospel (Mark 10:46-52), we could easily pass over him as just another blessed recipient of Jesus’ mercy. But he plays a bigger role in this scene than most recipients of Jesus’ healing. In fact, in this little scene Bartimaeus teaches us, in a way, more than Jesus does.', 'He teaches us, first, about faith. Now, the blind constantly live by faith. They trust that what they cannot see and verify with their own eyes is real, true, and present. Blind Bartimaeus goes even further. By faith he saw more clearly than the people with sight around him. He cries out, Jesus, son of David, have pity on me. Many if not most in the crowd looked upon Jesus with their eyes and saw only a man, a celebrity, or a miracle worker. Bartimaeus, without seeing, saw the Son of David – that is, the Messiah.', 'To see without seeing is precisely what we do when we believe. By faith we “see” what we cannot perceive with our eyes. We see the truth about God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. We see our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. We see His providential guidance of our lives. Without faith, we are blind to these blessings. Many who see physically are actually blind because they lack faith. Bartimaeus was the physically blind man who saw because of faith. To believe – to see without seeing – is the first thing Bartimaeus teaches.', 'At the same time, Bartimaeus teaches us about prayer, which is the fruit of faith. His cry is a basic prayer: Jesus, son of David, have pity on me. This aspiration contains the essentials. First, the personal appeal: Jesus. Then a confession of faith: Son of David – the Messiah. And finally, a petition: have pity on me. Prayer can and should be as basic as that.', 'Bartimaeus also shows the perseverance necessary for prayer. [M]any rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he kept calling out all the more. The greatest obstacle in prayer is our own failure to persevere. The distractions of the world act like the crowd surrounding Bartimaeus. They in effect rebuke us, tell us to be silent, to get on with more practical things, more important things. They tempt us to turn aside and give up our efforts. Bartimaeus shrugged these off and persevered in his appeal to our Lord. So should we.', 'Interestingly, his perseverance is not immediately rewarded. The Lord draws him out further in this exercise of faith and makes him persevere more. What do you want me to do for you? Now this is a strange question. Bartimaeus is a beggar; he probably wants money. Bartimaeus is blind; he probably wants to see. Most importantly, Jesus is divine; He already knows what Bartimaeus wants.', 'So, why does He ask? To provoke deeper prayer. St. Bede says, “He puts the question, to stir up the blind man’s heart to pray.” Jesus knows what Bartimaeus needs. He asks the question not to gain new information but to open Bartimaeus’ heart to receive what He desires to give. Jesus doesn’t need to know, but Bartimaeus needs to think about it, about what he really desires.', 'What do you want me to do for you? Our prayer of faith is deepened when we consider that question, when we imagine our Lord asking us that bluntly. We want some superficial things that benefit us for this world. There are higher, nobler things that we want…but still for this world. Jesus’ question directs us to what we most profoundly desire but don’t yet realize that we do.', 'Which brings us to a final teaching from Bartimaeus: Heaven. Bartimaeus’s answer summarizes the longing of the human heart: Master, I want to see. God created us to see. And not just to see the things of this world with our bodily eyes but to see Him face to face. He wants us to use our sight for and in eternity.', 'Sure, Bartimaeus desired to see so that he could have a regular life. But there’s a hint that it went deeper than that. Perhaps he wanted to see so that he could see Jesus with his own eyes, so that he could look upon the One He believed in. Indeed, once healed he doesn’t use his sight for his own worldly endeavors and interests. Instead, he follows Jesus on the way. Having seen him with his own eyes, he won’t be separated.', 'By repeating Bartimaeus’s words – Master, I want to see – we express our deepest desire, to see the Lord. We want to go to heaven, to see the One in Whom we believe, to look upon the face of the One Who created us and for Whom we are created. That prayer is also a plea to be freed from those things that blind us to Him – from the images and ideas that draw our eyes away from Him.', 'So, let’s not think of Bartimaeus as just a poor blind guy that our Lord healed. He is no passing character, which is why we know him by name. He provides us an example – of faith, of prayer, and of the desire we all ought to cultivate for Heaven.', '__________', 'Fr.

Perfectly timed for this nail-biting election season, in other words.', '', 'Justin Chang', 'That sums up the movie’s paperback-thriller appeal and its dramatic limitations. Adapted from Robert Harris’ 2016 novel, Conclave isn’t a whodunit, exactly, although it does begin with the discovery of a body. The pope has died unexpectedly in his quarters, and the Sacred College of Cardinals will now hold a conclave to determine his successor.', 'The conclave will be overseen by Cardinal Lawrence, played by an excellent Ralph Fiennes. Lawrence has his work cut out for him. He’s having serious doubts about both his future in the Church and his personal faith, and his contentious and spiteful colleagues are not doing much to restore it.', 'Before long, the college will devolve into a cesspool of backbiting, infighting and ruthless smear campaigning. Perfectly timed for this nail-biting election season, in other words.', 'Things start off civilly enough, as cardinals from all over the world descend on Rome for the conclave. Stanley Tucci is expertly cast as Cardinal Bellini, Lawrence\'s longtime friend and ally who is favored to do well in the election. By turns catty and serious-minded, Bellini tells Lawrence that, ""No sane man would want the papacy."" But if Bellini were take himself out of the running, the next in line is Cardinal Tedesco — someone he can\'t stand.', 'Played with delectable comic menace by the Italian actor Sergio Castellitto, Tedesco is the kind of staunch traditionalist who still complains that the Church got rid of the Latin Mass. The more liberal-minded Bellini and Lawrence fear that Tedesco will take the Church backward if he’s elected; they want to see the Church make progress on gay rights, multi-faith unity and women in leadership — issues that of course bedevil Pope Francis’ reign in the present day.', 'But for all these high-minded gestures at topicality, Conclave isn’t really about the challenges facing Catholicism today. Nor is it about the clergy sexual-abuse scandals that continue to make headlines, and which the movie acknowledges in passing.', 'The director Edward Berger is in it mainly for the intricate puzzle-box plotting and the relentless political backstabbing. Berger previously directed All Quiet on the Western Front, and he stages Conclave as another kind of war movie, where words become weapons and even the cardinals’ seating arrangements begin to resemble battle formations.', 'One of these men will be the next head of the Church, and the options aren’t terribly inspiring. John Lithgow gives a wily performance as one of the college’s more popular and opportunistic members. Lucian Msamati oozes ambition as a cardinal who’s vying to become the first African pope in many centuries.', 'Conclave is a noisy movie; the actors chew and chew the Vatican scenery, and Volker Bertelmann’s score is as bombastic as an exorcism. I was grateful for the understated yet commanding presence of the divine Isabella Rossellini, making the most of a thin role as a nun who says little but sees everything. Equally welcome is the Mexican actor Carlos Diehz as a humble cardinal who’s led a dangerous ministry in Afghanistan. His motivations are among the movie’s more intriguing mysteries.', 'Berger is clearly having fun ushering us into the shadowy, cloistered world of the Vatican, complete with detailed re-creation of the Sistine Chapel. And Conclave is undeniably engrossing to watch as it shuffles and reshuffles the narrative deck and serves up one juicy cardinal-red herring after another.', 'While the story may be a parlor trick, there’s nothing phony about Fiennes’ performance as the movie’s troubled conscience, a thoughtful man of God experiencing a genuine crisis of faith. Fiennes makes Lawrence’s psychology intensely compelling, whether he’s stepping in to reprimand a wayward colleague or reluctantly considering the papacy himself.', 'Lawrence claims he doesn’t have the spiritual fortitude to be pope; his attitude is basically “Let this chalice pass from me.” But Bellini calls him out. Every cardinal harbors the ambition to be pope, he says, and has even secretly chosen the papal name by which he would like to be known.', 'Speaking of names: Lawrence’s first name, we learn early on, is Thomas, which means that he is, literally, a doubting Thomas.

Born intersex but unaware until a medical condition revealed it, he told the former pope that he intended to resign. The former pope forbade it and instead made him the Archbishop of Kabul.

Ralph Fiennes in Conclave,https://www.laineygossip.com/review-edward-bergers-conclave-at-once-tense-silly-thrilling-absurd/80124,"['Edward Berger takes a break from the muddy battlefields of Europe to make a film set in a considerably more beautiful location—the Vatican. ', 'Conclave is Berger’s follow-up to All Quiet on the Western Front, and it is a cinematic palette cleanser, a psychological thriller with a high quotient of little hats and be-caped men scurrying down marble halls, whispering in shadowy colonnaded corners, and plotting in the Sistine Chapel. It’s a perfect antidote to the far drearier and more depressing Western Front, though it’s no less beautifully made, with exceptional cinematography courtesy Stéphane Fontaine.', 'Adapted from Robert Harris’s 2016 novel of the same name, Conclave is a film about conflict and the minutiae of the Catholic Church as the pope’s unexpected death leaves Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes, doing career-best work) to manage the conclave in which the College of Cardinals will elect a new pope. This involves cardinals from around the world descending on the Vatican to scheme and plot their way to power. The film can be taken as an allegory for a political election—it’s easy to compare to the US election, but the truth is, the conservative/liberal divide is fraught in many western democracies, so it can also be taken as a broader critique for these tensions, in general.', 'The conclave is upset by the arrival of a mysterious cardinal no one knew about, a man with a gentle voice and watchful eyes called Benitez. (Fun fact, Cardinal Benitez is played by Mexican-Canadian actor Carlos Diehz, who decided to try acting after his children grew up and moved away.) What is Benitez’s angle, what does he want, why did no one know he exists except the dead pope? But this is just one mystery that Thomas must solve, for he is also unraveling a shady secret in Cardinal Tremblay’s past. Tremblay (John Lithgow) is the mainline conservative candidate for pope, and his rivals are Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), the hard right candidate; Cardinal Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati), who would be the first Black pope but is also socially conservative; and Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci), a progressive cardinal who feigns disinterest in the papacy in order to seem humbler and more appealing.', 'All of these men have secrets Thomas must ferret out, in hopes of finding the most suitable candidate for pope, all while dealing with his own crisis of faith, an improbable push for the papacy, and some unnamed social unrest ongoing outside the walls of the conclave. It’s a lot, but somehow Conclave, adapted by Peter Straughan for the screen, never feels overstuffed or like it’s rushing to get somewhere particular. Events unfold steadily as Thomas picks away at the many secrets held within the Vatican. He is aided in this by a nun, Sister Agnes (Isabella Rossellini), who is relegated to the sidelines by tradition, but still manages to find a way to make her mark on the proceedings. Rossellini has a spectacular moment that fully justifies forcing her to spend most of her screentime in silence, watching petty men in little hats squabble while she keeps the Vatican running smoothly. ', 'While Conclave is not a particularly flattering portrait of the Catholic Church, it is sensitive to faith and the role faith plays in people’s lives. Apt to his name, Thomas harbors doubts about the whole thing, going through the motions dictated by centuries of pomp, all while feeling adrift and disconnected from God. He tried to resign as dean of the College of Cardinals, but the late pope denied his resignation, specifically keeping him around to manage the conclave. Thomas’s faith journey is about understanding the higher purpose he serves, which is perhaps not so much the political aspect of the papacy, but what it represents to believers around the world. Conclave is not especially deep, but where it does pick at weightier themes, it does so with sensitivity and real thought.', 'At least until the completely bonkers third-act twist, which had the audience at TIFF shrieking with delight and disbelief. When Conclave decides to ditch any pretense of depth and go full bananas, it does so with 100% commitment. Somewhere in that wild turn is a lovely message about acceptance and God’s love, but honestly, it’s buried so far under the rubble of shock it barely sees the light of day.

You might see it grappling with themes of identity, terrorism and crises of faith and start looking for a deeper meaning.', 'But that would be a mistake.', ""Because for all its slick cinematography, prescient topics and heavy-hitter stars, Conclave is more movie-of-the-week than the awards-bait it's already begun to be billed as. It is, at its heart, a deeply silly film masquerading as serious social commentary — a sort of Mean Girls in robes, juggling a seemingly impactful message that instantly shatters into a thousand little pieces the moment you actually start to examine it."", ""That said, it's also quite good. "", ""Adapted from a novel by speculative history writer Robert Harris, it's perhaps predictable that Conclave was going to be an expertly crafted B-movie rather than some kind of cerebral classic. "", 'For starters, it stars everyone from Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and John Lithgow as a gaggle of gossipy clergymen who\'ve gathered for a pontifical election after the mysterious death of this film\'s pope: the traditional ""conclave"" in which cardinals are locked away from the outside world until they can agree on the new head of the church. ', 'In this case, that\'s easier said than done. As the film\'s past pope was a moderately-progressive figure, his passing has opened up the possibility for more liberal candidates like Cardinal Bellini (Tucci) to cement the direction he\'s taken the church, or conservative voices — like Sergio Castellitto\'s Cardinal Tedesco — to undo them: reinstitute the Latin Mass, keep Black members out of the upper levels of the priesthood and potentially launch a religious war against Muslims, whom he at one point refers to as ""animals.""', 'This is the first genre red herring: behind all the votives and vestments, Conclave has little if anything to say about theology and — beyond the most basic ideas of inclusion and tolerance — no prophecies on the future of the Catholic church.', 'Its allusions to real-life concerns are purposefully shallow and uncomplicated, and there is clearly no desire to really deconstruct the teachings or practices of the religious institution. To the potential fury, or relief, of the church itself, Conclave simply uses the largest Christian denomination as a convenient setting and vehicle for its central (and perhaps only) theme. ', ""That comes in the way of our actual main character: Fiennes' Cardinal Lawrence. As the disaffected dean of the Vatican's College of Cardinals, Lawrence is given the unhappy task of actually overseeing the conclave, while simultaneously grappling with his quickly eroding faith: both in his religion, and the character of his fellow clergymen."", ""It's through that ironic matchup that Conclave gets all its juice: the world's pressures for certainty and conviction, versus the benefit of and need for doubt. Virtually everything throughout the movie can be seen through that lens: from Tedesco's frequent tirades about good versus evil, to Lawrence's reluctant inquiries into mysteries behind the pope's death, to the suspicious behaviour of a latecomer to the conclave."", 'And in one of at least four such speeches, Lawrence even hammers us over the head with it.', '""Certainty is the great enemy of unity,"" he says. ""Certainty is the deadly enemy of tolerance.""', ""It's an interesting enough message — perhaps proven by the fact that it already catapulted the aptly named religious play Doubt to a Pulitzer Prize.  "", ""For Conclave, the take is underlined by impressive performances from everyone involved, and gorgeous cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine that visually elevates the movie's aesthetic impact. But even apart from the arm's-length approach to its religious subject matter, an overwhelmingly one-sided take on what could be an interesting moral dilemma and a convoluted and farcical third-act reveal disqualifies the film as a real conversation starter."", 'Where Doubt presented its crisis between conviction and circumspection as equally risky no matter the choice, Conclave has a pretty safe bet on the correct choice.

Ralph Fiennes gives a steady and strong performance as the man in the middle of exquisitely watchable religious chaos.

(Chalk it up to divine intervention if you can see THAT coming.)', 'Having a bunch of ambitious religious dudes stuck in one place gives “Conclave” a hostile and explosive energy, which contrasts with the wonder and awe of the papal votes unfolding in the Sistine Chapel. (They didn’t film in the actual place but, holy cow, does Berger immerse you in the splendor anyway.)', 'The atmosphere is boosted by some splendid acting: Fiennes lends a vulnerable and earnest demeanor to the honorable Lawrence, while Tucci’s complexity and Lithgow’s antagonism spark their respective rival cardinals. Isabella Rossellini is also spectacular as Sister Agnes, who at first seems to be Lawrence’s nun Friday, giving him a helpful hand with her problem-solving skills, but she becomes one of the film’s chief sources of emotional warmth and moral richness.', 'Berger juggles a cast of characters with enough different ideologies and qualities to keep an audience invested in rooting for or against certain cardinals – he even nods to certain aspects of the Catholic Church’s shady real-life reputation to give it more depth. The thriller is both a thought-provoking investigation into real-life themes and human flaws but also an undoubtedly entertaining exercise, one where the simple act of dropping off ballots becomes a crucial aspect of a scintillating, white-knuckle affair.']"

And that was far less true of Tremblay, because his character doesn\'t plumb the depths of a spiritual crisis the way Ralph\'s character does. Tremblay is a kind of the workhorse of the College of Cardinals. He\'s an administrator, and he takes care of the finances and the logistics. He\'s a man of the cloth and we presume, a deeply devoted and faithful servant. But he has a strain of ambition, as almost all of the major figures do with either a strong, or a nearly undetectable strain of ambition.

He earns the respect of his fellow cardinals—and eventually enough votes to become pope—while delivering a stirring speech about leading his ministry during wartime in Congo.', 'WATCH NOW:', 'Ariana Grande & Cynthia Erivo Take Lie Detector Tests', 'But before Benitez can ride his pope mobile into the sunset, Lawrence asks him why he made, then canceled, a medical appointment at a clinic in Switzerland years before the conclave. That is when Benitez reveals that he was born intersex. While having appendix-removal surgery decades earlier, doctors discovered that Benitez has both external male genitalia and internal female organs. He tells Lawrence that he declined to get a laparoscopic hysterectomy to remove his uterus and ovaries, thinking it a sin: “I am what God made me.”', 'When Benitez told the former pope his secret, the now deceased leader unexpectedly embraced his presence in the church. This support emboldened Benitez, making him believe that his difference could serve him as a religious leader. “I know what it is to exist between the world’s certainties,” he tells a stunned Lawrence, who similarly champions the new pope just before the credits roll.', 'Those who read the best-selling Robert Harris book on which Peter Straughan’s screenplay is based won’t be surprised by this ending.

They just generally want to talk about the film, about the feeling of the different political agendas, which seem to mirror the discourse of the day,” Berger tells Vanity Fair. “The movie could take place in Washington, DC, or within a company—Condé Nast,” he adds with a grin. “The CEO job is gone and suddenly everyone gets out their knives and tries to get that job. That’s what people understand and take away. And of course the ending changes or adds to that perspective, but it hasn’t been the main point of discussion. It’s one point of many.”', 'Vanity Fair: What was your first reaction upon learning the ending of Conclave?', 'Edward Berger: The script was the first thing I read, before the book. Tessa Ross, the producer, called me and said, “I think I have a script for you that you might like.” I said, “Who wrote it?” She said, “Peter Straughan.” And then I knew I was in for a treat. My reaction to the ending was pretty much like my reaction to all the twists and turns. I really liked that all the characters revealed something, a side of themselves that they didn’t expect, some deeper truth.', 'I didn’t expect it. It hit me profoundly, because I also thought suddenly the movie had something bigger to say. The movie takes place in the oldest patriarchy in the world, the Catholic Church, and Isabella Rossellini, even a person like that is relegated to being silent—just there to serve and observe. So suddenly, it left me with a feeling that maybe there’s a crack in the veneer of this seemingly perfect organization, and through that crack a future light can shine in.', 'Once you know the ending, it makes you want to go back and rewatch the rest of the film. Are there clues about Beneitez, or the fact that he will become pope hidden anywhere in the film?', 'There’s a small hint in the script, a scene where Cardinal Lawrence opens up his plastic bag of [shaving] razors and so forth. When he’s in Benitez’s room, he sees that his razor is still unused. It didn’t do anything for me and took away from the character, so I took it out. The only thing that we’re hinting at is that Benitez gathers traction throughout the film, mostly off-camera. More and more people align with him, that he’s actually the only person of purity in this. Everyone seems to have seven agendas, egotistical agendas, except him. He comes to it from a place of purity and clarity and faith and love, and all these wonderful elements that a lot of the others have lost—including Ralph’s character.', 'Through casting, we spent a long time finding Benitez because I didn’t want someone who you knew from any other movie. Because when he delivers that speech at the end, his reveal of his truth, there would be a sense in your mind: “I’ve seen him in this movie and in that movie.” So he needed to come from a sense of unknown. Carlos was really the only person in the world who we found where I looked into him and said, “Oh my God, I believe it.”', 'As cardinals begin lobbying to become the new pope, we begin to get a picture of what the old pope’s tenure looked like. He had secrets, but he was also supportive of Benitez.', 'We find him dead in his chambers and usually every pope moves into the papal palace, which is palatial and has all the luxuries in the world. This guy chose to stay in the Casa Santa Marta, which is basically a youth hostel. It’s cheap and modest. Just by that choice already you go, okay, this was probably a humble guy who said, “I just need a couple rooms where I can concentrate and study and that’s it.” By accepting who Benitez was, saying, “It doesn’t change how I view you, you should still be a cardinal. You’re a good person. We should have a person like you within the church,” we get a clear feeling of what his political agenda was.', 'It is difficult to read exactly what Ralph’s character is thinking when he hears about Benitez’s past. Were different versions of that scene filmed?', 'From Ralph’s character’s point of view, this comes as a shock. This revolutionizes his way of thinking. It wouldn’t come to me or you as a shock. It would be interesting. But for a Catholic person, it’s a big thing. Because even though he propagates in the beginning, I’d love a pope of uncertainty, when he is suddenly confronted with someone who says I’m in between the two worlds, suddenly he just needs a moment to work through that. We didn’t want to play it for shock value, by the way. We really wanted it to feel very natural and soft. This is Benitez. This is who he is; this is part of him. We wanted it to play as subtly and as sensitively as possible, and really not go for the big twist, sensational reveal.', 'Was that part of the reason that the film ends there? Was there ever a temptation to capture more of the fallout from this confession?', 'No, for me it really needs to end on Ralph thinking, this is kind of beautiful. Ralph in his room, all you hear is the hum of the fluorescent light, his breath, he’s sequestered, there’s no sunlight, no life coming in. It’s really oppressive, claustrophobic. Suddenly the shutters open. Light comes back in. Then he hears laughter. He realizes, oh, the right person has been selected to be pope. There’s a smile on his face: this is the right thing for the future of the church. His boss accepted it, so why question it? Everything that Carlos says makes complete rational sense. This is part of his physicality. We elected him. Why would that change anything?', ""I had seen an old black and white photograph of three nuns walking through Rome. And I thought that should be our last shot. We shot this in a studio, and I showed the photo to Ralph and said, “This is what you’re looking at, these three women laughing.” And he said, “Oh, that’s really helpful.” He’s really looking basically at the future of his own institution. That's really what the end is. It’s not about Benitez. It’s more about letting in a breath of fresh air."", 'In the film it is said that “the church is not the past. It is what we do next.” Do you imagine what’s next for all of the characters?', 'We could do a sequel. [laughs] No, I think this is it. But obviously I think he would be a pope of great humility and understanding, furthering the cracks of the institution, bringing more light in.', 'Do you foresee people within the church finding out about Benitez’s intersex identity, or does that even matter?', 'It doesn’t matter. To me it really wouldn’t change anything. Still the same pope, and all that matters is how he represents his community and brings other people together. To be honest, probably a lot of the cardinals would be upset or say he cheated, but I don’t care. That’s their problem, not Benitez’s problem.', 'Do you have that same viewpoint with potentially religious people who may feel cheated by or be outraged about the ending? Are you bracing for backlash?', 'Not everyone needs to agree with the movie. I love when people disagree and we can have an argument about it, a real lively discussion. This is what Benitez is about—bringing people together, furthering discussion, and not squashing it. So if people disagree with it—which, to be honest, there will be people of course. But I’m not bracing myself, because I do feel that we try to deal with [the reveal] with diligence, sensitivity, and not using it as a plot device or anything. It’s also not a takedown of the church. It really looks at the people of that faith with honesty—trying to understand and serve everyone’s story.', 'Why does Benitez choose to be called Pope Innocent?', 'It’s a name of purity without any preconceptions.

Ralph Fiennes manages ambition and deceit as the Catholic church picks a new pope in ‘Conclave’,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/24/nx-s1-4893023/ralph-fiennes-conclave,"['By ', 'A Martínez', ', ', 'Reena Advani', ', ', 'Phil Harrell', ""Ralph Fiennes stars as Cardinal Lawrence in director Edward Berger's CONCLAVE, a Focus Features release."", 'If fiction depicts reality, then the election of a pope can be cutthroat. At least that’s how it’s portrayed in the new movie Conclave.', 'In the opening scene, the pope is dead. His room is sealed. Cardinals from all over the world descend on The Vatican to sequester themselves until they’ve chosen the next one.', 'Ralph Fiennes plays Thomas Lawrence, dean of the college of cardinals. He’s in charge of managing the vote – as well as the cardinals’ strong and various opinions about the future of the church. They connive, strategize and uncover damning secrets during their deliberations.', ""“Cardinals, priests – they’re human beings. They might have ambition,” Fiennes told Morning Edition host A Martínez. “Where ambition becomes egocentric and self-serving is one thing; they might have ambition to do well in the church. I think it's okay to be ambitious for something.”"", 'Fiennes’s Cardinal Lawrence claims not to want the papacy for himself, but he’s allied with Cardinal Aldo Bellini (played by Stanley Tucci), a reform-minded American. Bellini lobbies for the job mostly to oppose an Italian Cardinal, Goffredo Tedesco (played by a scene-stealing Sergio Castellitto) who represents the conservative wing of Catholicism. His ambition is undeniable. Tedesco wants to take the church back to its pre-Vatican II days of Latin liturgies and unchallenged patriarchy.', ""“It's not just about stopping Tedesco,” Fiennes explains. “It's also about advancing the church into issues of sexual orientation, gender, women – key liberal issues.”"", ""Ralph Fiennes grew up with his own experience in the Catholic church. “My mother was a committed Catholic,” he says. He spent part of his youth in a Catholic boys school in Kilkenny, Ireland, “until I was about 13 when I rebelled. I said to my mother, ‘I don't want to go to Mass anymore. I don't understand it. I don't feel it. I don't believe.’”"", ""Still, the script for Conclave spoke to him. “I've always carried in my adult life a real curiosity about faith – and a real interest in people who are committed to a life in the church.”"", ""Fiennes researched his role by speaking with Vatican insiders. At first, he was sheepish about how the work would be received. “I met some priests who were incredibly helpful,” he remembers. “They're thinking philosophically a lot about these big questions. I didn't meet anyone who I felt was locked in defensively in relation to ‘Here's an actor playing a cardinal.’ I felt I met open and kind people who said, ‘Yes, these are challenges.’ They are aware and sensitive to all kinds of things relating to the church's role. I found it quite inspirational.”"", 'Conclave opens in U.S. theaters nationwide on Friday, October 25.', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

‘Conclave’: Electoral Fight for Christianity’s Future,https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/conclave-christian-movie-review/,"['', 'The release of Conclave mere weeks before the U.S. presidential election is no accident. This is a movie about the high-stakes, contentious selection process of a new leader at a time of widening political division. The drama of Conclave includes candidates, campaigning, endorsements, ballot boxes, a “college” of electors, secret conversations in dimly lit halls of power, and even jarring attempts to undermine the democratic process. Sure, Conclave isn’t about selecting a new president; it’s about selecting a new pope. But the parallels are obvious and intentional.', 'Directed by Edward Berger and adapted from the 2016 novel by Robert Harris, Conclave seems to suggest the contemporary Roman Catholic Church is just as corrupt and broken as American democracy, and just as driven by the egos of overconfident men and their appetites for power. While it makes some fair points, in the end Conclave’s potency is compromised by its inability to conceal clear bias in a certain direction.', '', 'I enjoyed Berger’s last film, 2022’s Oscar-winning All Quiet on the Western Front. But that film was heavy-handed in forcing its point in unsubtle ways. Unfortunately, the same tendency bogs down Conclave.', 'The fictional film follows a papal conclave that happens in the wake of a beloved pope’s death. Most of the drama takes place within the Vatican’s walls as the College of Cardinals gathers to elect a new bishop of Rome. The cardinals spend several days going through multiple secret ballot votes until a candidate wins at least a two-thirds majority of votes. All of it is totally hidden from the public and the press, save the black or white smoke that emanates from the Sistine Chapel’s chimney, indicating a failed vote or successful election of a new pope.', 'Sure, Conclave isn’t about selecting a new president; it’s about selecting a new pope. But the parallels are obvious and intentional.', 'Much of this is interesting to watch, even as a Protestant believer who finds the papacy and the Roman Catholic idea of apostolic succession unbiblical. The film’s inside look at such a secretive but long-held tradition is Conclave’s greatest strength.', 'A troupe of excellent actors enhances the drama’s prestige: The excellent Ralph Fiennes plays Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, who presides over the conclave and allies with liberal cardinals like Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci). Both are contenders to be the next pope, as are Cardinal Tremblay (John Lithgow) and Cardinal Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati). The film is at its best when it subtly observes these men’s characters and allows the audience to discern their integrity (or lack thereof), particularly whether they’re more defined by humility or ambition.', 'Many times, though, the film oversells its political parallels. One character says, “I feel like I’m at some American political convention.” Another makes a comment obviously directed straight at the American viewer in 2024: “Is this what we’re reduced to, voting for the least-worst option?”', 'The conclave’s primary factions fall roughly along a progressive/conservative split that mirrors American politics. To be sure, there is a divide in the Catholic Church between those who prioritize conserving tradition and those who seek an updated, more inclusive church. But in Conclave, this split doesn’t concern theology as much as it does the issues driving American politics.', 'One giveaway is the character Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), the Trump-esque conservative candidate campaigning on a platform of traditionalism and nationalism (essentially “Make the papacy Italian again!”). He has an ostentatious swagger about him and doesn’t mince words as he critiques the previous pope and decries encroaching liberalism. When incidents of Islamist terror happen outside the Vatican walls over the course of the conclave, Tedesco uses the opportunity to ratchet up the us-versus-them rhetoric his liberal opponents despise.', 'The liberal cardinals respond to Tedesco in the way American progressives respond to Trump. They say things like “We liberals have to unite against him!” and “It’s a war!” They argue a Tedesco victory would undo decades of progress and send Rome back to the dark ages.', 'Watching Conclave, it’s hard to imagine actual cardinals talking about one another in these ways, demonizing “the other side” with brazen partisan rhetoric. But this film doesn’t attempt to accurately reflect the Catholic Church’s reality as much as to land points about the type of Christianity it doesn’t like (traditional/conservative) and the type it hopes will prevail (progressive).', 'Conclave is a cultural product of the post-Christian West. On one hand, it appreciates the church’s aesthetics. The film’s cinematography (often lingering on the Sistine Chapel’s beauty) and elegant black-white-red color palette suggest some fondness for the church’s contribution to culture. On the other hand, the drama’s shadowy vibes and menacing music underscore a posture of skepticism toward institutional Christianity.', 'Berger goes out of his way to observe the marginalization (and silence) of women in contrast to the consolidation of power among men—a move intended to associate the church with predatory patriarchy. He comedically lingers in one scene on a deferential curtsy by a nun (played brilliantly by the great Isabella Rossellini) that speaks volumes.', 'This conflicted approach perfectly captures the post-Christian mood. The pomp and circumstance of it all is endearing, and some of the Christian characters’ virtues are laudable; but the church’s institutional authority and beliefs (particularly its gender dynamics) are disdained.', 'Conclave is a cultural product of the post-Christian West.', 'It’s not that the filmmakers want the church to go away entirely. They just want a church that matches their progressive views. This becomes clearer and clearer as the movie goes on. A theme starts to emerge around the goodness of doubt and the virtue of uncertainty. “Let us pray for a pope who doubts,” one cardinal says in a pivotal sermon. “Certainty is the great enemy of unity. Certainty is the deadly enemy of tolerance.”', '“Certainty” is framed in Conclave (as it often is by progressive Christians) as the most egregious sin. Traditions must be questioned and long-held beliefs challenged. The church isn’t the past, one liberal cardinal asserts; the church “is what we do next.” He might as well have been advocating for a church defined by “what can be, unburdened by what has been.”', 'Of course, reform is valuable in the church. We Protestants know this well (Happy early Reformation Day!). But elevating uncertainty to the highest value isn’t a recipe for healthy reform and an enduring church. Conclave is correct to assert the fallibility of the church’s human leadership. But too often a healthy skepticism about human authority sets the stage for a doubt of all authority and eventually a deconstruction of faith.', 'Uncertainty can be weaponized as a destroyer of whatever tradition we don’t like. Appealing to examples of corrupt church leaders becomes an excuse to throw all church leadership—and their interpretation of Scripture—into question. Sober realism about church leadership is one thing, but a “doubting church” free-for-all is more progressive wish-fulfillment than a realistic course. It’s impossible to build on a foundation that’s ambiguous, shifting, and basically up for grabs. That’s precisely the sort of future Conclave wants to build for the church.', 'Major spoiler follows. In the end, Conclave underscores its position by who it has “winning” the papal election. The victor is a dark-horse, mysterious candidate who wasn’t even on the original invite list: Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), who has led Catholics in some of the hardest places in the Middle East (Baghdad, Kabul). He wins because he appears to be the most humble, Jesus-like servant leader—decidedly not seeking power.', 'Elevating uncertainty to the highest value isn’t a recipe for healthy reform and an enduring church.', 'But here’s the twist: Benitez isn’t a he at all. “He” has a uterus and ovaries. He’s intersexual, having been “assigned” male at birth and living as a man, even though he later discovered he had female reproductive organs.', 'When Lawrence discovers the secret and confronts Benitez, the new pope (who tellingly chooses the name Pope Innocent XIV) says, “I am what God made me,” a familiar line in the LGBT+ movement. “I know what it is to exist between the world’s certainties,” he adds, in a binary-defying statement intended to be the film’s mic-drop line.', 'Lawrence is deeply shaken, but it’s too late. Benitez is the new pope: history’s first female—or at least gender ambiguous—head of the Catholic Church. It’s a zinger of an ending, not only because the joke is on 2,000 years of “patriarchy” but because the wishes for a church built on uncertainty come true in the most vivid, potentially catastrophic of ways. The new pope embodies uncertainty and doubt, his very biology apparent evidence that God isn’t interested in clear binaries and easy certainties.', 'Again, however, this is just a progressive fantasy with no grounding in the realities of biblical theology on topics like gender and sexuality and humanity as male and female. Still, it’s telling that a major Hollywood film casts a vision like this. I’m not sure mainstream audiences will buy it. But if they do, it’ll be further evidence of how much work Christians have to do—on the topic of gender and sexuality but also on the issues of ecclesial authority and doctrinal certainty.', 'There are legitimate questions to ask about power and leadership abuse in the church, of course, and about how these things leave a trail of dechurching casualties and declining trust in theological traditions. When one character says of the late pope that he never doubted God but doubted the church, he’s describing a widespread sentiment among many Christians clinging to God in spite of the church. These are good questions to ask, important conversations to have. But hopefully, we can come to better answers than what Conclave offers.', 'Being a pastor is hard. Whether it’s relational difficulties in the congregation, growing opposition toward the church as an institution, or just the struggle to continue in ministry with joy and faithfulness, the pressure on leaders can be truly overwhelming. It’s no surprise pastors are burned out, tempted to give up, or thinking they’re going crazy.', 'In ‘You’re Not Crazy: Gospel Sanity for Weary Churches,’ seasoned pastors Ray Ortlund and Sam Allberry help weary leaders renew their love for ministry by equipping them to build a gospel-centered culture into every aspect of their churches.', 'We’re delighted to offer this ebook to you for FREE today.

The German-Austrian filmmaker spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the hype swirling around his latest feature, Conclave.', 'Ralph Fiennes stars in the religious thriller, based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Robert Harris. The two-time Oscar nominee plays Cardinal Lawrence, the man tasked with overseeing one of the most ancient events in world history: the sequestering of the globe’s cardinals as they elect a new pope.', 'With a script by Peter Straughan, what unfolds is a gripping glimpse into the inner workings of the process at the Casa Santa Marta in Vatican City: a group of men, some of whom are grasping at power, while others — Lawrence included — grow increasingly concerned that the honor will fall into the wrong lap. Fiennes’ character deals with tension, scandal and his own struggle with faith as fellow cardinals portrayed by Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Sergio Castellitto do nothing to make things easy on him.', '', 'Isabella Rossellini portrays a stern and firm Sister Agnes alongside cardinals Carlos Diehz and Lucian Msamati. Conclave, releasing in U.S. theaters on Oct. 25 via Focus Features, has received rave reviews since its premiere at the 51st Telluride Film Festival in August. It later screened in both Venice and San Sebastian, where Berger was in attendance to soak up the love.', 'THR caught up with the filmmaker — already an Oscar winner for All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) — at the BFI London Film Festival to discuss his mindset heading into awards season; capturing the onscreen magic of Fiennes (as critics deem it his career-best performance); and why comparisons to the looming U.S. election are well founded. “American news is so full of polemics and trying to deride the other side rather than trying to report objective news,” he says. “I can’t watch it.”', 'Congratulations on a brilliant film. Doubt and religion — why was that such ripe soil for you?', 'Well, that’s actually what made me do the film. That feeling, that inner journey that Ralph goes through. It is a wonderful topic for a political thriller, not [just] for a religious thriller. This could take place anywhere. It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So I think that’s interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what Ralph is going through. He says, “I have difficulty with prayer,” and if prayer is at the core of his job, if it’s the essence … it’s almost like if I’m saying I have difficulty believing in what the camera does — the core of what I do. To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It’s an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it’s actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating.', '', 'It’s just 100-something cardinals in the world, and one of them will be pope. So being a cardinal comes with a lot of promotions, and promotion comes with having to deal with other things — of why you first started.', 'There’s a rather platonic theme in this film: A leader should be someone who doesn’t want to lead, who doesn’t want that power. Do you believe the pope should be someone who doesn’t want to be pope?', 'It’s interesting. I can’t speak for the pope — I’m too ignorant for that. But I do know if, around me, I feel that people want something too much and that the ambition has an egotistical motive … Ambition can be healthy in terms of, “I want to keep exploring different things.” If a pope that is selected does it for those reasons, to keep growing and trying to help others, I think that’s a healthy ambition. But if it’s an ambition to become famous, to become successful and to be more powerful than others, then it is probably dangerous to be the spiritual leader of a big part of the world. So I do think that has some value, that sentiment of, “How do we keep the purity of my congregation?”', 'There’s also a pendulum swinging in Conclave. You’ve spoken about it in previous interviews as it mirrors the U.S. election — as a society, we swing from left-leaning governments to right-leaning, and back again. Ralph and Stanley’s characters are increasingly worried about the Italian cardinal [Tedesco] and his very traditional views. I wondered if you could talk about how that pendulum transcends religion, politics, everything.', '', 'It always happens. And hopefully, it swings the way you want it to swing. But also, what the film really deals with is doubt and certainty, and I think that pendulum also swings both ways. It doesn’t mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini [Tucci’s character] has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well. And I always think that, in a way, certainty creates antagonism and that’s just going to make the other side stronger.', 'So there’s a way of trying to understand why the other side is that way and trying to reach out a hand and somehow convince them through diplomacy. But to be overly certain … and I see it in American news. Obviously, when I get [to the U.S.], I’m interested [in] what does Fox News say? Because I can’t believe it. But then I switch to CNN, and it’s not that much better. It’s just because it’s so full of polemics and trying to deride the other side rather than trying to report objective news. I can’t watch either.', 'What research went into this movie? The conclave is such a mystery to so many people, and this felt like a very authentic glimpse into what happens during those days that the cardinals are sequestered.', 'We did a lot of research. We obviously have a book that it’s based on and [author] Robert Harris is very good at doing research, and he shared that with us. Then, we have [screenwriter] Peter Straughan, who did a lot of research. I did a lot of tours. I was trying to look at what it really looks like. I had a spiritual teacher, basically a religion teacher, by mine and Ralph’s side. Because we really wanted to get it right in terms of what is known. Because Catholics around the world, priests around the world, they take what they do seriously. I don’t want them to look at Ralph and go, “[Scoffs.] It’s just a stupid movie.” I want them to go, “Wow. They depict my life. And I might agree with it or not, but they got it right.”', '', 'And yet, I wanted to create a world that represents Ralph’s journey. So the Casa Santa Marta, for example, we built, and we designed it so that we felt that it looks right for the movie rather than the reality. In real life, it is quite unfilmable. I think it’s not cinematic. It looks like a hostel. I wanted this feeling of symbolizing Ralph’s journey. He goes in this conclave, and he is sequestered, and he doesn’t have any clues from the outside world. It was really wonderful to design a room for him that feels dark. It’s a little bit oppressive, and the shutters go down, and there’s no light, and there’s never any daylight in his room, and all you hear is the buzz of the neon light, this fluorescent [light] above his bed, and his breath. And that’s it. He’s alone with his thoughts and with himself. No phone, no news, no nothing. That’s what the purpose of the conclave is, to be with yourself and with your colleagues and find the Holy Spirit to determine who is the next spiritual leader. In the end, when the shutters rise and he opens the window and he hears feminine laughter from outside, there’s life coming back into the room and into his life, and that creates a positive reaction in him and in the audience. You take those liberties to shape a film.', 'I want to ask about your interpretation of the pope that is finally elected in Conclave and, without any spoilers, what it means.', 'I can talk about it more generally. I think the film talks about the role of women in the church with Isabella’s role, and how that is, maybe to some people, a bit foreign. When she speaks, I think she speaks her mind, the truth, and we want to applaud her because finally, someone says it so obviously. The relationship between femininity, masculinity, doubt — which is maybe seen as weakness, maybe seen as a feminine quality. So that femininity versus masculinity, it does have a big role in this film.', '', 'We have a movie that takes place in the oldest patriarchal society in the world or the oldest institution in the world. And what Isabella or some other elements in the film mean to me is that institution, that structure, gets a crack, and maybe that crack lets some light in and that’s how the future could look. We could benefit from that light and that additional perspective. And again, it’s a perspective of uncertainty, of being in not one, not the other, but in between worlds.', 'I know that Conclave is getting a lot of awards buzz. There’s Oscar talk about Ralph, and about you. Can you talk about Ralph’s performance and your hopes coming into awards season?', 'It’s really easy to talk about Ralph’s performance because I just love watching what he does. I mean, basically, he plays this role because one day, we woke up, and we thought: “You know who should play this? Ralph Fiennes.” Because Ralph Fiennes is someone that when I look into his eyes, he invites me into his interior life. He lets me know what he’s thinking without saying anything, and this character doesn’t say that much. He mostly listens and looks and reacts and tries to organize, tries to manage, reluctantly. So he doesn’t want to stand in the line. He wants to be in the back seat. Other people are more active. Stanley is louder. John Lithgow is louder. Ralph is like an Englishman in the background. And for that to work, you need someone who has that capability of inviting us in. And, to me, it’s just a miracle of sitting behind the camera and watching him and going, “Wow.” And all l want to do is share that with you. My responsibility is putting the camera in the right place so I make sure I don’t lose a single drop of that water, that magic, and hand it over to you.', '', 'In terms of Oscar things, I really don’t bother. It’s always nice and wonderful and flattering and everything, but you don’t make a movie for it. It sounds stupid, but you just want to make a movie and hope it works, and anything else that comes after is an added gift. We’ll see what happens. If it has longer legs, that’s wonderful because more people will see it and we can celebrate together.', 'Has the reaction so far surprised you? I’m sure life has changed a lot since All Quiet on the Western Front, but has Conclave been on a whole other level?', 'Yes, because being a moviemaker is so intimate. You make a movie, there’s a tiny group of people, there’s a producer, there’s an editor, there’s a composer. That’s about the people who see it, four or five people, and then you invite others, another 10, another 15. That’s it. A small group of people, friends, your partners, eventually, and you rely on their reaction. You think, “OK, it seems to be done. I don’t know what to do anymore. Why don’t we finish up and now hand it over to you?” So you can’t ever expect or plan a reaction, you can’t rely on your friends and producers because they’re so close to you, and they’ve seen the movie so many times.', 'So it’s a magical thing. You put out a film and hope that it finds fertile ground, and when it does, you’re happily surprised, because you never know. You can’t plan laughter. You can’t plan emotion. You can do it to the best of your ability. You hope that people will be engaged, but you never know. So it’s lovely when that pays off.', '', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"
Is ‘Conclave’ the Oscars dark horse that could shake up the Best Picture race?,https://www.goldderby.com/article/2024/conclave-oscar-predictions/,"['GoldDerby', 'Readers who regularly follow Gold Derby’s Oscar predictions may have noticed a movie quietly working its way up the ranks in various categories. That movie is “Conclave,” an adaptation of Robert Harris‘s best-selling 2016 novel, which was released nationwide by Focus Features on Friday, October 25. So now seems like a good time to look at which categories “Conclave” can thrive in.', 'Directed by Edward Berger (“All Quiet on the Western Front“), the movie follows Ralph Fiennes‘s Cardinal Lawrence, who has taken on the less than envious task of running the elections to select a new pope after the previous pontiff dies suddenly. Many cardinals are in the running, and some even want Lawrence to take on that lofty role, until someone lurking in the shadows begins revealing dirt on the candidates.', '', '', '', 'When you have a movie do as well at the Oscars as Berger’s “All Quiet on the Western Front” did two years ago (four wins out of nine nominations), people are bound to be interested in your follow-up movie, and that includes academy voters. Fortunately, Berger has delivered a strong dramatic thriller, which premiered at the Telluride and Toronto International Film Festivals in September, racking up positive reviews — currently at 94% on Rotten Tomatoes — so it seems like a good time to break down its Oscar potential.', '“Conclave” has an exceptionally strong cast, which already makes it a strong contender for a SAG Awards ensemble bid. The clear standout is Ralph Fiennes, a two-time previous nominee for “Schindler’s List” and “The English Patient,” but who hasn’t received an Oscar nomination in over 25 years. Fiennes’s “The Constant Gardener” co-star Rachel Weisz even won the Oscar for that 2005 drama, while he didn’t even earn a nomination.', 'After Fiennes, academy voters are likely to look at another previous nominee, Stanley Tucci, who plays Cardinal Bellini, the American Roman Catholic contender for the papacy and confidante to Lawrence who has some of the most dynamic dramatic scenes in the film. Tucci was previously nominated for his role in Peter Jackson‘s adaptation of the bestselling “The Lovely Bones” in 2009 and might be one of the most respected character actors in Hollywood.', '', '', 'Two-time Oscar nominee John Lithgow is also a Best Supporting Actor hopeful for his role as another key cardinal, but that’s a smaller and less showy role than Tucci’s. Berger’s international cast also includes Mexican actor Carlos Diehz, who has a few important scenes with Fiennes. Actually, almost all the actors in the film have at least one major scene with the leading man.', 'Isabella Rossellini has also attracted attention for her supporting role as Sister Agnes. In the only major female role in the movie, Rossellini brings another voice of reason to the tumultuous conclave. She’s on the cusp of a Best Supporting Actress nomination, according to Gold Derby’s current odds, but could be bumped by Saoirse Ronan for “Blitz” and/or Selena Gomez for “Emilia Pérez.” It’s somewhat shocking that Rossellini, daughter of legendary Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini and famed actress Ingrid Bergman, has never been nominated for an Oscar despite almost 50 years in the business with unforgettable roles in David Lynch‘s “Blue Velvet” and more.', '', '', 'Best Director could be a tougher category for Berger with so much competition for those five slots. The fact that he wasn’t nominated for helming “All Quiet on the Western Front,” despite it winning the Best International Feature category and multiple craft awards, suggests he might not yet have the clout in the directors branch to get their vote. That said, he does currently rank among the likely nominees in Gold Derby’s odds, so perhaps the academy is about to make up for his previous snub.', 'Having a stronger chance of winning is Peter Straughan‘s adapted screenplay, which contains as much striking dialogue as his Oscar-nominated script for “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.” The screenplay and acting categories often share a tight bond, even though they’re nominated by two separate branches. After all, you can’t have performances on the level of this cast’s if it’s not on the page, and those actors really bring out the strength of Straughan’s (and Harris’s) words.', 'Craft categories are going to be extremely competitive at this year’s Oscars, but “Conclave” does have a few achievements that stand out, most notably the costumes by Lisy Christl, who was previously nominated for “Anonymous,” the Roland Emmerich-directed movie that questioned whether William Shakespeare wrote his own plays. Christl had to design elaborate garments for the cardinals, which really stand out in the conclave scenes where they’re all gathered to vote.', '', '', 'Berger’s composer for “All Quiet,” Volker Bertelmann, won the Oscar for that film on his second nomination, and his score for “Conclave” does just as much to drive the suspense in the story, so it has a strong chance of being nominated, and the odds say it’ll win too.', 'Another impressive achievement is Suzie Davies‘s production design. She worked on the title estate for Emerald Fennell‘s “Saltburn” last year, after getting an Oscar nomination for Mike Leigh‘s “Mr. Turner” back in 2014. She also designed Leigh’s upcoming “Hard Truths,” but that isn’t nearly as extravagant as recreating the interiors of the Vatican and other locations around Rome.', 'Other below-the-line categories like Best Editing and Best Cinematography might be tougher to break into, with larger-scale films like “Gladiator II” and “Dune: Part Two” vying against indie films “Anora” and “The Brutalist” there. Even so, with so much potential support from actors, writers, and some of the craft branches, it seems like “Conclave” could easily be one of the 10 ultimate Best Picture nominees. Getting a directing nomination may be crucial for its chances to win, though recent Best Picture winners like “Argo,” “Green Book,” and “CODA” have shown that a Best Director snub is not a deal-breaker.', 'We also may want to make a note of how “Conclave” does at the box office this weekend, although Focus Features will probably do their best to keep it in theaters to make sure academy voters and industry guilds, especially the Screen Actors Guild, get to see the movie before voting.

"Conclave (UK/USA, 2024)",https://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/conclave,"['As a dramatic exploration of the political wrangling that occurs behind-the-scenes when the College of Cardinals meets to elect a new pope, Conclave is compelling and intriguing. As an opportunity for a group of top-notch actors to showcase their abilities, it stands well above most films. But as a thriller, it comes across as far-fetched and even a little silly with a mystery that is less-than-mysterious and a distinct lack of tension or suspense. The resolution is problematic, although it might have worked if Conclave had been positioned as a period piece set decades or centuries in the past.', 'Outside of those who have participated in the election of a pope, no one really knows what transpires in the Sistine Chapel during the period when the world’s 118 cardinals are sequestered, so much of what occurs in Edward Berger’s film (a mostly faithful adaptation of Robert Harris’ 2016 novel) is speculative. It feels credible, however, with politics and philosophical differences resulting in unconventional alliances. From ballot-to-ballot, behind-the-scenes wrangling can result in an ebb and flow in support for various candidates until one finally achieves the necessary 2/3 majority (79 votes) to win. Conclave does its job of presenting a version of what could be, concerned only that it seems believable (not that it necessarily reflects reality). Although the film’s pacing is unhurried, I was never bored.', 'The acting elevates the material. All the A-list actors bring their A-games. Ralph Fiennes gives a sympathetic portrayal of British Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, the Dean of the College of Cardinals who organizes and runs the conclave. Fiennes’ performance is understated, revealing a man who struggles with his faith and his position in the election. Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow are standouts, with additional strong support being provided by Isabella Rossellini and several lesser-known actors (Sergio Castellitto, Lucian Msamati, and Carlos Diaz).', 'There are four major contenders for the papacy. Aldo Bellini (Tucci) is a pragmatist representing the liberal wing; if elected, he would continue the reforms implemented by his predecessor. He is most directly opposed by Goffredo Tedesco (Castellitto), a reactionary Italian whose homophobic, racist views hearken back to the Church as it was before Vatican II. In between are Joseph Tremblay (Lithgow), a mainstream conservative, and Nigerian Loshua Adeyami (Lucian Msamati), whose skin color would make him a trailblazer but whose beliefs are closer to Tedesco than Bellini.  Two dark horses also emerge: an obscure cardinal from Kabul, Vincent Benitez (Diaz), and Lawrence himself, who appeals to liberals not enamored with Bellini. Initially, none of the contenders has close to the number of votes but, as the conclave drags on, gradual shifts occur. In his role as organizer, Lawrence investigates unsavory rumors that emerge about several candidates, becoming the equivalent of the movie’s Hercule Poirot.', 'Berger, who is perhaps best-known for his acclaimed 2022 version of All Quiet on the Western Front, matches a peerless visual style (co-credit cinematographer Stephane Fontaine) to go along with the film’s other assets. He opts for a low-key approach to proceedings, at least until events during the third act ratchet up the melodrama. And, although there doesn’t seem to be much doubt about who ultimately will end up with the 79+ votes (the Law of Conservation of Characters determining this), the various twists and turns along the way are sufficient to keep the average viewer engaged. As for questions left unanswered (chiefly surrounding Tremblay), I’m not sure whether these ambiguities are intentional or represent plot holes.', 'Perhaps because of the religious trappings and the impeccable credentials of the cast, the movie may seem more serious and important than it is. Although it pays lip service to the doctrinal schisms within the Catholic Church, Conclave’s sympathies lie with the liberal wing. The movie is at its best when it feels like a Vatican riff on 12 Angry Men, a concept that is enough to keep things flowing smoothly until the frustratingly “Hollywood” events of the final 20 minutes.', '']"

He's joined by the culture critics Teri Hart, Syrus Marcus Ware and Ashley Ray to give us their takes on the new Catholic thriller Conclave, Hasan Minhaj's new Netflix special and the craze around movie popcorn buckets."", ""You can listen to the full discussion from today's show on CBC Listen or on our podcast, Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud, available wherever you get your podcasts."", ""Rad: So that's a bit of the trailer for Conclave. This movie stars Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci. They're playing cardinals who are circling each other during the very secret election process of a new pope. This movie is a pulpy thriller set in the Vatican. And it's the latest from Edward Berger. His last movie, All Quiet on the Western Front, took home a bunch of Oscars. So we have a good idea where Conclave is headed. Teri Hart, Ashley Ray and Syrus Marcus Ware — they're all here to talk about it. Thanks for being here, everyone."", ""You know, Teri, let me start with you, because you and I have already butted heads when it comes to this movie.

What is Conclave about?"", 'Get more with a free CBC account', 'Comment on articles, stay in the know with our newsletters and stream more on CBC Gem.', ""Teri: Well, to be clear, you're wrong. I'm right. But, you know, most simply, it is what we heard in that clip at the beginning of the show. It is about the election of a new pope and about all the machinations, consequences and kind of self-interest that all of those cardinals come to the table with to try and get power. You can make correlations to any modern elections that we have in society now. But this is one of the oldest institutions in the world, and it plays like a thriller. I mean, you heard it right. It's got those big acting moments, the really serious monologues and all those crazy papal costumes, because those costumes are bananas. But that is what it is. It is squarely about the election of a new pope."", 'Rad: Well, OK, now for the people in the back, Teri, what is it that you actually love about this movie?', ""Teri: So I love all of the things that it is. I love a big Hollywood movie with those big speeches that can kind of make the hair on your arms stand up. Those moments in the theatre that you're like, this matters. And all those actors that you mentioned, Ralph Fiennes, I mean, he has never been better. I've never been a huge Ralph Fiennes fan, but in this I think he's just pitch perfect. Stanley Tucci is finally out of the kitchen and reminding us that he's actually a great, great actor. John Lithgow is perfect in what he has to deliver here. And I mention all the men, but Isabella Rossellini has a mic drop moment in this movie that I hope people recognize for what it is. And it takes her all the way to the Oscar stage for a supporting actress nomination. And, you know, I just like that it is pulling back the curtain on this institution and a process that they go through that the world watches. And yet it doesn't vilify the Catholic Church. That is not about my position on the Catholic Church. That is about me watching this movie and the success of what this movie is trying to do. And I think it delivers exactly on the point that the movie is making: what it's like to elect a new pope."", ""Rad: It's so funny because I feel like I agree with everything you're saying, but I somehow have completely different feelings about this movie. But that's a different matter. Syrus, you heard Teri talk about how this is about the church, but it's also an election. So obviously there are mirrors to our current politics. I'm curious to know, how do you feel about how this movie resonates with conversations we're having out there today?"", ""Syrus: This movie is so fascinating because you get to see the behind the scenes politicking and organizing and, you know, agitating that happens in the behind the scenes of an election. So you have everything in this papal election. You have, perhaps familiar tropes where you have a bunch of the cardinals not wanting a Black pope to be elected and they make statements to that effect. What would happen if we had a Black pope? And they make their votes and they campaign and they negotiate to try to make sure that a Black person doesn't get elected. You have similar tensions around gender. These are very similar to what we're seeing in our electoral stage here in the broader social world where similarly there are people who are not sure that we're ready to have a Black president and a Black prime minister, a woman leading in leadership roles, very similar to what we see behind the scenes."", ""What I also love is the ritual of the electoral process. They put their notes down on a little dish and then the dish slips it into into this this vessel that holds all of the ballots and then the ballots are burned in the ceremonial way. And the smoke that comes out of the smokestack tells the townspeople. You know, it's a very ritualistic thing and it's very similar to what we do. We take our little piece of paper and our tiny little pencil. We go behind a cardboard — you know, we fold up our thing, we slide it — and it's a very ritualistic process. So, it's very similar to an electoral process that just happens to be one that's for the pope. But I think that the racism, the underlying oppression that is guiding who's making the decision about leadership is very reflective of what's happening with our electoral state. Even here in Northern Turtle Island, in Canada, with some of our Conservative and Liberal and NDP, you know, hopefuls really going to battle."", ""Rad: I love how invested you sound in that process. Ashley, look, this is a movie that could be seen as a sort of meditation on faith, right? Because you're dealing with the symbolic power of religion, but you're also searching for what is the practical function of religion in modern times and stuff. But I mean, all of this is also packaged in this, you know, slickly entertaining thriller package. Right? So I'm just wondering how much of this rang true for you?"", 'Ashley: I do have to admit, I am a papal nerd — someone who took Latin for nine years and studied it in college. So I was on the edge of my seat, thrilled at how accurate they got this. I was sitting there like, your pronunciations are on key.... I thought it was so accurate to this nerdy thing that happens so rarely in one\'s lifetime that some people — I\'m not Catholic, I just truly find the history of it so interesting. And this movie brought it to life for me. So yeah, I was nerding out when I\'m like, ""There they go with this seal on the door, this is it! And my friends, of course, are like, ""We don\'t get why this matters."" But it is so cool to me that they did really honour the realism and authenticity of this process. And what I thought was so great is how they brought in all the tension that does exist. But they bring in so much humour to me that you laugh in this movie in ways you don\'t expect. There\'s just so much tension that does get alleviated in these ridiculous ways. And I don\'t want to spoil it, but to me it\'s so perfect. And maybe because I am the American here, but I also just thought it was a perfect allegory for our current political situation. I feel like Stanley Tucci is playing this Kamala stand-in where you\'re just hoping she can get enough votes and just get this done. Lithgow is playing this Trump-like guy who you just don\'t want to see win. And we\'re so close to the election, I couldn\'t see it outside of that dynamic.

With an all-star cast including Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow, the movie has attracted a lot of Hollywood buzz already. It has also raised questions in more than a few minds: How is a pope really elected? Does the movie get it right?', 'For starters, think of a papal conclave as more of a parliamentary election process of about a month rather than the two years of an American presidential primary cycle. Only the cardinals and a few staffers witness a papal election in the locked Sistine Chapel. They take a vow of silence to be broken only with papal permission and under penalty of excommunication.', 'But cardinals are human, and historians and journalists are savvy, so we know some inside stories. Bookies in the Renaissance paid conclave staff to chalk votes on dirty dishes passed outside after dinner. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V bragged that he knew when cardinals visited their chamberpots during the conclave of 1549-1550. In 1922, a reporter and a photographer were found as stowaways when the traditional final shout before a conclave begins of “Extra omnes!” (“Everybody else out!”) was made.', '', 'Secrecy wasn’t always the rule. It became normative starting with the conclave of 1800 C.E. (held in Venice, it was the last not at the Vatican), with Napoleon breathing down cardinals’ necks. From then on, notes and ballots were burned, leading to the white smoke that would indicate the election of a new pope, followed by the announcement “Habemus papam” (“We have a pope”). Ballots had been used for many years before then, however: The historian Frederic J. Baumgartner used them to reconstruct conclave tallies from 1600 to 1846 in Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections. He found one pile of ballots from 1655 where 27 of 66 of cardinals, disgusted with their choices, voted No one.', 'As recently as 2013, one or some cardinal electors were talking in great detail, allowing America’s Rome correspondent Gerard O’Connell to recreate the movement toward Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio in The Election of Pope Francis: An Inside Account of the Conclave That Changed History (including one cardinal who misspelled Bergoglio’s name).', 'The conclave as we know it—in which cardinals are locked in a room until they pick a pope—is less than half as old as the church itself. For the first few centuries, while Christianity was still illegal in the Roman Empire, it appears that a first-among-equals was chosen to lead the church from among the Roman clergy. Once the Roman Empire imploded, the bishop of Rome became ever more a civic leader as well, which brought Roman families into the mix to put their sometimes-undeserving sons onto Peter’s chair. That is when and where the cardinals come in.', 'Cardinals were the leaders of the churches and dioceses in and around Rome. Up to about 1000 C.E., this group of two dozen or so comprised the Roman clergy and were tasked with choosing their leader. Pope Sixtus V (1585-1590) decreed 70 to be the limit of the membership of the College of Cardinals, but rarely were there more than several dozen active at any one time. Just 51 cardinals elected John XXIII in 1958, but 80 elected Paul VI in 1963.', 'Pope Paul VI mandated a few years later that a cardinal loses his right to elect a pope at the age of 80; he also set the total number of electors at 120, though that figure has been exceeded several times. The relative number of cardinal electors is still staggeringly small compared to the more than one billion Catholics worldwide: John Paul II was elected by 111 cardinals in 1978, while 115 elected Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013.', 'We should keep in mind that it wasn’t always just cardinals voting, either. Not until 1059 did Pope Nicholas II give cardinals the leading role in selecting the next pope, and even then the sitting pope could make his non-binding choice known—and others in Rome might have a say. In 1179, at Lateran III, cardinals were given the exclusive vote, and a two-thirds majority vote took the place of the nearly-impossible previous mandate of unanimity. But it took the rambunctious election of 1268-1271—the longest interregnum in papal history—to give us the conclave proper.', 'At that conclave, cardinals wandered around Viterbo after the pope died there, following the standard process of holding the conclave wherever the prior pope died (many cardinals were part of the traveling Roman Curia). Fed up, the people of Viterbo finally locked the cardinals in a palace and restricted their food. After further delays, they ripped the roof off.', 'The cardinals then moved to binding arbitration, agreeing to accept whoever a committee of six chose. This man was Pope Gregory X, who knew a good idea when he saw one. He engineered the Council of Lyons II in 1274 to give the church the conclave structure it more or less follows today, with some modifications.', 'The new rules were clear: Cardinals had ten days to start voting where the pope died. Cardinals were locked in with a key (cum + clave = conclave) and could choose a pope one of three ways: scrutiny (casting votes), acclamation (everyone agrees in a voice vote) or delegation whereby the cardinals name a handful among them to choose with the others pledging to accept that person as pope. Food, water and funds from the papal treasury were restricted until a pope was named. To move the voting along, Gregory XV in 1621 introduced secret ballots and said cardinals could only write one name instead of the customary several. Acclamation was ruled out and cardinals voted twice a day instead of just once.', 'Pope John Paul II brought things up to date in 1996, especially with regard to the larger number of cardinal electors, and Benedict XVI made a few tweaks. Until the two papal elections in 1978, cardinal electors slept in curtained-off cubicles in the rooms outside the Sistine Chapel. John Paul II built the Domus Sanctae Marthae for the cardinals to live in more comfortably during a conclave. The rest of the time, the building is used as a guest house (though Pope Francis has made his home there). Cardinal electors are now shuttled between the Domus, where they eat and sleep, and the Sistine Chapel, where they vote—still locked in, sort of, and forbidden from any contact with the outside world via sweeps for electronic bugs and cell phones.', 'Pope John Paul II also reiterated the ban on acclamation from 1621 and removed the option of a delegated committee. Breaks can be built in if several days pass without an election, though most of the elections of the last two centuries have been just a few days each. His other innovation was that if 10 conclave days passed without an election, the cardinals could restrict their votes to the top two vote-getters in the last ballot. Those two could be present, but couldn’t vote. The winner would then need garner only 50 percent plus one vote instead of the traditional two-thirds—an unpopular rule that Benedict XVI then changed back to two-thirds.', 'It used to be that the conclave started 10 days after the pope died, but before airplane travel that meant some cardinals never made it before the doors locked voters in and everyone else out. Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore was the first American cardinal to vote in a conclave, but that was because he happened to be in Rome when the pope died in 1903. He missed the next one, in 1914, along with Boston’s Cardinal William O’Connell, who heard Rome’s bells ringing to announce the election of Benedict XV as they arrived in a car after their ship docked in Naples.', 'Cardinal O’Connell was not pleased. Though he had a ship waiting for him next time, the same thing happened: The bells rang for Pius XI as he arrived. Reportedly, O’Connell had a rather emotive conversation with the new pope, who extended the gap between papal death and the conclave’s start to 15 days, but not more than 20. Cardinal O’Connell finally got to participate in the 1939 conclave that elected Pius XII.', 'Today, a papal death starts the clock on Peter’s chair being vacant (sede vacante). The papal funeral is celebrated within four to six days, followed by nine days of mourning and special Masses. Cardinals meet during this time to talk openly and privately about what qualities they think the next pope should have. Cardinals over the age of 80 (who have lost their vote) can also participate in these meetings. Everyone else can make their voices known in public protests, articles, interviews and speeches.', 'In the event of a papal resignation, the sede vacante period starts with the effective date and time the pope steps down, which can speed things up. After he announced his resignation but while still pope, Benedict XVI adjusted the timing: A conclave can start before 15 days if all electors are present but must start at 20 days, even if some are absent.', 'The camerlengo is the person in charge of certifying the pope’s death, sealing off the papal apartment and office, and then overseeing the funeral and conclave. The first day of the conclave is taken up with cardinals and staffers taking an oath of secrecy. There is an opening Mass and one evening vote—typically used to give a shout-out to an esteemed cardinal who won’t be elected. But that vote can also indicate where favorite names or a dark horse stands.', 'There are no nominating or campaign speeches. The real discussions take place over coffee, drinks and meals. The cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel in two sessions per day (one in the morning and one in the late afternoon), with two votes each time—adding to up to four votes per day. Each cardinal disguises his handwriting and fills in a card printed with “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as Supreme Pontiff”). Each cardinal places his ballot in an urn (which used to be a large chalice when there were fewer electors) and declares in Latin: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.”', 'The cardinals run things themselves. A few, chosen by lot and changed every so often, count the ballots. If the number of ballots and cardinals don’t match, the ballots are burned without being opened. If the numbers jibe, then the count begins: Two cardinals open, read and mark the vote. A third repeats the move but also announces the name and, in a wonderfully old-fashioned way, passes a needle and thread through each to mark that it’s been counted.', '', '', 'If no one cardinal receives two-thirds of the votes (or two-thirds plus one if the total number isn’t divisible by three), the process is repeated for a second vote. If that vote doesn’t result in a new pope, then the cardinals break for lunch or the day. Failed votes are collected and burned with a pellet that creates black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney—indicating to the world outside that there was no winner. A different pellet produces white smoke that signals a successful election.', 'When a cardinal is elected, he is asked two questions. Do you accept your election? By what name will you be called?

'They have the same vices as we do': How new thriller Conclave is lifting the lid on the Pope's election,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241024-how-new-thriller-conclave-is-lifting-the-lid-on-the-popes-election,"['Based on a bestselling novel by Robert Harris, the Oscar-tipped film imagines what goes on behind the scenes of the secretive process – complete with scheming, smearing and leaking.', 'As rival factions of cardinals manoeuvre to elect the next pope, the US Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci) rejects a suggestion that he use stolen documents to smear a rival. His decision is not entirely on moral grounds. ""I\'d be the Richard Nixon of popes,"" he says, in a scene that captures the savvy plot, the wit and the colourful characters in Conclave. The film takes us behind the scenes of the secretive, ritualised process that happens in the Vatican after a pope dies, but it plays like a bracing, contemporary political thriller. Edward Berger, whose All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) won the Oscar for best international film, directs with great precision and fidelity to real-life conclaves, capturing an essential conflict: this ancient ritual now lands in the media-flooded 21st Century.', 'That link between ancient and modern actually inspired Robert Harris\'s bestselling 2016 novel of the same name, the basis for the film. Harris tells the BBC that the idea came to him in 2013 while, in the midst of finishing his Cicero Trilogy of novels set in ancient Rome, he was watching news of the election of Pope Francis. Harris says: ""Just before the [new] Pope reveals himself on the balcony, the windows on either side fill up with the faces of the cardinal electors who\'ve come to watch him. I looked at their faces, all elderly men, crafty, some very benign and holy, some looking quite cynical. And I thought, \'Oh my God, I\'m looking at the Roman Senate.\'"" He observed that ""an all-male ruling Senate had lived on, and these elderly men running everything was a direct link with the Roman Republic"". When he then started researching conclaves, he says, ""I just thought it was absolutely riveting, politics in the raw.""', ""In his Oscar-tipped performance, Ralph Fiennes centres the film and adds sincere spiritual heft as the fair-minded English Cardinal Lawrence, tasked with running the conclave even though his confidence in his own vocation is wavering. The story begins with the death of the Pope, and the film-makers did extensive research to mirror the authentic details of a conclave. The cardinals arrive from around the world and live in austere rooms in a dormitory-like building, Casa Santa Marta. Once the conclave begins, they are sequestered, surrendering their phones and other devices, shut off from internet access or any news of the outside world, and being sworn to secrecy. Elaborately, they vote in the Sistine Chapel, writing the name of a would-be pope on a slip of paper, which is then put on a silver plate and deposited in an urn. Voting continues day after day until a pope is elected. All true, except that film's Casa Santa Marta and Sistine Chapel were built in Rome's Cinecitta Studios."", 'All the ornate trappings, accurate details and bright-red cardinals\' hats don\'t get in the way of the political power struggles, which are equally realistic. Berger tells the BBC that the cardinals\' understandably human ambitions are similar to those in any institution. ""The CEO is gone and people are going to come out fighting, they\'re going to take out their knives and get that job, in Washington DC or in the Church in this case,"" he says. ""We think of this as an ancient spiritual ritual, and these men as sort of holy. We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they\'re going to have cell phones, they\'re going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do. The Pope ends up in a plastic body bag like all of us. And to me, that was important, to bring them into modernity.""', 'Harris says he ""wanted to reflect the genuine divisions within the Church, which exist just as they exist within secular politics"". As in politics today, the fictional rivals break into stark liberal and conservative camps. Bellini, one of the frontrunners, is the liberal standard-bearer, open-minded toward issues including women\'s roles in the Church. The other frontrunner is the Italian Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), a conservative who longs to return to a Latin Mass. Other contenders include the enigmatic Canadian Tremblay (John Lithgow), Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati), who hopes to become the first African Pope, and the little-known Benitez (Carlos Diehz), who was secretly appointed the Cardinal of Kabul (a post which, in fact, does not exist). Berger builds suspense as scheming, leaking of information and smearing goes on, with a taut style that brings to mind such political thrillers as All the President\'s Men.', 'Outside the calm of the Sistine Chapel, Bellini says he doesn\'t want the job even as his supporters wrangle votes for him in order to block Tedesco. That plot turn is not even a little far-fetched. Dan Wakin, who reported for the New York Times on the conclaves that elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and the current Pope Francis in 2013, tells the BBC: ""A cardinal who wants to become pope would do the exact opposite of tooting his own horn. That kind of exposed ambition is a deal-breaker.""', 'In a book-length interview published in April, Pope Francis himself revealed that in 2005 he was unknowingly supported as a candidate in an attempt to block the election of the conservative Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict. And even when the cardinals are sequestered, the media casts a shadow. In the film, when one cardinal\'s past is exposed within the conclave by a rival, Lawrence bluntly tells him, ""You will never be Pope."" Alluding to the Church\'s well-known real-life scandals concerning sexual abuse by priests, he says: ""Nothing terrifies our curia more than the thought of more sexual scandals.""', 'In the 15th Century, Alexander VI, a Borgia, is alleged to have bribed his way into office. In the 16th Century, one conclave lasted 72 days, and when a frontrunner died it was rumoured that he had been poisoned. Back then, bankers in Rome took bets on who might win, creating a direct line from history to the circus-like atmosphere of today\'s media world. In 2013, the BBC coverage said, ""St Peter\'s Square has become a kind of Coliseum. On every vantage point are the TV tents waiting for the games to begin."" The Guardian ran a Choose-Your-Own Pope feature.', 'Today, some of the manoeuvring plays out in public. Before the voting began in 2013, American cardinals were forced to stop giving news briefings, under pressure from other cardinals, while it was known that Italian cardinals continued to leak to the press. But in the film, much of the vote-whipping still happens behind the scenes, before and after the conclave officially starts.', 'More like this:', '• 12 of the best films to watch in October', '• The 1924 film that imagined a female president', '• 10 great films about presidential elections', 'Wakin says that during this period,""the cardinals often eat together and can drop hints about who they think would be the best candidate,"" a reality that is a central element in the movie – although the fictional cardinals do much more than hint.', 'Although Berger agrees that Conclave is often driven by politics, he points out that there is ""a deep sort of second layer that\'s what the movie\'s really about"", namely Lawrence\'s inner turmoil. ""He has a crisis of faith. He says, \'As a cardinal I have difficulties with prayer.\' That\'s as if I said, \'I have difficulty trusting the images that my camera captures.\' It\'s an existential crisis."" Berger says that the problem should be relatable to viewers in general. ""It happens to be religion, but it could as well be inner confidence. That\'s really what spoke to me and why I wanted to make the film,"" he says.', 'Another low-key but crucial facet of Conclave is Isabella Rossellini\'s role as Sister Agnes, who is in charge of the nuns brought in to cook, clean and generally serve the cardinals. They are meant to be quietly in the background, but as Agnes says in one plot-changing scene, ""God has given us eyes and ears."" Berger says, ""I always said to Isabella, when you\'re in the scene, we really need to see you and see what you think and be with you. So she always had the close-up, she wasn\'t just part of the scene."" He adds, ""The patriarchal structure gets a crack through that theme.""', 'All these simmering elements, including Agnes\'s role, lead to a shocking end that shouldn\'t be spoiled. Harris says, ""I didn\'t just put in the end as a kind of amusing twist. It\'s built into the very fabric of what the novel and the film are all about. He also got an endorsement from one of his background sources. ""I was helped by – he died, sadly, so I\'m sure he wouldn\'t mind me saying – the English Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O\'Connor."" After he sent Murphy-O\'Connor a copy of the book, Harris says, ""To my surprise he wrote me a fan letter about it saying, \'This is exactly what a conclave is like. Your central cardinal is exactly as we cardinals would wish to be. And as for the ending, I told myself it was only a novel.\'""', '--', ""If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."", 'For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.', 'How a 1892 photo from Rougeville, Michigan, became the most iconic image of the bison massacre in America.', 'The US Presidential elections did not always depend on just these seven states.', 'In 1890 an estimated cargo of 180,000 ancient felines, weighing 19.5 tonnes, were auctioned off in Liverpool.', 'The Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak was accidentally discovered by Bulgarian soldiers digging up shelters in 1944.', ""The Varna treasure is considered the world's oldest human processed gold, dating back 6,500 years."", ""Hiding in a London cathedral is an intricate wooden mock-up of Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece."", 'Bettany Hughes goes underwater in search of ancient archaeological finds in historic Sozopol, Bulgaria.', 'In 1911, a fence was constructed on the US-Mexico border.
