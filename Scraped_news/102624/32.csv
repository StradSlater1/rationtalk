Apple (AAPL) and Masimo Patent Clash: Recent Developments in Health Tech,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2568541/apple-aapl-and-masimo-patent-clash-recent-developments-in-health-tech?r\u003d4bf001661e6fdd88d0cd7a5659ff9748\u0026mod\u003dnews_archive,"[""Currently, Apple Watch models sold in the U.S. lack a blood oxygen monitoring feature due to an ongoing patent dispute between Apple (AAPL, Financial) and medical technology company Masimo. This legal battle revolves around health features, especially concerning blood-oxygen detection. Recently, Apple achieved a minor victory as an older model of Masimo's smartwatches was found to infringe on patents, resulting in a $250 compensation—equivalent to half the price of an Apple Watch Series 10 with cellular capabilities."", ""The conflict began when Apple hired Masimo's former Chief Medical Officer and Chief Technology Officer from its subsidiary, Cercacor, in 2013 and 2014 to work on the Apple Watch. Masimo filed a lawsuit in January 2020, accusing Apple of stealing confidential information and poaching key employees. Masimo sought a ban on the sales of Apple Watch Series 6, claiming it infringed on their blood-oxygen technology patents."", ""The battle intensified when the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled in October 2023 that Apple had violated Masimo's pulse oximeter patents, ordering a ban on the sale and import of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensors. Apple managed to temporarily delay the ban but eventually disabled the feature on newer models like the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 via software updates."", ""In the face of Masimo's allegations, Apple chose to confront the issue head-on rather than settle through licensing agreements. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, highlighted that the appeal of Apple Watch extends beyond just the blood-oxygen sensor, emphasizing consumer interest in other features."", ""In October 2022, Apple took the offensive, accusing Masimo's W1 smartwatches of patent infringement. Recently, a jury sided with Apple, finding Masimo's smartwatches and chargers violated certain patents, though the compensation awarded was minimal, indicating the key focus was more on halting sales rather than monetary gain."", 'The dispute has attracted the attention of other tech giants like Google and Qualcomm. In September, Masimo announced collaborations with them to integrate their biosensing technology into Wear OS smartwatches. This move introduces new variables into the ongoing battle between Apple and Masimo, with the potential to reshape the smart wearable market. As this technological face-off continues, the impact on consumer options remains an important consideration. Observers are keen to see how this innovation-driven conflict unfolds in the future.', ""We'd love to learn more about your experiences on GuruFocus.com and how we can improve!""]"

On Friday, a federal jury ruled that Masimo had indeed infringed on some of Apple's patents and, as a result, awarded Apple US$250 in statutory damages — a sum Apple requested as a symbolic gesture."", ""The US$250 damages Apple received from this case represent the statutory minimum for the patent violations. Apple specifically requested this figure to emphasise that the case was not about financial compensation. During closing arguments, Apple's attorney, John Desmarais, clarified this point to jurors, saying, “We're not here for the money,” as reported by Bloomberg Law. By seeking the minimum damages, Apple underscored its focus on enforcing patent rights rather than seeking financial gain."", ""This lawsuit focused on a few Masimo products, including the W1 and Freedom smartwatches and an associated health module. The jury found that these products had violated one of Apple's patents, while Masimo's smartwatch charger infringed on another. The verdict also noted that Masimo's infringement was “wilful,” indicating the jury believed the company knowingly violated Apple's intellectual property."", ""This ruling follows a separate decision by the International Trade Commission (ITC) earlier this year, which concluded that Apple had itself infringed on Masimo's patents relating to pulse oximetry, the technology used to measure blood oxygen levels. Due to that ITC ruling, Apple was forced to stop selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models with blood oxygen features in the United States. Consequently, the latest Apple Watch Series 10, which was recently launched, also lacks these features to comply with the ITC's restrictions."", ""Apple's legal battles with Masimo have highlighted the competitive nature of the wearable health-tech industry, where both companies are attempting to innovate while protecting their intellectual property. As the popularity of health-focused wearable devices continues to grow, disputes over patents and proprietary technologies are likely to become even more common. With Apple and Masimo actively investing in the health-monitoring market, this recent case could mark one of many future challenges as tech companies push to advance medical-grade wearable technology."", 'The ruling serves as a partial victory for Apple, underscoring the importance of protecting its innovations while only receiving a symbolic US$250 in damages. Whether further legal battles await Apple and Masimo in this ongoing rivalry remains to be seen, but both companies appear committed to maintaining their positions within the industry.', ""Tech Edition has partnerships that involve sponsored content.

The firm successfully blocked U.S. sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, via an International Trade Commission (ITC) ruling that the devices infringed on its patent for pulse oximetry.', 'Between December 21 and December 27, only the Apple Watch SE — which lacks the feature — was available to buy from Apple stores. But the company quickly compensated, by removing blood oxygen measurement from its flagship smartwatches sold new — a feature that’s still MIA on new devices to this day.', 'On Friday, Apple got a small piece of revenge over Masimo, Bloomberg Law reports, with a federal jury in Delaware concluding that the firm had infringed on two of Apple’s patents in one of its smartwatches. But ultimately, it’s not much of a prize for a couple of reasons.', 'Firstly, the damages won’t make the world’s richest company much richer. A fee of just $250 (yes, just a single zero) was sought by Apple, the statutory minimum damages possible.', '“We’re not here for the money,” Apple attorney John Desmarais is quoted as telling jurors in his closing statement, adding that the purpose of the action was to “stop copying our design”.', 'But while two design patents were indeed found to be infringed — one for the charger, and one health module in the watch itself — neither is part of Masimo’s current products, making an injunction of future sales essentially pointless, Bloomberg explains. “The decision all but removed its chances to block Masimo’s current products,” the piece reads.', ""Claiming that the jury ruled in its favor “on nearly all issues”, Masimo's statement opines that the legal action was a bust for the iPhone maker. “Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” the statement reads."", 'Here at Tom’s Guide our expert editors are committed to bringing you the best news, reviews and guides to help you stay informed and ahead of the curve!', 'Apple, as you might imagine, seeks to paint things differently. “We thank the jury for their careful consideration in this case, finding Masimo willfully infringed Apple’s patented designs,” a statement shared with 9to5Mac reads. “Teams at Apple worked for years to develop the Apple Watch, a successful and innovative product that meaningfully impacts users’ lives.', '“Masimo took shortcuts, launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property.
