But there’s probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with or that distract us from our main goal here.”', 'However, sources tell the WSJ that Boeing will likely continue to oversee the Space Launch System, which will eventually help bring NASA astronauts back to the Moon. It’s also reportedly expected to hang onto its commercial and military satellite businesses.', 'Ortberg will have some big changes to make in the coming months, especially as the company continues to bleed cash.

He fired Boeing’s defense and space business leader in September, and this week told analysts and investors that it was more important to be “doing less and doing it better.” The company blamed a $250 million Q3 loss on Starliner problems, and there’s no doubt that the capsule has tarnished Boeing’s public image.', 'The apparent selloff leak comes just a day after the delayed return of SpaceX’s Crew-8 astronauts to Earth, underscoring Boeing’s problems.

Boeing was also the main US contractor for the ISS.', 'A potential sale would also show how much the space industry has changed in recent decades.

"Space shots: A tangled web of speculation surrounds Boeing, Blue Origin and Bezos",https://www.geekwire.com/2024/space-shots-boeing-blue-origin-bezos/,"['BY ALAN BOYLE on October 26, 2024 at 10:39 am', 'Is Boeing thinking about unloading some of its space projects? Is Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin space venture a potential buyer? And in light of former President Donald Trump’s increasingly close relationship with SpaceX founder Elon Musk, how are Bezos and Blue Origin reaching out to the GOP candidate?', 'Such speculation is fueled by several reports about space-related (and Bezos-related) developments over just the past couple of days. Here’s a quick rundown:', 'Boeing considers trimming back space programs: Citing unidentified sources, The Wall Street Journal reports that Boeing is exploring the idea of handing off some of its roles in space programs for NASA — including its unprofitable Starliner space taxi development program.', 'The Journal says such discussions are still at an early stage and may not result in a deal. But the strategy is in line with recently appointed CEO Kelly Ortberg’s plan to streamline Boeing’s business lines in light of its financial crisis. This week the company announced a quarterly loss of $6 billion, and union workers voted to continue a costly strike affecting Boeing’s airplane factories.', 'Starliner has been costly as well, due to $1.85 billion in overruns that haven’t been covered by Boeing’s fixed-price contract with NASA. This summer’s first crewed Starliner mission to the International Space Station was marred by thruster issues that resulted in the capsule being sent back down to Earth uncrewed. The two astronauts who rode Starliner to the ISS will have to stay in orbit until a SpaceX Dragon brings them down next year.', 'Boeing also has served as the prime contractor for the space station — but with ISS operations scheduled to wind down in the 2030 time frame, the company is exploring an arrangement to transfer that support role to a different company, the Journal reports. United Launch Alliance, Boeing’s joint venture with Lockheed Martin, has also long been rumored to be up for sale.', 'The Journal says some of its sources expect Boeing to hang onto its satellite business, as well as its role as a major contractor for NASA’s heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket.', 'Could Blue Origin step in? According to the Journal’s sources, Boeing has held discussions with Blue Origin about taking over some of the NASA programs. Such discussions reportedly took place before Ortberg became Boeing’s CEO.', 'Blue Origin has a couple of potential lines of business that could be a good match for what Boeing’s currently doing in space. Last year, for example, the company began a collaboration with NASA to explore developing new capabilities for crew transportation to and from low Earth orbit. Having a crew capsule would complement the capabilities of Blue Origin’s orbital-class New Glenn rocket, which is currently being prepared for its first launch.', 'Boeing is already one of the partners backing Orbital Reef, a commercial space station project led by Blue Origin. The plan calls for Boeing’s Starliner capsule and Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser space plane to transport crew and cargo to and from Orbital Reef. Would Blue Origin take over the Starliner program, or develop its own crew vehicle to take over Starliner’s role? If NASA puts more money into Orbital Reef, might ISS operations be part of the deal?', 'Any of those strategies would be a big step for Bezos’ space venture, which already has its hands full with New Glenn, Orbital Reef, the New Shepard suborbital space program and the Blue Moon lunar lander that’s being built for NASA’s use. But as Boeing’s executives consider how it might pare down its unprofitable lines of business, it’s worth watching what Blue Origin is doing as well.', 'We’ve reached out to Boeing and Blue Origin, and will update this report with anything we can pass along.', ""Spotted outside Trump's Austin event: The former president talking with Bezos's Blue Origin execs (the same day The Post announced its editorial board won't make an endorsement) w/ @Post_AG 📸 by @alexbrandon https://t.co/BQb7Ee5oRZ pic.twitter.com/3DccYHP1ig"", 'Blue Origin and Jeff Bezos attract notice on the political scene: The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, made news on Friday when the newspaper announced that it would not make an endorsement in the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump. Reports soon emerged that the Post’s staff had prepared an editorial endorsing Harris, but that Bezos spiked it.', 'Also on Friday, Trump made a campaign stop in Austin, Texas — and stopped along the way in an airport hangar for a quick chat with Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp and Megan Mitchell, the company’s vice president for government relations.', 'There haven’t been any details about the context for the meet-and-greet or about what was said. But some observers linked up the two developments to suggest that Bezos and the executives at his ventures were making efforts to smooth relations with Trump. Back in 2015, the two men stirred up something of a flame war on Twitter, now known as X. Since then, Bezos has brought down the temperature, going so far as to praise Trump on X for his “tremendous grace and courage” after July’s assassination attempt.', 'Now X is owned by Musk — who also founded SpaceX, the dominant player in the space industry. Musk is one of Bezos’ longtime business rivals. He’s also one of Trump’s biggest and most vocal backers. If Trump wins, Musk has agreed to support his efforts to reduce federal spending — perhaps as the leader of a “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE.', 'Considering the Bezos-Musk rivalry, it might make political sense for Blue Origin to have its own points of contact with Trump, just in case. It would be tricky to untangle the web of connections involving Trump, Musk and SpaceX, Blue Origin and Bezos. Nevertheless, we’ve reached out to the Trump campaign and to Blue Origin about this, and we’ll pass along anything we can report.', 'Husky undergrads are helping scientists decode the universe.', '', 'Astronomy undergrads at the University of Washington are testing their cutting-edge coding skills in the classroom — and the cosmos.

The SLS, the key component of the agency’s Moon exploration plans, successfully performed its first flight two years ago. However, production of the rocket has faced assorted troubles and quality control issues.', 'The less successful programs, including the ill-fated Starliner ship, designed to transport crews of up to seven to and from the ISS, could end up sold off, the sources claimed. The spacecraft was originally planned to become operational in 2017 but has been repeatedly delayed over assorted engineering and management problems. The latest crew flight test, launched in June, resulted in partial failure after the spacecraft’s thrusters malfunctioned on approach to the ISS, and it was deemed too risky to return its astronauts aboard the ship, which ultimately returned to Earth uncrewed in September.', 'The potential sale of its space-related assets comes as a part of the strategy of Boeing’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who is seeking to streamline the corporation and cut its financial losses. However, Boeing had been in contact with potential buyers, including the Blue Origin company owned by Jeff Bezos, even before Ortberg took over in August.', 'The new CEO signaled the corporation was due for a major overhaul, during a call with analysts and investors earlier this week. While the production of military and commercial aircraft will remain at the company’s core, it could ditch “some things on the fringe,” Ortberg stated.', '“It’s going to take a lot of work. We’re not going to be able to just wave a wand and clean up these troubled contracts. We signed up to some things that are problematic,” he warned, stating that Boeing would be “better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well.”', 'The corporation has been experiencing an enduring financial crisis, with its defense and space projects troubled by repeated cost overruns and delays, while airliner production has effectively ground to a halt in a weeks-long machinists’ strike.
