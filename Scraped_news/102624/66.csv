Millions of hours of work could have been blotted out in an instant if the Falcon Heavy hadn't kept its 100 percent success rate."", '""It\'s highly stressful, I never enjoy the launches,"" Dr Sascha Kempf, principal investigator for one of the nine instruments on board, told The Register. Kempf has spent the last 20 years on the team and is acutely aware that all that time could be in vain.', ""This is NASA's largest and best equipped interplanetary probe yet. Even with the initial boost from Falcon Heavy's thrusters, it'll take over five years for the circa 6,000 kg (13,000 lb) Clipper to reach Jupiter, by way of gravity slingshots from Mars and the spacecraft's home planet. Once at Jupiter, the surveyor will begin a four-year mission to map, sniff, and probe the ice moon of Europa, considered one of the best prospects for harboring the conditions necessary for life in the Solar System."", ""Jupiter's fourth-largest moon, about 90 percent the size of our own, is entirely covered by a thick shell of ice (believed to be 15 to 25 kilometers deep), which hides a vast ocean of liquid water beneath. This ocean is kept warm by the constant gravitational tugging and kneading from its close orbit around the largest planet in the Solar System. Plumes of liquid erupt from its surface, which could provide evidence about whether Europa's ocean has the conditions necessary to support life."", 'Europa Clipper - click to enlarge', ""NASA has been planning this trip for decades, and these included landing, boring a submarine into the waters below, and now nine carefully designed instruments that will hopefully map the moon's surface, scan its underwater oceans, and find out what Europa's made of."", ""We can't build a spacecraft that could survive orbiting Europa, given Jupiter's fearsome radiation belts that encircle the moon. So, the Clipper will dive through them with most of its hardware encased in a shielded cage. Once out of the danger zone, the data will be trickled back to Earth and we'll find out if Europa is a source of life in the Solar System and its resources."", ""The launch was something Europa's discoverer 17th Century astronomer Galileo Galilei would have loved to see."", ""He's credited with first sighting the moon on January 8, 1610, although a fierce plagiarism fight determined German astronomer Simon Marius may also have spotted it around the same time but not broadcast his notes on time - broadband speeds being someone on a horse in the seventeenth century. Its highly reflective icy surface and size made it an easier spot, and the constantly shifting ice crust makes it one of the smoothest objects in the Solar System, and one of the brightest."", 'Humanity received the first blurry photos of Europa in 1973, when Pioneer 10 shot past, and again a year later with Pioneer 11. The Voyager spacecraft got slightly better images, showing the surface riven with cracks in the ice and - critically - no impact craters, suggesting a surface that was constantly shifting and reforming.', 'Europa in color from Voyager. Source: NASA - Click to enlarge', 'These images inspired Arthur C Clarke to write a sequel to his classic book 2001, named 2010, which postulated using the moon as a possible refueling station for spacecraft. An attempt by Chinese astronauts to do so tragically fails with primitive life under the ice overwhelming the spacecraft.', ""It was - appropriately enough - the Galileo probe in 1995 that sent back the first really good shots of the moon's surface shortly afterward - from a distance of 33,000 kilometers (20,000 miles,) making a total of 11 flybys in all over its eight-year mission - more than any other Jovian satellite."", ""Galileo's magnetometer revealed that Europa likely has a subsurface ocean beneath its icy shell, and also that significant amounts of water can be found on its sister moons Callisto and Ganymede. The three moons also have what's called a 'surface-bound exosphere,' which is a tenuous atmosphere extending above the surface."", ""It's this exosphere that scientists like Kempf and the rest of the team behind the Clipper want to explore, but first they have to get there, and the rest of the Solar System is going to lend a helping hand."", ""The probe's trip to the largest planet in the Solar System is a circuitous one. First the spacecraft is heading off to Mars to pick up some speed."", ""The concept of using a planet for a free speed boost came from UCLA mathematician Michael Minovitch, who used NASA JPL's IBM 7090 - then the fastest supercomputer of its time in 1961 - to solve the three-body problem of orbital computing a year later. Calculating orbits based on two objects, such as the Moon and the Earth, was relatively straightforward, but add another body into the equation - such as the Sun - and there was the potential for some really interesting orbital mechanics. Minovitch's equations were used to boost some of humanity's earliest space probes and the Clipper is no exception."", ""By diving into Mars' gravity well the probe will gain two kilometers a second's worth of velocity, Stefano Campagnola, mission design manager of the mission told The Register. In return the planet will lose an infinitesimal amount of momentum."", '""Mars orbit is technically not in the optimal place to leverage our initial orbit, but we can use its gravity for free (if the timing works), and that saves a lot of propellant."" he explained.', ""Once the probe has been slingshotted around Mars it'll head back to Earth for another gravity assist. That will power it off to Jupiter with enough propellant saved to allow the probe to maneuver into orbit around the gas giant and allow it to swing close to Europa without having to hang around in the dangerous belt of radiation."", ""Campagnola explained how, once in orbit, the Clipper team will use the gravitational influence of Jupiter's four largest moons to adjust the spacecraft's trajectory and allow it to scan most of Europa's surface and swoop down over the surface to sample the conditions. This will preserve the spacecraft's fuel and allow it to possibly extend the mission if the kit on board can hold out long enough."", 'An unshielded human would absorb a killing dose of charged particle radiation every day they were on the surface. But the radiation also causes serious problems for instrumentation, so the Clipper design seeks to put as many of the critical components of the spacecraft in a radiation-hardened repository in the center of the vehicle.', ""For example, Dr Kempf has been on the team designing the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) for the flight, a sniffing device designed to find out what is lurking near Europa's surface. The instrument will store its findings in 8GB of Flash memory housed in the repository and then, as the spacecraft leaves Europa and the radiation shielding, will fire that data back towards Earth."", 'SUDA sniffer is on its way. Source: NASA - Click to enlarge', ""There's not a lot the team can do to protect some of the instrument's components, but everything that can be put in the repository is, he explained. With this design, the whole Clipper team is hoping to extend the life of the probe."", ""Another problem is everyone getting their instruments in the right place. The MAss Spectrometer for Planetary EXploration/Europa (MASPEX) will be used on flights that will go as low as 25 kilometers from the moon's surface, he said, but for the cameras used to map the surface that's too low and the probe will be going too fast - leading to a phenomenon called pixel smearing."", 'The same issues will affect MASPEX instrument, designed to sniff out particles surrounding the moon, or even from inside it, Kelly Miller, group lead at Southwest Research Institute that built the instrument, explained.', ""Eruptions from within Europa have been spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope and it's hoped, if the team is very lucky, that the spacecraft might intercept either one of the plumes or its aftereffects. Doing so would show a lot of information about whether or not Europa could actually be suitable for life."", 'The Clipper is planned to fly by the moon 49 times in the original mission plan, but Miller told The Register that she was hopeful that the instrumentation would hold up for many more flybys. After all, previous NASA missions have extended well past their original planned shutdown dates.', ""But at the end, the Clipper will be destroyed - deliberately. Once all the useful science has been achieved, the team don't want to risk the spacecraft crashing into Europa and contaminating the moon, so instead the spacecraft will be put on a collision course with one of Jupiter's other satellites, Ganymede."", ""It'll be a sad end for a probe that represents possibly our best chances to date for studying the habitability of environments beyond Earth, but the volumes of data transmitted back could reveal vital clues that we are not alone in the Solar System. ®"", 'Send us news', 'The Register Biting the hand that feeds IT', 'Copyright.

Is There Life on Europa?,https://www.404media.co/is-there-life-on-europa/,"['Welcome back to the Abstract! ', 'This week in science got off to a bombastic start with the successful launch of NASA’s Europa Clipper on Monday, marking the beginning of the first dedicated mission to study Jupiter’s tantalizing ocean moon. ', 'The mission will swing into orbit around Jupiter in April 2030 with its sights on Europa, an ice world about the size of our own Moon that bears a vast subsurface ocean. This hidden marine environment has distinguished Europa as one of the most promising targets in the search for extraterrestrial life. ', ""Europa Clipper will perform a series of flybys that will eventually bring it to within 16 miles of the moon’s frozen terrain. While it’s possible that life might exist on the sunlit surface, it would have to endure harsh radiation from Jupiter. There are, perhaps, better odds for life in the liquid water ocean that exists beneath miles of ice, beyond the range of Jupiter’s particle bullets, where the Sun doesn't shine."", ""Photosynthesis would not work in Europa’s dark inner ocean, but the moon may well be geologically active at its seafloor due to the immense tidal forces that Jupiter exerts. Here on Earth, this type of activity opens hydrothermal vents that leak out heated water and chemical energy. Vents are biological hotspots for extremophile organisms that don't need solar power to survive, availing themselves instead of the chemical fuel at these sites through a process called chemosynthesis. "", 'As an added bonus, vent systems are a leading candidate for the cradle of life on Earth, meaning that the first organisms on our planet could have emerged in these environments. You and I and everyone we know may well be the descendants of vent bugs from the dawn of earthly creation! The possibility that vents could have been a biological spark on Earth raises the prospect that similar ecosystems have sprouted up on Europa.', 'Europa Clipper is a recon mission; it won’t actually be able to peer into the moon’s depths to confirm if alien beasties lurk below. Its main goal is to check out the moon up close so it can get better specs on the extent and dynamics of the ocean—which could contain more than twice as much seawater as Earth—which can then help to constrain the habitability of this world. ', 'But as it happens, two studies came out this week that are serendipitously relevant to assessing the odds of life on Europa. I’ll break those down below, and then address the age-old question: Lunarphile or lunarphobe? Finally, we’ll close out with some news from the rodent incest beat. Life finds a way this week, whether it’s in space, in the ocean, or in a space ocean.', 'These Animals Need to Vent ', 'Bright, Monika, “Animal life in the shallow subseafloor crust at deep-sea hydrothermal vents,” Nature Communications', 'As I mentioned above, hydrothermal vents on Earth’s seafloor are ecological metropolises, home to diverse communities of microbes and animals that have been documented in research dives. However, the biosphere underneath these vents, buried deep in the seafloor, has barely been explored.', 'To close this knowledge gap, scientists decided to dig up a chunk of seafloor at a vent system in the East Pacific Ridge at a depth of 1.5 miles underwater. The subterranean seabed was full of life, including animals, which had never been observed in these environments before.', '“While the subseafloor microbial and viral biosphere at deep-sea vents has been described, we show that animal life also exists in this shallow rocky subseafloor province,” said Monika Bright at the University of Vienna and colleagues. “Here we report, to our knowledge for the first time, the discovery of animals excavated from fluid-filled, shallow cavities in the subseafloor of deep-sea hydrothermal vents.”', 'This study is amazing for a few reasons. First, the team gets bonus points for naming their site Fava Flow Suburbs, which sounds like a sick Mario Kart track, and for conducting the observations from a research vessel named after Falkor from The Never-Ending Story, which is excellent luckdragon representation. ', 'But more importantly, the discovery of animal life in these crustal spaces—including tubeworms, regular worms, and snails—reveals that the vent ecosystems are far bigger and more complex than previously known. Hydrothermal vents are clearly resilient and dynamic pockets of habitability, which is good news for people holding out for alien life on Europa. It’s also a reason to protect these environments on Earth from human-driven threats, such as deep-sea mining.', '“The study of the subseafloor biosphere for animal life has just begun,” Bright and her colleagues said. “The uniqueness of active hydrothermal vents is well recognized, and protection against potential future anthropogenic impact such as deep-sea mining has been suggested or is in place. The discovery of animal habitats in the crustal subseafloor, the extent of which is currently unknown, increases the urgency of such protections.”', 'In other news…', ' Mars Is a Death Trap….Except for Maybe This Lil Part', 'Khuller, Aditya et al, “Potential for photosynthesis on Mars within snow and ice,” Communications Earth & Environment', 'Let’s keep the alien ball rolling here, but pass it on over to Mars. Most searches for life on the red planet, including NASA’s Perseverance mission, are focused on finding fossils from its hospitable heyday some 3.5 billion years ago, when liquid water rivers flowed and lakes pooled on its surface. ', 'Since that time, Mars’ atmosphere and magnetic field have collapsed, exposing its landscape to damaging ultraviolet radiation, which has dehydrated the planet. Life on Mars would need to retreat into subterranean water reservoirs to survive, so the thinking goes, putting it out of reach of our missions. ', 'Now, however, scientists have proposed that life could potentially exist at the Martian surface in pockets of meltwater shielded by ice cover that is clear enough to allow sunlight through for photosynthesis.', '“Our analysis shows that despite higher surface ultraviolet radiation levels on Mars than on Earth, it is possible for terrestrial photosynthetic organisms to find locations within exposed ice on Mars with favorable solar radiative conditions,” said Aditya Khuller of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and colleagues. ', '“These potential present-day habitats are centimeters to meters below the surface and could be the most easily accessible locations to find extant life on Mars via future robotic and human missions,” the team concluded.', 'In other words, legit Martian microbes could be hanging out in these lightly dusted ice patches, close enough to the surface that we could probably drive a rover right up to them to say hi. ', 'It’s also possible, of course, that Mars is lifeless, and always has been. But this study, along with the above story about  hydrothermal vents, hints that organisms have opportunities to emerge and persist in all kinds of habitable zones on a planet, even if that world is otherwise not all that welcoming to life. That’s worth keeping in mind as Europa Clipper embarks on its journey to a world that may contain habitable zones both in its irradiated surface ice, and in seafloor vents far below.', 'Lunarphobe or a Lunarphile? Tropical Forest Edition', 'Bischof, Richard, “The moon’s influence on the activity of tropical forest mammals,” Proceedings of the Royal Society B', 'Humans are highly attuned to the phases of the Moon, a preoccupation that has inspired lunar calendars, rich folklore, and alleged werewolf outbreaks. Now, scientists have observed how the lunar cycle influences animals that live on forest floors sheltered by dense tropical canopies. ', 'A team observed 86 mammal species in protected forests on three continents and discovered that even in these environments, where hardly any moonlight penetrates through the trees, wildlife is still affected by the phases of the Moon. Some were “lunar phobic,” and avoided moonlight, while others exhibited “lunar philia” and were attracted to it.', '“Half of all species in our study responded to lunar phases, either changing how nocturnal they were, altering their overall level of activity, or both,” said Richard Bischof of the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and colleagues. “Avoidance of full moon was more common, exhibited by 30% of all species compared with 20% of species that exhibited attraction. Nocturnal species, especially rodents, were over-represented among species that avoided full moon.”', 'The study is interesting not only for its identification of freaky lunarphiles—looking at you, four-toed elephant shrew—but also because it highlights yet another disruption that stems from deforestation.', '“Our findings indicate that lunar phases influence animal behavior even beneath the forest canopy,” the team said. “Such impacts may be exacerbated in degraded and fragmented forests.” ', 'An Update on the Weird Mammal that Thinks It’s a Bug  ', 'Leedale, Amy et al “Kin recognition for incest avoidance in Damaraland mole-rats”, Proceedings of the Royal Society B', 'Last but not least, an update on incest avoidance in the Damaraland mole-rat. Any study on mole-rats catches my attention because these creatures are simply delightful. They are the only mammals to exhibit eusociality, the highest form of social organization in nature, which is normally the domain of ants and bees. ', 'Mole-rats, like those insects, anoint a queen who is solely responsible for reproduction, while workers support the colony’s needs. But though it is very trippy for a mammal to just up and live a bug’s life, it also raises challenges for ensuring genetic diversity. ', 'To that end, scientists set out to learn how mole-rats avoid inbreeding by rearing females and males together, and apart. They found that the rodents tend to mate and reproduce with partners that are unfamiliar to them, regardless of how genetically close they were to those partners. ', '“Here, we aim to determine the mechanism of kin recognition for incest avoidance in the Damaraland mole-rat Fukomys damarensis,” said Amy E. Leedale of the University of Salford and colleagues. “We found that unfamiliar pairs were more likely to engage in sexual behaviors and bred more successfully than familiar pairs, regardless of their genetic similarity. Females paired with unfamiliar males were also more likely to exhibit reproductive activation, characterized by increased levels of oestradiol and progesterone.” ', '“This study shows that in Damaraland mole-rats, inbreeding avoidance can be achieved through a discrimination mechanism that relies on association during rearing,” the team concluded. In this way, mole-rats have evolved to enhance genetic diversity by exhibiting a preference for strange bedfellows.

Hurricane Milton just pushed Earth away from Jupiter: NASA warns of unexpected effect,https://www.eldiario24.com/en/hurricane-milton-just-pushed-earth-away/2352/,"['mossandfog.com', 'A brewing hurricane has once again led NASA to pause its launch. Hurricane Milton has just caused the earth to move away from Jupiter and it was something unexpected. NASA’s next mission is called Europa Clipper. The project, which was initially scheduled to investigate Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is currently facing delays since the hurricane interfered with crucial launch preparations.', 'The hurricane storm struck in Florida close to where SpaceX’s facilities utilised to launch similar projects are located. This whole situation has affected both the logistics and infrastructure of this initiative. This “push away” metaphor illustrates how the violent hurricane has indirectly postponed an important space exploration endeavour, diverting focus from Jupiter’s system.', 'Europa is one of Jupiter’s icy moons which has been the apple of scientists’ eyes because they believe it has the potential to produce life. Underneath the icy surface is believed to be a huge salty ocean. Earth has a salty ocean and therefore it makes sense for this discovery to be a trigger for scientists to explore further. NASA’s Europa Clipper mission will explore this moon and collect vital information that may provide answers on its habitability.', 'This entire mission serves to comprehend whether Europa’s ocean can support life, and in this case, it would revolutionise the way we see planets beyond Earth. Launching such a bold mission, however, necessitates exact time and resource coordination. The Clipper spacecraft will be sent to Jupiter using SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, which depends on a number of ground-based support systems and infrastructure.', 'Hurricane Milton has disrupted crucial launch preparations at Florida’s Kennedy Space Centre, which is essential to these operations. The effects have gone beyond the infrastructure, it has disrupted the time frame and plans that these scientists have placed in order. NASA initially scheduled the Europa Clipper mission launch for October 2024 in order to maximise travel time by matching Jupiter’s location with respect to Earth.', 'As NASA and SpaceX are working tirelessly to adjust to all these disruptions, the delay in to launch of this project could throw away the whole packaged execution out the window, which is a frustration on their end. The spacecraft could potentially take time to reach Jupiter and in this instance, it could take months, if not years to mission timeline putting Earth at a greater distance from a ground-breaking moon exploring the mission of Jupiter.', 'The Europa Clipper mission’s disruption by Hurricane Milton also highlights how susceptible space missions are to Earthly natural disasters. Events like hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires can have a significant impact on activities that rely on physical infrastructure, even though most people consider space exploration to be distinct from earthly problems.', 'At this point, it is quite difficult to point out a solution or to foresee what could be next because this is all because of a natural disaster that cannot be controlled or stopped. NASA just has the priority that itself and SpaceX recover from all these disappointments. According to preliminary information, launch pads and support equipment may be able to be fixed in a few months despite sustaining moderate damage.', 'This indicates that although the launch of the Europa Clipper mission may be postponed, it is not completely doomed. NASA expects that, albeit not as quickly as anticipated, we will nevertheless get closer to discovering Europa’s mysteries. Senior launch director at NASA’s Launch Services Program said in a statement,', '“Once we have the ‘all-clear’ followed by facility assessment and any recovery actions, we will determine the next launch opportunity for this NASA flagship mission.”', '© 2024 by El Diario 24', '']"
Europa Clipper Is One of Two Missions on The Way To See if Jupiter’s Moons Support Life,https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/europa-clipper-is-one-of-two-missions-on-the-way-to-see-if-jupiters-moons,"['On Oct. 14, 2024, NASA launched a robotic spacecraft named Europa Clipperto Jupiter’s moons. Clipper will reach the ice-covered Jovian moon Europa in 2030 and spend several years collecting and sending valuable data on the moon’s potential habitability back to Earth.', 'Clipper isn’t the only mission highlighting researchers’ interest in Jupiter and its moons.', 'On April 13, 2023, the European Space Agency launched a rocket carrying a spacecraft destined for Jupiter. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer– or JUICE – will spend at least three years on Jupiter’s moons after it arrives in 2031.', 'I’m a planetary scientist who studies the structure and evolution of solid planets and moons in the solar system.', 'There are many reasons my colleagues and I are looking forward to getting the data that Europa Clipper and JUICE will hopefully be sending back to Earth in the 2030s. But perhaps the most exciting information will have to do with water. Three of Jupiter’s moons – Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – are home to large, underground oceans of liquid water that could support life.', 'Jupiter has dozens of moons. Four of them, in particular, are of interest to planetary scientists.', 'Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are, like Earth’s Moon, relatively large, spherical, complex worlds. Two previous NASA missions have sent spacecraft to orbit the Jupiter system and collected data on these moons. The Galileo mission orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003 and led to geological discoveries on all four large moons. The Juno mission is still orbiting Jupiter today and has provided scientists with an unprecedented view into Jupiter’s composition, structure, and space environment.', 'These missions and other observations revealed that Io, the closest of the four to its host planet, is abuzz withgeological activity, including lava lakes, volcanic eruptions, and tectonically formed mountains. But it is not home to large amounts of water.', 'Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, in contrast, have icy landscapes. Europa’s surface is a frozen wonderland with a young but complex history, possibly including icy analogs of plate tectonics and volcanoes. Ganymede, the largest moon in the entire solar system, is bigger than Mercury and has its own magnetic field generated internally from a liquid metal core. Callisto appears somewhat inert compared to the others but serves as a valuable time capsule of an ancient past that is no longer accessible on the youthful surfaces of Europa and Io.', 'Most exciting of all, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto all almost certainly possess underground oceans of liquid water.', 'Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto have chilly surfaces that are hundreds of degrees below zero. At these temperatures, ice behaves like solid rock.', 'But just like Earth, the deeper underground you go on these moons, the hotter it gets. Go down far enough, and you eventually reach the temperature where ice melts into water. Exactly how far down this transition occurs on each of the moons is a subject of debate that scientists hope to resolve with JUICE and Europa Clipper. While the exact depths are still uncertain, scientists are confident that these oceans exist.', 'The best evidence of these oceans comes from Jupiter’s magnetic field. Saltwater is electrically conductive. So, as these moons travel through Jupiter’s magnetic field, they generate a secondary, smaller magnetic field that signals to researchers the presence of an underground ocean. Using this technique, planetary scientists have been able to show that the three moons contain underground oceans. And these oceans are not small – Europa’s ocean alone might have more than double the water of all of Earth’s oceans combined.', 'An obvious and tantalizing next question is whether these oceans can support extraterrestrial life. Liquid water is an important part of what makes for a habitable world, but it is far from the only requirement for life. Life also needs energy and certain chemical compounds, in addition to water, to flourish. Because these oceans are hidden beneath miles of solid ice, sunlight and photosynthesis are out. But it’s possible other sources could provide the needed ingredients.', 'On Europa, for example, the liquid water ocean overlays a rocky interior. That rocky seafloor could provide energy and chemicals through underwater volcanoes that could make Europa’s ocean habitable. But it is also possible that Europa’s ocean is a sterile, inhospitable place – scientists need more data to answer these questions.', 'Europa Clipper and JUICE are set up to give scientists game-changing information about the potential habitability of Jupiter’s moons. While both missions will gather data on multiple moons, JUICE will spend time orbiting and focusing on Ganymede, and Europa Clipper will make dozens of close flybys of Europa.', 'Both of the spacecraft will carry a suite of scientific instruments built specifically to investigate the oceans. Onboard radar will allow Europa Clipper and JUICE to probe into the moons’outer layers of solid ice. Radar could reveal any small pockets of liquid water in the ice or, in the case of Europa, which has a thinner outer ice layer than Ganymede and Callisto, hopefully detect the larger ocean.', 'Magnetometers will also be on both missions. These tools will give scientists the opportunity to study the secondary magnetic fields produced by the interaction of conductive oceans with Jupiter’s field in great detail and will hopefully give researchers clues to salinity and volumes of the oceans.', 'Scientists will also observe small variations in the moons’ gravitational pulls by tracking subtle movements in both spacecrafts’ orbits, which could help determine if Europa’s seafloor has volcanoes that provide the needed energy and chemistry for the ocean to support life.', 'Finally, both crafts will carry a host of cameras and light sensors that will provide unprecedented images of the geology and composition of the moon’s icy surfaces.', 'Maybe one day, a spacecraft will be able to drill through the miles of solid ice on Europa, Ganymede or Callisto and explore oceans directly. Until then, observations from spacecraft like Europa Clipper and JUICE are scientists’ best bet for learning about these ocean worlds.', 'When Galileo discovered these moons in 1609, they were the first objects known to orbit another planet directly. Their discovery was the final nail in the coffin of the theory that Earth – and humanity – resides at the center of the universe. Maybe these worlds have another humbling surprise in store.', 'This article, originally published April 10, 2023, has been updated with details about the Europa Clipper launch.', 'Mike Sori is an Assistant Professor of Planetary Science at Purdue University.

"The Marshall Star for October 16, 2024",https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/the-marshall-star-for-october-16-2024/,"['NASA’s Europa Clipper has embarked on its long voyage to Jupiter, where it will investigate Europa, a moon with an enormous subsurface ocean that may have conditions to support life. The spacecraft launched at 11:06 a.m. CDT on Oct. 14 aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.', 'The largest spacecraft NASA ever built for a mission headed to another planet, Europa Clipper also is the first NASA mission dedicated to studying an ocean world beyond Earth. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 billion miles on a trajectory that will leverage the power of gravity assists, first to Mars in four months and then back to Earth for another gravity assist flyby in 2026. After it begins orbiting Jupiter in April 2030, the spacecraft will fly past Europa 49 times.', '“Congratulations to our Europa Clipper team for beginning the first journey to an ocean world beyond Earth,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “NASA leads the world in exploration and discovery, and the Europa Clipper mission is no different. By exploring the unknown, Europa Clipper will help us better understand whether there is the potential for life not just within our solar system, but among the billions of moons and planets beyond our Sun.”', 'Approximately five minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s second stage fired up and the payload fairing, or the rocket’s nose cone, opened to reveal Europa Clipper. About an hour after launch, the spacecraft separated from the rocket. Ground controllers received a signal soon after, and two-way communication was established at 12:13 p.m. with NASA’s Deep Space Network facility in Canberra, Australia. Mission teams celebrated as initial telemetry reports showed Europa Clipper is in good health and operating as expected.', '“We could not be more excited for the incredible and unprecedented science NASA’s Europa Clipper mission will deliver in the generations to come,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. “Everything in NASA science is interconnected, and Europa Clipper’s scientific discoveries will build upon the legacy that our other missions exploring Jupiter – including Juno, Galileo, and Voyager – created in our search for habitable worlds beyond our home planet.”', 'The main goal of the mission is to determine whether Europa has conditions that could support life. Europa is about the size of our own Moon, but its interior is different. Information from NASA’s Galileo mission in the 1990s showed strong evidence that under Europa’s ice lies an enormous, salty ocean with more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined. Scientists also have found evidence that Europa may host organic compounds and energy sources under its surface.', 'If the mission determines Europa is habitable, it may mean there are more habitable worlds in our solar system and beyond than imagined.', '“We’re ecstatic to send Europa Clipper on its way to explore a potentially habitable ocean world, thanks to our colleagues and partners who’ve worked so hard to get us to this day,” said Laurie Leshin, director, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). “Europa Clipper will undoubtedly deliver mind-blowing science. While always bittersweet to send something we’ve labored over for years off on its long journey, we know this remarkable team and spacecraft will expand our knowledge of our solar system and inspire future exploration.”', 'In 2031, the spacecraft will begin conducting its science-dedicated flybys of Europa. Coming as close as 16 miles to the surface, Europa Clipper is equipped with nine science instruments and a gravity experiment, including an ice-penetrating radar, cameras, and a thermal instrument to look for areas of warmer ice and any recent eruptions of water. As the most sophisticated suite of science instruments NASA has ever sent to Jupiter, they will work in concert to learn more about the moon’s icy shell, thin atmosphere, and deep interior.', 'To power those instruments in the faint sunlight that reaches Jupiter, Europa Clipper also carries the largest solar arrays NASA has ever used for an interplanetary mission. With arrays extended, the spacecraft spans 100 feet from end to end. With propellant loaded, it weighs about 13,000 pounds.', 'In all, more than 4,000 people have contributed to Europa Clipper mission since it was formally approved in 2015.', '“As Europa Clipper embarks on its journey, I’ll be thinking about the countless hours of dedication, innovation, and teamwork that made this moment possible,” said Jordan Evans, project manager, JPL. “This launch isn’t just the next chapter in our exploration of the solar system; it’s a leap toward uncovering the mysteries of another ocean world, driven by our shared curiosity and continued search to answer the question, ‘are we alone?’”', 'Europa Clipper’s three main science objectives are to determine the thickness of the moon’s icy shell and its interactions with the ocean below, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission’s detailed exploration of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond our planet.', 'Managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California, JPL leads the development of the Europa Clipper mission in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.

This research helps connect two cosmic mysteries and provides information about the environment around some of the bigger types of black holes.', 'This artist’s illustration shows a disk of material (red, orange, and yellow) that was created after a supermassive black hole (depicted on the right) tore apart a star through intense tidal forces. Over the course of a few years, this disk expanded outward until it intersected with another object – either a star or a small black hole – that is also in orbit around the giant black hole. Each time this object crashes into the disk, it sends out a burst of X-rays detected by Chandra. The inset shows Chandra data (purple) and an optical image of the source from Pan-STARRS (red, green, and blue).', 'In 2019, an optical telescope in California noticed a burst of light that astronomers later categorized as a “tidal disruption event”, or TDE. These are cases where black holes tear stars apart if they get too close through their powerful tidal forces. Astronomers gave this TDE the name of AT2019qiz.', 'Meanwhile, scientists were also tracking instances of another type of cosmic phenomena occasionally observed across the Universe. These were brief and regular bursts of X-rays that were near supermassive black holes. Astronomers named these events “quasi-periodic eruptions,” or QPEs.', 'This latest study gives scientists evidence that TDEs and QPEs are likely connected. The researchers think that QPEs arise when an object smashes into the disk left behind after the TDE. While there may be other explanations, the authors of the study propose this is the source of at least some QPEs.', 'In 2023, astronomers used both Chandra and Hubble to simultaneously study the debris left behind after the tidal disruption had ended. The Chandra data were obtained during three different observations, each separated by about 4 to 5 hours. The total exposure of about 14 hours of Chandra time revealed only a weak signal in the first and last chunk, but a very strong signal in the middle observation.', 'From there, the researchers used NASA’s Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) to look frequently at AT2019qiz for repeated X-ray bursts. The NICER data showed that AT2019qiz erupts roughly every 48 hours. Observations from NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and India’s AstroSat telescope cemented the finding.', 'The ultraviolet data from Hubble, obtained at the same time as the Chandra observations, allowed the scientists to determine the size of the disk around the supermassive black hole. They found that the disk had become large enough that if any object was orbiting the black hole and took about a week or less to complete an orbit, it would collide with the disk and cause eruptions.', 'This result has implications for searching for more quasi-periodic eruptions associated with tidal disruptions. Finding more of these would allow astronomers to measure the prevalence and distances of objects in close orbits around supermassive black holes. Some of these may be excellent targets for the planned future gravitational wave observatories.', 'The paper describing these results appears in the Oct. 9 issue of the journal Nature. The first author of the paper is Matt Nicholl of Queen’s University Belfast in Ireland.', 'NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center manages the Chandra program. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s Chandra X-ray Center controls science operations from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and flight operations from Burlington, Massachusetts.', '› Back to Top', 'The study of X-ray emission from astronomical objects reveals secrets about the universe at the largest and smallest spatial scales. Celestial X-rays are produced by black holes consuming nearby stars, emitted by the million-degree gas that traces the structure between galaxies, and can be used to predict whether stars may be able to host planets hospitable to life. X-ray observations have shown that most of the visible matter in the universe exists as hot gas between galaxies and have conclusively demonstrated that the presence of “dark matter” is needed to explain galaxy cluster dynamics, that dark matter dominates the mass of galaxy clusters, and that it governs the expansion of the cosmos.', 'X-ray observations also enable us to probe mysteries of the universe on the smallest scales. X-ray observations of compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes allow us to use the universe as a physics laboratory to study conditions that are orders of magnitude more extreme in terms of density, pressure, temperature, and magnetic field strength than anything that can be produced on Earth. In this astrophysical laboratory, researchers expect to reveal new physics at the subatomic scale by conducting investigations such as probing the neutron star equation of state and testing quantum electrodynamics with observations of neutron star atmospheres.', 'At NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, a team of scientists and engineers is building, testing, and flying innovative optics that bring the universe’s X-ray mysteries into sharper focus.', 'Unlike optical telescopes that create images by reflecting or refracting light at near-90-degree angles (normal incidence), focusing X-ray optics must be designed to reflect light at very small angles (grazing incidence). At normal incidence, X-rays are either absorbed by the surface of a mirror or penetrate it entirely. However, at grazing angles of incidence, X-rays reflect very efficiently due to an effect called total external reflection. In grazing incidence, X-rays reflect off the surface of a mirror like rocks skipping on the surface of a pond.', 'A classic design for astronomical grazing incidence optics is the Wolter-I prescription, which consists of two reflecting surfaces, a parabola and hyperbola (see figure below). This optical prescription is revolved around the optical axis to produce a full-shell mirror (i.e., the mirror spans the full circumference) that resembles a gently tapered cone. To increase the light collecting area, multiple mirror shells with incrementally larger diameters and a common focus are fabricated and nested concentrically to comprise a mirror module assembly (MMA).', 'Focusing optics are critical to studying the X-ray universe because, in contrast to other optical systems like collimators or coded masks, they produce high signal-to-noise images with low background noise. Two key metrics that characterize the performance of X-ray optics are angular resolution, which is the ability of an optical system to discriminate between closely spaced objects, and effective area, which is the light collecting area of the telescope, typically quoted in units of cm2. Angular resolution is typically measured as the half-power diameter (HPD) of a focused spot in units of arcseconds. The HPD encircles half of the incident photons in a focused spot and measures the sharpness of the final image; a smaller number is better. ', 'Marshall has been building and flying lightweight, full-shell, focusing X-ray optics for over three decades, always meeting or exceeding angular resolution and effective area requirements. Marshall utilizes an electroformed nickel replication technique to make these thin full-shell X-ray optics from nickel alloy.', 'X-ray optics development at Marshall began in the early 1990s with the fabrication of optics to support NASA’s Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF-S) and then continued via the Constellation-X technology development programs. In 2001, Marshall launched a balloon payload that included two modules each with three mirrors, which produced the first focused hard X-ray images of an astrophysical source by imaging Cygnus X-1, GRS 1915, and the Crab Nebula. This initial effort resulted in several follow-up missions over the next 12 years and became known as the High Energy Replicated Optics (HERO) balloon program.', 'In 2012, the first of four sounding rocket flights of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) flew with Marshall optics onboard, producing the first focused images of the Sun at energies greater than 5 keV. In 2019 the Astronomical Roentgen Telescope X-ray Concentrator (ART-XC) instrument on the Spectr-Roentgen-Gamma Mission launched with seven Marshall-fabricated X-ray MMAs, each containing 28 mirror shells. ART-XC is currently mapping the sky in the 4-30 keV hard X-ray energy range, studying exotic objects like neutron stars in our own galaxy as well as active galactic nuclei, which are spread across the visible universe. In 2021, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), flew and is now performing extraordinary science with a Marshall-led team using three, 24-shell MMAs that were fabricated and calibrated in-house.', 'Most recently, in 2024, the fourth FOXSI sounding rocket campaign launched with a high-resolution Marshall MMA. The optics achieved 9.5 arcsecond HPD angular resolution during pre-flight test with an expected 7 arcsecond HPD in gravity-free flight, making this the highest angular resolution flight observation made with a nickel-replicated X-ray optic. Currently Marshall is fabricating an MMA for the Rocket Experiment Demonstration of a Soft X-ray (REDSoX) polarimeter, a sounding rocket mission that will fly a novel soft X-ray polarimeter instrument to observe active galactic nuclei. The REDSoX MMA optic will be 444 mm in diameter, which will make it the largest MMA ever produced by MSFC and the second largest replicated nickel X-ray optic in the world.', 'The ultimate performance of an X-ray optic is determined by errors in the shape, position, and roughness of the optical surface. To push the performance of X-ray optics toward even higher angular resolution and achieve more ambitious science goals, Marshall is currently engaged in a fundamental research and development effort to improve all aspects of full-shell optics fabrication.', 'Given that these optics are made with the electroformed nickel replication technique, the fabrication process begins with creation of a replication master, called the mandrel, which is a negative of the desired optical surface. First, the mandrel is figured and polished to specification, then a thin layer of nickel alloy is electroformed onto the mandrel surface. Next, the nickel alloy layer is removed to produce a replicated optical shell, and finally the thin shell is attached to a stiff holding structure for use.', 'Each step in this process imparts some degree of error into the final replicated shell. Research and development efforts at Marshall are currently concentrating on reducing distortion induced during the electroforming metal deposition and release steps. Electroforming-induced distortion is caused by material stress built into the electroformed material as it deposits onto the mandrel. Decreasing release-induced distortion is a matter of reducing adhesion strength between the shell and mandrel, increasing strength of the shell material to prevent yielding, and reducing point defects in the release layer.', 'Additionally, verifying the performance of these advanced optics requires world-class test facilities. The basic premise of testing an optic designed for X-ray astrophysics is to place a small, bright X-ray source far away from the optic. If the angular size of the source, as viewed from the optic, is smaller than the angular resolution of the optic, the source is effectively simulating X-ray starlight. Due to the absorption of X-rays by air, the entire test facility light path must be placed inside a vacuum chamber.', 'At the center, a group of scientists and engineers operate the Marshall 100-meter X-ray beamline, a world-class end-to-end test facility for flight and laboratory X-ray optics, instruments, and telescopes. As per the name, it consists of a 100-meter-long vacuum tube with an 8-meter-long, 3-meter-diameter instrument chamber and a variety of X-ray sources ranging from 0.25 – 114 keV. Across the street sits the X-Ray and Cryogenic Facility (XRCF), a 527-meter-long beamline with an 18-meter-long, 6-meter-diameter instrument chamber. These facilities are available for the scientific community to use and highlight the comprehensive optics development and test capability that Marshall is known for.', 'Within the X-ray astrophysics community there exist a variety of angular resolution and effective area needs for focusing optics. Given its storied history in X-ray optics, Marshall is uniquely poised to fulfill requirements for large or small, medium- or high-angular-resolution X-ray optics. To help guide technology development, the astrophysics community convenes once per decade to produce a decadal survey. The need for high-angular-resolution and high-throughput X-ray optics is strongly endorsed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s.In pursuit of this goal, Marshall is continuing to advance the state of the art in full-shell optics. This work will enable the extraordinary mysteries of the X-ray universe to be revealed.', '› Back to Top', 'NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and New Horizons spacecraft simultaneously set their sights on Uranus recently, allowing scientists to make a direct comparison of the planet from two very different viewpoints. The results inform future plans to study like types of planets around other stars.', 'Astronomers used Uranus as a proxy for similar planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, comparing high-resolution images from Hubble to the more-distant view from New Horizons. This combined perspective will help scientists learn more about what to expect while imaging planets around other stars with future telescopes.', '“While we expected Uranus to appear differently in each filter of the observations, we found that Uranus was actually dimmer than predicted in the New Horizons data taken from a different viewpoint,” said lead author Samantha Hasler of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and New Horizons science team collaborator.', 'Direct imaging of exoplanets is a key technique for learning about their potential habitability, and offers new clues to the origin and formation of our own solar system. Astronomers use both direct imaging and spectroscopy to collect light from the observed planet and compare its brightness at different wavelengths. However, imaging exoplanets is a notoriously difficult process because they’re so far away. Their images are mere pinpoints and so are not as detailed as the close-up views that we have of worlds orbiting our Sun. Researchers can also only directly image exoplanets at “partial phases,” when only a portion of the planet is illuminated by their star as seen from Earth.', 'Uranus was an ideal target as a test for understanding future distant observations of exoplanets by other telescopes for a few reasons. First, many known exoplanets are also gas giants similar in nature. Also, at the time of the observations, New Horizons was on the far side of Uranus, 6.5 billion miles away, allowing its twilight crescent to be studied – something that cannot be done from Earth. At that distance, the New Horizons view of the planet was just several pixels in its color camera, called the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera.', 'On the other hand, Hubble, with its high resolution, and in its low-Earth orbit 1.7 billion miles away from Uranus, was able to see atmospheric features such as clouds and storms on the day side of the gaseous world.', '“Uranus appears as just a small dot on the New Horizons observations, similar to the dots seen of directly imaged exoplanets from observatories like Webb or ground-based observatories,” Hasler said. “Hubble provides context for what the atmosphere is doing when it was observed with New Horizons.”', 'The gas giant planets in our solar system have dynamic and variable atmospheres with changing cloud cover. How common is this among exoplanets? By knowing the details of what the clouds on Uranus looked like from Hubble, researchers can verify what is interpreted from the New Horizons data. In the case of Uranus, both Hubble and New Horizons saw that the brightness did not vary as the planet rotated, which indicates that the cloud features were not changing with the planet’s rotation.', 'However, the importance of the detection by New Horizons has to do with how the planet reflects light at a different phase than what Hubble, or other observatories on or near Earth, can see. New Horizons showed that exoplanets may be dimmer than predicted at partial and high phase angles, and that the atmosphere reflects light differently at partial phase.', 'NASA has two major upcoming observatories in the works to advance studies of exoplanet atmospheres and potential habitability.', '“These landmark New Horizons studies of Uranus from a vantage point unobservable by any other means add to the mission’s treasure trove of new scientific knowledge, and have, like many other datasets obtained in the mission, yielded surprising new insights into the worlds of our solar system,” added New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute.', 'NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, set to launch by 2027, will use a coronagraph to block out a star’s light to directly see gas giant exoplanets. NASA’s Habitable Worlds Observatory, in an early planning phase, will be the first telescope designed specifically to search for atmospheric biosignatures on Earth-sized, rocky planets orbiting other stars.', '“Studying how known benchmarks like Uranus appear in distant imaging can help us have more robust expectations when preparing for these future missions,” concluded Hasler. “And that will be critical to our success.”', 'Launched in January 2006, New Horizons made the historic flyby of Pluto and its moons in July 2015, before giving humankind its first close-up look at one of these planetary building block and Kuiper Belt object, Arrokoth, in January 2019.

So why Europa instead of these other two moons?', '', ""WONG: On Europa specifically, we think that its subterranean ocean holds at least twice as much water as all of Earth's combined. And so it's a tiny moon, roughly the same size as Earth's moon, which is bone dry. But it's got twice as much water, if not more, hiding underneath its icy crust as all of Earth's oceans combined. And that, when I first heard that, that blew my mind. And I was like, OK, let's go looking for life there."", '', ""BARBER: Today on the show, the hunt for life on Europa.

I'm Regina Barber, and you're listening to Short Wave, the science podcast from NPR."", '', 'BARBER: OK, so Mike, we have these hints about what Europa is like. But what do we actually, like, scientifically know about this moon?', '', ""WONG: Yeah. We're pretty sure that Europa has a global liquid water ocean that is somewhat salty. This is because of the way that Europa responds to Jupiter's magnetic field. So it would take a salty ocean with these salt ions in it to basically change the local magnetic fields around the moon. And this was sensed by the Galileo spacecraft, which visited Jupiter and swung by Europa and was able to use its magnetometer, the thing that measures the magnetic field, to sense that there was something bizarre happening when it flew by Europa. And after scientists did a bunch of physics--"", '', 'BARBER: Bizarre, OK.', '', 'WONG: Yeah. It was like, oh, OK. The only thing that could really explain this kind of magnetic anomaly was if there was something conducting electricity inside of Europa. And--', '', 'BARBER: What?', '', 'WONG: Yeah. And so the only plausible explanation was that, what if there was a salty ocean beneath that ice crust? And the more we learned about Europa, the more evidence that we gathered that sort of, like, corroborates this idea that, yeah, because Europa is an orbital resonance with several of the other moons in the Jovian system--', '', ""BARBER: It's just getting pulled by all these other moons."", '', ""WONG: Exactly. And that friction of being pulled and squashed, mostly by Jupiter's gravity as it orbits in its sort of oval-shaped orbit, that would supply the heat, the thermal energy, required to keep Europa's ocean liquid instead of just freezing up at those distant, frigid temperatures-- 25 times less sunlight out at Europa than here at Earth."", '', ""BARBER: So this isn't the first trip that we've put out there, like, to learn more about these icy moons in our solar system. There's also the Cassini mission that collected data around Saturn starting in 2004. Like, why was that mission such a big deal?"", '', ""WONG: So the Cassini mission was this flagship mission that was sort of a jack of all trades, explore the Saturn system in all its glory. And the Saturn system has a lot to offer. I mean, there's Saturn itself, which is a beautiful gas giant planet. It's got its amazing ring system and then dozens of moons that are all intrinsically valuable and worth exploring, two of which could potentially host life. That's Enceladus and Titan. And so we learned, from the Cassini mission, that the icy ocean world Enceladus, which is kind of like a mini version of Europa, also has a global liquid water ocean and has the kind of chemistry that results from hydrothermal systems, which are a leading geochemical environment for the origin of life. And we suspect that similar hydrothermal conditions would exist at the bottom of Europa's ocean as well."", '', ""BARBER: Yeah. I mean, scientists, like, they don't know for sure if there are hydrothermal vents there. But the Cassini mission, it got water shot at it by Enceladus. That's also a reason why this mission was such a big deal."", '', ""WONG: Yeah. So Enceladus does this brilliant thing that it just sprays part of its ocean into space all the time. It's got these perennial geysers shooting out of its south pole. And the geyser material originates in Enceladus' liquid water ocean. So by flying through this geyser and sampling the chemistry of the particles that have emerged from the geyser, you actually get to sample something that came from its liquid water ocean. Enceladus is just constantly pouring its guts out for us to sample. And luckily, the Cassini orbiter was there to actually taste that and get to know the chemistry of the ocean. Europa is a bit more cagey."", '', ""BARBER: But the Cassini data from these water samples weren't definitive. Like, we don't know for sure if there's life in that ocean. But there are building blocks for life, which is fascinating. That's a whole other episode."", '', 'WONG: Yeah.', '', ""BARBER: And Cassini, it's not around anymore, because, like, in 2017, it was sent into Saturn's atmosphere to burn up."", '', 'WONG: Yes.', '', ""BARBER: Because NASA, in the event any of these moons did have like the tiniest inkling of life, they didn't want that spacecraft, with possible microbes on it from Earth, to accidentally contaminate any other place."", '', ""WONG: Exactly. Right, because there might be tiny microbes that, despite scientists' best abilities of scrubbing these instruments clean, still hitched a ride to the outer solar system. And if one of those microbes-- and we know microbes are really hardy creatures. They can go into these protective, spore-like stages of their life cycle and just hang out in really harsh environments and then reanimate themselves when they get a more habitable condition. You can crash land on one of these habitable moons, and then you start to infect it, basically, like an infection from Earth. And that's not what we want."", '', ""BARBER: So OK. We've talked a little bit about history of these Saturn moons. Let's go back to Jupiter's moon, Europa, where we started here. Like you said, the Clipper is going to fly by. Why not land on Europa?"", '', ""WONG: Yeah. So Europa is constantly being pummeled by the radiation in Jupiter's magnetosphere. And so a lander, or even an orbiter around Europa, wouldn't last very long. Its instruments would be fried. And that's why Europa Clipper has this super wide, elongated orbit where it actually orbits Jupiter and makes these flybys of Europa. But one thing that people maybe forget about is that the radiation on Europa, despite it being very dangerous to our spacecraft, might be the key to why Europa is habitable, or at least one of the keys. So all life as we know it basically needs to eat and it needs to breathe. So we eat food and we breathe oxygen. But there's many different ways of making a living. Certain microbes literally eat and breathe rock. So you can eat and breathe whatever you want. There just needs to be things to eat and breathe. On Europa, where would the breath, that sort of oxygen, come from? We think the fact that its icy surface is constantly being slammed by these energetic particles. And when you break apart water, you break apart H2O, you get hydrogen, you get oxygen. The hydrogen is super light, so it escapes off into space. And the oxygen is left behind. And so Europa's surface might be coated in, basically, oxygen that is created by this radiation. And if that oxygen is then able to get into the ocean, that could supply the ocean with the oxygen needed for Europan life to breathe."", '', 'BARBER: OK, OK. So will there be any inkling of life on Europa that anyone in the astrobiology community can call life?', '', 'WONG: I get asked this question all the time. And I always have to clarify, is the question, is there life on Europa, or is the question, is there life on Europa and we will find it?', '', 'BARBER: My question is, is there life on Europa?', '', ""WONG: I think that there's a really good chance that there could be life on Europa. And if there's not, it will also teach us something really fundamental, because it means that something wasn't quite right on Europa to either originate or to sustain life over billions of years."", '', ""BARBER: So why do you think the Europa Clipper-- like you were talking about earlier, that it's debatable that the Europa Clipper mission can actually definitively tell us that there's life on Europa. Like, why is that?"", '', ""WONG: Yeah, because a different kind of mission architecture, what people are calling a Europa lander, which actually does brave that radiation, go onto the surface of Europa, and sort of maybe rove around the surface, or taste the surface, or maybe even melt or drill through the ice and try to get to the ocean, that would give us data that could be really definitive about life on Europa. But because this thing is staying in space, for the most part staying very far away from Europa and making these quick dashes by Europa, it's going to give us a lot of new information about the structure, the interior, and the potential habitability of Europa but may not give us the kind of data we need to definitively say if there's life. I think one of the biggest open questions in science is, are we alone in the universe? And we want to know, is life just a random occurrence that happened to-- you know, we got lucky, essentially? Or does it occur wherever the conditions are right? And in our solar system, I don't think there is a place more tantalizing than Europa as a second harbor for life. And I think it's also a monumental challenge to go and seek life on another planet because, especially if that planetary body is like Europa, its life, if it has life, had a completely different origin from life on Earth. And so do we need to expand our mind to what life is and what life could be in the cosmos to actually basically identify and determine that there is life on another world? And I think finding evidence of extraterrestrial life that has a completely separate origin and evolutionary story from us will actually teach us quite a bit about what life really is in the universe."", '', 'BARBER: Michael Wong, fellow Trekkie, thank you so much for coming to talk to us today about Europa and all the other icy moons.', '', 'WONG: My pleasure.

And in every single place, we have found life. So, what could we find elsewhere in our solar system with similar conditions? NASA’s Europa Clipper Mission will soon seek an answer to that question by studying the icy satellite of Jupiter, although the spacecraft will not arrive until 2030. Meanwhile, scientists, journalists, and streamers congregated in Florida, excited for the October launch of the mission atop a Falcon Heavy rocket. On 14 October at 12:06 p.m. EDT, the spacecraft lifted off from Kennedy Space Center and successfully deployed the enormous solar arrays that power the mission.\n ', 'Before anyone sets their expectations too high, Europa Clipper is not on a mission to find life but to determine how habitable the subsurface ocean may be. So, how do we know there’s a subsurface ocean?', 'From data collected by ground-based telescopes and previous missions, including NASA’s Galileo and Voyager, scientists discovered that Europa’s surface was composed of water ice, with very few craters. Few craters in solar system terms usually mean a young surface, so the water ice is being replenished somehow. That discovery led to an understanding that the resonant orbits of the Galilean moons cause regular gravitational pulls against Jupiter’s gravity, causing the moon interiors to heat up. Volcanic eruptions on Io were predicted from this hypothesis and eventually observed with Voyager 1 in 1979.', 'However, the evidence predicted a subsurface ocean under a thick icy shell for Europa rather than volcanism. The moons’ and Jupiter’s push and pull causes tidal heating that keeps the ocean liquid and could even cause hydrothermal venting on the ocean floor. Here on Earth, hydrothermal vents are prime locations for a wide variety of life forms that live off the nutrient-rich eruptions. As Project Staff Scientist Cynthia Phillips explains, “Europa’s surface is covered with ice, but under that ice, there’s this giant ocean of liquid water. We think there’s actually more water there than all of Earth’s oceans combined. That ocean could be a great place to look for life.”\n ', 'If we’re not searching for life, what are we looking for? The Europa Clipper mission has three main science goals:', 'Goal number two is closest to the heart of the SETI Institute’s mission — determining whether the icy moon and its subsurface ocean are habitable and capable of supporting biology. As we understand it, life’s ingredients include water, organics, energy, and stability. The spacecraft carries nine science instruments onboard to find out what is available.', 'From NASA’s website: “The spacecraft’s payload will include cameras and spectrometers to produce high-resolution images and composition maps of Europa’s surface and thin atmosphere, an ice-penetrating radar to search for subsurface water, and a magnetometer and gravity measurements to unlock clues about its ocean and deep interior. The spacecraft will also carry a thermal instrument to pinpoint locations of warmer ice and perhaps recent eruptions of water, and instruments to measure the composition of tiny particles in the moon’s thin atmosphere and surrounding space environment.”', 'Europa Clipper will make about 50 close flybys to gather data, dipping as low as 25 kilometers above the icy surface. Each pass will cover a different location, giving scientists a nearly complete view of the moon. That data will take years to analyze fully, but scientists are hopeful and excited about the future.\n ', ' ', 'This article was originally published on medium.com.', ' ', ' ', '', ' ', '', 'SETI Institute\n339 Bernardo Ave, Suite 200\nMountain View, CA 94043, United States', 'Phone 650.961.6633\nFax 650.961.7099']"

That probe launched on its mission on Oct. 14; it's somewhere in the vastness of space now, on its way to Europa."", 'But the sturdy plate — inscribed with far more than the poignant words of Limón — also has a twin that sits on our planet. The replica is at the Brand Library & Art Center in Glendale, California, and the simple fact that it exists invites us to ponder the peculiar gap between art and science, or lack thereof.', '""we / pin quick wishes on stars.

You could perhaps also argue that quite literally everything is scientific, leading to the same conclusion.', 'The way tiny vibrations in your house can make water ripple within a Poland Spring bottle is strangely mesmerizing when focused on, the general reflective properties of mirrors are consistently tapped on in artist exhibitions, and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which is used to describe the curvature of complex shapes, is often referred to by mathematicians as ""beautiful.""

Still, of course, I feel there are crossovers — I'd say both are easily considered the pursuit of truth. Philosophers, artists and scientists have argued over these kinds of questions for decades, and we certainly won't get to the bottom of it in this article."", ""However, what about the division between art and astronomy specifically? It's interesting how the lines seem further blurred."", ""Unlike botany, for example, astronomy is a subject in which we have to imagine our targets most of the time.

(Even Albert Einstein didn't think we'd witness the gravitational waves that ripple across the universe when two black holes collide, but then we did in 2015. It is no wonder that astronomy and faith were far more tethered during ancient times than they are today.)"", ""Furthermore, defining the edge of the universe might be a mystery we may never solve, and by nature of being human, we can't exactly comprehend light-year-long distances — research has even shown that physicists' brains work differently than non-physicists' because the former have to continuously think about unfathomable scales. And unlike many other scientific topics such as mineralogy or clinical medicine, astronomy also has the potential to explain our existence on the grandest of terms."", '', 'Yet astronomy attempts to elucidate these somewhat ineffable concepts much in the same way art attempts to express the ineffable through images, sound, words or any other medium — in turn, both cultivate a certain profound, unsettling and existential feeling in us, and we chase that feeling. Of course, there are always going to be arguments made in different directions, but at its root, analyzing space seems to evoke something in us that analyzing other scientific subjects does not. ', 'Cosmic discoveries can offer both reprieve and anxiety, as well as a sense of unity mixed with uncanny loneliness.

NASA’s Europa Clipper mission aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket is paving the way for an entirely new avenue of exploration in the search for life beyond Earth and our solar system.', 'Mars, once part of Musk’s dream, is still an important destination. However, recently, attention has been paid to Jupiter’s moon, Europa. Europa is the most promising candidate for the search for life beyond our home planet, as the site of one of NASA’s most ambitious planetary missions.', 'Europa is shrouded with ice, and below it is a salty ocean of water, which experts think might have all the ingredients required to support life.
