', '', 'Washington is the sixth state to report human cases of bird flu, which has spread rampantly in wild birds, poultry and cattle. Assuming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms the state’s positive tests, they will bring the U.S. tally to at least 31.', 'Flu experts said the risk of a broader outbreak among humans will continue to simmer if the virus remains uncontrolled in animals.', '“The longer this virus hangs out in the environment, the more animals it spills over into, the more it changes in ways we don’t understand or predict, the more concerned we are going to be that this becomes the next global pandemic,” said Dr. Amber Itle, the Washington state veterinarian.', 'For now, however, health officials maintain that the virus has not made key genetic changes that would allow it to spread between people. ', '“There is no evidence of any sustained human transmission. And that is a key milestone for all of us. It’s a key trigger for all of us. That’s when we really start to say, ‘Oh, something that’s markedly different about this virus,’” Dr. Umair Shah, Washington’s health secretary, said at a news conference Sunday. ', 'A CDC spokesperson said Tuesday morning that a federal team was being deployed to Washington and that risk to the public remained low. ', 'However, the virus is a growing concern for farmworkers on the front lines. The four latest cases were among workers who had culled birds at a commercial egg farm where an outbreak of avian influenza was reported in chickens.', 'Shah said the workers were part of a contract crew tasked with depopulating — or euthanizing — all chickens at the farm in Franklin County, in southeastern Washington, which had more than 800,000 birds. Itle said the workers wore full protective equipment: suits made of Tyvek, goggles and respirators. ', '“It’s hot, it’s dusty. It’s a lot of birds in close proximity, and we’re getting a lot of viral exposure,” she said.', '', 'The four people who tested positive after that work reported mild respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis, or pink eye — symptoms now understood to be common when people are infected. None of the workers were hospitalized. ', 'Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said the Washington cases represented “more of the same” in a pattern observed across the U.S. as workers tasked with culling sick animals have fallen ill. ', 'However, one human case — in Missouri — has puzzled researchers and health officials, because that person did not have contact with animals. It is not clear how the person was exposed, and results of further tests that could offer clues are still pending, according to the CDC. Six health workers exposed to the patient reported respiratory symptoms.', 'Webby said the virus’ spread in cows for the past 10 months has raised experts’ level of concern because cows are mammals and interact with humans frequently. That increases the likelihood the virus could mutate to pass from person to person. ', '“Just because it hasn’t happened in 10 months … it doesn’t mean it can’t,” said Webby, an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. ', 'Research suggests that incredible amounts of virus are shed in infected cows’ mammary glands, so the virus could spread through raw milk. (Milk sold in grocery stores is pasteurized, which inactivates the virus.) ', 'At the same time, the U.S. is preparing for flu season, when circulation of common influenza viruses increases in fall and winter. If two influenza viruses share the same host, they can share genetic information and mutate more quickly.', '“You don’t want people affected with the seasonal flu virus to get a virus from animals and for those viruses to potentially recombine,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington and the director of its Center for One Health Research.', 'Rabinowitz added that it is important to improve protection protocols for farmworkers and encourage them to get their flu shots. ', '“This is a wakeup call. We need to do a better job of protecting workers,” he said.', 'Itle said cases in poultry were not unexpected in Washington state, because migrating birds passed through during summer and early fall. Recently, owls and other birds of prey were found dead, suggesting some wild animals had been stricken with the virus. ', 'Wild birds can spread the virus to farms through direct contact with poultry or livestock or via droppings, saliva or feed.  ', 'More than 103 million birds have been sickened, killed or culled in the current bird flu outbreak, according to CDC statistics. The virus has been detected in poultry in 48 states.

As the CDC continues to test employees exposed to the virus at an infected commercial egg laying operation in Franklin County, Wash., the number of positive cases in humans may continue to increase.', 'Also contributing to the growing number of cases is a total of 15 human cases confirmed in California since the beginning of October. These were all in workers exposed to infected dairy cows across 13 dairy farms in the state. All symptoms have been reported as mild, with no hospitalizations occurring.', 'CDC continues to declare the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to the general public is low. This assessment is supported by evidence that no person-to-person spread of the disease has occurred.', 'A deep dive into the case that popped up in Missouri last month without known exposure to infected cattle or poultry has led the CDC to remain confident in its assessment.', 'The Missouri case was the first — and to this day, the only — time a person has tested positive for H5N1 without reporting exposure to animals. The uncertainty of the source of exposure opened the door to the possibility of person-to-person transmission.', 'However, after subsequent testing and research, the CDC has ruled out person-to-person transmission.', 'In a conference call on Oct. 24 with federal health and agriculture officials, Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, detailed the process the agency undertook to come to this conclusion.', 'The Missouri patient had underlying medical conditions and tested positive for influenza A while hospitalized. During the patient’s stay, they came into contact with 112 healthcare workers. Six were found to have experienced respiratory symptoms. When the CDC tested the healthcare workers for the disease, the agency could serologically rule out they had not contracted H5N1.', 'Meanwhile, the CDC also looked into people who had household contact with the patient. This avenue of testing proved to be less clear-cut than that of the healthcare workers.', 'The CDC discovered one person to have a neutralizing antibody to H5N1 similar to that of the patient, suggesting they were both infected with the bird flu. However, the agency will not officially add the household contact to the number of confirmed H5N1 cases. That status could only be achieved if the contact showed signs of contracting the disease through at least two of the three assays run by the CDC, and the subject only showed signs on one test.', 'The patient and the contact were noted to have displayed symptoms for H5N1 around the same time, which the CDC views as epidemiologic evidence one did not contract the disease from the other but from a third-party source.', '“I think what we do know is that the evidence points toward a single source of infection,” Daskalakis explained. “The force of the larger evidence also suggests that likely exposure was an animal or animal product that we have not identified in our epidemiologic survey.”', 'Chains are catering to consumers’ interest in sweet and spicy flavors.', 'Limited-time offerings debut across foodservice menus.', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
