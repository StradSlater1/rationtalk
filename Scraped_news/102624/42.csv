Nearly 35 years into their incarceration, new evidence has been uncovered that could prove the brothers were victims of vile sexual abuse at the hands of their father', '', 'This election is still a dead heat, according to most polls.

But quality journalism must still be paid for.', 'O\nn the evening of 20 August 1989, José and Kitty Menéndez were watching TV in the den of their Beverly Hills mansion when their two sons, Lyle and Erik, entered the room carrying 12-gauge shotguns. Police sources told the Los Angeles Times that a gun barrel was thrust into José’s mouth after he’d already been shot four times, and a final blast blew off the back of his head. Kitty, who was shot 10 times, attempted to crawl away while her sons reloaded, before receiving a fatal blast to the cheek. Hours later, the older brother, Lyle, called 911, sobbing to the dispatcher: “Somebody killed my parents!”', 'Now, 35 years on, the notorious murders are the subject of a new Ryan Murphy drama on Netflix, titled Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny star as the parents, Nicholas Chavez and Cooper Koch as the sons. It’s the second in Murphy’s controversial true-crime saga, the first edition of which reignited interest in the “Milwaukee Cannibal”, Jeffrey Dahmer. That show, titled Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and starring Evan Peters as the bespectacled serial killer, went stratospheric, hitting 1 billion hours of views in its first 60 days and prompting widespread debate about the glamorisation of murderers. This time, though, things are different. This time, the “monsters” might just be the victims.', 'During the brothers’ trials, which took place from 1993 to 1996, Lyle and Erik – who were 21 and 18 at the time of the killings – claimed they had endured a lifetime of abuse at the hands of their father, a millionaire Hollywood entertainment executive. The defence therefore argued that the pair should be tried for manslaughter, not murder, further alleging that José had threatened to kill his sons to keep them quiet. It didn’t work. On 2 July 1996, Lyle and Erik were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. But more than three decades on, in time for the arrival of Netflix’s highly anticipated new series, fresh evidence has the potential to set them free.', 'Two months after the murders took place, Robert Rand, a journalist for the Miami Herald who perhaps knows the case better than anyone, travelled to Los Angeles to interview the Menéndez family. At the time, the brothers had not yet been arrested, and it was widely believed that the mafia was responsible for the deaths of José and Kitty in connection to José’s status as a wealthy home video executive.', '“I spent three days with Erik and Lyle. They were not suspects, publicly. I had absolutely no reason to be suspicious of them,” Rand tells me now. “They were telling me very loving, emotional stories about how close-knit their family was.” Little did Rand know, it would be the first of many times he met with the brothers over the next three and a half decades for a story that would define his career. His 2018 book, The Menendez Murders: The Shocking Untold Story of the Menendez Family and the Killings that Stunned the Nation, has just been re-released with a new epilogue revealing crucial information uncovered in the past six years.', 'Previously, the brothers claimed they had gone to the cinema to watch Batman the night their parents were killed. In reality, they had dumped the guns somewhere off of Mulholland Drive, then driven to a movie theatre and bought tickets to a film they didn’t watch before returning home to the crime scene. During the 1989 interview, Erik chillingly told Rand: “I’ve never seen anything like it, never will see anything like it. They looked like wax. I’ve never seen my dad helpless, and it’s sad to think he would ever be.”', 'In the trailer for Murphy’s new series – screeners were not available to press for the release – Erik and Lyle are shown going on a lavish spending spree in the wake of their parents’ deaths. Indeed, in the seven months between the murders and their arrest, the brothers spent an estimated $700,000. Lyle bought a Porsche 911 Carrera to replace the “piece of s***” Alfa Romeo his father had given him, as well as $40,000 worth of clothes and a $15,000 Rolex watch. His more eccentric purchases included a $300,000 down payment on a buffalo wing restaurant in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had attended college.', 'Eventually, Erik confessed to the killings to his psychologist, Jerome Oziel. Lyle was furious and allegedly threatened to kill the doctor. Unbeknown to them, Oziel’s mistress, Judalon Smyth, was listening through the door. “I never thought I believed in evil, but when I heard those boys speak, I did,” she told investigative journalist Dominic Dunne (portrayed in Monsters by Nathan Lane) in 1990. After a messy breakup with Oziel, it was Smyth who alerted police to the existence of therapy session tape recordings in which the Menéndez brothers admitted to the murders of their parents.', 'After their arrest in March 1990, it took three years to get Lyle and Erik on the stand as lawyers debated whether using the tapes as evidence violated doctor-patient privilege. The trial was broadcast on Court TV, garnering international attention. “You have to remember that back in the 1990s there was no internet, no social media,” Rand tells me. “So once the mainstream media set the profile or the agenda for the case – greedy, rich kids kill parents – that was it, you were cooked. And it was very difficult for the defence to fight back.”', '', '', 'Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 days', 'New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial. Plan auto-renews until cancelled', 'The brothers admitted to killing their parents, but contended that they did so out of fear, especially of their father, who they claimed was a violent paedophile. As evidence, the defence called on several family members to testify. Lyle and Erik’s cousin Brian Andersen said José would have the boys shower with him after tennis practice. He told the jury: “As soon as José took either one of the boys into their room, the door was locked behind them, and Kitty made clear you did not go down the hallway.” Another cousin, Diane Vander Molen, testified that Lyle had confided in her about the abuse when he was just eight years old. She said he had asked to sleep in her room one night “because his father and him had been touching each other down there, indicating that it was his genital area”.', 'Nevertheless, prosecutors argued that even if Lyle and Erik were abused, it didn’t give them the right to kill. They pointed to the therapy confession, during which they did not mention self-defence or fearing for their lives. The brothers were retried and found guilty after a first trial ended with jurors deadlocked. Both were convicted on two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life. “Eric and Lyle Menéndez have been incarcerated for 34 years and six months, and I believe that they are in prison for killing their lifelong abusers,” Rand says. “The correct verdict for the Menéndez brothers trial should have been manslaughter, not murder.”', 'Over the past three decades, Rand has conducted countless interviews with Menéndez family members and José’s affiliates. Last year, another alleged victim of José’s abuse came forward. In the 2023 Peacock docuseries Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed (co-produced by Rand), Roy Rosselló, a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band sensation Menudo, claims he was drugged and raped by José when he was a teenager. At the time, José was the head of RCA Records. “We believe that Roy was ‘gifted’ to José Menéndez after José signed Menudo to a $30m contract,” Rand tells me. In the documentary, Erik tells Rand from prison: “I always hoped and believed that one day the truth about my dad would come out. But I never wished for it to come out like this: the result of trauma that another child has suffered.”', 'The day after the documentary premiered, appellate attorneys for the Menéndez brothers filed a habeas petition to vacate their 1996 convictions based on new evidence. The petition lists Rosselló’s revelations and a letter written from Erik to his cousin, Andy Cano, in December 1988 – months before the murders. In the letter, which Rand was given by José’s younger sister and Andy’s mother, Marta Cano, an 18-year-old Erik writes: “I’ve been trying to avoid dad. It’s still happening, Andy, but it’s worse for me now... Every night I stay up thinking he might come in... I’m afraid... He’s crazy. He’s warned me a hundred times about telling anyone, especially Lyle.”', 'The brothers’ attorneys are now hoping they will be resentenced to time served and let out of prison. They are now aged 53 and 56. Thanks to events like the #MeToo movement, Rand argues, our understanding of abuse victims has changed drastically since the Menéndez siblings first went on trial. Lyle’s prosecutor, Pam Bozanich, for instance, had even argued in the Nineties that “men could not be raped, because they lack the necessary equipment to be raped”.', '“Back in 1993, I interviewed every juror after the first trial,” Rand says. “All the women voted for manslaughter. All the men voted for murder. All the men said to me, ‘Well, a father would never do that to his sons, right?’ ... I think that we have evolved as a society over the past 30 years and we are much more willing to accept that these things really do happen, not only to women, but also to men.”', '‘Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story’ arrives on Netflix on Thursday 19 September', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"
How the Menéndez brothers’ case got to resentencing: ‘Paid their debt to society’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/erik-lyle-menendez-brothers-resentencting,"['Sentenced to life imprisonment for killing their parents, the brothers could finally have a shot at freedom after 35 years', 'N\nearly three decades ago, Los Angeles prosecutors argued that Erik and Lyle Menéndez were cold-blooded killers who violently murdered their parents for money, and asked that they be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.', 'This week, in an extraordinary turn of events for the brothers, the Los Angeles district attorney said he will recommend they be resentenced – a decision that could lead to their release.', '“They have been in prison for nearly 35 years. I believe that they have paid their debt to society,” George Gascón, the Los Angeles DA, said during a packed Thursday press conference at the city’s hall of justice.', 'Gascón said he would ask they instead be sentenced to 50 years to life in prison, a recommendation that – because of their young age at the time of the killings – means they would be eligible for parole.', 'The news was celebrated by family members, several of whom sat in the front row during the announcement, as well as the brothers’ massive community of supporters on social media, and high-profile criminal justice advocates like Kim Kardashian.', 'It’s a development that for so long seemed impossible – Erik and Lyle Menéndez were sentenced to two consecutive life terms in 1996 after a jury found them guilty of first-degree murder in the killings of their parents, José and Kitty. Lyle, 21, and Erik, 18, shot their parents multiple times as they watched television in their Beverly Hills home in August 1989.', 'Erik is now 53 and Lyle is 56.', 'The brothers said they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up the years of sexual, psychological and physical abuse they had suffered. Prosecutors accused the brothers of lying and portrayed them as greedy rich kids eager for their multimillion-dollar inheritance – a narrative that long persisted in pop culture. They were tried twice, and testimony about their abuse was limited in the second trial.', 'Earlier this month, Gascón said his office would review new evidence in the case, including a letter written by Erik before the killings that corroborated his allegations of abuse and an allegation by a former member of the band Menudo who said that José Menéndez, previously an executive at RCA records, had raped him.', 'Gascón emphasized how societal attitudes around male victims of sexual abuse have changed, and that there is greater recognition that “both men and women can be the victims of sexual assault”. He expressed concern that the state may have exhibited implicit bias in a manner that affected how the case was presented, citing a comment from one prosecutor “how men cannot be raped”.', 'There is no question the brothers committed the killing, he told CNN. “The question is to what degree of culpability should they be held accountable to, given the totality of the circumstance.”', 'The district attorney’s announcement that he would review the case came as a more sympathetic view of the brothers emerged in recent years due in part to viral TikTok videos during the pandemic that focused on the abuse the brothers faced. The story has long remained in the public eye, but numerous documentaries and TV shows, including Ryan Murphy’s Monsters, intensified public interest and the district attorney’s office was flooded with inquiries, Gascón said.', 'Kardashian penned an essay calling for the brothers’ release, pointing to the abuse they had suffered – Lyle said his father began abusing him when he was six years old, while Erik said his father raped him for more than a decade – and their behavior in prison. The brothers have earned college degrees, served as mentors and provided hospice care to elderly people in prison.', '“I have spent time with Lyle and Erik; they are not monsters. They are kind, intelligent, and honest men,” Kardashian wrote.', 'The Los Angeles district attorney’s office was deeply divided, Gascón said, with some prosecutors arguing the brothers should remain in prison and others advocating for their release. After reviewing the arguments on both sides, the district attorney said, he decided on Thursday, shortly before the press conference, that the brothers should be resentenced.', '“We’re going to recommend to court that the life without out the possibility of parole be removed,” he said. “They will be eligible for parole immediately. “I do believe the brothers were subjected to a tremendous amount of dysfunction in the home and molestation.”', 'Still, he didn’t believe manslaughter was an appropriate charge and described the killings as premeditated. But the brothers, he argued, undertook a journey of redemption and rehabilitation and will be safe to re-enter society.', 'Judge William C Ryan will consider the recommendation next month, and if he agrees, the brothers will go before the parole board.', 'The timing of Gascón’s announcement drew some criticism – a poll earlier this month showed that the district attorney was lagging far behind a challenger in his re-election race. But Gascón said the decision was not political and said his office has sought to resentence more than 300 people during his tenure.', 'But for family members who have long advocated for the brothers, the news brought hope.', '“This decision is not just a legal matter – it is a recognition of the abuse my cousins endured and we are grateful for the DA’s leadership in putting justice over politics,” said Karen VanderMolen, Kitty’s niece. “It is time for Erik and Lyle to come home.”']"

Netflix also released a documentary titled “The Menendez Brothers” earlier this month. Celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, also came forward to issue their own public statements of support for the brothers.', 'Some legal experts say the Hollywood projects, as well as a public shift in attitude toward victims of sexual abuse, helped bring renewed attention to the Menendez brothers, paving the way for their potential release from prison.', '“When the Ryan Murphy series came out, it was such a caricature of them that the pendulum swing backlash actually created a focus on it,” Mark Geragos, an attorney for the Menendez brothers, told reporters on Thursday. “And people then took a look.”', 'Lyle and Erik Menendez fatally shot their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989.

The show is the latest example of Hollywood’s fascination with true crime, a genre that has repeatedly been criticized for retraumatizing victims and normalizing horrific acts of violence.', 'In an interview with NBC News, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón said his office already had plans to revisit the case after receiving two petitions. But the Netflix documentary triggered an onslaught of new interest and his office started getting a lot of questions.', '“It became awfully clear to me that we needed to handle the case and move on,” he said. “That is a reason why I decided to move forward.”', 'The Netflix show came on the heels of a 2023 Peacock documentary “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed,” which revealed shocking details about the brothers’ father, José Menendez, who was then an executive at RCA. It appeared to corroborate Lyle and Erik’s claims that they had been raped and sexually abused throughout much of their youth, details of which were excluded from their second trial.', '“They should send a big thank-you note to the people who did the recent documentary,” said Manny Medrano, a Los Angeles-based criminal defense attorney who has followed the case since its inception. “There’s no question that the brothers benefited from the Hollywood influence and the documentaries and everything else that happened after that.”', 'Murphy told Variety in September that he believes his show was “the best thing that has happened to the Menendez brothers in 30 years.”', '“They are now being talked about by millions of people all over the world,” he said, adding: “And I think the interesting thing about it is it’s asking people to answer the questions, ‘Should they get a new trial?

They got life without the possibility of parole. I just think that given the current state of the law and given our assessment of their behavior in prison, they deserve the opportunity to be re-evaluated and perhaps reintegrated into the community.”', 'A hearing on the matter could be held in 30 to 45 days, when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge will ultimately decide whether the brothers will be resentenced. Gascón said he supports the resentencing of the brothers to life with the possibility of parole – which normally would mean 50 years to life in prison. But because the crimes happened when the brothers were under 26 years old, they would be eligible for youthful parole under California law.', 'Calling the brothers “model prisoners,” Gascón told CNN he believes there’s a good chance they would be paroled if the decision reaches the parole board. An attorney for one of the brothers said he hopes they’ll be home by Thanksgiving.', 'The re-examination of the case comes more than 35 years after the 1989 fatal shooting of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion.

The first trial – one of the first cases to be televised – ended in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on the charges. In their second trial, much of the defense evidence about sexual abuse was excluded, and the brothers were found guilty in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison.', 'Multiple factors ultimately led to the resentencing recommendation, but whether the brothers – now in their 50s – could be released from prison remains uncertain. Here’s what led to the decision and what could happen next:', 'Although Gascón believes Lyle and Erik Menendez were appropriately sentenced during their trial more than three decades ago, they deserve a chance to be re-evaluated, he told CNN’s Stephanie Elam Thursday. Gascón said he believes the brothers had been sexually abused prior to the killings, and they have served enough time behind bars.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nRead the letter from Erik Menendez to his cousin before the murders', 'Gascón’s decision was made just an hour before he made the announcement Thursday because there were vastly different opinions on the case within his office, he told CNN. Multiple factors went into the decision to recommend a resentencing, including how multiple family members “made it very clear that not only that there might have been sexual molestation, but they say this is a very dysfunctional, very abusive home, and it was so for many years,” Gascón said.', '“I believe they have served enough time,” he said.', 'Gascón’s re-examination of the case came after attorneys for the Menendez brothers filed a habeas corpus petition in 2023, citing what they argue is new evidence, as well as a recent California law on resentencing in which the court can take into consideration sentences in comparable cases.', 'Among the new evidence the 2023 petition asked a court to consider: a sworn statement by former Menudo boy band member Roy Rosselló, who alleged Jose Menendez sexually assaulted him in the 1980s. The attorneys also said a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin months before the killings alludes to the abuse he endured.', 'In the motion filed by Gascón, the district attorney laid out details about the brothers’ rehabilitation efforts in prison during a time when they had no reason to believe they would be released.', '“Both Erik and Lyle Menendez have been recognized for their work ethic, professionalism, and being significant contributors to the betterment of the community they live in,” the filing said.', 'The brothers have participated in victim impact programs, workshops and events, along with creating multiple programs to help those “in need around them,” according to the motion.', 'The motion said the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was “actually able to close an entire discipline dorm based on Lyle Menendez’s ability to build consensus among inmates and the administration.”', 'The brothers “understand the harm they caused extended far beyond the direct victims of the offense,” the motion continued, and they have not engaged in “a single act of violence” before the crimes in their case, nor have they done so while in prison for 30 years.', 'The district attorney emphasized the brothers’ “significant amount of trauma and abuse” they experienced as children and how they have done a “tremendous amount of self-work while in custody,” using their lived experience to help others, the filing said.', 'Gascón, who is campaigning for reelection next month on a platform including sentencing reform, told CNN times have changed regarding how the public and the courts treat victims of sexual abuse.', 'The district attorney’s office also considered the brothers’ behavior while incarcerated, and they have “shown a tremendous amount of efforts to rehabilitate,” Gascón said.', '“They have been model prisoners by all accounts. Not only have they worked on their own self-improvement, but they have done a lot of work to better the life of those around them, which that part is unusual,” Gascón told CNN, indicating the men created groups to address how to deal with untreated trauma and help inmates with physical disabilities.', 'Citing their conduct during the last three decades in prison, Gascón said he believes there is a strong possibility the brothers will be paroled.', '“What they did was horrible. They premeditated the murder of their parents and killed them. But I think they’re different people today, and we base our opinion on the last 35 years of behavior,” Gascón said.', 'The decision on whether the brothers should be paroled will, however, ultimately lie with the parole board if the court agrees with the district attorney’s office on the resentencing, according to the district attorney.', 'When asked about mounting criticism from opponents who suggested reconsidering the Menendez brothers’ sentence was a political move, Gascón said, “There’s nothing political about this,” adding more than 300 resentencings have happened in the county since he took office in December 2020, including 28 for murder.', 'Thursday’s decision brought a ray of hope for the brothers’ attorneys and family, who said they anticipate the men can soon be reunited with loved ones and live a life outside of prison.', '“I believe before Thanksgiving, they will be home,” one of the brothers’ attorneys, Mark Geragos, said Thursday.', '“We are grateful the district attorney recognized not only the extraordinary contributions Erik and Lyle have made while in prison, but the role sexual abuse played in their actions as well,” another attorney, Cliff Gardner, told CNN.', 'After the official recommendation was filed, Nancy Theberge, deputy in charge of Gascón’s resentencing unit, said the unit will begin coordinating with the defense and court staff to set dates for the next proceedings. Once a hearing date is set, the defense can decide whether to have the brothers physically in the courtroom or appear via video or conference. All arguments and evidence will be admitted then. The judge will make a ruling based on what is presented, Theberge said.', '“We’re just starting the process,” she said.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nFamily members stand behind Lyle and Erik Menendez as they await a decision that could see them released from prison', 'Separate from the resentencing recommendation, the habeas corpus petition filed last year is scheduled to be heard in November. The defense was asking the court to either vacate the brothers’ conviction and sentence, or permit discovery and an evidentiary hearing during which they can provide proof, the petition says.', 'But if the defense team agrees with the DA’s resentencing request, they may withdraw the petition – which would also become moot if the court agrees to a resentencing, Gascón told CNN Thursday.', '“I don’t agree with the arguments of the habeas.

Menendez Brothers' Lawyer Says He Believes Erik and Lyle Will Be Home By Thanksgiving,https://www.eonline.com/news/1409138/erik-and-lyle-menendezs-lawyer-speaks-out-amid-resentencing,"[""Erik Menendez and Lyle Menendez's lawyer said he is hopeful the brothers will be home in time for Thanksgiving now that the Los Angeles District Attorney has recommended they be resentenced."", 'Erik Menendez and Lyle Menendez are hoping for a positive end to 2024. ', 'While the brothers are currently serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents José Menendez and Mary Louise ""Kitty"" Menendez—which they maintain stemmed from years of sexual abuse at the hands of their father—Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced he recommends they be resentenced to add the possibility for parole. Needless to say, Erik and Lyle\'s lawyer was very happy about the decision.', '""I believe before Thanksgiving, they will be home,"" Mark Geragos, who was joined by Erik and Lyle\'s family, said during an Oct. 24 press conference following the D.A.\'s announcement. ""I still believe that.""', '""The family is uniform behind me in their resolve that these boys need to come home,"" he continued. ""And today is a monumental, monumental victory on that path.""', ""According to the lawyer, the Menendez family members traveled from all over the country on only six hours' notice to be present for the decision."", '""They dropped everything,"" he said. ""They left work, they canceled appointments to come here in a show of force because enough\'s enough. They want them to come home.""', ""He also gave a special nod to Kitty's sister Joan Andersen VanderMolen who has become a staunch supporter for the Menendez brothers to be released."", '""It\'s an amazing, an amazing testament to her ability to forgive for her ability to see the goodness in these young men,"" the attorney shared.

The decision will ultimately go to California governor Gavin Newsom, who could reject the board's final decision."", 'During the Oct. 24 press conference, the DA pointed to two new pieces of evidence presented by their lawyer as the impetus to recommend resentencing.', 'The first was a letter that Erik wrote to their cousin Andy Cando eight months before the 1989 murders, in which he described the allegations of abuse against their father. The other was a declaration by former Menudo band member Roy Rosselló alleging that he was assaulted by José—who worked with the band while COO of RCA Records—in the Menendez family home.', '""There are people in the office that strongly believe that the Menendez brothers should stay in prison the rest of their life, and they do not believe that they were molested,"" the DA explained during the press conference. ""And there are people in the office that strongly believe that they should be released immediately, and that they were, in fact, molested.""', 'He added that he does not want the alleged abuse to ""excuse"" the murder of their parents, but that ""after a very careful review of all the arguments"" he felt the case deserved to be resentenced.', 'As he had previously noted, Erik and Lyle—who were 18 and 21 at the time of the murders, respectively—have the support of so many of their family members.', '""The truth is, Lyle and Eric were veiled by the very people who should have protected them, by their parents, by the system, by society at large,"" their aunt Joan said on behalf of the family at an Oct. 16 press conference. ""When they stood trial, the whole world wasn\'t ready to believe that the boys could be raped, or that young men could be victims of sexual violence. Today, we know better. We know that abuse has long lasting effects, and victims of trauma sometimes act in ways that are very difficult to understand.""', 'She continued, ""If it were tried today, the evidence of their father\'s abuse would not only be admitted in court, it would provide essential context for why they acted as they did. No jury today would issue such a harsh sentence without taking their trauma into account.""', 'Your source for entertainment news, celebrities, celeb news, and celebrity gossip.

What to know about the resentencing decision,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/25/menendez-brothers-resentencing-release-details/75836700007/,"['Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón has filed a petition to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez, opening the possibility of parole for the brothers serving life sentences for the murder of their parents.', 'Gascón unveiled his long awaited decision in the infamous case on Thursday, saying the brothers have ""paid their debt to society.""', 'The petition asks the court to resentence the men to 50 years to life on two counts of first-degree murder, according to a copy obtained by USA TODAY. Under California law, they would be eligible for youth parole since they were under the age of 26 at the time of the crime and have already served 30 years in prison.', ""Now that the district attorney's office has filed the petition, it will go before a judge. If the judge sides with the defense and district attorney, a parole board will evaluate whether the brothers have been rehabilitated and are safe to reenter society."", ""At a Thursday news conference, Nancy Theberge, deputy in charge of Gascón’s resentencing unit, said she would like to see the petition for resentencing go before a judge within the next 30 to 45 days. She added that the brothers' could attend the hearing either in person or via Zoom."", ""The momentous decision came after the brothers' attorneys filed new evidence last year they said shed light on abuse suffered at the hands of their father, Jose Menendez, a wealthy music executive. In recent months, the brothers' family, as well as celebrities and human rights advocates, urged Gascón's office to release the convicted men, citing the new evidence and the evolution in the understanding of sexual abuse victims."", ""The Menendez brothers were convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez after their first high-profile televised trial ended in a hung jury. Their lawyers argued they acted in self-defense and said they were sexually abused by both parents. Prosecutors said the abuse never happened and the brothers were seeking their parents' fortune, then valued at about $15 million."", 'The case gained fresh attention following a recent slew of documentaries and a controversial true crime drama, all of which hastened developments in the case.', ""Here is what we know about the case and the Menendez brothers' uncertain path to freedom:"", 'Theberge said Thursday the resentencing unit will coordinate with the defense to set up a court date so the petition requesting resentencing can be heard.', 'The judge overseeing the hearing will then rule on the petition and decide whether the brothers will be eligible for parole. If the judge agrees the brothers should be resentenced, they will go before a parole board, which will primarily evaluate ""whether they are rehabilitated and safe to be released,"" Gascón said.', 'The district attorney said while he and some members of his office believed the brothers deserve to be resentenced, there may be other members of his office who will present arguments on why they should remain in prison for life.', '""It\'s very possible that there will be members of this office that will be present in court opposing their resentencing – and they have a right to do so,"" he said, adding, ""We encourage those that disagree with us to speak in the court.""', 'Gascón told reporters Thursday that he made his decision about an hour before the news conference in which he announced the bombshell development.', 'He said his decision came after a careful review of the arguments on both sides, with some staff in his office arguing for their immediate release and others arguing they should ""stay in prison the rest of their lives."" He said his staff disagrees on whether they believe the boys were molested.', 'After evaluating the evidence, the district attorney came to the belief that the brothers ""were subjected to a large amount of dysfunction in the home and molestation,"" he said, adding, ""I believe, under the law, resentencing is appropriate.""', ""Another factor in his decision was the brothers' behavior in prison. He said not only have they sought self improvement but they have tried to better the lives of their fellow inmates."", 'They created groups to deal with untreated trauma and others to help disabled prisoners, Gascón said. In one case Lyle Menendez negotiated for other inmates ""as to the conditions they live under in prison.""', '""All this was done by two young people that had no hopes of ever getting out of prison,"" he said.', ""The new evidence weighed by the district attorney's office included a letter purportedly written by Erik Menendez to his cousin, Andy Cano, in which he alluded to the abuse he suffered."", ""An excerpt of the letter, which the defense said was written eight months before the murders, was included in the 2023 habeas corpus petition filed by the brothers' attorneys."", '""I’ve been trying to avoid dad. It\'s still happening Andy but its worse for me now,” it said. “I never know when its going to happen and its driving me crazy. Every night I stay up thinking he might come in.”', 'Later, the letter stated: ""I know what you said before but I\'m afraid. You just don\'t know dad like I do. He\'s crazy! He\'s warned me a hundred times about telling anyone.""', 'The district attorney\'s office also examined allegations from a member of the 1980s pop band Menudo that he was abused by Jose Menendez – allegations made public in a documentary called ""Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.""', ""At the news briefing Thursday, some family members expressed gratitude for the district attorney's decision after years of calling for the brothers' release."", '""This step gives us all hope that the truth will finally be heard and that Lyle and Erik can begin to heal from the trauma of their past,"" said Anamaria Baralt, a niece of Jose Menendez.', 'Reality television star Kim Kardashian, who has been an outspoken advocate for the brothers\' release and has visited them in prison, said they ""were granted a second chance at life"" in a social media post.', '“Your commitment to truth and fairness is commendable,” she wrote, referring to Gascón, in a statement posted on Instagram.', 'Joan VanderMolen, sister of Kitty Menendez, told reporters at the Thursday news conference the decision was a ""brave and compassionate step forward.""', '""This decision is not just a legal matter, it is a recognition of the abuse my cousins endured,"" she said.

The other camp believes the brothers deserve a break due to claims of being sexually assaulted by their father.', ""Gascón’s comments come just weeks after he held a press conference, revealing he's reevaluating the case after a letter Erik allegedly wrote to his cousin Andy Cano months before the murders -- in which he details how his father allegedly abused him -- resurfaced, and after Roy Rosselló -- a member of the band Menudo -- claimed José sexually abused him."", 'Erik and Lyle have been behind bars since 1990, when they were arrested. They opened up about the abuse they allegedly faced at their first trial, but that ended in a hung jury.', ""In the retrial, a judge shot down any chance for such testimony -- but now Gascón's taking a hard look.
