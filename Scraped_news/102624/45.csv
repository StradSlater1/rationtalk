But within weeks of the new legislation being signed into law, SAG-AFTRA announced that it will be resuming negotiations with some of the largest video game companies on October 23. As the dispute veers towards a hopeful resolution, we break down what employers should take away from the video game actors strike, as well as the new AI digital replica laws that might have paved the pathway towards its resolution.', 'What’s Going On?', 'The video game actors strike is entering its third month as regulations over AI “digital replicas” remain at the forefront of labor negotiations.', 'Amidst this backdrop, in September 2024 alone, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed 18 AI bills into law, making AI a moving target for labor negotiations. This wave of AI legislation included two new laws regulating the use of digital replicas – one of the hot button issues at the heart of the video game actors strike.', 'What Are The New Digital Replica Laws?', 'AB 2602 (to be codified as Cal.

Code §3344.1) updates current law to prohibit the use of a deceased person’s voice or likeness in digital replicas without the prior consent of their estate.

This may embolden SAG-AFTRA during negotiations over the parties’ collective bargaining agreement, the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA). After all, SAG-AFTRA’s Executive Director has referred to AB 2602 as “one of our top legislative priorities.”', 'Additionally, the new laws may impact negotiations over how the term “digital replica” will be defined in the IMA.
