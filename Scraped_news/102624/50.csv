The star will undergo additionally testing tomorrow, and though Roberts emphasized that he did not want to speculate on the severity of the injury until those tests were completed, he noted that they’re “encouraged” by initial tests and that he’s “expecting” Ohtani to be back in the lineup for Game 3 on Monday.', 'It’s a potentially devastating blow to the Dodgers as they look to capture their first full-season World Series championship since 1988. While Ohtani has been unable to pitch this year after undergoing elbow surgery last September, it’s impossible to call his first season with the club anything other than an absolute success. The 30-year-old superstar slashed an eye-popping .310/.390/.646 (181 wRC+) in 159 games for the Dodgers this year and became the first player in MLB history to steal at least 50 bases (59) and hit at least 50 home runs (54) in a single season. Ohtani’s dynamic play has also been a key factor in the club’s postseason run to this point, as he had slashed an impressive .277/.414/.489 with three home runs and ten RBI during the playoffs this year entering tonight’s game.', 'Whether the Dodgers will have that explosive offensive talent in the lineup for the remainder of the series remains to be seen. While the severity of Ohtani’s injury is not currently clear, an injury of any significance will leave he and the Dodgers forced to balance the star’s health with their goal of closing out a World Series championship they’re just two victories away from clinching. Other players on the Dodgers’ roster, including fellow star Freddie Freeman and veteran shortstop Miguel Rojas, have played through injuries this postseason in hopes of bringing a World Series home to Los Angeles. If the Dodgers take a similar course of action with Ohtani and his shoulder issue is fairly mild, it’s possible to imagine him being back in the club’s lineup when the series moves to New York for Game 3 on Monday night.', 'That’s far from a guarantee, however, and it’s equally easy to imagine the issue being severe enough to leave Ohtani at risk of missing the rest of the series. If the injury proves to be severe enough for the Dodgers to remove Ohtani from their playoff roster, outfielders Kevin Kiermaier and James Outman would appear to be the most likely options for the club to consider activating in place of their superstar on the playoff roster. Meanwhile, Ohtani vacating the DH spot in the lineup would allow the club to offer additional rest to Freeman, who has played through the postseason on a sprained ankle and could benefit from the additional time off his feet. In such a scenario, Max Muncy would likely slide over from third base to cover first for Freeman, opening up the hot corner for Enrique Hernandez and second base for Gavin Lux.', 'Of course, with just five months left to Opening Day 2025, a particularly severe injury could not only leave Ohtani unavailable for the remainder of the World Series but potentially impact his Spring Training and readiness for the start of next year. Red Sox shortstop Trevor Story underwent what was believed to be season-ending shoulder surgery back in April following an initial diagnosis similar to Ohtani’s after Story awkwardly landed on his shoulder during a play in the field. Surgery wound up being necessary due to structural damage in his shoulder and came with an initial six-month recovery timeline, though Story managed to return ahead of schedule in just five.', 'The Dodgers are quite familiar with the perils of dislocated shoulders, as during the 2020 NLCS Cody Bellinger suffered a dislocated right shoulder that he played through in their last World Series run but ultimately required surgery on. That procedure came with a recovery timeline of just ten weeks but Bellinger infamously struggled badly over his next two seasons with the Dodgers, leading to questions regarding whether or not he returned to action before he was fully healthy. However severe Ohtani’s injury turns out to be, one silver lining for the Dodgers is that Ohtani’s left shoulder is the one at issue, meaning his pitching arm is likely to be minimally impacted by the issue as he looks toward a return to the mound in 2025.', 'LOS ANGELES DODGERS NEWSSTAND\nSHOHEI OHTANI', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'MLB Trade Rumors is not affiliated with Major League Baseball, MLB or MLB.com', '', '', '', '', '']"

The ball jumping off the Dodger bats. A standing ovation for Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The gigantic center-field speakers blaring party music in a celebratory setting.', 'All that Game 2 noise went away when Shohei Ohtani injured his left shoulder on a failed seventh-inning stolen-base attempt and lay on the ground in obvious agony. The Dodger Stadium crowd quieted quickly, then got mighty tense when the Yankees nearly came back in the ninth. But while the injury to their iconic designated hitter hung heavy in the air, the Dodgers were able to feed off the Freddie Freeman frenzy from a night earlier with a 4-2 win Saturday night to take a commanding 2-0 edge in this best-of-seven Fall Classic.', 'Freeman, still nursing that sprained right ankle, went deep again, and this time he had the company of NLCS MVP Tommy Edman and All-Star Teoscar Hernández and the backing of 6 1/3 one-hit innings from Yamamoto. The party quieted when Ohtani went down, and the Yankees had everybody on the edge of their seats when they plated a run and loaded the bases in the ninth. But the Dodgers protected their home turf.', 'In all best-of-seven postseason series, teams taking a 2-0 lead have gone on to win the series 77 of 92 times (84%). The most recent comeback from a 2-0 deficit came in the 2023 NLCS, with the D-backs rallying against the Phillies. Under the current 2-3-2 format, teams winning Games 1 and 2 at home have gone on to take the series 45 of 56 times (80%).', 'And so the Yankees, who brought their band of slugging superstars to the West Coast, head east with a daunting deficit against a Dodgers team that had been an out away from angst in the opener, yet is now two wins from a ring. What remains to be seen is if the tone will shift at Yankee Stadium, and if Ohtani will be back in the lineup in the Bronx.', 'As had been the case in Game 1, the Dodgers struck first in this one. And as had been the case in his hero turn in the previous round, Edman did the striking.', 'Edman, a coach’s kid who can play all over, was an unheralded acquisition for the Dodgers from the Cardinals at the Trade Deadline, partially because he hadn’t played all season after having wrist surgery last October. But in the last two weeks, the wiry utility man has come to be known as “Tommy Tanks” by making life miserable for lefties, and Carlos Rodón just so happens to pitch with his left arm. Leading off the bottom of the second, Edman connected with Rodón’s inside fastball and yanked it to the seats near the left-field foul pole to make it 1-0. It was his 10th hit in his first 15 at-bats off southpaws in this postseason.', 'That particular lead was short-lived, because a much-more-heralded provider of power -- Yankees right fielder Juan Soto -- continued his man-on-a-mission, pre-free agency tear by ripping a solo shot of his own off Yamamoto the very next inning. Soto, who turned 26 on Friday, flipped his bat with flair then confidently strutted around the bases with the score knotted at 1.', 'Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.', 'But it wasn’t knotted long. In the bottom of the third, the loaded Dodgers lineup feasted on Rodón fastballs to mount a two-out rally. First, Mookie Betts ripped a single to left. Then, Teoscar Hernández, who came to L.A. as one of the lesser-publicized signings in the Dodgers’ $1.2 billion winter and turned in an All-Star campaign, smoked a 98 mph four-seamer up in the zone into the right-field pavilion seats for an impressive two-run blast that made it 3-1.', 'Dodger Stadium was still rocking after Teoscar’s tater when Freeman stepped to the plate. The jersey he wore for Kirk Gibson karaoke night was freshly encased near the stadium’s suite-level entrance, but Freeman made it clear that the epic ending to Game 1 was not the end of his contributions to this cause. He worked the count full, then connected when Rodón challenged him with another high heater. As was the case a night earlier, Freeman left no doubt over where the ball would land, and the Dodgers were up 4-1.', 'That was the lead put in the clearly capable hands of Yamamoto, who had spurned the interested Yankees and one-upped their ace Gerrit Cole when he signed a 12-year, $325 million contract to join the Dodgers last winter. This was a night when Yamamoto showed the broad baseball world -- including an ample audience in his native Japan -- what all the fuss was about, confounding a dangerous lineup by allowing only the Soto swat and two walks and keeping the pressure off the oft-used L.A. bullpen by pitching into the seventh. He retired the last 11 hitters he faced and left to a stirring round of applause.', 'All this rapture made the sound of silence when Ohtani lay in pain at second base all the more piercing. Ohtani had drawn a walk off Clay Holmes and attempted to swipe a bag, just as he had done 59 times in the regular season. This time, his left hand hit the ground hard on his slide, and the force went to his shoulder.', 'The Ohtani injury changed the tone, and then the Yankees tried to change the lead by mounting a ninth-inning rally off Blake Treinen. Juan Soto singled and advanced on a wild pitch, and Giancarlo Stanton drove him home by banging a base hit off the third-base bag. Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled to put runners at first and second with one out, and Treinen plunked Anthony Rizzo with a 2-2 pitch to load the bases. But Treinen got a huge strikeout of Anthony Volpe, and Alex Vesia retired Jose Trevino on one pitch for the final out to bring the loud noises back again.', 'Anthony Castrovince has been a reporter for MLB.com since 2004.', '20 minutes ago', '9:35 PM PDT', '7:42 PM PDT', '4:57 PM PDT', '8:15 PM PDT', 'October 25th, 2024', '20 minutes ago', '9:35 PM PDT', '7:42 PM PDT', '4:57 PM PDT', '', '', '6:10 AM PDT', '7:26 AM PDT', '6:50 AM PDT', '5:45 PM PDT']"

World Series Game 2 highlights: Dodgers hold off Yankees 4-2,https://www.foxsports.com/live-blog/mlb/yankees-vs-dodgers-world-series-game-2-live-updates-score,"['The 2024 World Series continued on Saturday with the New York Yankees trying to even the series with the Los Angeles Dodgers following a gut-wrenching, 10th-inning loss in Game 1 at Dodger Stadium on Friday, but ultimately coming up short, 4-2, and going down 2-0 in the series.', ""Yoshinobu Yamamoto was sharp as the Dodgers' starter, only allowing one run. Carlos Rodón was taken off after allowing three runs in the third inning."", 'FOX Sports writers Deesha Thosar and Rowan Kavner provided live in-game analysis from Dodger Stadium. Check out all the top plays from Game 2 here!', ""Kavner: Aaron Boone thought he saw a positive sign in Aaron Judge's last at-bat of Game 1, a pop-out to shortstop that Boone thought Judge barely got under. Whatever he saw didn't lead to production in Game 2 for the presumptive AL MVP. Judge is now 1-for-9 with six strikeouts in the World Series, one of which came as the Yankees tried to mount a ninth-inning comeback. The Yankees loaded the bases, putting the winning run on base, but the Dodgers survived and take a commanding 2-0 lead to the Bronx. Now they await word on their own presumptive MVP."", 'Top 9: Stanton gets Yankees closer', ""Thosar: Anthony Volpe's weakness was fully exposed in the most important at-bat of his career to date. With the bases loaded and one out, Blake Treinen threw sweeper after sweeper after sweeper against Volpe, and the 23-year-old Yankees shortstop swung at all of them. Volpe struggled in his sophomore season this year with laying off outside pitches, and he just couldn't hold back in the ninth inning."", 'Kanver: Bases loaded, ninth inning, team at-bat trailing. Have we heard this before already? Treinen got a huge strikeout on Anthony Volpe. Alex Vesia now enters. Jose Trevino is pinch-hitting for Austin Wells with the Yankees down to their last out. What a start to the World Series.', ""Kavner: Well, things are getting interesting. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the ninth, but an RBI single from Giancarlo Stanton that hopped off the third-base bag, an eight-pitch single from Jazz Chisholm Jr. and an Anthony Rizzo hit by pitch have loaded the bases on Blake Treinen. The tying run's at second, the go-ahead run's at first, and there's only one out."", 'Top 8: Ohtani injury update', 'Top 7: Yamamoto walks off', 'Kavner: Yamamoto got the first out of the seventh inning before departing with a hug from Dave Roberts and a standing ovation from the crowd of 52,725. He allowed just one hit, a solo homer, before retiring the final 11 batters he faced in his first career World Series start. Only one other Dodgers pitcher — Rich Hill in 2018 — has thrown at least six innings while allowing one hit in a World Series game. Dodgers fans might want to forget how that one ended.', 'Bottom 7: Ohtani injured', 'Top 6: Judge strikes out again', ""Kavner: Yamamoto is through six scoreless innings. The only hit he has allowed is Soto's solo homer in the third. He has retired 10 straight since then. This is his longest outing since ... the last time he faced the Yankees, on June 7 in New York. In 13 innings against them, he has allowed just three hits and one run. Lefty Anthony Banda is up in the Dodgers' pen, but there's no one throwing yet. Lefties Jazz Chisholm and Anthony Rizzo are due up in the 7th. Yamamoto's at 80 pitches."", 'Top 5: Yamamoto in control', ""Kavner: Yamamoto has really settled in, retiring seven straight since the Soto homer. Through five innings, that's the Yankees' only hit of the night. Yamamoto has not gone more than five innings in a start since returning on Sept. 10 from a shoulder injury that held him out for nearly three months, but there's no one warming up yet in the Dodgers' bullpen. He's at 72 pitches through five, and the top of the Yankees' lineup is about to come up a third time through."", 'Bottom 5: Teoscar left stranded', 'Top 4: NY shut out', ""The Yankees couldn't narrow the gap at all as Yamamoto continues his strong night."", 'Bottom 4: Rodón is done', ""Thosar: It made little sense to me when the Yankees opted to start Carlos Rodon for Game 2, because the Dodgers hit lefties so well, and Rodon pitches better at home. More than anything, I thought Clarke Schmidt would've given them a better chance to go back to New York with a series split. But the Yankees' worst-case scenario was the Rodon that showed up in the second and third inning, the one that unraveled after he allowed his third home run of the night after just 13 batters faced. It's always hard to tell what the Yankees will get from Rodon, and when they needed a reliable starter more than anything else for Game 2, their top southpaw couldn't deliver. Fortunately for the Yankees, a three-run deficit isn't the worst thing in the world. "", 'Top 3: Soto ties it', ""Thosar: The bat flip said it all. Juan Soto looked into his dugout and pounded his chest after he hammered a solo shot to right field off Yamamoto, who erroneously thought he could get away with a 95 mph fastball that covered the middle of the plate. Soto doesn't miss mistakes on a bad day, and right now he's feeling so good at the plate that Yamamoto's decision to go with anything that resembled a heater, let alone throw it in the zone, was immediately punished. Soto's fourth home run of the playoffs tied the game at 1-1, and he's reached base in each of his 11 postseason games this October."", 'Bottom 3: Two for Teo, one for Freeman', ""Kavner: Back in June, Teoscar Hernández was the hero of the Dodgers' offense in the Bronx, launching three homers in the series win. He's back to tormenting the Yankees again, taking a heater at the top of the zone out for a go-ahead two-run homer. Not to be outdone, Freddie Freeman then made it back-to-back (not his first homer of the series, as you might have heard). The Dodgers are teeing off on Rodon his second time through."", 'Bottom 1: Yamamoto holding NY', ""Rowan Kavner: Yoshinobu Yamamoto hasn't had great command or control early, but he has gotten through two scoreless with two walks and a strikeout. When he carved through the Yankees lineup back in June, his go-to secondaries were the slider and splitter. It's mostly been the curveball the first time through. I'll be curious to see if he works the slider in more often after having success with it his last time out, but he'll need to command the fastball better regardless the second time through."", 'Bottom 2: Edman strikes again', ""Kavner: What a day July 29 was for the Dodgers. In a three-team deal that probably wasn't talked about enough at the time, they got Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech for Miguel Vargas and two lower-level prospects. Kopech immediately became a reliable high-leverage piece, while Edman, who hadn't played a game this year before the Dodgers made the trade, turned into a vital addition both for his defensive versatility (he can both center and shortstop, all the more important with Miguel Rojas banged up) and the switch-hitter's bat against left-handed pitching. He took Sean Manaea deep in Game 6 of the NLCS, and he took Carlos Rodon deep in his first at-bat Saturday to start the scoring. Juan Soto, however, eliminated that advantage quickly."", 'Top 1: Judge strikes out', ""Deesha Thosar: Even though his manager and hitting coach were encouraged by his at-bats in Game 1, Aaron Judge continues to look off at the plate. After leadoff man Gleyber Torres worked a walk, the Yankees' Big 3 had a prime opportunity to cash in. Soto grounded out, but he at least moved Torres up to second. But then Judge followed by striking out on seven pitches, and he kept whiffing on sliders down and away from Yoshinobu Yamamoto. In the regular season, that's a plate appearance that would normally end in a walk for Judge."", 'Bottom 1: No runs', 'Mookie Betts got his first hit of the World Series, but Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman both failed to get on base.', 'Bow down', 'LA rap icon Ice Cube got the Dodger Stadium crowd warmed up with ""Bow Down"" and ""It Was A Good Day.""', 'Judge has one goal', 'Aaron Judge came to New York to do one thing: bring the Yankees a World Series title for the first time since 2009.', 'Freeman still buzzing', 'Freddie Freeman told Ken Rosenthal that his walk-off grand slam to win Game 1 still hasn\'t settled with him: ""I don\'t think it can.""

Within minutes of the final out of Saturday’s 4–2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2, Shohei Ohtani, wearing street clothes and with his hair wet, presumably from a shower, his face impassive, boarded the elevator to the parking lot. He did not appear to be wearing a brace or a cast on his left shoulder, the one that suffered a subluxation—a partial dislocation—on a failed stolen base attempt in the seventh inning. ', 'As he left, I asked him how his shoulder felt. He did not respond. The elevator doors closed.', 'Manager Dave Roberts said that the team would know more about Ohtani’s status after the superstar DH underwent an MRI but that initial physical tests did not seem to indicate an injury that would end his World Series. ', ""“The strength was great, the range of motion good,” Roberts said. “So we’re encouraged. But obviously I can’t speculate, because we don’t have the scans yet. So once we get the scans, we'll know more.” Roberts added that, at least in theory, a left shoulder injury for a left-handed hitter is preferable to a right shoulder injury."", 'Through two games, the Dodgers have looked like the clearly superior team—their starting pitchers have lasted longer, their relievers have given up fewer runs, their offense has scored more runs, they’ve played cleaner baseball. But if indeed Ohtani misses time, the momentum of the series could swing. ', 'In the seventh, when Ohtani slid into second base and failed to get up immediately, Dodgers left fielder Teoscar Hernández said, “Not only the dugout, but the whole stadium was in silence.”', 'They understood the stakes: Ohtani is probably the most talented player in the history of the sport. He will almost certainly win his third Most Valuable Player award next month, and he had a 1.185 OPS in the National League Championship Series. ', 'The Yankees have largely kept him in check this series, holding him to one hit in Game 1 (although it was a big one—a one-out double on which he took third on an error, then scored the tying run on a sacrifice fly) and the walk in Game 2 that led to the fateful stolen base attempt. But just his presence in the lineup affects the way the Yankees approach the Dodgers: With Game 1 on the line Friday, New York manager Aaron Boone went to lefty starter Nestor Cortés, who had not pitched in more than a month, because he did not like the matchup of lefty reliever Tim Hill against Ohtani.

', 'A major Dodgers worry emerged at the end of the seventh when Ohtani was caught stealing to end the inning and suffered what manager Dave Roberts said was a left shoulder subluxation, or partial dislocation, when his left hand hit the ground as he slid into the bag. Ohtani stayed down for an extended period, eventually coming off the field holding his left arm at 90 degrees, amid stunned silence from a Dodger Stadium crowd of 52,725.', ""“The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged,” Roberts said of the initial testing on the superstar who’s headed for an MRI sometime Sunday. “Obviously I can't speculate … once we get the scans, we'll know more. Again, with the strength, the range of motion good, that's certainly a positive.”"", ""Asked about the possibility of playing without Ohtani, Roberts quickly shot that down, saying, “I’m not there … I'm expecting him to be in the lineup.”"", 'His status will be of keen interest not only to the Dodgers but to the Yankees, whose fate in this series suddenly hinges on their Legion of Doom trio in the batting order doing damage in Monday’s Game 3 against Walker Buehler, and on Clarke Schmidt containing a deeper Dodgers lineup.', 'Manager Aaron Boone pointed to a too-little, too-late rally in the ninth as something to build on and while he fell back on the “it’s a long series” cliche, he also acknowledged that, “we need to make it a long series now.”', ""“We won't flinch,” he added. “We've just got to keep at it.”"", ""Commissioner Rob Manfred sounded like he was counting on that during a brief chat with writers before the game, saying that figuring out where the Tampa Bay Rays will play in 2025 will be a focus “once we get past Game 7 — and we're going to have seven,” an assertion that may not age well at this pace."", ""Seven games of Dodgers-Yankees is, of course, what Major League Baseball wants more than anything after ending up with this glamour-market showdown. Manfred sees “this matchup as an opportunity to amplify everything we've been working on for the last few years. Focus on the players, trying to grow the game into a more national product, international growth, young people and when you get a stage like this, it's an opportunity to take a step forward.”"", 'Unsaid there is that a World Series featuring lesser markets — Kansas City-Milwaukee let’s say, although the Toronto Blue Jays and their outside the U.S.-complications make for a singular give-and-take in jewel events — are, at best, time to hold ground.

That season, they still won 106 games in 2021, one fewer than the San Francisco Giants.', 'The randomness inherent to the playoffs means they’ve only won one title during that time — beating the Rays in the Texas pandemic bubble in 2020 — but the depth they’ve assembled this year has allowed them to thrive in spite of injuries that should have submarined them.', 'So, if Ohtani misses any games in the World Series, well the Dodgers have been there, done that.', ""“We were battling throughout the year with a lot of injuries,” said Hernandez. “First was the starting pitching and then Mookie (Betts) and then Freddie. And hopefully not Ohtani in this case. It's not going to be a good feeling, but if he can't go on Monday, we just have to keep doing the thing we've been doing for the past couple weeks.”"", 'Tommy Edman, their long-time trade target finally acquired at this summer’s deadline, opened the scoring in the second with his second homer of the playoffs, turning on a 95.4 m.p.h. Carlos Rodon fastball and launching it 355 feet to left.', 'The only hit off Yamamoto came in the third, when Juan Soto hammered a middle-down sinker at 95.2 m.p.h. 386 feet to right to tie the score.

And then, with the fans chanting “Freddie, Freddie,” Freeman followed by hammering a 96.9 m.p.h heater up and in to right-centre for a 4-1 edge.', 'It’s the 19th time teammates have gone back-to-back in the World Series.', ""“You don't want that to happen when you score one and the other team comes back and scores to tie the game, or scores more than one run, but we just have to keep pushing,” said Hernandez. “That's what we put in our minds. It doesn't matter how many they score, we can score, and we know that. You just go, fight your at-bat, try to get on base for the guy behind you.”"", 'Edman followed with another double and promptly stole third, prompting first baseman Anthony Rizzo to make a mound visit to settle his pitcher down.

Treinen rallied to strike out Anthony Volpe before lefty Alex Vesia came on to get Jose Trevino, hitting for Austin Wells, the Dodgers now two wins away from adding another championship to Friedman’s burgeoning golden era.', '176 Comments', '90 Comments', '29 Comments', '25 Comments', '22 Comments', 'With your consent we may collect cookies and information to enhance our service, and improve your experience.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
2024 World Series: Yoshinobu Yamamoto shows Yankees what they missed out on in masterful Game 2 Dodgers win,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2024-world-series-yoshinobu-yamamoto-shows-yankees-what-they-missed-out-on-in-masterful-game-2-dodgers-win/,"['', ""LOS ANGELES -- One night after one of the most amazing and dramatic World Series games in history, the Dodgers cruised to a 4-2 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Fall Classic. There were no late-inning fireworks, nor did the Dodgers require any. That's because Yoshinobu Yamamoto was in total control for much of the night. "", ""He also really helped them set up for the rest of the series. We'll get to that. "", ""First, though, remember when Yamamoto was posted from Nippon Professional Baseball last offseason? The consensus was that he'd clear $250 million pretty easily and that means there was a limited pool of teams involved in serious bidding. As the time ticked down, two clear favorites among his suitors emerged: The Yankees and the Dodgers. "", 'Through that lens, Yamamoto here in Game 2 of the World Series was showing the Yankees what they missed out on. Yamamoto inked a 12-year, $325 million deal with the Dodgers and looked worth every penny in this one.', ""Really, other than his first start, he's been brilliant. Yamamoto was 7-2 with a 3.00 ERA and 1.11 WHIP with 105 strikeouts in 90 innings. This includes his catastrophic debut, when he gave up five runs in one inning in Seoul. He missed a big chunk of the season due to a shoulder injury, but he's been progressively getting better since his return. "", '""Every time I pitched, the last three games, I became more comfortable and I\'m feeling better,"" Yamamoto said through an interpreter before Game 1. ""Of course it\'s a World Series, so I might face a challenge, but I think I\'m -- because that benefits me, those previous three outings during the postseason.""', ""Yes, he was good in his previous two playoff starts after a bad one to start, but he was full-on dominant in Game 2, his first World Series start. In 6 ⅓ innings of work, he only allowed one hit. It was a solo home run off the bat of Juan Soto, but that can be forgiven because it's Juan Freaking Soto in the World Series. The only other blemishes on Yamamoto's ledger Saturday were two walks, but he pitched around those with relative ease. He struck out four. He induced lots of weak contact. He was masterful. "", ""Now, it wasn't just Yamamoto's outing that was impressive. It was the pressure he was able to take off the bullpen. Sure, there's a day off before Game 3, but the Dodgers might have to play three games in three days in New York -- unless they sweep and end this thing in four. This was the first time in 21 games that a starting pitcher against the Yankees went at least six innings. "", ""With Walker Buehler and a bullpen game looming, Yamamoto's brilliance and workload in Game 2 allowed the Dodgers to save a lot of those bullpen bullets. They only needed eight outs and got them from Anthony Banda, Michael Kopech, Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia. "", 'This is what an October ace looks like. The Dodgers have now won seven straight Yamamoto starts, with the latter four being playoff games, and, obviously, this one, his first World Series start.  ', ""The best baseball players in the world are excellent at curbing any nerves or emotions for the biggest games. They might feel nervous internally, but you can never tell from the outside. Yamamoto exemplified this in Game 2, looking calm and stoic throughout the outing. His manager was confident that's exactly what we'd see. "", '""The thing that excites me is his temperament, poise, the ability to control his emotions and still make pitches,"" Dave Roberts said before Game 2. ', 'On the biggest stage, Yamamoto delivered the goods and perfectly illustrated why he got the most lucrative pitcher contract in MLB history. Twisting the knife a bit into the Yankees, who missed out on signing him, was just an added bonus. And now the Dodgers need just two wins to earn the trophy.', '© 2004-2024 CBS INTERACTIVE.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto shines in World Series as Dodgers’ 2-0 edge takes on extra importance,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5875523/2024/10/27/yankees-dodgers-world-series-yoshinobu-yamamoto/,"['MLB', '', 'LOS ANGELES — For years before he made his move to Major League Baseball, before he became the highest-paid pitcher in the history of the sport, Yoshinobu Yamamoto was a subject of fascination. His training methods were idiosyncratic. His track record in Japan was one of dominance. His diminutive stature drew awe from executives throughout the game who marveled at his ability to manipulate a baseball.', '', 'On the largest stage of his baseball-playing life, the 5-foot-10 right-hander stood tallest. Yamamoto dominated the in the World Series, delivering the greatest start of his rookie campaign and bringing the Los Angeles Dodgers to within two wins of a championship.', '', '“He was lights out,” Kiké Hernández said.', '', 'What happened after Yamamoto left the mound only emphasized how important it was that the Dodgers’ $325 million man reached those heights Saturday night. Shohei Ohtani attempted to steal second base in the seventh inning and wound up after partially dislocating his left shoulder.', '', '', 'If Ohtani is out, it opens a window for a Yankees club that can close the margin on whatever slim lineup advantage the Dodgers may currently have. Soto has been New York’s most lethal weapon by far. Yamamoto neutralized Giancarlo Stanton, who has had a standout October, in three at-bats. Just about every opponent has faced this October has done an effective job of holding down the presumptive American League MVP; Judge struck out three times in four at-bats Saturday, including twice against Yamamoto.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '“I’m just really proud of him, where he started and where he is now,” Mookie Betts said.', 'The Yankees entered the series with what appeared to be a clear starting pitching advantage. The Dodgers managed to suppress that through two nights in Los Angeles, stealing a win in Game 1 after allowed just one run in six innings (Dodgers starter went 5 1/3 innings, allowing just two runs) and chasing another nine-figure starter in Carlos Rodón before he even complete the fourth inning on Saturday.', '', 'The Yankees’ advantage should, on paper, be greater in Games 3 and 4, where they will start Clarke Schmidt and ; the Dodgers will counter with Walker Buehler and a bullpen game after already asking two outings out of Blake Treinen (55 pitches), (24 pitches), (32 pitches) and Alex Vesia (17 pitches) through the series’ first two games.', '', '', 'Fabian Ardaya is a staff writer covering the Los Angeles Dodgers for The Athletic.
