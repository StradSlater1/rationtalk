He was 3-0 in the promotion with two finishes, and he had a dominant first round against Carlos Diego Ferreira before fading and getting finished in the third.', 'The hope here is that Rebecki has learned some lessons in terms of managing his gas tank following the loss. Even if he hasn’t, the multiple-time European no-gi grappling champion can hang with Orolbai on the ground, and he is a dangerous enough striker to potentially take an early round on the feet.', 'I’m splitting my exposure between Rebecki’s +260 moneyline and his point spread prop, but the latter is a much safer pick and still comes with some plus money attached.', 'The Pick: Mateusz Rebecki +3.5 point spread (+110 at DraftKings)', 'Senior Staff Writer at The Action Network', 'Fighter walkouts: Approx. 1:25 p.m. ET', ""I'll continue to find ways to bet against the undefeated Shara Magomedov, whose point-fighting, kick-oriented skill set doesn't match the Bond villain hype or aesthetic."", ""Magomedov has a two-inch reach advantage in this matchup.

If either of those ex-champs gets a rematch, Topuria will be flinging leather their way at full force again. He doesn't need to trash talk anyone. Topuria understands what it means to be a true champion. -- Wagenheim"", 'Khamzat Chimaev defeats Robert Whittaker, keeping his perfect record alive with a submission in the first round.', ""Is there any reason the UFC shouldn't catapult Khamzat Chimaev into a title fight? Who are we kidding here?"", 'I know the promotion promised former champion Sean Strickland a rematch with the man who took his title with a narrow decision. But this promise deserves to be broken because what Chimaev did to Robert Whittaker was a frightening reminder of why many crowned him a future champion just four fights into his UFC career back in 2021.', ""The health issues shouldn't be ignored, as they have slowed Chimaev from injecting himself into the title picture. But what he did to a former world champion who hadn't been submitted in nearly 13 years didn't serve as a suggestion -- it was a demand."", ""Strickland beating Paulo Costa by split decision and Chimaev steamrolling the higher-ranked Whittaker aren't in the same stratosphere when it comes to which performance is deserving of a title opportunity."", 'Yes, Strickland will certainly be unhappy that Chimaev jumped the line, but this was a one-sided outing against a former champion. Whittaker landed a grand total of two leg kicks before being sucked into the Chimaev vacuum and being forced to wear a ""Borz"" blanket.', ""And let's talk about that finish. It may have looked like Whittaker tapped early once the face crank was sunk in. However, Daniel Cormier shared a photo of Whittaker's crushed jaw on the broadcast, further cementing Chimaev as a force unlike any other in the division."", ""Chimaev took zero damage in the fight and said he is ready to challenge for the gold. It would be silly to deny him that opportunity. Sometimes, waiting for a title opportunity leaves you open to watching someone dart ahead of you. It's the cost of standing still when everyone else is moving. But, honestly, isn't the fight to make for Strickland a rematch with Israel Adesanya?"", 'How about we do that and let Du Plessis and Chimaev duke it out in early 2025. -- Hale', 'For my money, Magomed Ankalaev should have already been a UFC champion. I thought, very strongly, he beat Jan Blachowicz when they fought for the vacant title in 2022. The judges ruled that one a split draw, as UFC CEO Dana White was not a fan of how it played out, and Ankalaev has been on the slowest possible route back to a title ever since. The UFC already passed him up for a title fight earlier this year, when a 205-pound title shot went to Khalil Rountree, who was much lower in the rankings.', ""It's pretty apparent Ankalaev deserves a shot against Alex Pereira, but it's also quite obvious he's not the best thing for business. He's just not. And right now, the UFC has seen some fights go in a way that's not the best for business. Sean O'Malley losing his title isn't great for business. Jon Jones fighting once in over a year as heavyweight champion, not great. Belal Muhammad, widely known for his tendency to take opponents the distance, also not great."", ""The UFC is fantastic in that it regularly makes fights of the best against the best, but I do wonder how they'll handle this one. A lot could ride on what happens next month at heavyweight between Jones and Stipe Miocic. Who wins that? And who retires after? -- Okamoto"", '', '', '']"

Max Holloway mocks Ilia Topuria for mindless challenge: This isn’t for the ‘dumbest mother effer’ belt,https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/10/20/24274690/max-holloway-mocks-ilia-topuria-for-point-down-challenge-this-isnt-for-the-dumbest-mother-effer-belt,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Featherweight champion Ilia Topuria has made all sorts of predictions for his upcoming fight at UFC 308, but don’t expect Max Holloway to entertain any of his so-called challenges.', 'The most recent declaration from Topuria was that he planned to march to center of the octagon at the start of the fight and point to the ground as an invitation for Holloway to meet him there to start trading bombs. It’s a gesture that Holloway made famous after he did that years ago to prompt a wild exchange in the closing moments of his fight with Ricardo Lamas before doing it again at UFC 300 and pulling off one of the craziest knockouts in history with a last-second finish over Justin Gaethje.', 'Holloway says the problem with Topuria trying to steal his move is that he doesn’t even understand when or why he’s done that in the past.', '“The point down moment — I don’t think he gets the gist of it,” Holloway told MMA Fighting. “At the end of the day the point down, it’s something that you do towards the ending of the fight. If something is going good, if the fight is entertaining or you’re winning, you give the other guy a shot. The moment is the moment for a reason.”', 'Topuria promised if Holloway actually met him in the center and threw caution to the wind that he would deliver a first-round knockout. Holloway doesn’t discount that as a possibility—just like he could leave Topuria face down on the canvas in the same exchange—but that’s courting disaster in a fight that’s supposed to showcase two of the best and most skilled fighters in the world.', '“The belt is called the ‘Blessed Man Forever’ or what you guys want to call ‘the baddest mother effer,’” Holloway said referencing the ‘BMF’ title he won when he defeated Gaethje. “If the belt was the ‘DMF,’ the dumbest mother effer, then maybe I would get sucked into it. It’s far from that.', '“Like what I told you, and I told him, he talks about being boxer — that’s not very much boxer IQ’ish of him, but we’ll see what happens.”', 'Topuria challenging Holloway to throw down with him in a Toughman-style brawl is just the latest bit of trash talk coming from the featherweight champion ahead of UFC 308. He’s also said recently that Holloway didn’t actually want this fight but instead was forced into accepting the title bout after the UFC supposedly passed on a potential matchup against Michael Chandler instead.', 'If Topuria is trying to get in Holloway’s head with these constant jabs, he might be wasting his time because the 32-year-old Hawaiian can only laugh at that accusation.', '“The first guy I called out [after UFC 300] was the man sitting ringside,” Holloway says referencing Topuria. “It’s funny. He says that, but then you can go and click, there’s an interview of him saying that he won’t fight me if the BMF title wasn’t on the line. The last time I checked, the BMF title is not on the line.', '“So if anybody got forced to fight, it looks like him. It came out of his own mouth. He said he wasn’t going to fight me unless the BMF title is on the line. It’s not, buddy. So I guess he played himself on that one.”', 'Holloway admits that he had plenty of options available to him after his jaw-dropping win over Gaethje, but the only fight he really wanted was the one he got at UFC 308.', '“I wanted Ilia Topuria,” Holloway said. “I wanted the featherweight title. I wanted to be a two-time world [champion]. The undisputed title is what I wanted.”', 'Between now and Saturday night, Holloway expects he’ll hear Topuria issue more nonsensical challenges and make all sorts of predictions about the fight.', 'None of that matters much to Holloway as long as Topuria shows up at his very best and doesn’t forget to bring that UFC title with him to Abu Dhabi.', '“At the end of the day, if that’s what he needs to get himself to the fight or through the fight or whatever it is to the date, then so be it,” Holloway said. “Some people, that’s what they need. They need that self-confidence. They need to build their self-confidence some way, and if it’s pumping his chest and slapping his chest and being like ‘I’m the man,’ then that’s him.', '“You can’t take it away. He got pretty far using that technique. So at the end of the day, if he’s using it for this fight, so be it.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
COACH CONVERSATION | ILIA TOPURIA VS MAX HOLLOWAY,https://www.ufc.com/news/coach-conversation-main-event-topuria-holloway-ufc-308,"['Ahead of every championship fight, UFC staff writer E. Spencer Kyte sits down with one the sharpest coaching minds in the sport to break down the action and provide UFC fans with insights into each championship pairing from the men who spend their days getting these elite athletes prepared to compete on the biggest stage in the sport.', 'In advance of this weekend’s featherweight title clash between defending champ Ilia Topuria and current BMF titleholder and ex-featherweight ruler Max Holloway , Kyte called upon TUF alum and UFC veteran Eliot Marshall, who now serves as the co-owner and head instructor at Easton Training Center in Denver to provide his thoughts on four points of interest heading into this fascinating championship headliner at Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi.', '', 'Kyte: Let’s get into this — what’s the best trait of Ilia Topuria and what’s the best trait of Max Holloway?', 'Marshall: For Ilia, it’s his patience, his power, and his timing.', 'How To Watch UFC 308 In Your Region | Main Card At A Special Time: 2pm ET / 11am PT', 'My opinion on Max Holloway is that it’s that dog, that willingness to just engage and die. What he did with (Justin) Gaethje at the end (of their fight at UFC 300), there was zero reason for that.', 'Kyte: I wrote something about it recently and said that exact same thing: he pulled that stuff out when he’s up 3-1, at worst, and he’s already won that round, there are 12 seconds left and he’s like (makes Max Holloway point to ground motion).', 'Marshall: He’s up and the fifth round is over!', 'Kyte: It’s “I’m gonna give you the chance to land a massive shot, and if you do, you win.”', 'Marshall: There was so much at risk in that 10 seconds, and he literally just gave Gaethje a chance, but that sums up who he is.', 'Now look, that was a little luck; that’s God repaying him for entertaining us. They’re just swinging and zigging and zagging, and Gaethje zigged as Max was zagging and that was it.', ""Saturday's Full Fight Card Preview"", 'That wasn’t skill — hold on; I’ll say this about that: Gaethje was slower and beaten down in that moment, so probably didn’t move as crisply and as quickly as he possibly could because of all the other things Max had done through skill throughout those five rounds.', 'Kyte: The 24 minutes and 50 seconds before hand is why he’s more vulnerable to that shot.', 'Marshall: But Max always does that. Max is always willing. Max is a dog.', 'Kyte: I feel like the only time we didn’t really see it was the third fight with Volk (Alexander Volkanovski) and who knows? Sometimes you turn up and it’s not your night, you’re not firing, and you can’t pull it out. He got beaten clearly in that fight.', 'Marshall: He got beaten in that fight, but maybe Volk is his kryptonite. Styles make fights.', 'Kyte: 100 percent, and up until February, nobody had beaten that dude at featherweight in the UFC, so it’s not like he lost to some scrub. He’s got four losses in the last 11 years: three of them are to Volk, who was the pound-for-pound No. 1 and the other one was he went up to lightweight and fought (Dustin) Poirier.', 'Marshall: On short notice.', 'Kyte: Yeah. And he lost the fight, but it was competitive.', 'Marshall: So he took a fight on short notice against the No. 1 contender, a weight class above, and lost a decision, and he lost three decisions to the best guy at featherweight that has ever done it? Got it.', 'So this is the guy we’re talking about, and if you’re gonna ask who is the second best featherweight to ever do it, it’s probably him.', 'Kyte: There are a lot of people who will be really mad when they read this that say, “You’re forgetting Jose Aldo,” but we’re not forgetting Jose Aldo. He’s terrific. He’s No. 3.', 'Marshall: He didn’t have the competition in the WEC that now exists in the UFC at 145 pounds. Not knocking him, but what we have now? The competition is so much better. I hate doing this because we’re knocking the third best ever to do it in that division.', 'Kyte: Right. He’s third. There have been how many, and he’s No. 3; relax. Okay, back to it.', 'When you say it’s those three things for Topuria — patience, power, and timing — what is it that makes them stand out? We see the power when he puts people out, but when it comes to the patience and the precision, it feels a little uncanny to me compared to a lot of these folks.', 'Marshall: Remember when Anderson (Silva) used to do it in the first round? He would do it with movement and he’d joke around a little bit, where Topuria just does it so much better.', 'He’s staying in his stance, staying solid, putting some reads out there, and gaining a lot of information — watching how you move and react — and then he goes for the kill. One shot. He’s so hard to do anything against because he’s so patient as well. You can’t get your offense going because he’s doing all this while putting some forward pressure on, so you always have to worried about this massive power that is coming your way.', 'It’s different than how Anderson did it, which was all footwork and movement and he let the other person attack. Topuria does it with this forward pressure, but not actually striking a lot.', 'UFC 308 Embedded', 'Kyte: It’s walking you down. You’ve got to be worried about the hands, obviously, but he’s also a very good wrestler and he’s terrific on the ground, so you’re just stuck worrying about all these things while he’s also not giving you a ton of opportunities to throw.', 'Sean (Madden) and I talked about this in the last Coach Conversation regarding counter fighters that get stuck just constantly waiting because you’re never given the opportunity to go. Topuria feels like the guy that absolutely works those people, because you’re just stuck waiting and missing your spot.', 'Marshall: And then you’re out.', 'Kyte: I think he’s been great, obviously. I think there was some hesitation for some people after the Josh Emmett fight, but it’s a very good win.', 'Marshall: You don’t show up as Superman every night, but can you still get the win? Can you still figure out how to win on your off nights?', 'This is what makes champions champions. This is what separates the Andersons and the GSPs and the Jon Joneses from everyone else, where it’s “I’m in a dogfight here; can I figure this out?”', 'The Emmett fight wasn’t a dogfight, but on your worst nights, can you still…', 'Kyte: If your worst night is 50-45 against Josh Emmett, that’s pretty okay.', 'Marshall: Right, but this is what separates the best. Let’s just say he was a little off that night; okay — he still dusted him!', 'Kyte: Everyone would love a 10-second knockout or a quick submission, but that’s not often how these things go, especially not at the championship level. Instead, it’s usually the competitor that has crafted the better game plan and did the better job of executing things inside the Octagon that comes away with their hand raised and the gold around their waist.', 'So, how does either man get it done on Saturday night?', 'Marshall: The path to victory? Max? Put that pace on him, dog! Put that f***** pace on him that just tends to break people; everyone except Volk. Everyone at ’45, but Volk.', 'Topuria? I think if Topuria wrestles too much he’s gonna get tired.', 'How To Watch UFC 308 In Your Region | Main Card At A Special Time: 2pm ET / 11am PT', 'Kyte: I agree. I think this is tricky. I’ve been trying to figure this out for a couple days now knowing we were doing this.', 'I think it has to be a real combo platter of things.', 'Marshall: I was about to say, “Catch him early with a big shot and make Max hesitate after that,” but Max is too much of a dog for that; he’s not gonna care.', 'Kyte: You would normally think exactly that — get him early and put him away somewhere in the next couple rounds — but Max has never been stopped.', 'Marshall: The reason I would say catch him early and hurt him is I don’t think he’s gonna put him away, right, but that would change how Max did the fight moving forward. But Max isn’t gonna change. Max doesn’t give a f***!', 'I think for Topuria, he has to do what he does and not get hit a lot.', 'Kyte: He needs to be the faster guy. It needs to be combinations when you get into those exchanges, low kicks always help, wrestle a little.', 'Marshall: What Volk did really well was he switches up his tempo and he switches up his stances, but that’s not Topuria. I don’t know. I’ve been thinking all weekend knowing I have to answer this question, and…', 'Kyte: It’s weird because he absolutely has a great opportunity to win this fight, but when you try to articulate it and lay it out, it’s tough because you don’t just wanna say, “He’s gonna knock out Max Holloway.”', 'If he does, all the power in the world to him, but I can’t sit here and say that’s gonna happen.', 'Marshall: That’s not the path to victory. “Catch him with the shot!” That’s not a path.', 'Kyte: At least not at ’45 and not against Max Holloway.', 'I feel like this is one where he’s got to be the craftier guy; he’s gotta be the slicker guy. I absolutely think he can be, but there is — as you said — a dog standing in front of him that is going to be coming after him.', 'Marshall: I think he’s got to mix in some clinches to tire Max out. Not even go for the takedown — if it comes, great, and you can let him right back up. He can’t fight too hard to hold him down because that’s exhausting and Max is so hard to hold down.', 'But you can tire him out on the fence. You can knee his legs, you can slow down his movement, kick his arms so they’re slower.', 'Kyte: If you drag him down, you can look for stuff out of that front headlock series, see if you can catch something, because that’s what he’s best with.', 'Marshall: Obviously anything can happen, as always, but you’re not banking on that s***.', 'Max’s path to victory is easy, you know it; it’s what he’s done to everyone else. The way Topuria wins is not the way you beat Max Holloway historically. He might be able to and we’re gonna wait and see and find out.', 'And if he does, you and I will text each other and be like, “Well, that was impressive!”', 'Kyte: But the idea of Topuria pressuring forward, making Max hesitate and not throw is hard to picture, especially after what we saw from Max at UFC 300.', 'Order UFC 308: Topuria vs Holloway', 'Marshall: This is one of those things where I’m not saying Topuria can’t win — I’m not saying that at all — but nailing down how is difficult.', 'Here’s what I’ll say: Option 1, we’re gonna be shocked that Topuria actually knocks Max out.  Option 2, Max is either gonna dust him like he was dusting Gaethje, minus the knockout at the end, or, Option 3, it’s super close and I think it’s most likely the third one, but those feel like the three possible outcomes of this fight.', 'Kyte: If there was one thing that was going to significantly impact how this fight plays out — that swings it in one direction or the other — what would it be?', 'Marshall: We don’t know if Topuria is a dog or not.', 'Kyte: There are so many questions about this kid. It’s great. I love it.', 'Marshall: We haven’t seen him tested. He’s had tough fights, he’s fought tough guys, but we need to see the dog in you.', 'Kyte: He’s one of those guys where he’s talking it, but we need to see it. Putting featherweight champ in the bio and then backing it up is some high-quality bravado, but let’s see it here, too.', 'Do you think Topuria has that dog in him? From what you’ve seen of him, do you think it’s there?', 'Marshall: He’s not Max Holloway, I will say that. What was his life like in Georgia? That’s what I need to know.', 'Kyte: He moved with his family to Spain when he was 15, after moving to Georgia from Germany when he was five.', 'Marshall: I’m leaning towards him having a little above the normal level of dog in him. I don’t know enough about his life so I can’t answer this question as completely and effectively as I would like, but when you look at the Khabibs of the world, when you look at the Dagestan guys, their lives were tough.', 'Matt Brown overdosed and died. “Cowboy” nearly died. It’s these life experiences, man.', 'Kyte: I’m so curious to see.', 'Marshall: Look at how many fights Max took to get to the title. Look at Anderson — he fought an entire career before he got to the UFC and got the title.', 'You look at some of these guys and again — maybe he does; he absolutely could (have that dog in him), but six fights before the title? One hard one and then the champ? They’re all hard, but they’re not all Top 10 guys.', 'And then after you get to the top, do you still have (that same drive)? We don’t know any of this with him.', 'Kyte: This is why it’s such an interesting fight.', 'Kyte: Coaches see the sport differently and look at the sport differently than anyone else, picking up on different things and paying attention to movements, habits, or intangible pieces that others might not notice, but that could have a significant impact on the action inside the Octagon.', 'Every matchup offers its own unique collection of elements that might pique a coach’s interest and get them paying a little closer attention to once the fight gets underway.', 'So what is that one thing in this matchup?', 'Marshall: I wanna see if Topuria can make Max hesitate like he does to everyone else; like what you and Sean were talking about with counter fighters and it’s “there was my spot!” because that’s probably his path, right? And then maybe close the distance off that; mix up that style of fighting so Max can never get going.', 'Because if Max gets into his rhythm and puts you on his pace, there is no one in the world that is beating him.', 'That’s what Volk did to stop him — he didn’t let him get there.', 'Kyte: Messed up the zones, messed up the timing; came all the way in at times, he was all the way out at times, he’s longer than you think he is.', 'Marshall: I wanna see if he can do it because that’s what he’s gonna try; he’s not gonna come out and change his style. He’s the champ and it’s worked and he just knocked out Volk, so there is no way he’s changing his style.', 'How To Watch UFC 308 In Your Region | Main Card At A Special Time: 2pm ET / 11am PT', 'Kyte: Right.', 'Marshall: He’s the champ and he hasn’t lost — why in the f*** would you think you’ve gotta do something different?', 'Kyte: But it makes for a really interesting question and fight.', 'Marshall: Yeah, because Max is gonna come out and do what he does!

UFC 308 predictions,https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/10/25/24279317/ufc-308-predictions,"['FILED UNDER:', 'No matter what happens with Max Holloway and Robert Whittaker at UFC 308, these former champions are proof you can’t keep a good fighter down.', 'First, let’s talk about Holloway, the current “BMF” champion and former featherweight champion looking to regain the latter title when he takes on the undefeated Ilia Topuria in Saturday’s main event in Abu Dhabi. Holloway had a brilliant run as champion from 2017 to 2019 before running into rival Alexander Volkanovski, a fellow future Hall of Famer that just so happens to be his perfect foil. Holloway’s inability to get one over on Volkanovski seemed to signal the end of his run as 145’s top dog, but he just kept winning tough fights, putting on spectacular performances, and creating viral moments to the point that he forced his way back into the title conversation.', 'Now we’ll see if Holloway can cap off one of the most feel-good stories we’ve ever seen.', 'The stakes aren’t quite as high for Whittaker in the co-main event, but he faces a similar challenge as he takes on a gifted opponent who has never tasted defeat. Whittaker faced his own version of Volkanovski in the form of then-champion Israel Adesanya and future champion Dricus du Plessis, two opponents that relegated Whittaker to contender status. But like Holloway, he’s crawled his way back into spitting distance of a title, and an upset of Chimaev will have fans blowing up Dana White’s socials to give “The Reaper” his due.', 'Everyone should appreciate what Holloway and Whittaker are attempting to achieve here, because no one would have blamed them if they gave up on their championship dreams when they were at their lowest.', 'In other main card action, No. 1 light heavyweight contender looks to become, uh, even more the No. 1 contender (?) when he fights Aleksandar Rakic, Lerone Murphy meets Dan Ige in a bout with sneaky featherweight title implications, and the popular Shara Bullet opens the main card against Armen Petrosyan.', 'What: UFC 308', 'Where: Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi', 'When: Saturday, Oct. 26. The eight-fight preliminary card begins at 10 a.m. ET on ESPN+, followed by the five-fight main card at 2 p.m. ET exclusively on ESPN+ pay-per-view', '(Numbers in parentheses indicate standing in MMA Fighting’s Global Rankings and Pound-for-Pound Rankings)', 'Whether you’re rooting for Max Holloway or not, there’s plenty of reason to believe he can beat Ilia Topuria besides good vibes.', 'Yes, Topuria beat Alexander Volkanovski and Volkanovski beat Holloway three times, but put aside the MMA math and you’ll see this is a classic case of styles making fights. The “finish fast” mind set Topuria employed against Volkanovski won’t serve him as well against the titanium-chinned Holloway. If Topuria goes too hard in the opening rounds, he could find himself swimming upstream in the championship frames.', 'It’s on Holloway to make him work though. Holloway’s mixture of high volume and precision will give Topuria headaches, but Topuria’s technical skills are so sharp, he could catch Holloway with some of the same shots that felled Volkanovski. I don’t expect Holloway to go down and stay down, but could Topuria become just the second fighter to knock him down? I see it.', 'I’m looking past all of the weird side quests Topuria seems determined to talk about and trusting him to be at his best on fight night, because when he’s on, he’s legitimately one of the five best fighters in the world. Topuria can make a huge statement with a convincing win over Holloway and while I don’t expect him to dominate from bell-to-bell, he should come out with a controversy-free decision victory.', 'Pick: Topuria', 'Look, I can’t tell you for sure I didn’t write all those nice things about Robert Whittaker and Max Holloway to soften the blow of me picking against them both. But I’m picking against then both.', 'Dricus du Plessis wrote the blueprint for bullying Whittaker and as much as Whittaker learned from that loss, I don’t think he he has an answer for the sheer physicality of Khamzat Chimaev. I’ve never hopped off the Chimaev bandwagon, confident in my belief he can beat anyone as long as he makes it to the cage.', 'As I write this, there’s still plenty of time for Saturday’s co-main event to fall through, but assuming Chimaev makes the walk, I expect his unreal combination of strength, speed, wrestling ability, and raw power to be on full display. We’ll know early if Whittaker is poised to play the spoiler if he can stuff a few Chimaev takedowns and avoid early flurries on the feet. Don’t forget, this is a five-round fight, and if Whittaker takes it past Round 3, Chimaev’s chances of winning decrease exponentially with every passing minute.', 'So this is a leap of faith of sorts as I’m going with Chimaev to keep his act together and finish Whittaker in the first or second round.', 'Pick: Chimaev', 'This is just the ultimate banana peel for Magomed Ankalaev.', 'Unbeaten in 12 straight fights, Ankalaev is somehow at risk of potentially losing out on what should have been a surefire crack at the light heavyweight title to Aleksandar Rakic, despite Rakic coming off of two straight losses separated by a two-year injury layoff. MMA.', 'Rakic is a threat, too! He looked sharp in his comeback fight before getting Prochazka’d and if he sticks to the game plan of leg kicks and counter combos, it could be a serious problem for Ankalaev. When Ankalaev fought to a draw with Jan Blachowicz, much of his struggles came as a result of Blachowicz chipping away at his leg for the first three rounds. Then Ankalaev went to his wrestling to turn the fight on its head.', 'Should he consider focusing on his wrestling to stifle Rakic’s offense? It couldn’t hurt, though the rangy Rakic has shown good takedown defense when he’s had to use it. With only three rounds to work—and more importantly, to impress Dana White—Ankalaev might have to throw caution to the wind and stick to a standup duel.', 'That won’t be a problem for Ankalaev, a great striker that has strangely been labeled as an unappealing challenger for Pereira despite half of his UFC wins coming by way of knockout. He’ll mix the martial arts to break Rakic’s rhythm if it comes to it, but when it’s time to finish, Ankalaev will let loose with his limbs and take Rakic out.', 'Pick: Ankalaev', 'After several years where he struggled to string together fights, Lerone Murphy is finally in the swing of things and now it’s just a matter of making that brutal climb up the featherweight ladder. Dan Ige is the next logical step, a veteran that has gone the distance with the best of them even if he’s fallen short of proving he’s a top-10 fighter himself.', 'Murphy showed off an incredible pressure game in his recent win over Edson Barboza, but don’t expect Ige to wilt against the same tactics. “50K” is always in great shape and a hard 15 minutes won’t trouble him in the slightest. I’m guessing we see Murphy mixing up his tactics more, stinging Ige on the feet when he finds an opening and taking him down if the standup exchanges get too hot.', 'Overall though, I like Murphy to edge out a close striking battle, doing just enough to beat Ige to the punch and prevent him from getting his own offense going. It won’t be easy, but Murphy’s undefeated streak continues.', 'Pick: Murphy', 'Don’t ask me why, I’m expecting so much weirdness in this matchup.', '“Shara Bullet” should win this based on his finishing ability and unpredictable movement, but they haven’t given him a layup in Armen Petrosyan. The Russian-Armenian kickboxer specializes in drawn-out, methodical standup fights, which could lead to frustration for Magomedov (and those of us watching at home). Neither fighter has shown an inclination to push the pace, so look forward to long stretches of halfhearted flicks and feints as they work to goad the other man into a mistake.', 'That said, I can’t shake the thought that this fight will be filled with odd fouls, a restless crowd calling for more action, and maybe even a scoring controversy if we’re lucky. Magomedov brings a huge following with him whenever he steps into the octagon and there’s star potential there, but I remain unconvinced he can impose his will on a fight. Happy to be proven wrong.', 'Magomedov by decision?', 'Pick: Magomedov', 'Ibo Aslan def. Raffael Cerqueira', 'Rafael dos Anjos def. Geoff Neal (13)', 'Myktybek Orolbai def. Mateusz Rebecki', 'Brunno Ferreira def. Abus Magomedov', 'Chris Barnett def. Kennedy Nzechukwu', 'Farid Basharat def. Victor Hugo', 'Ismail Naurdiev def. Bruno Silva', 'Rinat Fakhretdinov def. Carlos Leal', '', '']"
UFC 308 Preview and Predictions: The MMA Mashup,https://www.rotowire.com/mma/article/ufc-308-preview-and-predictions-the-mma-mashup-86386,"[""While we may have seen better Pay-Per-Views overall, UFC 308 still features an intriguing 13-fight slate, including one of the best fights that can be made in the sport as its main event. We'll take a look at each bout across three platforms, including a couple of lopsided lines and two knockout artists classed as slight underdogs. Our betting lines this week come from the RotoWire MMA betting page and are accurate to the post date of this article. "", 'Murphy is one of the most complete featherweight prospects we have seen in some time, allowing him to excel against wrestlers, strikers, and submission grapplers. He is essentially a better version of Dan Ige, a fighter with slick boxing who can wrestle and grapple when the situation calls for it. Expect Murphy to capitalize in the striking and be a step ahead in exchanges if this fight hits the ground.', 'Mateusz Rebecki ran through his early opponents with his power and pressure but took a life-changing beating from the first fighter who could weather the storm and out-grapple him in Carlos Diego Ferreira. Orolbai may not have the athleticism of the Brazilian, but hits plenty hard and should be able to outscramble Rabecki on the mat. This will lead to the musclebound Polish fighter gassing once again, allowing Orolbai to take the fight over completely.', 'Fakhretdinov\'s windmill approach when he is forced to stand at range for any length of time puts an element of risk into his matchup against Muay Thai specialist Carlos Leal, but the Brazilian stands so upright in the pocket it\'s difficult to imagine that the ""Gladiator"" won\'t be able to regularly find clinch positions. While he is a veteran of the sport, there aren\'t many grapplers as committed as Rinat on Leal\'s resume, which makes it hard to pick him in a spot like this. ', 'Ismail Naurdiev will be thought of as the superior grappler in this matchup, but I will stop short of saying he will be dominated on the ground, as Naurdiev put up almost no offense whatsoever in a 2019 loss to Chance Rencountre, which saw him controlled for over 11 minutes. Silva has shown himself to be a capable wrestler and should be miles ahead while in striking range, as Naurdiev frequently leaves himself open to be hit. Neither man has set the MMA world on fire of late, but Silva was only taken down once by an incredibly strong grappler in Chris Weidman, which makes me think he should be prepared for this matchup.', 'At last check, the fight between Cerqueira and Ibo Aslan is (-600) to finish inside the distance, making it imperative to choose a side in DFS. While there may not be much daylight between the two, Aslan stands incredibly flatfooted in the pocket while also being at an athleticism and grappling disadvantage. Both men swing hard, which suggests that players should have some exposure on either side, but Cerqueira should have the depth of game and physical gifts to get the job done.', 'We finally saw Abus Magomedov employ a grappling-heavy style to get the win over Warlley Alves, but even that was more challenging than it likely should have been, with the Russian fighter looking noticeably tired in Round 3 and only recording six more significant strikes than his opponent. Ferreira is not a pure grappler but can scramble well on the ground and may even look for his own takedowns to work from top position. While Abus\'s skill set could potentially play well, I don\'t see him being able to avoid the power of ""The Hulk"" for 15 minutes.', ""Basharat would do well to copy the blueprint from Victor Hugo's last opponent, who pushed him up against the cage and looked for takedowns from the opening bell. The Bashharat brothers like mixing a healthy dose of striking with their grappling, but it's difficult to imagine Farid will want to spend too much time at range with such a dangerous striker."", 'It honestly feels as though the linemakers forgot the bout between Chimaev and Robert Whittaker will be decided over five rounds. ""Borz"" landed 38 strikes over just three rounds against Kamaru Usman, and while he was grounded and eventually finished by Dricus Du Plessis, Whittaker has historically been very difficult to take to the ground. This leads me to believe ""The Reaper"" will take this fight into deep waters, which has the potential to easily clear this total. ', ""Shara and Armen Petrosyan seem destined to have a 15-minute kickboxing match despite Petroysan's ability to grapple if he has to. The issue here is that both men are incredibly hittable and hard to put away, which should dictate a lot of strikes being exchanged in the center of the cage."", 'Much has been made about Topuria\'s finishing abilities heading into his bout with Max Holloway. The fact remains, however, that the next time ""Blessed"" loses by KO/TKO will be his first time in 33 professional fights. He also possesses elite takedown defense (84 percent). This means we win twice, as we get treated to an absolute war which should easily go beyond the early stages of the third round. ', ""Heavyweights are known for their ability to end fights early, but not all heavyweight fights are created equal. Nzechukwu is a slow starter, having seen a second round in five of his last six fights. We should also note that Chris Barnett has yet to have a UFC fight end in the first frame in four appearances. Given this, it's difficult to understand the line here, as neither man has shown themselves to be particularly knockout-prone in their respective careers."", 'At the risk of having to eat my words later on, any reasonable line feels like a gift here, as two durable, slow-paced kickboxers look set to strike with each other. While both men have been involved in fights that finished recently, their opponents in these matchups were incredibly active strikers. That will not be the case here, with both men looking to meticulously find their shots over three rounds.', 'As a fan of this sport for more than a decade, I am struggling to remember a single fight won by Rafael dos Anjos in which he could not outgrapple his opponent. Meanwhile, Neal\'s defensive grappling has stood up to some of the best and most persistent wrestlers in the sport, as he notched a decisive victory over Belal Muhammad, and gave Shavkat Rakhmonov his toughest fight to date. ""RDA"" has never lacked heart, but the former lightweight champion will simply be overmatched in this one, adding to his less-than-stellar resume at 170 pounds.
