Most people get sick three or four days after eating contaminated food, but the infection can take anywhere from eight hours to 10 days to become apparent.', 'Here are answers to common questions about E. coli:', 'The term refers to a family of bacteria that typically live in the intestines of humans and other animals.', 'Some strains are harmless or possibly beneficial, but the strain in this particular outbreak produces a toxin that can eat through the lining of the gut, causing bloody diarrhea, or, in rare cases, bloodstream infections, said Dr. Daniel Pastula, a professor of neurology, infectious disease and epidemiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.', 'The strains that are harmful to humans cause abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. If the bacteria reach the bloodstream, they can cause blood clots that damage the kidneys.', 'Children under 5, adults over 65 and people with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of complications.', 'The most common causes are undercooked beef or raw milk, though people also can sick from eating produce contaminated at the farm, Pastula said.', 'Cross-contamination in the kitchen, such as handling ground beef and then slicing raw vegetables without thoroughly washing your hands, also can result in an infection.', 'Your first priority is staying hydrated, even if drinking water and electrolyte beverages is the last thing you feel like doing while sick to your stomach. If you’re showing signs of dehydration, such as urinating less frequently, dizziness, or confusion, call your health care provider or go to an emergency room.', 'The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment asked that people with symptoms consistent with E. coli who recently ate at McDonald’s call their local health departments, so they can keep track of where the illness is popping up.', 'If you live with other people, you can take precautions to avoid passing the infection to them. Don’t cook for anyone other than yourself (not that you’re likely to want to host while sick), and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. The bacteria can spread when a sick person touches surfaces with contaminated hands.', 'For people who have severe cases, antibiotic treatment may make sense, but it can cause more problems for those who aren’t as ill, Pastula said. Antibiotics also kill off beneficial bacteria, and killing large amounts of E. coli at once can lead to a dangerous release of toxins, he said.', '“It’s not as simple as you have bacteria in your gut, I’m going to give you an antibiotic, you’ll be fine,” he said.', 'While you can’t control contamination in restaurants or on farms, safe food handling in your kitchen will reduce your risk of getting sick:', '“I think this (outbreak) shows the importance of food safety practices,” Pastula said. “There’s always going to be potential bacteria and viruses that threaten our food supply.”', 'Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group']"

McDonald’s confirmed that California-based vegetable producer Taylor Farms is the supplier of onions it removed from its supply chain. Taylor Farms issued a recall on four raw onion products, citing potential E. coli contamination, restaurant supplier U.S. Foods\nsaid in a notice to customers Thursday. (U.S. Foods is not a supplier for McDonald’s.)', 'The CDC initially reported 49 people became ill from the outbreak from Sept. 27 to Oct. 11. The tally has now risen to 75 cases across 13 states, including at least 22 hospitalizations, according to a CDC update on Friday. Health experts say the number of cases will likely rise as the investigation progresses.', 'Just two days after the CDC issued its advisory notice, it’s too soon to tell how the outbreak could affect McDonald’s business, especially if the case count grows. But investors are already worried that it could cause sales to fall at the company, which has been trying to rebound from lagging traffic by offering deals to price-sensitive customers.', 'Company spokespeople said Wednesday that’s it’s far too early to share if the outbreak was having any effect on its restaurants’ sales. McDonald’s is expected to report its third-quarter results on Oct. 29 before the markets open.', 'The damage to the business will depend in part on how effectively McDonald’s has already contained the outbreak — and how well it can convince diners it is safe to eat at its restaurants.', 'Investigations into multistate foodborne outbreaks can last from a few weeks to up to several months. ', 'But Dr. Thomas Jaenisch, an epidemiology professor at the Colorado School of Public Health, believes it will likely take two or three weeks for federal agencies and McDonald’s to determine the exact source of contamination and chain of events leading to the E. coli outbreak. He said any testing of ingredients and supply sources “really shouldn’t take that long.”', 'The CDC has said the number of confirmed cases related to the McDonald’s E. coli outbreak could grow as the investigation continues, as many people recover from an infection without testing for it or receiving medical care. It also typically takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick patient is part of an outbreak, the agency added. ', 'There’s also the possibility that cases could crop up in new states or regions that haven’t reported any illnesses, according to Xiang Yang, a professor and meat scientist at the University of California, Davis. ', 'For example, a person traveling to a state impacted by the outbreak, such as Colorado, could have gotten infected with E. coli and brought it back to where they are from, according to Yang. It is also unclear if the onion supplier ships ingredients to restaurants in other regions of the U.S., which could potentially spread the E.coli strain that caused the McDonald’s outbreak. ', 'That strain, called O157:H7, can cause a serious complication that can lead to kidney failure. One of the patients in the McDonald’s outbreak suffered from that condition, known as hemolytic uremic syndrome. The federal government essentially bans the sale of any ground beef contaminated with the strain, requiring suppliers to test their products for it.', 'E. coli can spread through contaminated food or water, or by an individual coming into contact with an infected person, environment or animal. ', 'The CDC and the 10 states impacted have been interviewing each patient case to get detailed information about their exposure to E. coli, such as what they ate and when, according to Craig Hedberg, the co-director of the Minnesota Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence. Hedberg is also a member of the McDonald’s Food Safety Advisory Council, but said he has not worked with the company on its response to the outbreak. ', 'The CDC and the states have been sharing the information they gather with the Food and Drug Administration to trace onion distribution and identify a specific source of contamination, he said. The information is also shared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, which does the same with ground beef. ', 'The CDC is investigating both the Quarter Pounder’s uncooked slivered onions and its beef patty as the potential culprit for the outbreak. ', 'Hedberg said contamination of raw onions with E. coli is “highly plausible,” noting several salmonella outbreaks have been linked to onions in recent years. ', 'McDonald’s uses a single onion supplier, which washes and slices the vegetable, in the affected area. ', 'Meanwhile, McDonald’s uses multiple beef suppliers in the region, and its burgers are supposed to be cooked to an internal temperature that would kill the bacteria. The size of the outbreak “would imply widespread undercooking by many different individual McDonald’s restaurants” if beef was the culprit, according to Hedberg.', 'But he said that seems unlikely since most fast-food chains have designed their cooking systems to prevent E. coli contamination of ground beef, which is a widely recognized hazard. Still, investigators will likely examine the cooking practices of multiple locations as part of the investigation, Hedberg noted. ', 'Jaenisch said he hopes the investigation will also examine the preparation process for Quarter Pounders to see if there is any potential for cross contamination between slivered onions and other ingredients.', '“When you prepare the burger at McDonald’s, at which point are the slivered onions added? Do they have a bowl of slivered onions, someone puts their hands in it and then touches the tomatoes?” Jaenisch said. “I would look very closely at that point of preparation.”', 'McDonald’s has already pulled Quarter Pounders from restaurants in the affected areas. Roughly a fifth of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants are not selling Quarter Pounder burgers at this time. The company has also instructed restaurants in the area to remove slivered onions from their supply, and has paused the distribution of that ingredient in the region.', 'Based on past foodborne illness outbreaks at other restaurant chains, it’s not a given that McDonald’s sales and brand image will suffer.', 'For example, rival Wendy’s\ndealt with its own link to an E. coli outbreak two years ago. More than 100 people got sick across six states. Still, the incident didn’t have a long-term effect on the chain’s sales.', '“They got past it, and you never really heard about it,” KeyBanc analyst Eric Gonzalez told CNBC. “I think there were some operators in the area that probably saw a mid-to-high single digit, maybe 10% decline for a couple days of a week or so, and then it reverted as the news cycle moved on.”', 'On the other side of the spectrum is Jack in the Box\n, which became the poster child for food safety issues decades ago.', 'An outbreak in 1992 and 1993 linked to the chain resulted in the deaths of four children and infected more than 700 people. Media coverage, coupled with the severity of the outbreak, led to a steep decline in sales that year, fueled three straight years of losses and tarnished Jack in the Box’s reputation for years.', 'And then there’s Chipotle\n, a more recent example of a chain that struggled for years to improve its food safety and turn around its image after a string of foodborne illnesses.', '“It was sort of a victim of its own inexperience, in a way, where not only were there multiple illnesses — E. coli, salmonella, norovirus — but you didn’t really have the expertise and experience level to manage through the crisis,” Gonzalez said.', 'After the initial wave of outbreaks in 2015, it took Chipotle several more years and a new CEO to rebuild trust in its burritos and bowls.', 'While investors fear the outbreak will hit McDonald’s sales, it’s unlikely that the burger giant turns into another Chipotle or Jack in the Box.', '“We don’t know where this is going to land, as far as McDonald’s is concerned, but you have to have a little bit of confidence in their ability to contain the outbreak,” Gonzalez said. “It’s a very sophisticated organization with a sophisticated supply chain, and I don’t doubt their capabilities.”', 'McDonald’s has already been taking steps to reassure customers about the safety of its food. Barring a much more serious crisis, it may be able to contain the damage to its brand, experts said.', 'Shortly after the CDC issued its notice, the company released a statement outlining the steps it’s taken to contain the outbreak, along with a video featuring McDonald’s USA President Joe Erlinger.', 'The following morning, Erlinger appeared on NBC’s “TODAY,” telling viewers — and potential customers — that its food and drinks were safe to consume.', '“Any kind of product safety recall requires some crisis communication and reassurance on the part of the corporation that it takes safety seriously, that it takes consumer health seriously and that it will react appropriately,” said Jo-Ellen Pozner, associate professor at the Santa Clara University Leavey School of Business.', 'She added that she thinks McDonald’s needs to apologize “very publicly” and aim its messaging at both consumers and its shareholders. However, that transparency means more media coverage, which reminds consumers about the crisis and risks scaring them away from McDonald’s restaurants.', 'Yang said McDonald’s appears to be “doing what they can do so far” while waiting for more information on the specific source of contamination. ', 'But other experts hope the chain does more to mitigate the potential spread of the outbreak during the investigation.', 'Dr. Darin Detwiler, professor of food policy and corporate social responsibility at Northeastern University, said he believes locations in other unaffected states should be “doubling up on their sanitation procedures and protocols and do more testing of their ingredients.” ', '“Don’t wait until the lawyers or inspectors say you have a problem,” Detwiler said. ', '“Why don’t you make the assumption that there could be something in your state, and check out your product,” he said. “That is being proactive. That is corporate social responsibility.”', 'Bill Marler, an attorney who specializes in cases involving foodborne illnesses, said McDonald’s should also follow in the footsteps of Jack in the Box, which offered to pay medical bills and lost wages for the victims of its E. coli outbreak.', '“They just need to be seen as a good corporate player, and that’s really how they’re going to be able to bounce back pretty quickly,” Marler said.', 'One potential plaintiff tied to the crisis has already reached out to Marler, who represented hundreds of people who sued Jack in the Box in a class-action lawsuit, leading to a settlement of more than $50 million.', 'McDonald’s is already facing at least two lawsuits tied to the outbreak.', 'Both Clarissa DeBock, of Nebraska, and Eric Stelly, a resident of Greeley, Colorado, are suing the company for damages in excess of $50,000 after allegedly testing positive for E. coli after eating at McDonald’s, according to court filings.', '“McDonald’s has nowhere to hide. They’re strictly liable for producing food that was contaminated. They may be able to point the finger at the onion supplier or the meat supplier, but ultimately they made the hamburger,” said Marler.', 'McDonald’s declined to comment on the lawsuits.', 'While media coverage of related lawsuits could bring more attention to McDonald’s, the suits themselves are unlikely to threaten the chain’s existence, according to Pozner.', '“McDonald’s is as ubiquitous as Coke. It’s one of these very taken-for-granted brands, for its value as a brand to be diminished in a significant way, would require a much more serious outcome of the E. coli outbreak,” she said. “The scope of this tragedy is still very contained.”', 'The outbreak comes as McDonald’s tries to win back diners who balked at years of price increases. For months, McDonald’s has been locked in a war with its rivals over competing value meals.', 'The restaurant industry broadly has seen traffic fall as inflation-weary consumers cook more at home and visit eateries less frequently. Fast-food chains, including McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s, have turned to discounts and value meals to win back customers.', 'McDonald’s U.S. restaurants have been offering a $5 value meal since late June. And earlier this month, the chain launched its Chicken Big Mac nationwide, betting that customers would be willing to pay its higher price point because of the novelty. Those moves seemed to be paying off for McDonald’s before the outbreak.', '“This is somewhat of a momentum killer for them,” Gonzalez said, adding that the burger category has plenty of “capable substitutes” for McDonald’s.', 'Combined, McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s control roughly 70% of the burger quick-service restaurant segment, according to Barclays. McDonald’s alone holds 48.8% market share.', '“It’s not a zero-sum game, but the burger category specifically is one of the more concentrated segments,” Gonzalez said. “If McDonald’s loses a point of sales, that’s 3 to 4 points up for grabs for Wendy’s or Burger King to capture.”', 'Got a confidential news tip?

On Tuesday, the CDC reported 49 cases and one death linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders tainted with E. coli.

Listeria, in particular,  has been a problem of late: Earlier in October, more than 11 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products were recalled. And an especially bad Listeria outbreak involving Boar’s Head deli-meat products has led to 59 hospitalizations across 10 states and 10 deaths.', '', 'Many of this year’s outbreaks have occurred in foods that are pre-prepared—those that can be eaten as-is, without further cooking. Foods such as Quarter Pounders and waffles, yes, but also cold cuts, prepackaged salads, and jarred salsa are popular because they are convenient. That convenience comes at a cost. A rule of thumb in food safety is that “the more a food is handled prior to consumption, the higher the chances it can be contaminated,” Lawrence Goodridge, the director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety, told me.

UCHealth Today,https://www.uchealth.org/today/how-to-stay-safe-from-deadly-e-coli-outbreak-linked-to-tainted-onions-at-mcdonalds/,"['', '', 'The state of Colorado made news in the wrong way recently with news of an E. coli infection outbreak initially linked to McDonalds Quarter-pounder hamburgers. Ten of the 26 cases reported in Colorado as of Tuesday, October 22, occurred in Mesa County on Colorado’s Western Slope, with one person there dying after being infected.', 'Public health experts have now traced the E. Coli outbreak to tainted yellow onions on the burgers, and cases have spread to at least 13 states, from Michigan to Washington. By Thursday, October 24, the number of cases had nearly tripled, to 75, with 20 hospitalizations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More cases are expected.', 'The outbreak illustrates the importance of surveillance of food-borne illnesses by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and their counterparts in other states, said Dr. Michelle Barron, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Colorado School of Medicine on the Anschutz Medical Campus.', '“I have high regard for them,” said Barron. “This case shows you the work they do. They were able to detect the outbreak and actually figure out where it is.”', 'We spoke to Barron to understand more about the E. coli bacteria, the detective work required to identify and mitigate an infection outbreak and to answer your top questions about food-borne illnesses.', 'It is Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria that dwells in our intestines. “We actually all have it, and so do animals,” Barron told Denver 7 News in an interview October 23. In healthy individuals, E. coli generally coexists peacefully in the thicket of organisms in the gut. Problems can occur, however, if a person ingests food or drinking water that is contaminated with specific strains of the bacteria, Barron said.', 'There are six strains of E. coli that cause illness, according to CDC experts.', 'Yes. It is O157:H7, which produces a toxin called Shiga, Barron said. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, “causes you to become acutely ill,” she said.', 'As with infection from other E. coli strains, people have severe diarrhea and dehydration, Barron said. However, the Shiga toxin increases the risk of bloody diarrhea and fever. In rare cases, the infection can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can cause blood pressure to plunge and lead to kidney failure and sepsis, she added.', '“This strain of E. coli can make you much sicker and has the potential to put you in the hospital because of HUS,” Barron said. She noted that the same strain infected hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants in Washington State in 1993, sickening hundreds and killing four children.', '“We try to get people to understand that if you are not getting better, and you still have fever and blood in your stool, you probably need to get checked,” Barron said. The longer the symptoms persist, the greater the risk of hospitalization or even death, she added.', 'It begins when an individual visits their medical provider and receives a stool test that confirms an infection, Barron said. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli is on a list of organisms that requires reporting to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), which has a section that works on tracking food-borne illnesses. In turn, CDPHE is part of a nationwide CDC network of public health agencies that track bacteria that cause illness, including E. Coli, salmonella, hepatitis A, Listeria and others', 'Individuals who have been infected provide demographic information and answer questions that help public health professionals probe where the infection may have originated, such as a wedding, a coffee shop, or with food purchased at a grocery store, Barron said. All of the information goes into the CDC’s national database. The details allow the painstaking work that isolates the cause of the infection.', 'In the McDonald’s case, the common thread – unraveled after more than three weeks – turned out to be Quarter pounders, but investigators still had to figure out what was unique about that particular burger that people consumed, Barron said. Was E. coli-containing ground beef undercooked? That possibility is still under consideration, but the likely culprit turned out to be fresh slivered onions layered on the Quarter Pounders – and only Quarter Pounders.', 'That conclusion, of course, led to the question of who supplied the onions. McDonald’s identified California-based Taylor Farms as the supplier. The CDC reported on October 25 that Taylor Farms began recalling yellow onions and contacting stores to remove their products. Thus, the hard work paid off by preventing further disease spread.', 'Barron noted that the first case of an E. coli infection was reported September 27, but at that point the cause was a mystery. “People will say, ‘How did you not know?’ I think it’s hard for people to see the work that goes into this, because all they see is the end point,” Barron said.', 'Yes. Between Tuesday, the 22nd and Thursday, the 24th, the number rose from 49 to 75.', '“It can take three to four days after your exposure to develop symptoms,” Barron said. “Now that there is more awareness (of the outbreak), there are probably more people who will get tested.”', 'Others who have symptoms may not get tested, making it impossible to know the true number who were infected, she added.', 'No, there’s no treatment for E. coli. In serious cases, however, providers can deliver IV fluids to treat dehydration and prevent kidney failure caused by toxins building up and triggering a massive immune response, Barron explained.', 'In addition, the CDC cautions that people infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli should not take medications for diarrhea because they increase the risk of HUS.', '“If you suspect you have an infection with E. coli O157 based on symptoms of bloody diarrhea and fever, you should avoid taking antidiarrheal medications and just focus on drinking enough fluids,” Barron said. “Taking an anti-diarrheal medication increases your risk of developing kidney damage and other complications.”', 'Older adults, very young children and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk, Barron said. “If you are relatively healthy and don’t have any other issues, you may feel sick, but it’s unlikely to cause you any [severe] problems.”', 'The CDC adds international travelers as a group are vulnerable to infection because of unsanitary food or drinking water they may encounter in countries they visit.', 'Yes, particularly in high-contact professions, like food-handling, Barron said. “But within your own household, certainly there is also risk,” she added. “The most likely way you are going to transmit infection within your household or to others – outside of having a contaminated product – is by not following good hygiene practices.”', 'People can mitigate the risk by doing basic things like washing their hands, separating raw meats and vegetables during cooking, and avoiding touching food when they are feeling ill, Barron said. It is also important to wash and/or cook raw fruits and vegetables, as they are historically the main source of food-borne illnesses, she said.', '“We want people to eat healthy, but it’s sadly ironic that it’s usually produce that gets us into trouble,” Barron said.', 'Get the most popular stories delivered to your inbox monthly', '', ' ', 'Metro Denver', '720.848.0000', 'Northern Colorado', '970.495.7000', 'Southern Colorado', '719.365.5000', 'Para información en español llame al', '844.945.2500', 'Download the UCHealth App', '']"

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) is still investigating the hamburger patties used in the Quarter Pounders to rule out the meat as the source of the outbreak.', ""Taylor Farms Suspected—and Then Confirmed—to be McDonald's Onion Supplier"", 'At the same time, national food wholesaler U.S. Foods has issued a recall of yellow onions in various forms due to potential E. coli contamination. The recalled onions were sourced from a Taylor Farms facility in Colorado, a third-party supplier to U.S. Foods. The recall of Taylor Farms onions impacts six U.S. Foods distribution centers in the region affected by the McDonald’s outbreak.', 'The recall did not mention being a supplier to McDonald’s, and according to Good Morning America, U.S. Foods said in a statement to ABC News that it is not a McDonald’s supplier. However, McDonald’s officials also said to ABC News that Taylor Farms is the supplier of slivered onions used in its restaurant locations implicated in the outbreak, but the company is unsure whether the Taylor Farms onions were provided to McDonald’s directly or through an intermediary.', ""FDA has confirmed that Taylor Farms is the supplier of the slivered onions to the affected McDonald's locations, but at the same time, it is important to recognize that the agency has still not definitively confirmed that the onions used on the Quarter Pounders are the vehicle of illness in the outbreak. The beef patties used on the Quarter Pounders are still being considered by USDA-FSIS as a suspect vehicle of illness."", 'Taylor Farms has issued a voluntary recall.', 'National Restaurant Chains Pull Onions Out of Abundance of Caution', ""The McDonald’s outbreak and supplier speculation has still come with rippling effects across industry. For example, Yum! Brands Inc.—the parent company of several global restaurant chains—has pulled fresh onions from select Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC locations, out of an “abundance of caution,” it said in a statement to multiple news outlets. Moreover, Burger King revealed that approximately 5 percent of its restaurants source their onions from a Taylor Farms Colorado facility, and that it has proactively asked the affected locations to dispose of the onions. McDonald's itself has temporarily stopped using slivered onions in the states that receive slivered onions from the suspected supplier."", 'Experts Stress the Importance of Traceability Amid Recall', ""Food safety experts are stressing that the McDonald's outbreak and the time sensitivity of confirming an implicated ingredient and supplier is a reminder of the importance of solid traceability and adherence to national standards. In a statement to Food Safety Magazine, the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) said, “Situations like this one are a good reminder about the importance of states adopting the FDA Food Code to protect communities across state lines... This particular outbreak also underscores the importance of the new FDA Food Traceability Final Rule [also known as FSMA 204], which will require recordkeeping beyond existing regulations to be able to rapidly trace and remove potentially contaminated food from the market.”"", ""Update, October 25, 2024: The article has been edited to reflect the most recent information from FDA, including confirmation of Taylor Farms as McDonald's slivered onions supplier and an updated number of illnesses involved in the foodborne illness outbreak."", '', ' ', '', '', 'Live: October 29, 2024 at 10:00 am EDT: By attending this webinar, participants will understand the importance of assessing food safety culture in driving continuous improvement.', 'Live: December 12, 2024 at 2:00 pm EST: From this webinar, attendees will be able to identify the different requirements for ready-to-eat and not-ready-to-eat products.', 'Copyright ©2024.

Of that 75, 22 people have been hospitalized and two developed hemolytic uremic syndrome — a condition that can cause kidney failure. One death, not connected to hemolytic uremic syndrome, has occurred in Colorado."", '""Most sick people are reporting eating Quarter Pounder hamburgers from McDonald’s, and investigators are working quickly to confirm which food ingredient is contaminated,"" the CDC alert says. The agency notes that an early review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that slivered onions served on the burgers are a ""likely source of contamination,"" while ground beef patties are also being investigated.', 'This has prompted a recall from the onion supplier, Taylor Farms, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" though the company tells CBS News that its own tests showed no traces of E. coli in the onions. Other fast food chains, including Burger King, have also stopped serving fresh onions, Reuters reports.', ""But McDonald's is not the only place where foodborne illness has been a concern in recent weeks."", 'On Oct. 18, the FDA announced that TreeHouse Foods was voluntarily recalling frozen waffle products due to potential listeria contamination.', 'In early October, BrucePac recalled 10 million pounds of meat due to listeria concerns. Products were supplied to stores like Target, Aldi and Publix.', 'On Oct. 11, Costco also issued a meat recall linked to listeria concerns, this time impacting products like frozen chicken pasta.', 'Costco issued a notice on Oct. 22 that it was voluntarily recalling packages of its Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon due to potential listeria contamination.', ""Foodborne illnesses are shockingly common in the United States. The CDC says that about 48 million people get sick from foodborne diseases every year. Here's a guide to these illnesses, from symptoms to treatment."", 'What it is: A bacteria that lives in the intestines of people and animals, and is known as Escherichia coli, or E. coli. Though it is harmless while in the gut, ingesting certain types of E. coli — such as E. coli O157:H7 — can cause severe gastrointestinal issues, according to the Mayo Clinic. One way E. coli is spread is when feces contaminate food and water. Since animals can potentially carry pathogenic E. coli, touching animals, such as at a petting zoo, can potentially put you at risk.', 'What the symptoms are: Stomach issues include severe cramping, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Fever is also common. In extreme cases, E. coli may lead to a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), or the development of high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and neurologic problems, according to the FDA.', '“If people develop bloody diarrhea or have a decline in urine output or are pale, they should seek medical attention,” says Shaw.', ""What experts need you to know: Consuming ground beef can potentially put you at a greater risk of E. coli exposure. “If you cook your steak, and you cook the outside, you’re usually safe from it,” says Parsonnet. “But if you make hamburgers, you’re taking the outside of the meat that’s been contaminated, and you're mixing it in the middle.” (The USDA recommends cooking ground beef to a safe minimum internal temperature of 160°F to destroy harmful bacteria.)"", 'But it’s not just ground beef that’s linked to outbreaks. “A few years ago, there was an E. coli outbreak in apple juice because it was probably contaminated by feces,” says Parsonnet. Anything that’s contaminated with animal feces, such as produce grown in fields, has the potential to expose you to E. coli, she says.', 'What it is: A disease-causing bacteria called listeria monocytogenes. It can survive and grow under refrigeration. The disease people develop after eating food contaminated with this bacteria is called listeriosis.', 'What the symptoms are: Mild symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, while symptoms for the more severe form of listeriosis include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).', 'What experts need you to know: “Listeria has the unfortunate property to grow under refrigeration temperatures, which is uncommon for foodborne illness,” Dr. Albert Shaw tells Yahoo Life. Shaw is an infectious diseases specialist and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Shaw added: “It can contaminate any food really, but we see outbreaks in raw fruits and vegetables, as well as improperly heated hot dogs and things like deli meats. Unpasteurized milk or soft cheeses, especially Brie and queso that are made with potentially unpasteurized ingredients, have been associated with outbreaks in the past.”', 'While listeriosis symptoms can typically be treated at home, Dr. Julie Parsonnet notes that the disease can be serious in certain individuals. Parsonnet is a professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine. “Pregnant women are at risk because the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and the placenta, and there’s a high risk of fetal loss due to the infection,” she tells Yahoo Life. “The elderly can also get listeria in their blood and their brain, causing meningitis. It’s not a common cause of disease, but among the foodborne illnesses, listeria is one of the more common causes of death.”', 'What it is: A group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness. It’s typically associated with meat and poultry as well as undercooked eggs, but dairy products, fruits and leafy greens can also be contaminated.', 'What the symptoms are: Gastrointestinal illness, which includes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. More severe illnesses associated with salmonella include high fever, lethargy, a rash and blood in the urine or stool, according to the FDA.', 'What experts need you to know: In the U.S., poultry and eggs — as seen with this recent outbreak and recall — are the most common sources of salmonella, says Parsonnet. You can typically avoid the bacteria by cooking your food. It’s also important to avoid cross contamination while preparing food, making sure that raw ingredients don’t touch anything you will be consuming.', 'Shaw says that for those with a normal immune system, salmonella typically runs its course in two to three days. Though most people recover at home, Parsonnet says it’s possible to see “severe illness in people who are immunocompromised or have sickle cell anemia.”', 'What it is: A highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. Exposure typically happens when people come into close contact with an infected person, as well as through eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the virus.', 'What the symptoms are: Lethargy, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, joint pain and dark-colored urine are all common symptoms. Clay- or gray-colored stool, as well as intense itching and jaundiced skin, are signs that can distinguish a hepatitis A infection from other foodborne illnesses.', 'What experts need you to know: Hepatitis A is rare in the U.S., thanks to vaccinations, notes Parsonnet. Adults who get hepatitis A typically recover within one to two weeks, but it’s possible for the disease to become chronic, which can lead to liver failure and death.', 'Shaw says that hepatitis A “is usually foodborne, either from contamination in the fields or with a food handler who is preparing food without sufficient precautions. Transmission can come from someone going to the bathroom and not washing their hands sufficiently and then preparing food.”', 'Recent hepatitis A outbreaks have been linked to strawberries, as well as raw scallops, frozen tuna and conventional blackberries.', 'What it is: A highly contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea.', 'What the symptoms are: Norovirus causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. “It usually resolves within two to three days,” says Shaw. These symptoms typically last one to three days, according to the Mayo Clinic.', 'What experts need you to know: Typically, people become infected after coming into contact with the virus by consuming food or drink contaminated by another person with the virus, or by coming into contact with a surface or object with the virus and then touching their mouth.', 'According to the CDC, norovirus is responsible for about 50% of all outbreaks of food-related illness, most of which happen in food-service settings such as restaurants.', ""“This is the virus that's associated with outbreaks on cruise ships,” Shaw points out. “It is highly contagious because the dose that you need to become infected is really low.”"", 'Parsonnet agrees, adding: “If you have it, you can easily give it to your family and to other people in the household” through being in close contact, such as sharing food or eating utensils. Most people recover without treatment, but symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting can cause severe dehydration.', 'The treatment for mild foodborne illness is typically rest and drinking plenty of fluids in order to avoid dehydration. In rare and severe cases, listeria and salmonella may be treated with antibiotics.', 'It’s also important to keep an eye on your symptoms, notes Parsonnet. A fever greater than 102°F, bloody diarrhea or diarrhea with mucus, bad abdominal cramps, weakness or confusion, and symptoms that don’t improve within 48 hours warrant reaching out to a health care provider.', 'This article was originally published on June 15, 2023, and has been updated.']"
