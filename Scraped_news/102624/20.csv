Striking workers’ pension demand reflects longing for a bygone era,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/25/pensions-boeing/,"['Boeing machinists want a return to traditional retirement plans, but defined-benefit pensions are rare in the private sector these days.', 'When 64 percent of Boeing machinists voted to continue their strike this week, many of them had in mind a goal rarely seen this century: the return of a traditional defined-benefit pension.', 'That retirement option was already rare in the private sector when Boeing ended its pension plan for the machinists a decade ago. These days at U.S. companies, worker-driven savings accounts like 401(k)s have mostly replaced pension plans that provide fixed monthly payments to retirees.', '“For defined-benefit pensions to become an issue, both in the autoworkers’ strike and in Boeing’s, it shows there is something in the air, that people long for these old-fashioned pension plans. And I find it surprising,” said Alicia Munnell, the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, who pointed out that the autoworkers eventually ended their strike without resuming a pension plan.', 'Congress created 401(k)s in 1978, allowing companies to contribute a set amount to employees’ individual accounts each month and let the workers invest the money as they choose. Since then, those and other defined-contribution plans have become much more common than defined-benefit plans in the private sector, although state and local government jobs are more likely to offer traditional pensions.', 'Follow Personal finance', 'The heyday of pensions began in the 1950s, when unions were at the peak of their power and employers enticed workers in the booming postwar economy to stick with a company job. By the ’60s and continuing into the ’80s, more than 40 percent of private-sector workers had a pension.', 'The 401(k) was first introduced as a way to offer more workers access to some sort of retirement plan. In 1990, 43 percent of private-sector workers still had a pension, down just three points from a decade earlier — and an additional 12.5 percent had a defined-contribution account such as a 401(k), but no pension.', 'Traditional pensions disappeared as regulations on them tightened — and as employers realized that ending those programs would take unpredictable costs off their books. By 2006, pensions had collapsed: Just 20 percent of private-sector workers had one. Today, the number stands at 15 percent, the same level of a century ago.', 'Proponents of defined-contribution programs say they have advantages over pensions for workers, not just employers.', 'Plans such as 401(k)s and IRAs give workers more control over their retirement investments. And a defined monthly benefit becomes less valuable in real terms in a period of high inflation, Munnell noted.', '“When you have a defined-benefit plan, you just sit there and you’ve got your $100 a month, and that number does not change,” she said. “But what you can buy with that $100 a month does change.”', 'Moreover, pensions favor workers spending their whole careers at one company. In today’s economy, workers might change jobs numerous times, often improving their salaries along the way; the decline in pensions was one cause of that shift.', '“When you look at young graduates from colleges these days, the data I’ve seen suggests they’ll change their jobs 10 or 11 times over the course of a lifetime,” said Michael Graetz, an emeritus law professor at Columbia University. “That’s not the way it was in the 1950s. … One of the selling points of a defined-contribution plan was you got to take it with you. With a defined-benefit plan, you might lose your benefit.”', 'But many experts say the change to 401(k) plans left millions of people facing more precarious retirements and worsened racial gaps in financial stability.', 'The distribution of defined-contribution accounts generally reflects inequality in the United States. Rich people are far more likely to have the accounts than poor people. White people are more than twice as likely to have one than Hispanic people and substantially more likely to have one than Black people. People with more education have the accounts more often.', 'Pensions, on the other hand, are much more evenly distributed, and the shift away from them has helped accelerate U.S. inequality. In 2013, almost 75 percent of Hispanic families, 60 percent of Black families and 35 percent of White families had no retirement savings, the Economic Policy Institute found.', 'And many people who do have retirement accounts have been unlucky or unsavvy investors.', 'A 2010 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research that examined 1 million retirement accounts found that workers made poor investment choices that reduced their potential savings by one-fifth. A 2016 University of California at Berkeley study involving the state’s public school teachers concluded that 6 out of 7 would have substantially less money in retirement if they had a 401(k) instead of a pension.', 'One rare large U.S. company that recently returned to a defined-benefit program was IBM, which did it largely for accounting purposes that would not apply to most large corporations. Experts are closely watching to see whether Boeing will consider bringing back its pension, but Graetz sees the aerospace giant as an outlier, with a strong union and few competitors that employ workers with the same specialized skills as airplane machinists.', '“If the Boeing workers were to succeed in getting a defined-benefit pension, I certainly wouldn’t take that as a signal that defined-benefit pensions are on their way back,” he said.', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Boeing CEO says the company must fundamentally change as losses surge,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/investing/boeing-losses/index.html,"['Markets', '', 'Fear & Greed Index', 'Latest Market News', '', '', 'Boeing reported huge quarterly losses Wednesday, as new CEO Kelly Ortberg conceded “it will take time to return Boeing to its former legacy.”', '“Going forward, we will be focused on fundamentally changing the culture, stabilizing the business, and improving program execution,” Ortberg said in the company’s quarterly statement. He took over control of the embattled aircraft maker in August, a month before the start of a strike by 33,000 members of the International Association of Machinists.', '“We’re clearly at a crossroads,” he said later in a call with investors. “The trust in our company is eroded. We’re saddled with too much debt. We’ve had serious lapses in our performance across the company, which has disappointed many of our customers.”', '“There’s no silver bullet,” Ortberg said in a separate interview with CNBC. “This isn’t going to be fixed in one fell swoop. There’s a lot of issues here that we’re dealing with… We really need to embark on a culture change that is something more than just a poster on the wall, that’s a guide to how the company behaves day in and day out.”', 'The company’s net loss surged to $6.2 billion from $1.6 billion a year earlier, with a $4 billion operating loss coming from its commercial airplane unit. That is the Boeing unit that has been the most troubled, but the strike affected only the last two weeks of the three-month period.', 'Boeing reported a $2.4 billion operating loss in its space and defense business, which is not affected by the strike.', 'The losses, thus, are not just from the strike. They include a $3 billion pre-tax charge for further delays in its next-generation commercial jet, the 777X, which has encountered problems during test flights and has further pushed back plans for its first delivery to customers to 2026 — along with plans to discontinue the 767 freighter jets.', '', 'RELATED VIDEO\nSpaceX capsule to bring home Boeing Starliner astronauts', 'Boeing is also taking a $2 billion pre-tax charge for problems with several defense and space programs, including its Starliner spacecraft, which had its first crewed flight in June. Starliner developed problems and had to return from the International Space Station without crew members, stranding two NASA astronauts on the ISS for months longer than expected. They will instead return to earth on a spacecraft from rival SpaceX. The charge for the Starliner program was not broken out by Boeing but it appears to be hundreds of millions of dollars.', 'Boeing had already warned investors of much of the bad news it would be reporting. And it warned Wednesday there will be more trouble ahead, with expectations for a negative cash flow throughout 2025, meaning it will spend more money on operations throughout the year than it will receive as revenue. That’s even with the assumption that strike ends soon.', '“First and foremost on everybody’s mind today is ending the IAM strike,” Ortberg told investors. “We have been feverishly working to find a solution that works for the company and meets employees’ needs.”', 'But even if the strike ends this week, it will take some time to get operations back to where they were before work stoppage began, Ortberg warned. He wouldn’t give a time frame for how long it will be before Boeing is once again building 38 of the 737 Max jets a month as it was before the strike.', '“It’s much harder to turn this on than it is to turn it off,” he said. “It is so much more important that we do this right than fast. I’m anticipating we’ll have a bumpy return.”', 'Shares of Boeing (BA), which were already down 39% so far this year ahead of the report, fell more than 3% after its comments to investors.', 'Although the problems in the company did not start with the strike that began on September 13, it brought virtually all of Boeing’s commercial airplane production to a halt. Standard & Poor’s, which is on the verge of downgrading Boeing’s credit rating to junk bond status for the first time in the company’s history, estimates that the strike is costing Boeing an additional $1 billion a month, on top of its existing rate of losses.', 'The good news for Boeing is that it is possible an end of the strike could be at hand. Rank-and-file members of the IAM are voting Wednesday as to whether to accept the latest offer from the company. If they accept it, they could return to work Friday.', 'If the offer is accepted, it could raise Boeing’s labor costs by more than $1 billion, according to analysis from Seth Seifman, aerospace analyst at JPMorgan Chase. Boeing has already announced plans to cut its global workforce of 171,000 employees by about 10%, or 17,000 jobs. The cost savings from those cuts could more than offset the increased cost of the wage package, Seifman said.', 'The offer would increase wages by 35 percentage points over the four-year life of the contract, with an immediate 12% raise, along with increased contributions to union members’ retirement accounts.', 'But Boeing did not restore the traditional pension plan that the company insisted members give up 10 years ago, a move that sparked widespread anger at company management among union members, and ratification is far from certain. A previous tentative agreement that was recommended by union leadership was almost unanimously rejected by rank-and-file members, sparking the start of the strike.', '“We’ve worked really hard to find that overlap to find a deal that the employees can feel good about and the company can be successful going forward,” Ortberg said in his CNBC interview. “I’m very hopeful for the vote.”', 'Still, this was one of the worst quarters for Boeing during a period of nearly five years of massive financial and operational problems. It’s the largest loss since the end of 2020, when the company was dealing with the effect of the pandemic on its airline customers and taking a huge charge for delays in the plans for its next-generation jet, the 777X.', 'Ortberg has said he wants to “reset” relations with the IAM and has relocated the CEO’s office from its corporate headquarters near the Pentagon outside of Washington, DC, back to Washington state where most of its commercial jets are built — and where the union members are on strike. But he comes into a company that has been accused by whistleblowers and other critics of putting a desire for profitability ahead of the quality and the safety of its aircraft, leading to a string of problems and federal investigations.', 'The latest loss brings Boeing’s total core operating losses to $39.3 billion since early 2019, when the second fatal crash of its key passenger jet, the 737 Max, led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. Boeing has reported losses in virtually every quarter since then.', 'The company has covered those losses by taking on massive amounts of debt. Boeing’s long-term debt climbed to $53 billion by the end of September, up from $47 billion at the start of this year and far above the $10.7 billion it had on its books at the end of March 2019. It has announced plans to raise another $25 billion through borrowing from major banks and the sale of stock and debt on Wall Street.', 'The company was also hurt financially by the pandemic, which brought demand for flying to a near halt and caused massive losses across the global airline industry, Boeing’s customer base.', 'Airlines are generally reluctant to cancel orders for jets that they already placed, even in a downturn, because there are financial penalties for doing so. But the delays in deliveries caused by the grounding opened the door for airlines to cancel 737 Max orders without penalty, and that resulted in hundreds of orders being canceled.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nWhat Boeing’s massive financial crisis means for you', 'Then, in January, a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines’ 737 Max jet shortly after takeoff. Although no one was seriously injured, the incident sparked numerous federal investigations and questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets. One federal probe found that the plane had left a Boeing factory without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.', 'The Federal Aviation Administration ramped up its oversight of the company, a step that will slow Boeing’s ability to increase production of the Max to the levels that it would need to return to profitability.', 'Despite recent issues, Boeing remains a key component in the US economy. It is America’s largest exporter, with an estimated annual contribution of $79 billion to the economy, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly at 10,000 suppliers spread among all 50 states. Some of those suppliers have already been laying off workers due to the strike.', 'Fortunately for Boeing, it is not likely it will be forced out of business by its current financial crisis. Boeing’s place as part of a duopoly, along with European rival Airbus, essentially ensures its survival. Boeing and Airbus are the only companies that make the full-size jets the global airline industry needs, and both companies have massive backlogs in orders. Any airline that canceled its Boeing orders and shifted to Airbus would need to wait at least four or five years to receive any aircraft from the European giant.', 'This story has been updated with additional context and developments.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Why Boeing’s 35% Wage Hike Is A Game-Changer For U.S. Labor Markets,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimosman/2024/10/19/why-boeings-35-wage-hike-is-a-game-changer-for-us-labor-markets/,"['SEATTLE, WA - SEPTEMBER 13: Heather Barstow (L), Chris Schorr (C) and Paul Burton (R), members of ... [+]', ""Not only a forced business choice, but Boeing’s forthcoming 35% pay increase for its employees is an indication of a significant change sweeping the whole American labor market. Boeing's audacious action under pressure from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union (IAM) over the past few weeks emphasizes the growing strain pushing pay inflation across sectors in a scene molded by intense talent competition, chronic labor shortages, and rising expenses. As companies like Boeing drive these changes, it raises critical questions about the future of both businesses and their employees. The evolving dynamics between corporate strategy and workforce expectations deserve careful discussion, as each will shape the path forward for industries and their workers alike. More importantly though, how does this mirror the more general economic patterns determining our future?"", ""Boeing finds itself at a turning point. In the tight labor market of today, the company's pay rise to its workers may appear audacious and required, but it reflects the deeper difficulties Boeing is confronting with ones that go much beyond merely compensation for employees. What does this action mean for Boeing's future as well as the larger U.S. job market?"", 'Boeing’s problems are profound. Indeed, they have been fighting back from the 737 MAX catastrophe, a terrible blow to their reputation, but their problems are stacked with operational mistakes, financial uncertainty, and poor leadership. Boeing sorely needs a transforming leader, someone who can take on these challenges head-on and rebuild investor confidence. I’m not sure Kelly Ortberg is that person either. Right now, the company is lost; worker strikes, supply chains are broken, and now pay inflation is driving it even further into a perilous financial position.', 'PROMOTED', ""In every sector, wage rises are becoming necessary for survival. Boeing's 35% pay increase reflects larger patterns: businesses are paying more to keep people from doing so since they must. Wages in industry, technology, and even retail are rising to match inflation, the cost of living, and a vigorous struggle for qualified personnel. For Boeing, the stakes are bigger nonetheless. They are fighting to keep their market share among growing manufacturing costs and declining margins, not only for talent competition."", 'Right now, Boeing just needs strategic clarity. Although the labor expenses can be controlled, they cannot be done without a strong concentration on raising operational effectiveness. Investors want to know how Boeing intends to negotiate the long-term financial strain these pay raises create. Can Boeing manage labor expenses so that it generates profitability? Will the fresh leadership offer the correct vision and approach to reverse current trends? The important questions are these. Boeing runs the danger of being caught in survival mode without specific answers.', ""Boeing's 35% pay increase taken all at once is only one component of a much bigger picture. Although it is a reaction to a very competitive labor market, it does not address the fundamental problems afflicting the business. To steady its operations and rebuild its reputation, Boeing requires transformative leadership, improved financial discipline, and a clear direction to avoid the hunters."", ""Investing Digest: Know what's moving the financial markets and what smart money is buying with Forbes Investing Digest."", '', '', '', ""As companies fight for talent, wages are rising across sectors; Boeing's pay rise is a perfect illustration of this trend. Boeing's pay raise fits more general trends of wage inflation across sectors, including retail, healthcare, technology, and logistics, driven by labor shortages and increased competition for talented workers. In a tight post-pandemic labor market, businesses across industries are mostly relying on pay raises to attract and keep talent."", ""Companies in aerospace and manufacturing are paying more to keep specialist staff like engineers and machinists, but smaller businesses could find it difficult to match these rises. Similar difficulties arise for the tech sector; giants like Google and Microsoft pay top dollar for positions in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, therefore making startups less able to compete. Hospitals are giving nurses large pay increases and bonuses to draw them into the healthcare sector; smaller providers cannot keep up with these expenses, so they are focusing on retention through improved working conditions and wellness programs. Minimum wages set by retail and logistics giants like Amazon and Walmart have also put pressure on smaller businesses unable to afford such pay increases. UPS and FedEx have raised delivery drivers' pay similarly. In a tight post-pandemic labor market, businesses across industries are mostly relying on pay raises to attract and keep talent. In hospitality, meanwhile, hotels and restaurants are increasing pay following the epidemic; smaller businesses may rely on local relationships or flexible schedules to be competitive. Businesses across all stripes that cannot match pay rises have to adjust by emphasizing upskills, enhancing corporate culture, or providing special value to draw in and keep personnel."", 'Similar actions in many sectors have long-term effects on corporate profitability and strategy. Higher pay aids draw and keep talent, but businesses like Boeing must balance these higher labor costs with growing input costs from inflation; therefore, they must concentrate on increasing production and efficiency to keep profit margins. While some shareholders might see these pay increases as a required investment in long-term sustainability, margin compression raises questions. Businesses like Boeing must properly explain these choices to investors so they may be convinced that these approaches would help stability and future expansion.', 'Rising cost of living and inflation are driving businesses like Boeing to pay more than only to remain competitive—rather than to survive. Workers all throughout the United States are demanding more wages to make ends meet as daily products and services are increasing in cost. The pay raise by Boeing is a striking illustration of how businesses are being driven to change for this environment. Not only Boeing: companies in all sectors struggle with inflationary pressures while employees have more negotiating leverage than before. These developments are changing the whole economy; hence, pay increases are now a must for survival in the current market.', ""The pay raise by Boeing emphasizes a crucial lesson for business America: wage inflation is now a reality rather than a transient issue. Businesses must consider pay raises as long-term investments in the development and retention of their workforce. Executives should learn from key points: investing in upskilling programs, reconsidering pay plans to be competitive and getting ready for a day when higher salaries are necessary for luring and keeping top staff. Boeing's efforts provide a paradigm for how businesses might change to remain competitive and sustainable in this new pay environment."", 'The pay rise by Boeing has important ramifications for the general American labor market and economy. Although pay inflation could be expensive for businesses now, by increasing consumer spending power, it has the potential to enhance the economy. Higher pay helps employees to participate more in the economy, hence promoting development in several spheres.', ""The issue for companies is not whether to change but rather how fast they can respond when pay inflation becomes a long-term threat. Boeing's audacious pay hike announcement is unambiguous evidence that businesses must move forcefully to keep talent in this new economic environment. For business leaders, the true lesson is to aggressively rethink pay plans, make investments in staff development, and get ready for a time when competitive salaries are vital. The businesses that grow from Boeing's mistakes and act early to upskill staff, simplify processes, and welcome pay changes will be the ones who survive. How will your company negotiate the pay inflation terrain?"", 'For over 30 years, I’ve navigated the ups and downs of investing, using in-depth analysis and a keen understanding of market dynamics to uncover hidden...

This alone could enable Boeing to survive a strike even longer than the one in 2008 -- but Boeing is laying plans to ensure it can last even longer if needed.', 'Simultaneous with the credit agreement, Boeing laid out plans to raise a further $25 billion through sales of debt securities, common and preferred stock, and other securities.

', 'The shift in the private sector from pensions to 401(k)s has been going on for decades, but now there’s more pushback from workers and unions. ', 'Broadly speaking, defined-benefit, or pension plans, are funded by employers and pay retirement benefits for life. ', 'Defined-contribution, or 401(k) plans, are usually funded by the employer and employee, and the employee then manages the investments for as long as they last.', 'Pensions put financial pressure and risk on employers to fund and manage them. Because 401(k)s put that pressure mostly on workers, they’ve become more popular with employers. But now there’s pushback led by unions.', '“I am not surprised that the Boeing workers rejected the contract,” said Teresa Ghilarducci, who studies retirement at The New School.', 'She said workers increasingly understand the risk inherent in 401(k)s.', '“A 401(k) plan does not guarantee a stream of income for the rest of your life,” Ghilarducci said. “People are filled with stress having to manage their nest egg.”', 'But pensions have disadvantages too, said Alicia Munnell at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.', '“I am surprised with the enthusiasm for defined-benefit plans,” said Munnell, who recently posted an article on the subject, titled “Don’t Bring Back Traditional Private Sector Defined Benefit Plans.”', 'Munnell said in the private sector, pension benefits typically aren’t indexed to inflation, which has soared in recent years.', '“And the key loser was people who had defined-benefit plans that did not keep pace,” Munnell said.', 'Another ding against pensions is the fear the employer-sponsor will go belly up. Monique Morrissey at the Economic Policy Institute said that concern is overblown.', '“In the private sector, benefits are guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,” Morrissey said.', 'In the public sector, pension funds come from government coffers, and Morrissey said one way to balance the budget “is by not contributing the full amount to the pension.”', 'Many experts agreed that the biggest problem today is that (as documented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics), aside from Social Security, millions of workers don’t have any plan — 401(k) or pension — to help pay their bills in retirement.
