Between 1967 and 1990, Lesh appeared on all 13 of the Grateful Dead’s studio releases and 10 official live albums.

Death comes for all of us and today it took Phil Lesh. "", ""I know enough to know there's better opinions and more knowledgeable people to speak on the matter. But I also know enough to know how to pay timely respects to a legendary figure in American music history. This is the best I can do. "", ""The Grateful Dead need no introduction. From 1965-1995 they played more live music than anyone in history. And they did it with a sound so unique that it defies explanation. It's blues and bluegrass and folk and country and rock and jug band and just about everything in between. Even Mickey Hart is rapping now, which is actually insane to think about and another example that they're a little bit of everything. "", ""Mostly, they're irreplecable and I'm here to argue that's directly because of Phil Lesh."", 'To understand why, you have to first understand the roots of the band. ', ""They started in 1965. Jerry Garcia met Bill (the drummer) in the early 60's while buying a banjo from a music store Bill worked at. Bill offered Jerry a job to give guitar lessons. Shortly thereafter, a teenage Bob Weir walked in off the street on New Years Eve and got introduced to Jerry. Guitar lessons were exchanged and shortly thereafter, a band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions was born. It was an old jug-band-bluegrass-string amalgamation with Pigpen ripping the harmonica over Jerry and a collective of legends-at-inception: Robert Hunter, Bob Weir and David Nelson. But no Phil Lesh. Not yet at least."", ""The unique thing here is that it's all acoustic. "", ""The other unique thing is that the Grateful Dead RARELY went unplugged: 1970 at Harper College certainly comes to mind and again for the Dead Reckoning Tour in the mid 80's. But really it's a completely different sound than Mother McCrees in 1964. Remember that."", ""Then in 1965, Jerry Garcia wanted to go electric. I don't know the story on how the idea came about, but the general concept is that the band would only become more unique if mixed with modern advances in equipment like the electric guitar. So they went electric and changed their name to the Warlocks. "", ""But in the process, they needed to find electric equipment, which was expensive. So they brought along a below average bass player whose family owned the local music store. He let the band use the store's equipment for free which was a huge plus because nobody cared about the bass player."", ""The music's alright but Jerry really knows the bass player blows. They need a guy that can hold the sound while Jerry wanders around the guitar neck and has a nice trip without getting pissed off with the bridges and transitions. Maybe not the sexiest spot on stage, but the bass player is critical to where Jerry needs to go to make the music what it is. "", ""So they bring along a guy named Phil Lesh - a classically trained, musical genius with absolutely ZERO experience playing the bass. He's a composer dropout from UC Berkley and he loves doing drugs. It's a perfect fit for a group of misfit toys, and from here, everything changes. "", 'Phil Lesh made things weird. He made it unique. He got the band to break into 30 minute improvisations. He locked in with Bill Kreutzmann and later Mickey Hart in arguably the best bass/percussion partnership in Rock N Roll history. And as I type this out, a stark realization comes to the front of my mind. ', 'Jerry Garcia is arguably one of the best guitar players of all time. Certainly one of the most recognizable and absolutely one of the most unique. His image and status so far exceeded the rest of the band combined. ', ""But if you listen to Jerry Garcia solo work, or Jerry Garcia Band, or Jerry Garcia Accoustic Band, or New Riders of the Purple Sage or Legion of Mary or really any of his collaborations, you'll know they drastically miss something from the Grateful Dead. "", '', 'And comparatively, Jerry played with much better musicians than his bandmates in their time apart. But he always said there was no greater challenge or better feeling than performing live with the Grateful Dead. ', ""That's because of Phil Lesh. The powerful energy and thumping melodies and unbelievable ability to quite literally compose an entire bass line - not just one repetitive 8-bar basic piece of bullshit. I'm talking about a full blown piece of individual music like he was conducting the New York Philharmonic all on his 6-string bass."", ""What makes that significant is the Grateful Dead relied on simplicity in the structure. Example: Morning Dew is three chords. Example: I Know You Rider is three chords. Most of their core stuff is predicated on basic blues structure where it's really in the musician's talent to explore and differentiate. To play along with them can be as easy or as hard as you want. But I can assure you it's much easier than you think and that's the way they designed it. "", ""But listen close enough and you'll find a bass player wandering around songs almost chaotically, leading his own opus to Bill's beat. Somehow in that way he was both uniting the stage while pursuing his own individual sound. Like a baseball team playing their own positions with absolutely no control over whether the guy next to him does his own job. "", ""The Grateful Dead, in a sense, existed long before Phil Lesh showed up. Those guys had been playing together for years, trying to figure something out together, taking chances and doing drugs. A lot of people know a lot more than me, but I'm willing to say they didn't come together the right way until Phil showed up. Why and how is worth 10,000 words so I'll just settle on this. "", ""There's no Grateful Dead if there's no Phil Lesh. "", 'He will be missed. ', ""Please do yourself a favor and read some tributes from some smarter people. They're definitely out there."", ""For now here's the only song he sang for the band.* He wrote it for his dad while he was dying from cancer.

He took up the trumpet at 14, eventually earning the second chair in California’s Oakland Symphony Orchestra while still in his teens.', 'But he had largely put both instruments aside and was driving a mail truck and working as a sound engineer for a small radio station in 1965 when Garcia recruited him to play bass in a fledgling rock band called The Warlocks.', 'When Lesh told Garcia he didn’t play the bass, the musician asked, “Didn’t you used to play violin?” When he said yes Garcia told him, “There you go, man.”', 'Armed with a cheap four-string instrument his girlfriend bought him, Lesh sat down for a seven-hour lesson with Garcia, following the latter’s advice that he tune his instrument’s strings an octave lower than the four bottom strings on Garcia’s guitar. Then Garcia turned him loose, allowing him to develop the spontaneous style of playing that he would embrace for the rest of his life.', ""Lesh and Garcia would frequently exchange leads, often spontaneously, while the band as a whole would frequently break into long experimental, jazz-influenced jams during concerts. The result was that even well-known Grateful Dead songs like “Truckin'” or “Sugar Magnolia” rarely sounded the same two performances in a row, something that would inspire loyal fans to attend show after show."", '“It’s always fluid, we just pretty much figure it out on the fly,” Lesh said, chuckling, during a rare 2009 interview with The Associated Press. “You can’t set those things in stone in the rehearsal room.”\nPhillip Chapman Lesh was born on March 15, 1940, in Berkeley, the only child of Frank Lesh, an office equipment repairman, and his wife, Barbara.', 'He would say in later years that his love of music came from listening to broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic on his grandmother’s radio. One of his earliest memories was hearing the great German composer Bruno Walter lead that orchestra through Brahms’ First Symphony.', 'Musical influences he often cited were not rock musicians but composers like Bach and Edgard Varese, as well as jazz greats like John Coltrane and Miles Davis.', 'Lesh had gravitated from classical music to cool jazz by the time he arrived at the College of San Mateo, eventually becoming first trumpet player in the school’s big band and a composer of several orchestral pieces the group performed.', 'But he set the trumpet aside after college, concluding he didn’t have the lung power to become an elite player.', 'Soon after he took up the bass, The Warlocks renamed themselves the Grateful Dead and Lesh began captivating audiences with his dexterity. Crowds gathered in what came to be known as “The Phil Zone” directly in front of his position on stage.', 'Although he was never a prolific songwriter, Lesh also composed music for, and sometimes sang, some of the band’s most beloved songs. Among them were the upbeat country rocker “Pride of Cucamonga,” the jazz-influenced “Unbroken Chain” and the ethereally beautiful “Box of Rain.”', 'Lesh composed the latter on guitar as a gift for his dying father, and he recalled that Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, upon hearing the instrumental recording, approached him the next day with a lyric sheet. On that sheet, he said, were “some of the most moving and heartfelt lyrics I’ve ever had the good fortune to sing.”', 'The band often closed its concerts with the song.', 'After the group’s dissolution following Garcia’s 1995 death, Lesh often skipped joining the other surviving members when they got together to perform.', 'He did take part in a 2009 Grateful Dead tour and again in 2015 for a handful of “Fare Thee Well” concerts marking both the band’s 50th anniversary and what Lesh said would be the last time he would play with the others.', 'He did continue to play frequently, however, with a rotating cast of musicians he called Phil Lesh and Friends.', 'In later years he usually held those performances at “Terrapin Crossroads,” a restaurant and nightclub he opened near his Northern California home in 2012, which was named after the Grateful Dead song and album “Terrapin Station.”', 'Lesh is survived by his wife, Jill, and sons Brian and Grahame.', 'Coffee Break: Enjoy your coffee with our daily selection of advice columnists, TV picks, horoscopes, & more.', 'By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and to receive emails from The Mercury News.', '', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group', 'Trusted local news matters.']"

That changed last night (Oct. 25) when Phish opened their show in Albany, N.Y., with a first-time cover of the Dead’s “Box of Rain” in honor of its singer and composer, Phil Lesh, who died earlier in the day at the age of 84.', 'Anastasio played frequently with Lesh over the past three decades and saluted him in an Instagram post as “more than a revolutionary, groundbreaking bass player — he transformed how I thought about music as a teenager. I have countless memories of standing in awe, listening to his winding, eloquent bass lines blending seamlessly with Jerry and Bobby’s guitars, Brent Mydland’s keys and the thunderous drums of Billy and Mickey. I’m so grateful for those beautiful memories.”', ""Phish bassist Mike Gordon added memories of his own, recalling an initial meeting in 1999 when Anastasio and Phish keyboardist Page McConnell played with Lesh during a three-night run at the Warfield in San Francisco. “We didn’t know each other, but I asked him if he’d have lunch with me, and the restaurant even printed menus that said ‘Bass Player’s Luncheon,'” Gordon wrote on Instagram. “That week, and many times since, we had the chance to collaborate and philosophize together. Later in 1999, he joined Phish on stage at Shoreline [Amphitheatre], even jumping on trampolines, and I had the privilege of playing bass with him on ‘Box of Rain’ for his 60th birthday. These moments were life-changing.”"", 'He continued, “earlier this year, we met up before a show at the Capitol Theatre [in Port Chester, N.Y.], and I asked him if he had any regrets. He told me no, that everything had unfolded as the universe intended. He also mentioned that he sees the Grateful Dead’s music lasting for centuries. I believe Phil’s contribution to that legacy will endure, inspiring generations to come. We’ll remember him, and his influence will live on in all of us.”', 'Per Setlist.fm, Phish hadn’t performed a Dead cover since a 2016 show in Nashville, during which that group’s Bob Weir joined them “West L.A.

He played violin as a child before turning his attention to the trumpet, which he studied throughout high school and his time at the College of San Mateo. In the early ‘60s, he met banjo player Jerry Garcia, who later asked him to join his rock band, The Warlocks, as their bassist — an instrument Lesh did not play. He accepted nonetheless, and in 1965, The Grateful Dead was born, with Lesh finding his footing in the improvisation-driven group as he went.', '“On a day-to-day basis, the psychic pivot to the Dead is Phil Lesh, the most aggressive purist, the anti-philistine Artist,” wrote Grateful Dead biographer Dennis McNally in his 2002 book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead. “It is he who most often and most loudly demands that they dance as closely as possible to the edge of the nearest available precipice.

His broad interest in music and his unfamiliarity with the bass directly contributed to him becoming one of the most innovative players of his time.', 'While many bass players were trained to hold down a band’s rhythm section in conjunction with the drummer, Lesh immediately felt his instrument should play more of a leading role. His bass lines through the Dead’s 1965-1995 heyday are rife with lead riffs and buoyant counterpoint play.', ""In pushing the instrument's boundaries he joined fellow travelers Jack Bruce of Cream and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane and later Hot Tuna, two other musical explorers who redefined the formerly hidden-away instrument as a leading voice in their bands."", 'When it came to such sonic experimentation, drugs certainly came into play. The Grateful Dead was the house band at author Ken Kesey’s famous “Acid Tests,” and sometimes the music could get taken over by the psychedelics.

But the set-up was so cumbersome to put up and take down that it was ditched after only a few memorable months.', 'After Garcia’s death, Lesh and the other members of the Grateful Dead soon found they were eager to continue without their musical and spiritual leader.', 'That led to a variety of still-ongoing incarnations of the group, which increasingly featured fewer members of the so-dubbed core (remaining) four. After what was supposed to be the band’s true good-bye to fans, the short 2015 Fare Thee Well tour, Lesh increasingly decreased his time on the road and on a bandstsand.', 'He opened Terrapin Crossroads to be able to play anything close to home, and often did so with his sons, performing Grateful Dead as well as other contemporary fare. The venue closed in 2021, and after that Lesh’s appearances were episodic at best as he slipped into his 80s.', 'But the memory of what Lesh and his band created, from its legions of Deadheads to its countless live show bootlegs, clearly powered the bass player through even his darkest days.', '“The Grateful Dead group mind was in essence an engine of transformation,” he wrote at the conclusion of “Searching for the Sound.”', '“As such, it had no morality of its own, it made no judgments, took no positions. It merely opened valves for music to pour through.”']"

At some point, whether in early jams on “China Cat Sunflower” or “Dark Star” or “Fire on the Mountain” or many other songs over the three decades before died, Lesh never settled for the conventional walking bass lines heard on most rock or blues records. Instead, his instrument would poke around the melody, pushing, prodding, and nudging the music out of one section and into a new, uncharted one.

"Phil Lesh, founding member of the Grateful Dead, dies at 84",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/10/25/phil-lesh-grateful-dead-dies/,"['Phil Lesh, a founding member of the Grateful Dead whose expressive bass lines helped shape the band’s trippy “space” jams and who contributed to hits such as “Truckin’” and the wistful “Box of Rain,” died Oct. 25 at age 84.', 'The death was announced in a statement posted to his official Instagram page. No cause was noted.', 'Mr. Lesh, alongside bandmates Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia, were the front three of the Grateful Dead from the band’s rise in San Francisco’s 1960s music scene until Garcia’s death in 1995.', 'While Garcia’s roots were in bluegrass and American folk music, Mr. Lesh influenced the band with his explorations in experimental bass lines and avant-garde riffs. Mr. Lesh had a key role in developing one of the Grateful Dead’s signature concert experiences: the free-form “space” interludes that were part jam and part celebration of the band’s psychedelic early years playing at “acid test” house parties in the Bay Area.', 'Mr. Lesh was particularly interested in jazz and classical music, picking up the violin as a child and the trumpet in high school. He played as the first-chair trumpet in the big band at the College of San Mateo and later studied under Italian composer Luciano Berio.', 'He had never played the bass guitar when Garcia, in 1964, asked him to join the rhythm section of the Warlocks, which they would later rename the Grateful Dead. He learned to play the instrument on the job. His playing, he once said, was influenced more by Bach than by contemporary rockers.', 'He became a pioneer in electric bass playing, often positioning his instrument as a counterpart to Garcia’s lead guitar, rather than being relegated to timekeeping. That freedom also gave Mr. Lesh a greater musical interplay with rhythm guitarist Weir and the band’s side-by-side drummers, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann.', '“I don’t get bored with being in the Grateful Dead. To me, the Grateful Dead is life — the life of the spirit … [and] the mind,” he was quoted as saying in rock biographer Dennis McNally’s chronicle of the Grateful Dead, “A Long Strange Trip” (2001).', 'While Mr. Lesh did not carry the cult aura of Garcia or possess the frontman persona of Weir, he developed a following of fans who would gather on his corner of the stage to watch his fingers fly over his six-string bass and take photos of Mr. Lesh in his seemingly endless supply of tie-dyed T-shirts.', 'Mr. Lesh’s high tenor was part of the Grateful Dead’s three-part harmony in the early years of the band on songs such as “Ramble on Rose” and “U.S. Blues,” but he gradually moved away from singing after vocal cord troubles in the early 1970s. Years later, he returned to vocals but in a much lower register.', 'He also co-wrote some of the songs with the band’s most memorable instrumental jams, including “St. Stephen” and “Dark Star,” and helped craft others including “Truckin’,” about the band’s life on the road and run-ins with the law (“Set up, like a bowlin’ pin/ Knocked down/ It gets to wearin’ thin”), the jazzy “Unbroken Chain” and “Box of Rain,” which was inspired by Mr. Lesh’s bedside visits to his dying father as he battled cancer.', '“On a day-to-day basis, the psychic pivot to the Dead is Phil Lesh, the most aggressive purist, the anti-philistine Artist,” wrote McNally. “It is he who most often and most loudly demands that they dance as closely as possible to the edge of the nearest available precipice.”', 'After Garcia’s death, Mr. Lesh played in bands that carried on the Dead’s legacy, including the Other Ones and his group, Phil Lesh and Friends. He mostly retired from touring in 2014, but he continued to perform with the Lesh family band and was part of the Fare Thee Well Tour in 2015 with other former Grateful Dead bandmates.', '“It’s always fluid, we just pretty much figure it out on the fly,” Mr. Lesh told the Associated Press in 2009. “You can’t set those things in stone in the rehearsal room.”', 'Philip Chapman Lesh was born in Berkeley, California, on March 15, 1940. His parents co-owned an office equipment repair business.', 'He attended the University of California at Berkeley but left in his first year and soon met Garcia at a Bay Area party in 1959. Five years later, Garcia invited Mr. Lesh to join the Warlocks as its bassist, even though Mr. Lesh had never played the instrument.', 'The band, now called the Grateful Dead, started to perform at writer Ken Kesey’s LSD-fueled gatherings known as “acid tests.” Mr. Lesh later said that the events — and his own psychedelic experiences — deeply influenced his style of play to push his bass lines in more experimental directions.', '“When Phil’s happening, the band’s happening,” Garcia once said.', 'In 1998, Mr. Lesh underwent a liver transplant as a result of a chronic hepatitis C infection. He had prostate surgery in 2006 after a cancer diagnosis. He sometimes performed at Terrapin Crossroads, a restaurant and nightclub he opened near San Francisco in 2012, named after the Grateful Dead song and album “Terrapin Station.”', '“I would have to say that music and performing are as essential as food and drink to me, but even more so as I get older,” Mr. Lesh told the Marin Independent Journal in June. “While it can sometimes be more of a challenge physically than it was when I was a young whippersnapper, I’ve found that age brings wisdom, and with that comes musical experience and knowledge that I didn’t have when I was younger.”', 'Survivors include his wife, Jill; and sons Brian and Grahame.', 'Mr. Lesh said that discovering jazz groups like those of Miles Davis and John Coltrane introduced him to the idea that a song didn’t have to be a fixed, static piece of art but one that could evolve and change, even nightly, through collaboration.', '“I heard a performance of Trane’s Quintet in ’62, in San Francisco. It totally transformed my life and my view of music, because it just kept evolving. It just kept changing and evolving and yet you always were aware wherever you were coming from. It was the finest thing I’d ever heard,” he told Forbes in 2022.', '“I grew up in the classic music scene,” he continued, “so I hadn’t known how deeply improvised music could go and how powerful it could be and that really opened my eyes, my ears, my heart.”', 'Travis M.

Lesh, a bassist and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, died Friday at age 84. ', 'In 1995, at the age of 53, Jerry Garcia slipped into a diabetic coma and died. In December 1998, Grateful Dead bandmate 58-year-old Phil Lesh had a liver transplant. Phil, as he is commonly known, lived for another 26 years before passing Friday at his home in Marin, California.', 'When the Grateful Dead disbanded after Garcia’s death in 1995, member Bob Weir chose to anchor himself in bands. He immediately founded Rat Dog in 1995 and then played with Dead & Company from 2016 until the present (he also has a side project called The Wolf Brothers). ', 'But not Phil. Phil had enough of playing in “the” band. He wanted to play in dozens of bands. In the time since he received a second lease on life, he primarily served as the bandleader for his outfit, Phil Lesh and Friends. ', 'Wikipedia has 103 musicians listed as having played with Phil and Friends. It also says “this list is not complete.” If you consider all the musicians who Phil played with at his bar Terrapin Crossroads and those not included in Wikipedia, he played with hundreds of musicians in the last 25 years.', 'Cris Jacobs played in Phil and Friends in 2018. He wrote in his Instagram account on Friday, “When I got the setlist from the night before I asked him if he wanted to know it, and he said, ‘No. I want to be surprised and live the experience in the moment’ just like he had hundreds of times at Dead shows over the years. We played one of the most inspiring, terrifying, and exhilarating sets of music I’ve ever played. Phil was a conduit for love, adventure, magic and community. He brought so many people together and made so many lives better through his music.” ', 'The most consistent musical companion Phil had in Phil and Friends was his drummer John Molo. Traditionally, a drummer and a bass player create what is known as a pocket for the rest of the band. In 2016, George Porter, the legendary bass player for the Meters told me in an interview, “The idea of the pocket is that when the drummer and the bass player are playing well together, they create a pocket and then everyone else can climb in and do what they want because the drummer and bass player got the pocket.”', 'If Phil Lesh were a pair of jeans, his jeans would have no pockets. Creating a foundation so the rest of the band members could explore and have a place to come back to is not what Phil did; he was out there exploring the terrain along with the other musicians in the band. ', 'And when those other musicians were Garcia, Weir, Brent Mydland (et. al), Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzman, collectively known as the Grateful Dead, Phil helped create some of the greatest musical alchemy conjured by any group of musicians ever. ', 'Before joining the Grateful Dead, Phil was interested in classical music. He grew up playing the violin and then switched to trumpet. He was passionate about Bach and John Coltrane. ', 'Phil played the bass more like a trumpet than a traditional bass. He was a master at improvisation, not afraid to get out in front of the music and lead the way. And he did it all with a gigantic, joyful smile.', 'The most distinctive aspect of Phil’s playing was how melodic it was. Aside from “Shakedown Street” and the opening notes of “The Other One,” Phil was not a bass player who dropped the low-end bombs. His playing would often lead the band through two different melodies at the same time.', 'Phil co-wrote two of the Grateful Dead’s most beautiful songs — “Unbroken Chain” and “Box of Rain.” The lyrics for the latter song “it’s all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago” resonate more deeply with me than any other Robert Hunter lyric. ', 'It was 26 years ago that a young man, known to Phil only as Cody, died in either an automobile or bicycle accident. At the end of every show, Phil would come out on stage and address the audience and give what was known in the setlists as “the donor rap.” He would tell Cody’s story and say that he was alive today because Cody was an organ donor and he would encourage everyone to “save the life of someone you’ll never meet.” ', 'A good way to honor the life of Phil is to learn more about becoming an organ donor.

Lesh had previously survived bouts of prostate cancer, bladder cancer and a 1998 liver transplant necessitated by the debilitating effects of a hepatitis C infection and years of heavy drinking.', ""Although he kept a relatively low public profile, rarely granting interviews or speaking to the audience, fans and fellow band members recognized Lesh as a critical member of the Grateful Dead whose thundering lines on the six-string electric bass provided a brilliant counterpoint to lead guitarist Jerry Garcia's soaring solos and anchored the band's famous marathon jams."", '""When Phil\'s happening the band\'s happening,"" Garcia once said.', ""Drummer Mickey Hart called him the group's intellectual who brought a classical composer's mindset and skills to a five-chord rock ‘n’ roll band."", 'Lesh credited Garcia with teaching him to play bass in the unorthodox lead-guitar style that he would become famous for, mixing thundering arpeggios with snippets of spontaneously composed orchestral passages.', 'Fellow bass player Rob Wasserman once said set Lesh’s style set him apart from every other bassist he knew of. While most others were content to keep time and take the occasional solo, said Wasserman, Lesh was both good enough and confident enough to lead his fellow musicians through a song’s melody.', '“He happens to play bass but he’s more like a horn player, doing all those arpeggios — and he has that counterpoint going all the time,” he said.', 'Lesh began his long musical odyssey as a classically trained violinist, starting with lessons in third grade. He took up the trumpet at 14, eventually earning the second chair in California’s Oakland Symphony Orchestra while still in his teens.', 'But he had largely put both instruments aside and was driving a mail truck and working as a sound engineer for a small radio station in 1965 when Garcia recruited him to play bass in a fledgling rock band called The Warlocks.', 'When Lesh told Garcia he didn’t play the bass, the musician asked, “Didn’t you used to play violin?” When he said yes Garcia told him, “There you go, man.”', 'Armed with a cheap four-string instrument his girlfriend bought him, Lesh sat down for a seven-hour lesson with Garcia, following the latter’s advice that he tune his instrument’s strings an octave lower than the four bottom strings on Garcia’s guitar. Then Garcia turned him loose, allowing him to develop the spontaneous style of playing that he would embrace for the rest of his life.', 'Lesh and Garcia would frequently exchange leads, often spontaneously, while the band as a whole would frequently break into long experimental, jazz-influenced jams during concerts. The result was that even well-known Grateful Dead songs like “Truckin’” or “Sugar Magnolia” rarely sounded the same two performances in a row, something that would inspire loyal fans to attend show after show.', '“It’s always fluid, we just pretty much figure it out on the fly,” Lesh said, chuckling, during a rare 2009 interview with The Associated Press. “You can’t set those things in stone in the rehearsal room.”', 'Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.']"
Phil Lesh was a spaceman,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/10/26/phil-lesh-grateful-dead-appreciation/,"['The bassist and songwriter pushed the Grateful Dead to new psychedelic frontiers – and chose intimacy when his remaining bandmates stayed on the road.', 'Even among the mongrels and misfits who made up the Grateful Dead, Phil Lesh managed to be an oddity. He was older than the others and had swum in different cultural pools. Schooled in classical music and besotted by beatniks, he didn’t cut his teeth on folk and blues. He’d never made rock-and-roll before guitarist Jerry Garcia convinced him to join his band the Warlocks on bass in 1965. Lesh hadn’t played one.', 'They would soon be known as the Grateful Dead, who over 30 years would blow open the aperture of rock music, rock concerts and rock fandom. Lesh’s first embrace of uncertainty crystallizes the crucial element he brought to the Dead: He pushed the band into the unknown. He channeled his love of improvisatory jazz, contemporary classical music and technology into their music, ensuring that the rock-and-roll he played reflected his obsessions. Thanks to Lesh, the Dead were liberated from the three-chord shuffle from the start.', 'Lesh died Friday at 84, just weeks before the Grateful Dead were to take another curtain call for their contributions to American culture. The band’s rise through the psychedelic byways of the Bay Area roughly mapped with Lesh’s increasing confidence within the band. With Garcia taking a deliberately laissez-faire approach as leader, Lesh had free rein to integrate adventurous concepts within the band’s folk-blues architecture. Introducing the rest of the group to the searching explorations of John Coltrane, Lesh also seized the possibilities of the recording studio, often to the consternation of the band’s associates. In a letter lamenting the cost overages during the recording of their second album, 1968’s “Anthem of the Sun,” Joe Smith of Warner Bros. singled him out as the catalyst for chaos within the band: “It’s apparent that nobody in your organization has enough influence over Phil Lesh to evoke anything resembling normal behavior.”', '“Anthem of the Sun” was indeed an indulgence, the pinnacle of Lesh’s fascination with recorded sound collages, an interest he cultivated when he attended Mills College, where he was classmates with the minimalist composer Steve Reich. The Dead backed away from such costly studio experimentations by the dawn of the 1970s, scaling back to the rustic Americana of “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty.” By that point, Lesh established a distinctive instrumental style. Equally pliable and aggressive, his bass could chase after Garcia’s winding guitar lines or ground the band with a rattling boom. Lesh not only adapted easily to the simpler settings of country-rock, he wound up singing one of the Dead’s signature songs in “Box of Rain,” an aching tribute to his dying father co-written with the band’s regular lyricist Robert Hunter.', 'Despite his facility in the studio, the stage is where Lesh thrived, particularly during the first half of the 1970s. Thanks to the legions of Deadhead tapers, every one of the band’s tours was thoroughly documented, so it’s possible to sample any given date from 1972 or 1974 and hear how the Dead interpreted the improvisations instigated by Lesh through his introduction to Coltrane. Occasionally, they would lay into a loping vamp. More often they set out on a quest for aural transcendence, a journey encouraged and accelerated by Lesh’s bustling, insistent bass.', 'Follow Music', 'Aided by Owsley “Bear” Stanley, the Dead’s onetime acid source turned sound engineer, Lesh sought sonic nirvana through the development of their “Wall of Sound,” a custom-made rig of hundreds of speakers that stood 40 feet high. Lesh described the Dead’s 1974 tour with the “Wall of Sound” as “the most generally satisfying performance experience of my life with the band” — but it represented something of a closing chapter for the group. Its financial burden forced them off the road for a spell, a hiatus that accelerated Lesh’s descent into alcoholism. He played a diminished role in the band until the mid-1980s, when he re-emerged as a sober family man with a steady marriage and two sons.', '“Touch of Grey,” the song that gave the Grateful Dead their first Billboard Top Ten hit two decades after their first record, turned the band’s world upside down. Fresh fans flocked to the Dead, upsetting the delicate balance of the Deadhead ecosystem. Lesh bristled at the larger venues the band had to play to accommodate new listeners and, through the rest of his life, wound up choosing intimacy whenever he could. His options increased after the Dead disbanded in the wake of Garcia’s death in 1995. Freed of the confines of the Dead touring machine, Lesh opted to challenge himself creatively, designing Phil Lesh and Friends as a collective featuring a rotating crew of musicians, many quite younger than the bassist himself.', 'Although he occasionally reunited with his surviving bandmates, participating in the 2004 tour as the Dead and the group’s farewell concerts at Chicago’s Soldier Field a decade later, Lesh preferred settings where he could reconnect with the sense of adventure that fueled him during the band’s glory days. While Bob Weir, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann toured arenas as Dead & Company in recent years, Lesh stayed near his home, often playing Terrapin Crossroads, the San Rafael, California, venue he established with his family, with his Terrapin Family Band, which often featured his grown sons Grahame and Brian.', 'Lesh’s decision to not participate in Dead & Company suggested that he found sustenance not in the Dead itself but rather the band’s ethos: the idea that a group of mismatched musicians could stumble their way toward the sublime. By pushing the Grateful Dead toward new, unheard vistas, Lesh demonstrated what could be possible within rock-and-roll — not just the outer reaches of “Space” that he encouraged in the group’s famous improvised jams, but by turning inward on compositions “Box of Rain” and “Unbroken Chain,” songs that exhibited an emotional intelligence uncommon in rock. Within that spectrum — from the head to the heart — laid Lesh’s enduring legacy, an entire strange trip in one full life.', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.
