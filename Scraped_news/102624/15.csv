Israel has split the territory in two by building the Netzarim corridor, which bisects the strip just south of Gaza City.', 'On Wednesday the Israeli military published documents which it said it had found in Gaza that proved that six Al Jazeera journalists had a military affiliation to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The papers could not be immediately independently verified.', 'In a statement on Thursday, Al Jazeera said the Israel accusations were “criminal, draconian and irresponsible” and “part of a wider pattern of hostility”. Several of the network’s journalists have been killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza war, deaths the Israeli military denies were deliberate.', 'Israel outlawed Al Jazeera earlier this year for what it termed “security reasons”, and raided its offices in the occupied West Bank.', 'The Committee to Protect Journalists’ Middle East programme said on X that the allegations amounted to the smearing of Palestinian journalists “with unsubstantiated terrorist labels”.', 'Indirect talks aimed at a ceasefire and hostage release deal in the war in Gaza, mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, have been deadlocked since the assassination in July ofIsmail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas and its main negotiator. The attack in the Iranian capital of Tehran is believed to have been carried out by Israel, although the country has not claimed responsibility.', 'The international community has pushed for a return to negotiations after Israel’s killing this month of the architect of the 7 October attacks, Yahya Sinwar, who had the final word on Hamas’s position in talks and had repeatedly blocked progress towards a deal.', 'Blinken, the US secretary of state, said after meetings in Doha with the Qatari leadership on Thursday that Israeli and US negotiators were expected to reconvene in “the coming days”.

He also announced an additional $135m (£104m) in aid to the Palestinians, while urging Israel not to block aid from entering Gaza.', 'Separately on Thursday, France hosted an international aid conference for Lebanon, but diplomatic efforts to end the new ground war between Israel and the powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah are yet to bear fruit.']"
