The update, expected Monday, will bring Apple Intelligence, hearing aid support for AirPods, sleep apnea detection for Apple Watch, phone call recording and more.', 'Apple Intelligence features are being rolled out slowly with every new iOS update. The process is expected to take a while. This first update hits the ground running with 10 features. But that’s not all — there’s more in this update for those of us with an older iPhone or who live in the European Union.', 'Keep reading or watch our video on the new features in iOS 18.1.', '', '', 'Table of contents: All the new features in iOS 18.1', 'The first Apple Intelligence features are here for the iPhone 15 Pro, all iPhone 16 models, all Macs and iPads with an M-series chip — and the new iPad mini.', 'More Apple Intelligence features are coming later. Image Playground and Genmoji, Visual Intelligence and a smarter Siri that can take actions on your behalf and see your screen are expected in iOS 18.2, which just entered beta testing.', 'If you own AirPods Pro 2, the software update will enable them to function as clinical hearing aids. Setup includes taking a clinically validated hearing test with AirPods Pro and iPhone. This enables AirPods Pro to boost the specific sounds the wearer needs.', 'Even better, “Your hearing profile is automatically applied to music, movies and phone calls across all your devices without needing to adjust any settings at all,” according to Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple.', 'According to early testing, the feature works pretty well in cases of mild to moderate hearing loss — but those with a severe case should stick to traditional hearing aids.', 'We highly recommend you take the built-in hearing test. Most people with hearing loss don’t know it.', 'If you own an Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 or Apple Watch Ultra 2, your watch will start collecting data overnight for possible sleep apnea. This requires 10 days of overnight sleep tracking, and it will analyze the data once every 30 days — so it won’t ring the alarm bells every day. You also will need to enable the feature in the Apple Health app after updating.', 'We strongly recommend you take advantage of this new Apple health feature, too. Again, lots of people who suffer from sleep apnea have no idea.', 'If you don’t want the big Connectivity widget in the iPhone’s Control Center, you can now replace it with the two or three toggles you prefer.

Siri’s big ChatGPT upgrade is here — for better and worse,https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278716/siri-chat-gpt-ios-18-2-developer-beta-apple-intelligence,"['By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.', 'Apple Intelligence’s official launch is less than a week away, but it’s the next wave of AI updates that will start to make Siri a lot more useful.', 'The forthcoming iOS 18.2 update — now available as a developer beta — starts to make your phone a lot smarter with the addition of Visual Intelligence and the ability to pass Siri requests along to ChatGPT. On phones that support Apple Intelligence, Siri won’t just be a “let me Google that for you” machine; now it’s a “let me ChatGPT that for you” machine, with all that entails: good, bad, and everything in between.', 'By default, Siri will ask for confirmation every time it wants to pass on a request to ChatGPT. This makes a lot of sense, and I thought I’d prefer that behavior. But after an afternoon using it, I realized I just wanted to get to the ChatGPT answer faster and turned it off. Siri still handles basic questions on its own and doesn’t pass things like “When is the US election?” to ChatGPT, thankfully. And it will still just Google something for you when that’s the best way to get to your answer.', 'But more complex stuff goes to ChatGPT, which means Siri can handle a lot more stuff than I’m used to throwing at it. Ask it “What are some cocktails I can make with whiskey and lemon juice?” and you’ll get a short list of options with descriptions. Old Siri will basically just show you a Google search snippet.', 'AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini regularly get things wrong and make things up. But I’ve started using them more and more as a starting point when I need help with something and I’m basically clueless. I actually downloaded Gemini (by way of Google’s iOS app) to the iPhone 16 I’ve been using because I got tired of opening it in a browser. As long as you don’t blindly trust what the AI tells you, it’s a handy way to get pointed in the right direction.', 'Apple has put some nice privacy protections around your use of ChatGPT. OpenAI is “required to process your request solely for the purpose of fulfilling it and does not store your request or any responses it provides,” Apple states. The information won’t be used to train AI models, either. If you sign in to your OpenAI account, your requests are saved in your ChatGPT history and all of OpenAI’s terms apply. But you don’t need an OpenAI account at all if you don’t want or have one. I appreciate that.', 'A glorified, iOS-ified Google Lens', 'iPhone 16 owners will have another way to tap into ChatGPT’s smarts, too: Visual Intelligence, which is also enabled in 18.2. It’s accessed by holding down the camera control button, which pulls up a camera live view. Once you take a photo, you can have ChatGPT analyze it or use Google Image search to find similar results on the web. It is a glorified, iOS-ified Google Lens, and it’s about time iPhones had something like this built in. Siri could previously look up plants and landmarks and the like, but nothing as expansive as this.', 'Visual Intelligence is pretty good — mostly. It was very flattering in its descriptions of various spots around my house, calling my entryway “cozy” and “well-organized,” and our whiskey collection “impressive.” It came up with a decent list of cocktails to make based on a picture of my home bar, and it got me started in the right direction on a home repair with a picture of the problem. As long as you treat the answer as a starting point, AI is pretty handy for these kinds of low stakes questions.', 'But all of the familiar pitfalls of AI chatbots are present, which Apple warns you about in every interaction you have with ChatGPT. I asked it to explain the joke in a Garfield comic strip to me, and it completely made up details that weren’t there (though to be fair, the joke it invented was funnier than the actual source material). I asked it about the books on my shelf and it hallucinated some titles that are definitely not on that shelf.', 'I also wish that ChatGPT would let you check its work the way that Gemini does. Google’s AI chatbot supplies obvious links to articles on the topics it references, so you know where to go to read more and double check what the AI is telling you. ChatGPT mentions in small print the number of sources it pulled from to come up with your answer for Siri, and you need to tap to see links to those articles.', 'Still, it’s a leap forward in the kinds of things you can expect Siri to do. And it’s one that people won’t see when they download Apple Intelligence; in iOS 18.1, Siri gets a new look with a glowing border, a new text interface, and improved language understanding. But it’s basically the same old Siri.', 'That starts to change in 18.2, and Apple’s AI ambitions are bigger still than “go ask ChatGPT.” Eventually, Siri will be able to take action for you in apps — kind of the whole promise of AI on our phones. But those kinds of updates likely won’t arrive until well into 2025.', 'Of all the Apple Intelligence features I’ve used so far, the ChatGPT integration feels like the one I’ll use the most; the same way that Gemini has me using Google’s assistant more often for more things. It’s not always right, but as a tool to help me get to the right answer, it’s pretty smart.', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', ""The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy joins the show to discuss a bunch of updates in the smart home world, including what's new from Google Home and in iOS 18, plus some big news in the world of smart locks and video doorbells. Then, The Verge's Chris Welch comes on to test some new earbuds, and see which pair has the best sound – and the best mic.

Apple Introduces Advanced AI Features in iOS 18.1: Enhancements for iPhone Users,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2568601/apple-introduces-advanced-ai-features-in-ios-181-enhancements-for-iphone-users,"['Apple (AAPL, Financial) has announced the launch of its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence feature with the release of iOS 18.1. This update promises to deliver an array of advanced AI functionalities, marking a significant step forward for iPhone users.', 'Key features in iOS 18.1 include a suite of writing tools for text proofreading and rewriting, which aims to enhance input quality. The update also introduces a photo cleanup tool that automatically organizes and optimizes photo storage. Additionally, users will benefit from a notification summary that intelligently organizes alerts for quicker access to important information. Enhancements to Siri are also part of the update, improving the virtual assistant’s interactive experience with more accurate information and suggestions.', ""Looking ahead, Apple plans to integrate Siri with OpenAI's ChatGPT in the upcoming iOS 18.2 version.

"iOS 18.1 iPhone Update: Release Date Confirmed, iOS 18.2 Beta Live",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2024/10/25/ios-181-iphone-update-release-date-confirmed-ios-182-beta-live/,"['Updated October 25 with further details of the new developer beta on its way.', 'Apple Intelligence is almost here and Apple has just confirmed exactly when. We already knew it was some time in October and now Apple has said it will be next week. And on Wednesday, Oct. 23, Apple has just put the first developer beta of iOS 18.2 live.', 'Apple Intelligence is just days away.', 'Although the iOS 18.1 release is highly anticipated, it’s the developer beta of iOS 18.2—set to be the next update unless there are bug fixes that are needed in the meantime—that will likely cause more excitement as it has a lot of new features.', 'PROMOTED', 'Early adopters of the new software have already commented on features they like. John-Anthony Disotto at Techradar, for instance, has talked about the AI features coming to the Mail app, saying, “While it may not be as headline-grabbing as ChatGPT-integration with Siri, Visual Intelligence, or Genmoji, it’s the mundane use of AI that I think the average consumer will appreciate most. I’ve been using the new Mail app in iOS 18.2 developer beta for roughly 24 hours now, and while it’s still in development it makes me optimistic about Apple Intelligence.”', 'Disotto’s enthusiasm is because of strong summarizing tools, new categorization and an improved design. Together they have sorted out what was a “mess of an inbox.” He also warns that as this is a developer beta, that it shouldn’t be installed on your main driver. I’d agree, early betas can be unstable or can damage battery life.', 'Forbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.', '', '', '', 'While he’s unsure how often he’ll use the summarization tools, he was impressed by how many details it picked up when sorting through a chain of seven messages.', 'As discussed below, this Mail feature is just one of many new capabilities coming later this year. These include Visual Intelligence which works with the Camera Control on the iPhone 16 series phones. Pressing and holding on the button means the iPhone will share extra information about what the camera can see, or translate a sign, recognize an address or phone number and more. Apple has said that the iPhone 16 was the first to be designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence, and this is an example of exactly that.', 'While the updates coming in iOS 18.1 are exciting, it looks like iOS 18.2 will be the big one in terms of Apple Intelligence highlights. As well as the details listed below, this update will also have Image Wand, which uses image generation tools to create an image in a note in the Notes app, for instance. If you’ve drawn something with the Apple Pencil on an iPad, for instance, it can turn a rough sketch into a nicer image.', 'There are also new details which have come to light of a key element of Apple Intelligence: there’s a waitlist. When you update to iOS 18.1, the Settings app includes a new extra called Apple Intelligence & Siri. It’s here that you can sign up to Apple Intelligence. When you do, you’ll be asked to join a waitlist, exactly as those using the developer or public betas have had to do.', 'During that time, the waitlist moved fast: I waited for all of 10 minutes. That may change when the software hits the critical mass that the general release brings with it. However, if you’ve already used Apple Intelligence in beta, Apple has said you don’t need to wait again.', 'So, as Ryan Christoffel points out at 9to5Mac, this is a cunning way to beat the waitlist. “You can join the Apple Intelligence waitlist today. How? By installing the iOS 18.1 public beta. Apple just released the iOS 18.1 RC beta today. RC stands for release candidate, meaning the software will likely be identical to what’s released to all users next week… once you install the iOS 18.1 RC, you’ll be able to join the Apple Intelligence waitlist without waiting another day.” Which means that you can then switch to the general release software next week but you won’t have to join a waitlist again.', 'Next week means Monday, Oct. 28, Tuesday, Oct. 29 or Wednesday, Oct. 30. My belief is that the exact release details will be 10 a.m. Pacific on Oct. 28.', 'The first features of Apple’s personal intelligence system are almost here. There’s more to come over the next few months but initial features include writing tools to let you improve what you’ve written. You can proofread your text, and the iPhone can rewrite or summarize what you’ve said. These tools are available across the iPhone, including in Mail, Notes, Pages and in some third-party apps.', '', 'Photos has a new clean-up tool which can remove people and things spoiling your shot, and uses multiple machine learning tools to leave the background pristine, like they were never there.', 'You can already record and transcribe audio, but with iOS 18.1, the capability to record phone calls is added, complete with automatic notifications to participants. A summary is also generated after the call ends.', 'Siri gains a new design that looks somehow more central to the iPhone experience and will offer a more intuitive interaction.', 'At first, Apple Intelligence on iPhone will only work with devices with language and Siri set to U.S. English. But Apple has now released a developer beta which will extend this to other versions of English.', 'The new dev beta of iOS 18.2 has just gone live and it allows more English speakers to use Apple Intelligence, specifically English for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the U.K.', 'It also introduces a lot more features, plus refinements to the existing writing tools—you can specify what you’re looking for with a “Describe your change” element.', 'New features include Image Playground, which lets you create images from a picture in your photo library. You can save these to a new standalone app which will update automatically across devices on the same Apple account.', 'And iOS 18.2 sees the arrival of the much-anticipated Genmoji to create all-new emoji with just a text prompt. There’s also the first sight of integration with ChatGPT. If Siri thinks ChatGPT could help, it’ll ask if you’d like to be connected to it. Apple has stressed the security protections it has put in place for each request and no ChatGPT account is needed. Visual Intelligence, which integrates with the iPhone’s Camera Control is also in the new beta.', 'Apple iOS 18.2 will go on general release in December, Apple has confirmed.', 'I’ve been writing about technology for two decades and am routinely struck by how the sector swings from startling innovation to persistent repetitiveness.

Previously, you were locked into Apple’s choices when it came to your default apps for messaging, emailing, calling and more.', 'Now, though, that has all changed, and Apple lets you pick new default apps in the following areas: web browsing, calling and call filtering, emailing, messaging, passwords and codes, and keyboards. While some of these were previously available, you’ve not been able to change your default messaging and calling apps before.', 'You can manage these choices in a new Default Apps section in the Settings app. That makes it a lot easier to change your default apps with a few quick taps.

That’s when the company will roll out its Apple Intelligence AI platform to eligible devices. Apple isn’t being shy about how profound of an event this will be for the company and its future. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple Intelligence would make the experience of using Apple products “profoundly different” and likened Apple’s AI technology to the iPhone’s touch interface and the iPod’s click wheel in terms of innovation and importance.', 'That’s a high bar—and possibly a problematic one. That’s because the Apple Intelligence that gets rolled out this week won’t be a finished product but rather a work in progress. All of the Apple Intelligence features the company previewed in June won’t be coming to your iPhone or other devices just yet. So, what features are coming this week? Here’s what you need to know.', 'When Apple Intelligence launches this week, it will include a swath of new AI features baked into the iPhone’s operating system—iOS 18.1 (Apple Intelligence is also coming to supported iPads and Macs this week). These features can be broken down into four main categories, according to the release notes (published by 9to5Mac). They are:', 'In addition to the above Apple Intelligence features, others launching this week include the ability to use auto-generated, contextually relevant smart replies so you can quickly respond to emails and text messages with a tap, and the ability to generate a text-based summary of audio recordings, which saves you the time of having to listen to the entire recording.', 'While many people will find the above features useful, they are, unfortunately, just a handful of the ones Apple promised when the company first previewed Apple Intelligence in June. Most of the headline-prompting, eye-catching features of Apple Intelligence are still months away—with some likely not making an appearance until 2025.', 'For example, Image Playground, the name Apple gives to Apple Intelligence’s ability to generate images in the style of sketches and illustrations that can be used in messages, presentations, and documents, is nowhere to be seen in Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1. Neither is what is perhaps the most fun feature—Genmoji—which allows users to create custom emojis. Both these features are rumored to not be arriving until iOS 18.2 is released in December, according to Bloomberg.', 'But other features of Apple Intelligence are even further away. The most powerful features of Apple Intelligence likely won’t arrive until iOS 18.4, which isn’t expected until Spring of 2025, at the earliest. Bloomberg says that’s when Apple Intelligence will finally gain the ability to understand context and allow Siri to control apps and “see” what is currently on users’ iPhone screen to help them complete tasks.

Image Playground is Apple's dedicated image creation app that can build cartoon-like pictures based on text descriptions."", ""This guide highlights everything that you need to know about Image Playground, from its limitations to where you can use it, and we'll provide updates as Image Playground evolves."", 'Updating to iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2 adds a ""Playground"" app to the Home Screen or desktop, denoted by an icon featuring a white cat/dog/bear creature in a 3D style.', 'Tapping into the app brings up a splash screen with instructions on how to use Image Playground, but it\'s straightforward. There\'s a text bar at the bottom that instructs you to ""Describe an image.""', 'As soon as you type in a word or phrase, Image Playground starts working on generating an image for you. You can essentially type in anything, like ""crocodile wearing a tutu"" or ""skunk hula hooping on top of an elephant.""', ""You can modify the result with additional word descriptions, or use one of Apple's suggestions. You'll get several possible images for each description, and you can swipe through them to choose what you want. You can add and remove words and phrases until you refine the generated image to exactly what you want."", ""Image Playground is very much in beta right now, so Apple is soliciting feedback. There are thumbs up and thumbs down icons you can use to submit feedback. Thumbs up doesn't require additional input, but thumbs down goes to an interface where you can select what's wrong with an image and provide additional written details."", ""After you've created your ideal image, you can tap on the Done button to save it to your Image Playground library. Items saved in the Image Playground library can be edited again later, deleted, or shared with the standard Share Sheet. There are also built-in tools for copying, sharing, or saving an image during the creation process."", 'You can start an Image Playground creation with a person. People that are saved in your People album in the Photos app will show up as an option (yourself included), and you can select a specific photo of a person to use as the base for a new image.', 'Each photo of a person will look different because Image Playground is pulling in the specific angle, lighting, and look of a particular image rather than of an aggregate, so you can swipe through to see which image of a person looks the most like them when converted to an animated form.', ""You are limited to individuals that are saved to your People album, so AI isn't going to understand if you ask for an image of Tim Cook or Taylor Swift, but for this use case, you can import a photo."", 'You can also create a generic look to use as a base using the built-in ""Appearance"" option in the Person interface. That setting lets you select a skin tone and feature set, which can be refined further with image descriptions.', ""If you don't know where to start with an image creation or you need inspiration for details, Apple has a range of suggestions that you can tap to add to your image."", 'There are themes like adventure, disco, summer, party, sunset, and fantasy, along with places like city, space, desert, park, prairie, and forest. Apple suggests costumes that include artist, chef, hiker, mage, robot, and superhero, and there are accessories you can select from like sunglasses, beanie, top hat, party hat, and flower crown.', 'These are just a jumping off point, of course, and you can choose any location or setting and add any objects and accessories you want using text descriptions.', ""Suggestions in the Image Playground app aren't contextual, but when you use Image Playground in Messages, you might see suggestions based on what you've been talking about."", ""You can't make photorealistic images with Image Playground, and that's by design. Apple doesn't want to generate images that can fool someone, so you're limited to two styles: Animation and Illustration."", ""Animation is a 3D-looking style that looks like something out of a Pixar movie, while Illustration is a flatter, 2D image that's simpler."", ""When Image Playground was first announced in June 2024, Apple said there would be three styles, including Animation, Illustration, and Sketch. It's not clear if sketch is still planned and will be coming at a later date."", 'You can take a photo or import a photo from the \u200cPhotos\u200c app to use as inspiration for an Image Playground creation. If you want an Image Playground image with \u200cTim Cook\u200c, using a photo is the way to go.', 'Any photo works to serve as inspiration for a creation, and you can use a photo for the main subject of an image or for the background.', 'You can create images in the Image Playground app and share them in Messages, but you can also do it directly from the Messages app. In a conversation, tap on the ""+"" button and then choose Image Playground from the list.', ""The Messages mini app works like the full app. Just type in a description of an image and use the same steps to get it to where you want it. When you're finished, tap on Done, and it'll show up in the send field of your conversation so you can text it to whoever you're conversing with."", 'To share an Image Playground image in a text message, you can use the built-in Image Playground mini app in Messages, which is the quickest route.', ""You can also go to the Image Playground library or create a new image in the app and then use the Share Sheet to AirDrop it, send it via Messages, email it, or save it to the \u200cPhotos\u200c or Files app. Anything you've saved to \u200cPhotos\u200c can be uploaded to a social media app."", 'The Share Sheet is like the Share Sheet anywhere else in iOS, so if you have an app like Instagram installed, there is a Share Sheet option to upload an Image Playground creation directly to Instagram. The same goes for other social networks that support the Share Sheet.', 'Image Playground is in beta right now, and Apple says that users can see unexpected results depending on the descriptors that are used. Sometimes words that seem like they should produce a simple result end up making something unexpectedly odd, such as the banana split images below.', 'The AI has some limitations to be aware of, and there are also built-in guardrails that restrict the content that you can create.', ""One noticeable limitation involves Image Playground creations that use photos of people. You can only get portrait-style photos that show the top half of a person, with no option for a full-body pose. So if you wanted to generate an image of your friend Eric roller skating, it's hard to depict that activity accurately because Image Playground will only generate a chest-up image."", ""This limitation doesn't apply when generating images of animals and creatures, but it's an issue when you want to depict an activity that needs more than a head and shoulders."", ""This also impacts images that you might want to generate with a secondary object, like a cat or another person. Image Playground doesn't always do a good job with multiple subjects in a photo at this time. The more descriptors you have, the more it struggles with this kind of thing."", 'As with most image generating tools that are available, Image Playground struggles with text. Text tends to be non-sensical.', '', ""Apple learned some lessons from other tech companies that have introduced image generation tools, and there are plenty of built-in restrictions. When Google debuted Pixel Studio in August, people were able to use it to generate images with drugs, alcohol, Nazis, and more, and Apple's not allowing any of that."", 'When a word isn\'t allowed, you\'ll see the following message: ""Unable to use that description"" with an undo button you can use to remove it.', 'There are other phrases that Image Playground will kind of ignore. If you use ""blood"" or ""bloody"" for example, you\'ll get a red-tinted background, but no actual blood. You can\'t use words like murder or dead or their synonyms, and while gun and pistol are okay, AK-47, machine gun, and shotgun are not.', ""Concepts that could be used to generate a political image are likewise banned. You can't add country-specific flags, or countries like United States, Mexico or Germany. Words related to drugs or drug paraphernalia don't work, and there are a lot of descriptors that Image Playground will just disregard, even if you don't get a message that it's explicitly forbidden."", ""It's clear that Apple put a lot of work into preventing Image Playground from generating inappropriate images, and the company has made it clear that improvements will be made and that there's still a possibility of unexpected results during the beta."", ""When Apple Intelligence is having trouble applying a word, it often requires you to select a person to add to your image, even if you didn't want to add a person. It can be frustrating, and you'll need to add the person, change your phrasing, and remove the person to get to what you really meant."", ""Likewise, Apple doesn't allow you to create images of copyrighted characters, so there won't be any option to use Image Playground to create compromising photos of Bluey and Mickey Mouse."", ""Image generation for Image Playground is done on-device, so nothing that you're typing in is sent to a cloud server or shared, though it is worth noting that Apple is collecting feedback on it right now."", 'Image Playground is only available in the iOS 18.2 beta, and the beta is limited to developers at the current time. There is no word yet on when a public beta might be released.', 'You need to opt in to a second waitlist to get access to Image Playground and Genmoji in iOS 18.2, with Apple apparently limiting the number of people who can use the features.
