Topics ranged from business to personal and geopolitical issues.', 'In one instance, Putin pressured Musk to direct SpaceX to withold Starlink, its powerful satellite internet communications service, from Taiwan as a favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Journal reported, citing two people briefed on the request. Beijing is a crucial ally to the Kremlin. A version of Starlink that is available for military use is called StarShield.', 'Speaking at a Semafor conference in Washington D.C. on Friday, NASA administrator Bill Nelson said, “If the story is true that there have been multiple conversations between Elon Musk and the president of Russia then I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.” He also said the matter “should be investigated.”', 'CNBC has not independently verified the conversations, which the Journal described as a “closely held secret” even within the U.S. government.', 'But the report raises new questions about how Musk makes decisions at his companies that impact geopolitics and national security, such as where and when to enable Starlink’s satellite communications technology. Those questions extend to the way Musk operates the social network X, which he owns and leads as CTO.', 'Musk has become a major Republican donor this election cycle, and is among the most influential supporters of former President Donald Trump’s campaign.', 'In September, the chair of a House committee on China, Rep. Mike Gallagher returned from a Taiwan visit with a congressional delegation, where they learned that StarShield was not operational for American troops in and around the region. They sent a letter to SpaceX demanding that the company switch it on.', 'As NBC News previously reported, Musk and SpaceX said they were in full compliance with their Pentagon contract, and denied the House’s claim. SpaceX later sought majority ownership of a Starlink-based venture requested by Taiwan, a proposal the island nation rejected, calling it incompatible with its laws.', 'Currently, the SpaceX website says that a “service date is unknown at this time,” for Starlink in Taiwan for general customers.', 'Musk and representatives for X, SpaceX and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'Russia’s KGB, and its successor agency the FSB have, for decades, been interested in controlling media narratives and reaching as many people as possible with anti-Western or pro-Kremlin messages. The conversations between Musk and Putin, who once ran the KGB, reportedly occurred as Musk was in the midst of a leveraged buyout and takeover of Twitter.', 'It was previously known that Musk had engaged in at least one discussion with Putin directly.', 'In 2022, Eurasia Group founder and political analyst Ian Bremmer wrote that Musk had spoken to Putin before the X owner posted social media messages in early October about Russia’s war on Ukraine.', 'Musk had proposed that Ukraine should hand over Crimea to Russia and that Kyiv should remain “neutral” rather than attempting to join NATO. He continued to promote the idea, via X (formerly Twitter) that some Ukraine citizens would prefer to join Russia.', 'Kremlin officials praised Musk for his opinion then, while Musk drew sharp criticism from many others, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., and Russia-born human rights activist and former chess champion Garry Kasparov.', 'Musk closed his acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion on Oct. 27.', '“I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago,” Musk said at that time. “The subject matter was space.”', 'About a year later, in September 2023, Putin publicly praised Musk, calling him a “talented businessman.” Putin’s praise came after Musk said he had refused an emergency request by the Ukrainian government to extend coverage of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites to Sevastopol in Crimea. Putin made the comments at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, where he spoke about Russia’s space program after a failed moon landing.', 'Before that, Musk actively sought to do business with Russia at his companies SpaceX and Tesla over the years.', '“I went to Russia three times to try to buy a couple of their biggest [intercontinental ballistic missiles],” Musk told an audience at the SXSW interactive conference in 2013, where he recounted the challenges of starting up his re-usable rocket business.', 'While the missile deal never manifested, SpaceX was funded in part by Russian-born Israeli tech magnate Yuri Milner, who has deep ties to Silicon Valley firms. In August 2022, Milner officially denounced his Russian citizenship. SpaceX now regularly conducts missions with NASA astronauts and cosmonauts from Roscosmos, the Russian Space agency, though diplomatic collaboration of this sort is typical in the aerospace industry.', 'Musk and SpaceX are credited with inspiring the creation of the Commercial Space Act by Republican then-Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, which passed in 2004, enabling private sector companies to provide launch services to federal agencies.', 'Rohrabacher represented Orange County, California, in the House for 30 years, but lost his reelection bid in 2018. That loss was partly due to Rohrabacher’s publicly acknowledged communication with the Kremlin, which included a meeting in Moscow in 2016 that troubled U.S. intelligence officials.', 'Musk’s Tesla has forged supply chain ties to Russia more recently, purchasing millions of euros worth of aluminum from Rusal since late 2020, as CNBC first reported. Rusal was founded by sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and was once sanctioned by the US Treasury, which cited Russia’s “malign activities” at the time. Those sanctions were lifted under Trump in 2019.', 'Should Trump win, he has promised Musk a role in a “government efficiency” commission, which he said he would create at the tech magnate’s suggestion. Such a role would give Musk sway over federal agencies including those tasked with ensuring that he and his companies comply with federal laws.', 'Speaking at the New York Economic Club in September, Trump said the commission as he envisions it would be “tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Trump has repeatedly said Musk would lead the commission but would not have to leave his companies to do so.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

', 'Some politicians have cited Mr Musk’s conflicts of interest with China, where his electric carmaker Tesla has manufacturing facilities, as justification for building its own alternative.', 'This effort gained renewed urgency after shipping vessels damaged two sub-sea internet cables connecting some of Taiwan’s outlying islands near the Chinese mainland last year, almost completely cutting them off from contact with the outside world. ', 'Some analysts viewed the outage as Beijing carrying out a dress rehearsal of its invasion tactics.', 'On Thursday, Taiwan’s ministry of digital affairs launched the island’s first domestically produced high-altitude balloons to serve as backup communication channels in the event of emergencies.', 'In February, members of US Congress said Starlink’s approach to Taiwan could threaten its government contracts. ', 'Mike Gallagher, a Republican representative for Wisconsin, said that by not making its service available in Taiwan, SpaceX could be in breach of its contract to make the service accessible to the US government worldwide, according to a letter reviewed by The New York Times.', 'SpaceX “is in full compliance with all of its US government contracts”, the company said at the time. ', '“SpaceX notified the select committee last week that it is misinformed, but the committee chose to contact media before seeking additional information.”', 'Mr Musk, the world’s richest man with an estimated fortune of $270 billion (£208 billion), according to Bloomberg, has recently thrown his support behind Donald Trump, joining him on the Republican presidential campaign trail and giving away millions of dollars to sway voters in swing states.', 'His increased presence has led to speculation Mr Musk may be seeking greater influence in a new administration in 2025.', 'Trump has also made regular phone calls to Putin since leaving office, according to a recent book by veteran political journalist Bob Woodward.']"

However, they said the administration has not raised any alerts about possible security breaches by Musk.', ""Musk's unique position - with significant business links to the US military and intelligence communities and access to sensitive information - has heightened concerns among many American officials."", 'The concern is not entirely new: in October 2022, political scientist Jan Bremmer claimed Musk had spoken with Putin, with the Kremlin chief reportedly willing to negotiate for peace with conditions that included Ukrainian neutrality and territorial concessions.', 'Musk, however, later clarified publicly that he had only spoken with Putin once, in early 2021, and that the topic was limited to space.', 'According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk’s interactions with Russia date back to early 2021, when he publicly invited Putin to join a conversation on Clubhouse, a social media platform for live audio discussions.', 'The Kremlin expressed interest but sought clarification on the invitation, and discussions did not proceed further at that time.', 'Reports indicate that Musk’s contact with Russia expanded to inlcude senior Russian officials, including Sergei Kiriyenko, the first deputy head of the Russian presidential administration.', 'Sources suggest these conversations took place under pressure from Moscow, including what appeared to be implicit threats against Musk’s business interests.', 'For instance, Dmitry Rogozin, then-head of Roscosmos, publicly warned that Musk would “have to answer” for the Pentagon’s provision of Starlink communication systems to Ukrainian forces in Mariupol in May 2022.', 'Musk’s role became more controversial after reports from Ukrainska Pravda revealed that in September 2022, Starlink lost connection just as Ukraine launched a marine drone attack on Russian naval forces in Sevastopol Bay.', 'The mission targeted the Admiral Makarov frigate, with drones carrying explosives tracked by top Ukrainian officials. Sources say Starlink was disabled about 70 kilometers from the target, leaving some drones adrift and the mission ultimately unsuccessful. Attempts to restore the connection reportedly went unanswered.', 'Despite this setback, Ukraine adjusted its drone operations and successfully hit Russian assets in Sevastopol that October. Although only two drones from the initial attack returned, they provided valuable data for ongoing military improvements.', ""In September 2023, CNN reported that Musk had ordered the Starlink disconnection, fearing escalation.

But the way he relates to geopolitics has unsettling echoes in America’s past, putting him in the company of business figures whose international misadventures have almost always been a black mark on their historical records.', 'Seasoned diplomats and government watchdogs were aghast at the report of Musk’s relationship with Putin, especially given Musk’s possible appointment to an ambiguous-but-sweeping role in a second Trump administration.', 'It’s unavoidable for international business leaders to have contact with foreign leaders, said Richard Stengel, an undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under former President Barack Obama.', 'Musk’s relationship with a global pariah like Putin, however, carries another level of risk.', '“This in particular is just much more sinister,” Stengel said. He called the WSJ’s report that Putin implored Musk not to activate Starlink service over Taiwan as a favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping “really dicey business.”', 'This might be norm-busting for a contemporary CEO, but Musk’s move has clear precedent in the behavior of tycoons of another generation, whose vast empires and outsized egos led them to write their own scripts on the global stage.', '“Musk’s wealth is immense by historical standards, comparable to Carnegie and Rockefeller, so there aren’t too many points of comparison,” said Mark Wilson, professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.', 'Musk’s use of his business empire to cultivate close ties with a brutal dictator actually is reminiscent of one Rockefeller — David, the head of what was then called the Chase Manhattan Corporation (and later the Council on Foreign Relations) who in the 1970s tried to make nice with the deposed Shah of Iran and the perpetrators of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.', 'Then there’s Henry Ford, the paradigm-shifting carmaker with whom Musk is most often compared. Before Ford became the face of World War II-era isolationism, he embarked in 1915 on an ill-fated personal mission aboard his “Peace Ship” to stop World War I — an effort unsupported and unaligned with the administration of President Woodrow Wilson, who heard Ford’s pitch for the endeavor but declined to sponsor it.', '“Every crackpot and nut in the country wanted to get on that boat,” a Brooklyn Eagle reporter noted at the time. Ford ultimately abandoned the trip out of fear for his company’s reputation, but he would remain active in anti-war politics, for a time heading up the isolationist “America First Committee.”', 'One pattern seems to be that moguls don’t mind sitting down with dictators if it prevents a conflict. Ford notoriously received emissaries and awards from Nazi Germany. William Randolph Hearst, in 1934, visited Hitler in Berlin, in a quixotic attempt to communicate American views of the Nazi regime to its leader.', 'According to the Journal’s reporting, Musk has been cultivating a direct personal relationship with one of the few world leaders on the Treasury Department’s blacklist, on which Putin sits aside North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.', 'Whatever their ideological sympathies for history’s butchers, Ford, Hearst and Musk’s efforts all share a Pollyannaish belief that ruthless men with ambitious, complex geopolitical goals can be pacified if only they could just sit down and talk. It’s a worldview that only a man not used to hearing the word “no” might inhabit, like Ross Perot’s batty mission to send the mercenary Bo Gritz into Southeast Asia to “rescue” POWs from the Vietnam War.', 'It’s also one of the primary critiques of Trump’s approach to foreign policy.', 'Sometimes there can be backlash. Perot didn’t canoodle with dictators, but his freelancing infuriated the Reagan administration all the same — and just a few months later, the Army canceled a massive contract with his Electronic Data Systems.', 'For Musk, it’s not clear that kind of repercussion is even possible. Plenty of information technology firms existed at the time to make up Perot’s contracts. But there’s only one company with the size and expertise to launch missions to the International Space Station, provide satellite internet access in crucial global war zones and break new ground by landing humanity’s first reusable rocket. And Musk controls it.', 'That means the American government is in a far trickier position than it was with any of these past moguls in putting a leash on his one-man diplomacy. (A Pentagon spokesman told The Wall Street Journal “We do not comment on any individual’s security clearance, review or status, or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual’s actions.”)', '“If this was any other contractor, it would be looked into by the agency … but the question about Musk is, is he ‘too big to fail?’” asked the former undersecretary of state Stengel.', 'In keeping with former President Donald Trump’s obsession with fin-de-siècle economics, Musk might be pushing America toward a new retro-futurism: the world of Ford and Hearst freely courting some of America’s worst enemies, with government helpless to rein them in and only their personal worldviews and consciences to dictate the terms of those relationships.', 'A message from G42:', 'The future of AI is being shaped by a complex web of global data regulations.

The two have publicly discussed a potential government role for Musk.', 'In recent days, Musk also offered splashy, $1 million daily sweepstakes for swing-state voters that has drawn scrutiny from the US Justice Department. Despite a warning from the Justice Department that the payments might be illegal, Musk’s super PAC awarded two $1 million prizes to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday.', 'This story has been updated with additional details.', 'CNN’s Sean Lyngaas, Jackie Wattles and Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.
