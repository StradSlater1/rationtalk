These patients also had at least one other underlying conditions like obesity or heart disease, and hadn’t used a diabetes drug in the past 6 months. The team compared semaglutide — in the form of Ozempic — with seven other diabetes medications like metformin, insulin, and liraglutide, which belongs to the same drug class as semaglutide. They found that Ozempic use was associated with a 40 to 70 percent lower risk of Alzheimer’s compared to the other drugs, with the most pronounced difference showing up between Ozempic and insulin. This correlation remained consistent across age, gender, and weight.', 'Those with type 2 diabetes are a high-risk group for Alzheimer’s disease. This study shows that while semaglutide treats the disease itself — that was what Ozempic’s first intended use was — it’s also associated with a dramatically reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The paper also notes that while the underlying mechanisms behind this association are still unknown, they could reflect semaglutide’s benefits on other risk factors for Alzheimer’s, including obesity and cardiovascular diseases.', 'This team isn’t the only one who’s onto semaglutide’s promise for potentially treating Alzheimer’s disease. Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, is also investigating semaglutide and Alzheimer’s. It’s currently conducting two phase 3 clinical trials comparing the drug to a placebo in over 3,000 people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment.

Although there is no cure for AD, several modifiable risk factors have been identified that can be targeted to reduce or delay the onset of both AD and dementia.', 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity.', 'In addition to these indications, semaglutide can also support the management of various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, depression, alcohol use, and smoking, all of which are also considered modifiable risk factors for AD. Thus, clinical trials are needed to assess whether semaglutide can delay or prevent AD.', 'The researchers of the current study hypothesized that semaglutide reduces the risk of developing AD in high-risk patients. To this end, an emulation target trial was conducted using the TriNetX Analytics platform based on real-world electronic health records (EHRs) of T2DM patients without a history of AD.', 'Seven target trials were emulated using 1,094,761 eligible patients from a nationwide database of U.S. patients. All study participants, both men and women, were 60 years of age or older.', 'None of the study participants used any antidiabetic medications within the past six months of the study commencement and were considered ‘new users.’  However, these patients received semaglutide prescriptions due to a history of hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, or stroke.', 'For every patient population, a specified trial was conducted to compare semaglutide with other drugs used to treat T2DM including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), insulins, metformin, sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and other GLP-1Ras.', 'Based on EHR data, the first-time diagnosis of AD was considered the primary outcome, whereas AD-related medication prescriptions, such as donepezil, lecanemab, rivastigmine, aducanumab, memantine, and galantamine, were considered secondary outcomes. Each outcome was separately analyzed.', 'The study cohort consisted of 17,104 new users of semaglutide and 1,077,657 new users of other antidiabetic medications. The effectiveness of semaglutide was compared with each of the studied antidiabetic medications.', 'Significant heterogeneity was observed between insulin and semaglutide recipients regarding ethnicity, age, sex, diagnosis of obesity, certain cardiovascular conditions, and AD-related risk factors. However, these groups were balanced after matching their propensity score.', 'T2DM patients who were prescribed semaglutide were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with AD during a three-year follow-up visit as compared with those prescribed other antidiabetic medications, irrespective of sex, gender, and obesity. The overall three-year risk of first-time AD diagnosis was almost two-fold higher in the general older population.', 'The three-year cumulative incidence curves comparing semaglutide with each antidiabetic medication indicated a divergence in the curve within 30 days that continued to separate thereafter. This finding highlights the role of semaglutide in delaying AD development with persistent effects.', 'Similarly, the subpopulation analysis indicated that semaglutide reduced the risk of first-time AD diagnosis as compared to other antidiabetic medication groups. The secondary outcomes analysis also indicated that semaglutide decreased AD-related medication prescriptions as compared to other antidiabetic medications in diabetic patients, with or without obesity.', 'Existing evidence suggests that GLP-1RAs like semaglutide may protect cognitive function by increasing authophagy and brain glucose uptake. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that semaglutide can reduce neurotoxicity by preventing the proliferation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles.', 'Clinical studies have produced similar results, with GLP-1RAs reducing cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM. In fact, one study conducted in Denmark found that patients with T2DM prescribed GLP-1RAs were at a 53% reduced risk of developing all-cause dementia.', 'Importantly, several other diabetic medications, including SGLT2i, may also reduce the risk of first-time AD diagnoses. SGLT2i, for example, reduces neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nevertheless, the current study reports that semaglutide was significantly more protective against AD than other anti-diabetic medications, including SGLT2i.', 'Despite these observations, additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms through which semaglutide reduces the risk of developing AD.', 'The current study has several limitations, including the retrospective observational study design that used patient EHRs. This study design may not consider overdiagnoses, underdiagnoses, misdiagnoses, and unmeasured or uncontrolled confounders, which could generate biased results.', 'Furthermore, since semaglutide received FDA approval relatively recently, the follow-up period was limited to only three years.', 'Patient data was obtained from the TriNetX Analytics platform; therefore, the results require additional validation in analytics platforms. EHRs in TriNetX lack data on medication adherence and cognitive impairment tracking, which may influence study outcomes.', 'Semaglutide prescription reduced the risk of a first-time AD diagnosis by 40-70% in older populations with T2DM and other comorbidities.', 'Future studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of this drug in other populations.

', 'Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, was associated with a 40% to 70% lower risk of a first-time Alzheimer’s diagnosis in patients with Type 2 diabetes compared with seven other diabetes medications. That includes insulin and older so-called GLP-1 drugs similar to Ozempic, the research said. ', 'Alzheimer’s disease is often diagnosed in the mild dementia stage, when a person has significant trouble with memory and thinking. Almost 7 million Americans have the condition, the fifth-leading cause of death for adults over 65, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. But the number of Alzheimer’s patients is projected to rise to almost 13 million in the U.S. by 2050. ', 'There are no cures for Alzheimer’s, only drugs that treat the symptoms of the disease or slow the progression of the condition in people at the early stages of it. But a potential preventive treatment such as semaglutide may prove even more useful, said lead study co-author Dr. Rong Xu, a biomedical informatics professor at Case Western Reserve University. ', 'That’s because by the time many patients are diagnosed with the disease, “it’s often too late for treatment,” Xu told CNBC. She added that many of the risk factors of Alzheimer’s, such as obesity, diabetes and smoking, are preventable and “modifiable.” ', 'The results add to mounting evidence that GLP-1s, a popular class of obesity and diabetes medications, may offer health benefits beyond promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar. That includes Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s weight loss injection Wegovy, and drugs from Eli Lilly\nthat work slightly differently. ', 'Novo Nordisk and rival Eli Lilly have been studying their drugs as potential treatments for chronic conditions such as sleep apnea and fatty liver disease. Novo Nordisk, which did not fund the new Case Western study, is also examining semaglutide in a late-stage study on Alzheimer’s patients. ', 'The new Case Western study released Thursday builds on other research released in July on a once-daily drug for diabetes and obesity called liraglutide, which Novo Nordisk sells under the brand names Saxenda and Victoza. In the liraglutide research, data from a midstage trial found that the drug may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease by protecting patients’ brains. ', 'In the study released Thursday, researchers from Case Western analyzed three years of electronic records of nearly 1 million U.S. patients with diabetes who did not have a prior Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The study was partly funded by the National Institutes of Health. ', 'The study compared semaglutide with seven different diabetes medications, including insulin and a drug called metformin. It also includes other GLP-1s, such as liraglutide and a medication from Eli Lilly called dulaglutide. ', 'Semaglutide was associated with a roughly 70% lower risk of first-time Alzheimer’s diagnosis compared with insulin, a nearly 60% lower risk compared with metformin and a 40% lower risk compared with other GLP-1s, according to the study. Semaglutide was also associated with significantly lower prescriptions for Alzheimer’s disease-related medications, the study said. ', 'Similar reductions in risks were seen across patients in the trial, regardless of their gender, age group and whether they had obesity. ', 'But the study has limitations since it relies on data from electronic health records. Xu called for more research, specifically clinical trials that randomly assign patients to receive semaglutide or other treatments, to confirm how much Ozempic and other GLP-1s can help prevent or delay Alzheimer’s disease. ', 'Xu and the team of researchers also plan to study whether GLP-1s can prevent Alzheimer’s in patients with obesity, but they want to wait one or two years for GLP-1s approved for weight loss to be on the market longer so there is more patient data for them to analyze. Wegovy won approval in the U.S. in 2021, while Eli Lilly’s weight loss injection Zepbound only entered the market last fall.', 'Got a confidential news tip?
