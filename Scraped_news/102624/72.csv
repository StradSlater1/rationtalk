Recent research suggests a “gut-first hypothesis” or a gut-brain connection in PD — a pathway that could mark a significant shift in how the neurodegenerative disorder is looked at, its diagnosis, its progression, and its treatment.', 'A recent study — ‘’Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Mucosal Damage (MD) and Subsequent Risk of Parkinson Disease’ — published in the JAMA Network Open found that a history of upper GI MD was associated with an increased risk of developing PD. The cohort study of 9,350 patients with no prior history of PD found that mucosal damage on upper endoscopy was associated with a 76% greater risk of a PD diagnosis.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

It afflicts about a million people in the US.', 'Bess’ lab specializes in studying the human microbiome—the community of trillions of microbes that live in your gut that are not genetically related to you. What Bess’ interdisciplinary team found is that the protein chunks that aggregate in the brain and lead to Parkinson’s appeared to form in the intestine as a result of the well-known E. coli bacteria, which resides in our gut.', 'The team found that waste produced by E. coli causes protein chunks—called alpha-synucleinaggregates—to form.', '“There’s evidence that these disease-causing protein clumps can travel from the gut to the brain along the vagus nerve that connects these organs,” Bess says.', '“So, if you can stop the aggregates from forming in the gut, there’s a chance that the proteins won’t reach the brain and cause Parkinson’s. And now that we know a way that these protein aggregates form, we can find ways to prevent their formation.”', 'Bess’ team, working with Penn State professor of electrical engineering Aida Ebrahimi, recently found that a component of coffee can prevent the protein aggregates from forming in intestinal cells.', '“Other studies have shown that drinking coffee decreases the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, and our findings shed light on how this could work,” says Bess, whose team’s findings are laying the groundwork for new treatments that target the proteins before they ever make it to the brain.', 'Now that the intestinal origins of the protein chunks are becoming clear, Bess and her team are planning to reveal the protein chunks’ journey in greater detail. In collaboration with professor of chemistry Jennifer Prescher, Bess’ team is tagging the proteins with bioluminescent molecules that emit light and are traceable as they move throughout the body.', '“We can track the protein from intestinal cells and see if it goes into neurons, which is the proposed mechanism for getting from gut to brain,” says Bess.', '“Clumps of alpha-synuclein are found in the gut many years before disease symptoms manifest, and so there’s a real window of opportunity for stopping these pathogen proteins from forming before they become more of a problem.”', 'The notion that a treatment for a disease like Parkinson’s that afflicts the brain may begin in the gut is a new one.', '“The idea that Parkinson’s disease can start in the gut is a bit weird in terms of the typical dogma for thinking about Parkinson’s disease,” says Bess.', '“But our research is charting a map for how this is possible. We hope our work will open new avenues for better treatments to help people with this disease.”', 'The research appears in ACS Chemical Neuroscience and in ACS Chemical Biology.', 'Funding for the research came from the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, and Scialog Grants sponsored jointly by Research Corporation for Science Advancement, the Frederick Gardner Cottrell Foundation, and the Paul G.

"Antibiotics, Antifungals May Slightly Raise Parkinson's Risk",https://www.miragenews.com/antibiotics-antifungals-may-slightly-raise-1342910/,"[""A Rutgers Health study has found that people who took multiple courses of penicillin antibiotics had a modestly lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease, a surprising finding that researchers say highlights the complex relationship between bacteria in the digestive tract and brain health."", ""The study, published in Parkinsonism & Related Disorders, analyzed medical records from more than 93,000 people in the United Kingdom. Researchers found that those who received five or more courses of penicillin antibiotics in the five years before diagnosis had about a 15% lower risk of Parkinson's compared with those who took no antibiotics."", '""We found an inverse dose-response relationship between number of penicillin courses and Parkinson\'s disease risk across multiple durations,"" said Gian Pal, a neurologist at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and lead author of the study. ""This was unexpected and contrasts with some prior studies.""', ""The findings add to increasing evidence that the trillions of microbes living in the human digestive tract may play a role in Parkinson's disease, a progressive brain disorder that affects movement and balance. Some researchers believe inflammation or toxins from certain gut bacteria could contribute to the disease's development."", '""There\'s an idea that the disease starts in the gut and that inflammation in the gut can make the gut more leaky and allow toxins or inflammation to ascend to the brain through the vagus nerve,"" Pal said.', ""To investigate potential links between gut bacteria and Parkinson's, the researchers examined anonymized medical records from a large U.K. database. They compared 12,557 people diagnosed with Parkinson's to 80,804 similar individuals without the disease."", ""In addition to the reduced risk associated with penicillin use, the study found people who took two or more courses of antifungal medications in the five years before diagnosis had about a 16% higher risk of Parkinson's. This aligned with findings from a previous Finnish study."", 'However, Pal said the associations were relatively small and should not influence medical decisions.', '""These are all very mild, so it should not influence decisions about when to use antibiotics or antifungals,"" he said.

While its exact causes remain unclear, researchers believe a combination of genetic and environmental factors produce the disease.
