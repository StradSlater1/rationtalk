"Iran, weakened by attacks on its allies, braces for Israeli strikes",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/20/iran-waits-israel-strikes/,"['Israel plans to strike Iran in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack this month. Iranians fear the response will destabilize the economy and stir unrest.', 'In the weeks since Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel — and as Tehran awaits an Israeli response — pro-government media have run wall-to-wall coverage promoting Iranian military might.', 'State television has played footage of missiles soaring over Israeli cities, while hard-line newspapers have warned of a “doomsday scenario” if Israel strikes back.', 'Despite official efforts to project strength, however, the depth of the crisis for Iran is clear: Israel is crushing Tehran’s allies in the region, making it more vulnerable to attack. And while the United States has sought to limit the scope of Israel’s response, the strikes could destabilize Iran’s fragile economy, stir divisions among government opponents and undercut hopes that the country’s new, pro-reform president would usher in an era of engagement with the West.', '“We have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said during a visit to Baghdad last week, part of a whirlwind diplomatic tour across the Middle East to shore up support ahead of the strikes. “We are not afraid of war, we are ready for war, but at the same time we don’t want war,” he told reporters at a news conference with his Iraqi counterpart.', 'Follow World news', 'Iran’s leaders view Israel as increasingly unrestrained, analysts say, as it barrels through the region, ignoring pleas by the Biden administration to scale back the bombing and protect civilians in places such as Gaza and Beirut. In the past few months, Israeli intelligence and military forces have assassinated the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, invaded southern Lebanon, and sent more troops into the Gaza Strip, where they have recently laid siege to the Jabalya refugee camp in the north.', '“They have come to the conclusion that Israel wants to eliminate all of its threats,” Vali Nasr, a Middle East expert and senior professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said of the leadership in Tehran. “That includes Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.”', 'Iran attacked Israel on Oct. 1 as retaliation for the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July and Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah in Beirut last month. The strike on Nasrallah also killed a general from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Abbas Nilforoushan.', 'Iran fired around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, and at least two dozen munitions broke through the country’s air defenses, according to a Washington Post analysis. It was the second time Iran attacked Israel directly, after it fired off hundreds of missiles and drones in April. That attack was retaliation for an Israeli strike that killed two senior Iranian commanders at Iran’s consulate in Damascus.', 'Israel has not said how or when it will respond to the latest missile volley. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United States earlier this month that he would avoid hitting Iranian nuclear sites and oil facilities, officials said.', 'On Saturday, Israel said a drone launched from Lebanon “targeted” Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea in the north, although there was no damage and neither he nor his wife were there. Netanyahu, in a statement, characterized the incident as an “attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife,” calling it “a grave mistake.”', 'President Joe Biden said Friday that he knew when and how Israel would attack but declined to elaborate as he spoke with reporters during a visit to Germany. He said Israel’s killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in Gaza on Wednesday was an opportunity to “deal with Israel and Iran in a way that ends the conflict for a while ... that stops the back and forth.”', 'Still, an aerial bombardment of targets in Iran could damage critical infrastructure and further harm the country’s struggling economy. Already, there are long lines at gas stations in the capital. Some residents say they are stocking up on food, and dozens of domestic flights have been canceled in anticipation of an attack.', '“This is a wave of crisis like all the previous ones. Many people like myself have gotten numb as a result of years and years of crisis and don’t necessarily panic anymore,” said Masoud, a 42-year-old small-business owner from Rasht, in northern Iran. Like other Iranians interviewed, he spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his first name, for fear of reprisal by authorities.', 'But unlike previous times of increased tensions, civil unrest and economic crisis, he said, this time he’s concerned about greater economic fallout. He fears that the Iranian regime will be directly targeted by Israel, threatening people who depend on the government for their livelihoods.', 'Decades of U.S. sanctions, corruption and mismanagement have hobbled Iran’s economy, which remains highly dependent on oil exports. For ordinary Iranians, unemployment, soaring inflation and a weak currency have eroded standards of living.', 'Even if Israel avoided strikes on oil production facilities, it could target Iran’s refineries, analysts say.', '“And that would potentially be something to hit in order to disrupt the domestic situation in Iran,” Colby Connelly, director of the economics and energy program at the Middle East Institute, said. “Maybe resulting in fuel shortages, you know, seemingly geared toward domestic instability.”', 'In recent years, Iran has seen waves of anti-government protests, including unrest that erupted in 2019 after authorities abruptly cut fuel subsidies, raising the price of gas virtually overnight.', 'In 2022, the death of a young woman in police custody set off a months-long nationwide uprising. More than 500 people were killed, according to the United Nations, and thousands more were arrested.', '“No foreign attack can harm the Iranian people more than” the government has, said Babak, a 28-year old from Tehran.', 'Among opponents of the Iranian government, the prospect of Israeli strikes has triggered debate over whether to support the attack. Some Iranians, like Babak, say they hope a military strike will facilitate the downfall of the country’s leadership, while others warn that supporting Israel is dangerous and that any escalation will bring more suffering to Iran’s population.', '“I know that it takes time, I know that everybody wants them gone right now, I want them gone yesterday,” Hamed Esmaeilion, an Iranian activist who now lives in Canada, said of the government.', 'His wife and daughter were killed in 2020 when the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a civilian airliner shortly after it took off from the airport in Tehran. He said he understands why some people are tempted to support a foreign attack on Iran, but he fears a darker future for the country if people seek political change through force.', '“In a war, innocent people die, infrastructure is damaged,” Esmaeilion said, adding that recent conflicts in the region have not ushered in societies that are more open or democratic. “If they overthrow the regime, what is the replacement? It could be more repression.”', 'At the same time, those who support President Masoud Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, are worried that tensions with Israel, a key ally of the United States, will torpedo his administration’s early outreach to Western nations after years of isolation.', 'Arash, a 38-year-old engineer in Tehran, said the president’s supporters are disappointed but understand that he took office at a difficult time for the country. He was voted in after his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, died in a helicopter crash.', 'Then, on the day he was inaugurated, Hamas’s Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran.', '“We are going through one of the hardest years ever,” Arash said. He added that this round of escalation between Iran and Israel appears more critical than in the spring.', '“This time seems much more serious,” he said. “And now, more or less, everyone is thinking about war at the back of their minds.”', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

A day before the attacks, Israel had used intermediaries to warn Iran about them, to make sure they wouldn’t cause massive casualties, Mostafa Najafi, a security expert in Tehran with connections to the regime’s elites, told me. He said the attacks weren’t “as vast and painful as Israeli officials had claimed” they would be. Israel did not target Iran’s infrastructure, such as its oil and gas refineries, nor did it assassinate political or military leaders.', 'Because of this, Iran has an opportunity to call it quits by giving a weak enough response that wouldn’t invite Israeli retaliation.

Iran insisted the strikes caused only “limited damage,” and Iranian state-run media downplayed them. Taken together, the moves suggested at least for now that both countries are trying to avoid a more serious escalation.', 'Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel.', 'Following the airstrikes, Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying it “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran has “no limits” in defending its interests and called for the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israel for the attacks.', 'But late Saturday, Iran’s military issued a carefully worded statement suggesting any cease-fire in Israel’s ground offensives in Gaza and Lebanon would trump any possible retaliatory strike.', 'Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency said four people were killed, all with the military air defense. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. But the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees Iran’s vast ballistic missile arsenal, was silent, raising questions about whether anything had been hit at its bases.', 'Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a statement posted to X, gave his condolences to the families of the dead and warned against future attacks.', '“Enemies of Iran should know these brave people are standing fearlessly in defense of their land and will respond to any stupidity with tact and intelligence,” he wrote.', 'U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like “they didn’t hit anything but military targets.” His administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations.

The targets included Iran’s air defences, as well as missile and drone production, and launch facilities.', 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant followed the operation from the IDF’s command and control centre in Tel Aviv.', 'The strikes came in several waves, over a three-hour period. Just after 06:00 (03:00 GMT), the IDF said the strikes had concluded.', 'The White House described the strikes as an “exercise of self-defence”. A senior administration official said the US had worked with Israel to encourage a ""targeted and proportional"" response.', 'The extent of the attacks - and the damage caused - remains unclear at this stage.', 'The IDF said it hit around 20 targets, including missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air-missiles and other military sites.', 'The Iranian military confirmed that two soldiers had died “while battling projectiles”.', 'Iranian authorities said sites in Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces were targeted. The country’s air defence said it had “successfully intercepted” the attacks, but that “some areas sustained limited damage”.', 'BBC Verify has identified damage at a defence ministry base to the east of Tehran, and at an air defence base to the south.', 'A senior US administration official said the attacks did not damage Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear facilities, targets President Joe Biden had urged Israel not to hit.', 'Syrian state media also reported strikes on military sites in central and southern Syria, though Israel has not confirmed striking the country.', 'Iran is the primary backer of a range of groups across the Middle East - often described as proxy groups - that are hostile to Israel, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which Israel is currently at war with.', 'In April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel, with about 300 missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli air strike on an Iranian embassy compound in Syria that killed several top commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).', 'Israel responded with a “limited” strike on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan, which Iran chose not to respond to.', 'Later, in July, Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on Beirut. The next day, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel, though Israel did not comment.', 'In late September, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig-Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, a high-ranking Iranian official, in Beirut.', 'On October 1, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, which it said was in response to the deaths of Haniyeh, Nasrallah and Nilforoushan.', ""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied a report by US outlet Axios that prior to the attacks, Israel sent Iran a message revealing certain details about the strikes, and warning Tehran not to respond."", '""Israel did not inform Iran before the attack - not about the time, not about the targets, not about the strength of the attack,"" the prime minister\'s spokesperson said.', 'Still, early signs indicate this attack was not as serious as some had feared.', 'The IDF said in a statement that ""we are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.

"Though limited, Israel’s highly successful attack leaves Iran more vulnerable than ever",https://www.timesofisrael.com/though-limited-israels-highly-successful-attack-leaves-iran-more-vulnerable-than-ever/,"['ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 387', '', 'Israeli officials aren’t speaking much about the airstrikes in Iran on early Saturday morning, but that shouldn’t detract from the significance of the operation.', 'It seems to have gone off exactly as planned, with no losses on the Israeli side. That in and of itself is a major accomplishment.', 'The risks inherent in operations 1,600 kilometers from Israeli airspace are daunting. A minor complication can turn into a life-and-death challenge.', 'The strikes were planned with the assumption that the fighter jets would be able to refuel near Iran. But if a small component in the refuel system malfunctions, or a plane’s engine fails, a pilot would face a dangerous landing in likely enemy territory. Almost all the support and emergency capabilities the Israeli Air Force can bring to bear in operations over Gaza and Lebanon would be irrelevant so far from the country’s border.', 'As far as we know, however, no significant malfunctions took place, a testament not only to the skill of Israel’s pilots, but also to the professionalism of IAF maintenance and support personnel.', 'Instead, Israel was able to get dozens of planes close enough to Iran to launch precision munitions at military targets in several waves.', 'Iran knew for weeks an attack was coming, and might even have been tipped off indirectly by Israel about the timing of the strikes. Yet it could do nothing to stop Israeli jets from carrying out their operation deliberately and systematically.', 'Now Iran — and its gas and nuclear facilities — are more vulnerable than ever. The regime’s most advanced anti-aircraft systems were destroyed, and replacing them — if Russia is even willing or able to do so — will not happen immediately. Its air defenses, which were ineffective on Saturday, are now even less capable with batteries and radars destroyed.', 'On top of the disabling of its air defenses — systems in which Iran has poured significant investment — the Islamic Republic has also lost its chief deterrent against Israel. After weeks of devastating strikes against its leaders and Israeli ground troops operating in force in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is able to fire a couple hundred rockets at Israel a day, but that’s it. It has lost the ability to do anything that alters Israel’s decision-making about strikes on Iran. Longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed, and Israeli jets struck Iran directly, yet normal daily life goes on in most of Israel.', 'The Israeli strike may have been somewhat limited in terms of the actual damage it caused, but the message to frail Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is what matters: Israel can reach strategic sites in Iran and can hit what it wants, while Tehran lacks the ability to get in the way.', 'This time it was military sites, but Iranian leaders have to be asking themselves how much more it would take for Israel to focus on targets with higher strategic value — oil facilities, symbols of the regime, and of course, the nuclear program.', 'And things could get even worse for Tehran. The Joe Biden/Kamala Harris White House has worked hard to limit Israel’s retaliation against Iran’s two missile attacks this year out of fear of escalation into a regional war that could suck in the US. Iran also faced no risk of Biden ordering a US strike on Iranian soil.', 'Much to Iran’s chagrin, there is a real chance Donald Trump could be back in power by January. The return of the unpredictable president who ordered the elimination of the notorious head of the IRGC’s Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, and who replaced the 2015 nuclear deal with a maximum pressure strategy, combined with Israel’s newly aggressive posture against the Iranian axis, is a dangerous scenario for Tehran.', 'That doesn’t mean Iran won’t respond to Saturday’s attack. It is sensitive to appearing weak in front of its restive population and its proxy network. And Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal is large and can cause damage to Israel even if most of what it fires gets intercepted by Israel and its allies. Israelis are in no mood to have massive Iranian attacks become something they have to get used to, even if the damage so far has been relatively small.', 'And there remains the ever-pressing question of Iran’s nuclear program. With pressure growing on the regime, and a growing sense of vulnerability, could this be the scenario that pushes Khamenei to order an all-out drive to build a nuclear weapon and present a powerful new deterrent against Israel and the US?', 'That is certainly possible. But after Saturday’s strike, it is also now more likely that Israel will feel it has the capacity — and the imperative — to cause meaningful damage to that program with a new series of attacks.', '', 'Are you relying on The Times of Israel for accurate and timely coverage right now?

Washington fears a cycle of escalation, particularly in the last two weeks before the US presidential election.', 'Israel is already fighting on multiple fronts. In Lebanon on Wednesday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Hashem Safieddine, who was expected to be Nasrallah’s successor. Israel claimed Safieddine had been killed in an airstrike earlier this month, alongside Ali Hussein Hazima, the head of Hezbollah’s intelligence unit.', 'In the statement, Hezbollah said Safieddine spent most of his life serving the movement and that he “competently managed” the executive council – the highest political decision-making body in Hezbollah. The group pledged to carry on in “that path of resistance and jihad”.', 'The death of Safieddine, the most senior Hezbollah official killed since the killing of Nasrallah, throws the leadership of the group further into question. The current de facto public face of the group is Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary general, but he has not yet been picked as its permanent leader. Despite most of its senior military command and top political leaders having been killed by Israel over the past three months, Hezbollah has said the organisation retains its ability to fight Israel.', 'Israel carried out airstrikes on Wednesday in Tyre, one of the largest cities in southern Lebanon, which had become a refuge over the past year for thousands of families displaced by fighting further south. Videos showed large plumes of smoke billowing between residential buildings in the centre of the city.', '“We’re sitting here terrified. The strikes are near us, the sounds are just next to us. We’re horrified,” said Rita Darwish, a woman who had been displaced to Tyre from Dhayra, a border village, a year earlier. She added that she would flee Tyre “at the first chance” once the bombing stopped.', 'The strikes on central Tyra, a Unesco-listed port city, were part of Israel’s expanding military campaign in Lebanon that had escalated in the last week. Parts of greater Beirut that had not been hit before, as well as Tyre and Nabatieh, another large city in the south, were now included in Israel’s attacks.', 'On Tuesday, Hezbollah announced it had carried out 39 operations against Israel, including the downing of two drones, striking six tanks and targeting 19 groups of Israeli soldiers. Fighting continued on Wednesday, with Hezbollah bombing Israeli soldiers in the towns of Odaisseh and Rab Thalatheen in south Lebanon.', 'The number of strikes carried out each day by the Islamist militant group has significantly increased in recent weeks, with it announcing it had entered into a “escalatory phase” of war against Israel. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the holiday residence of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the coastal city of Caesarea on Saturday. Netanyahu was not present at the time of the attack.', 'On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of “military affiliation” to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.', 'The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reacted with scepticism, saying that “Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence”.', '“After killing Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail Al Ghoul in July, the IDF previously produced a similar document, which contained contradictory information, showing that Al Ghoul, born in 1997, received a Hamas military ranking in 2007 – when he would have been 10 years old,” the NGO said in a statement on X.', 'In the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, the IDF continued to round up Palestinian men as it sought to end resistance in the area, more than a year after the Gaza war began. An IDF statement said at least 150 men had surrendered and had been detained. The UN estimates that over the past two weeks, about 60,000 people have fled from the north of Gaza to the southern end of the coastal strip in the face of Israeli evacuation orders, military strikes and dire shortages of food, water and medicines.']"

Iran mocks Israel’s ‘weak’ attacks as hardliners call for reprisal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/iran-mocks-israel-attacks-weak-hardliners-reprisal,"['Political elite under pressure from variety of sources, with US urging Iran to step back from the brink', 'The Iranian government has belittled the scale and effectiveness of the Israeli attack on its military sites, but hardliners in the parliament insisted the strikes breached Iranian red lines and required a swift response, preferably at a time when Israel is already enmeshed in Lebanon and Gaza.', 'The internal Iranian debate on how to respond to the long-awaited Israeli attack turns on whether to treat Israel’s breach of Iranian national sovereignty as too grave to be ignored, or instead to heed the advice coming from the region and from the US to acknowledge the relatively limited nature of the attack and to step back from the brink by not launching reprisals.', 'In making its decision, the Iranian political elite will have to weigh conflicting political, diplomatic and military pressures. But the initial tone from the government was one of patriotic pride at the performance of the air defences, rather than calls for immediate retribution. Some even claimed that the air defences proved better than Israel’s Iron Dome.', 'In what amounted to a holding statement, the foreign ministry condemned the attack, adding: “Iran feels entitled and obliged to defend itself against foreign acts of aggression.”', 'The Iranian government spokesperson, Fatemeh Mohajerani, said that “only limited damage has been done”, and that the pride of Iranians had been strengthened by their response to the attacks.', 'But an internal political debate has already started on how to respond which is likely to replicate differences inside the political elite that have been evident ever since Iran surprisingly elected the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian as president, partly on a ticket to improve relations with the west.', 'Amir-Hossein Sabeti, the ultra-conservative MP for Tehran, said on X: “Stable security depends on authority and a strong response to the smallest mistake of the enemy. Although the mountain of the Israelis gave birth to a mouse, the violation of Iran’s red line and the invasion of the country’s territory must be answered at a level that will surprise them.', '“The best time to respond is when they are engaged in an attritional war in Gaza and Beirut.”', 'On social media there were calls for Operation True Promise 3, a reference to the code name given to Iran’s first two attacks on Israel.', 'By contrast, the former Tehran University professor Sadegh Zibakalam said: “Israel’s early morning air attack on Iran was more than a military achievement for Tel Aviv, it was a diplomatic success for Washington, which was able to force Netanyahu strictly to limit the attack so that Iran does not have to retaliate. Americans have shown for the umpteenth time they do not want war with Iran.”', 'Many ridiculed Israel’s attack as weak, after the preceding week’s threats to attack Iran’s oil and nuclear sites. Ebrahim Rezaei, a member of the parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, wrote in the first minutes after the attack on X: “I entered Tehran through Mehrabad airport a few minutes ago and passed through a number of streets, I did not see anything unusual. The Zionist enemy is like small change, it only makes noise but has no value or effect. They are too weak to seriously harm Great Iran.”', 'Hesamoddin Ashena, an adviser to Iran’s former president Hassan Rouhani, wrote: “You played with the lion’s tail. This is not Palestine, nor Lebanon, Iraq, nor Afghanistan. This is Iran.”', 'Some of the big military and political players in Iran have yet to make statements.', 'Diplomatically, the Iranian foreign ministry will also be listening to the advice from the region, especially from Saudi Arabia, with which it is trying to rebuild ties.', 'Iran will be pleased with the messages of solidarity from across the Gulf including Oman, Riyadh, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, signs that the country’s recent diplomatic push in the region has paid dividends. Such public displays of solidarity are not automatic between Iran and its Arab neighbours.', 'Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, reflected widespread sentiment, saying: “We are very concerned by the flagrant violation of aggression on Iran this morning. Thankfully, the damage appears limited and we dearly hope there are no casualties.', '“It’s time for the world to wake up to the urgent need to address the root causes of this crisis, above all Israel’s illegal and brutal occupation of Palestinian lands.”', 'The Jordanian army stressed that it had not allowed Israel to use its airspace. Some of this Arab support, however, is likely to be contingent on Iran not escalating the crisis. It was noticeable that neither Saudi nor the UAE named Israel in their condemnatory statements.', 'Hardliners in Tehran in turn will be asking what this show of regional solidarity represents in practice, and whether Iran’s best route to security remains, as they have always insisted, in restoring the battered “axis of resistance”.', 'On the military side, daybreak allowed Iran and open source experts to survey the scale of the damage, including the death of two Iranian army soldiers, even if the government ordered Iranians not to upload pictures.', 'Sign up to Headlines US', 'Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning', '', 'The fact that Tehran returned to normality within hours, with schools opening, traffic jams resuming and the stock market rising, raises the bar for those calling for military reprisals.', 'Military analysts appear to feel that Iran’s air defences outperformed expectations.', 'Iran’s own assessment of its air defences is at odds with Israel’s claims that it operated in the skies above Iran with near impunity.', 'Shahabeddin Tabatabaei, a reformist member of the information council of the Iranian government, wrote in his account on X: “The fake regime’s attack was defeated by the country’s integrated air defence system.”', 'But Iran knows that another attack on Israel will lead to recently installed US defences being engaged, and there is no guarantee that America would sit out a further Israel response to an Iranian attack, taking the world closer to a direct Iranian-US conflict, probably the penultimate rung on the escalatory ladder before a full-scale regional war.', 'Moreover, the chain of responsibility, from Iran’s perspective, started with an Israeli bombing on 1 April on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps officers. Iran responded with Operation True Promise 1 on 13 April, a highly signalled attack using drones and missiles.', 'Israel retaliated on 19 April, with limited airstrikes on an air defence radar close to a nuclear site in Iran.', 'Subsequently, the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on 31 July, and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Beirut on 27 September along with the IRGC deputy commander of operations, Abbas Nilforoushan.', 'This led to Iran’s response on 1 October, labelled Operation True Promise 2, in which about 200 ballistic missiles were fired at Israel. On this sequencing, Iran feels entitled to respond to restore deterrence.', 'Pezeshkian feels personally burnt, as the government chose in August not to respond militarily after Haniyeh’s assassination because of assurances given indirectly by the US that the peace talks in Gaza were two weeks from a breakthrough. Subsequently, the US was unable to deliver Israel’s backing for the ceasefire.', 'So, further western promises that diplomats are on the cusp of a breakthrough, either in Lebanon or Gaza, will be viewed sceptically in Tehran.', 'Talks about a Gaza ceasefire are due to restart on Sunday and there are some signs that the Israeli army may want a break in Lebanon. If Iran in this context did decide to call it quits with Israel on this third and most dangerous front then no one would be happier than the White House. Some faith would be restored in its ability to de-escalate events. But at present such a pre-election hail mary seems unlikely.']"

Bowen: Iran faces hard choices between risks of escalation or looking weak,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2742rynqgo,"['Israel’s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors.', 'They must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens.', 'At the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel’s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States.', 'In the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran’s Islamic regime.', 'Iran’s official media in the hours before and after Israel’s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel’s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back.', 'That is the hope of Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America’s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence.', '""I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,” he said. ""I\'m equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond.""', 'Iran’s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey’s NTV network that ""any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.”', 'Hours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: ""Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force."" It was, he said, ""highly misleading and baseless"" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack.', 'As the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran’s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence ""as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter"". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.', 'Israel has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel.', 'That did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies.', 'The men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called ""axis of resistance"" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes.', 'Six months into the war, Israel’s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action.', 'When that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran’s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices.', 'Israel interpreted Iran’s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden’s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel.', 'On 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).', 'The Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden’s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel’s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan.', 'Biden apparently asked Israel to ""take the win"" hoping that might stop what had become the most dangerous moment in the widening Middle East war. When Israel confined its response to a strike on an air defence site, Biden’s plan seemed to be working.', 'But since the summer, Israel has repeatedly escalated the war with Iran and its axis of allies and proxies. The biggest blows were landed in a major offensive against Iran’s most important ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran had spent years building up Hezbollah’s arsenal of weapons as a key part of its forward defence. The idea was an Israeli attack on Iran would be deterred by the knowledge that Hezbollah would hammer Israel from just over the border in Lebanon.', 'But Israel moved first, implementing plans it had developed since Hezbollah fought it to a standstill in the 2006 war. It blew up booby trapped pagers and walkie talkies it had deceived Hezbollah into buying, invaded south Lebanon and killed Hezbollah’s leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah, a man who had been a symbol of defiant resistance to Israel for decades. The authorities in Beirut say that Israel’s offensive in Lebanon has so far killed more than 2,500 people, displaced more than 1.2 million and caused enormous damage to a country already on its knees after its economy largely collapsed.', 'Hezbollah is still fighting and killing Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon and firing large numbers of rockets. But it is reeling after losing its leader and much of its arsenal.', 'Faced with the near collapse of its strategy, Iran concluded it had to hit back. Allowing its allies to fight and die without responding would destroy its position as the leader of the anti-Israeli and anti-western forces in the region. Its answer was a much bigger ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October.', 'The airstrikes on Friday 25 October were Israel’s response. They took longer to come than many expected. Leaks of Israeli plans could have been a factor.', 'Israel is also carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk has called it the darkest moment of Gaza’s war, with the Israeli military subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and the risk of starvation.', 'It’s impossible for an outsider to know whether the timing of Israel’s attacks on Iran was designed to draw international attention away from northern Gaza. But it might have been part of the calculation.', 'It is hard to stop successive rounds of strikes and counter strikes when the countries concerned believe they will be seen as weak, and deterred, if they don’t respond. That is how wars spin out of control.', 'The question now is whether Iran is prepared to give Israel the last word, at least on this stage of the war. President Biden backed Israel’s decision to retaliate after 1 October. But once again he tried to head off an even deadlier escalation, telling Israel publicly not to bomb Iran’s most important assets, its nuclear, oil and gas installations. He augmented Israel’s defences by deploying the THAAD anti-missile system to Israel, and prime minister Netanyahu agreed to take his advice.', 'The American elections on 5 November are part of both Israel and Iran’s calculations about what happens next. If Donald Trump gets his second term, he might be less concerned than Biden about answering Iranian retaliation, if it happens, with strikes on nuclear, oil and gas facilities.', 'Once again, the Middle East is waiting. Israel’s decision not to hit Iran’s most valuable assets might, perhaps, give Tehran the chance to postpone a response, at least long enough for diplomats to do their work. At the UN General Assembly last month, the Iranians were suggesting that they were open to a new round of nuclear negotiations.', 'All this should matter greatly to the world outside the Middle East. Iran has always denied it wants a nuclear bomb. But its nuclear expertise and enrichment of uranium have put a weapon within its reach. Its leaders must be looking for a new way to deter their enemies. Developing a nuclear warhead for their ballistic missiles might be on their agenda.', 'Israel has carried out its first ever air strike on Iran, following weeks of speculation.', 'Israel has launched air strikes on Iran, with blasts heard in the capital Tehran.', 'Israel says it has conducted ""precise strikes on military targets"" in Iran.', 'Scant information about the strikes indicate Israel could have reined in some of its more ambitious plans to cause Iran pain.', 'Rear Adm Daniel Hagari says the strikes are in response to Iran ""relentlessly attacking"" Israel.', 'Copyright 2024 BBC.
