He has covered national and local politics for over 20 years and spent seven years as editor-in-chief of the Washingtonian. His Capital City column chronicles the inside conversations and big trends shaping Washington politics.', 'There is nothing quite so frustrating as an act of cowardice presented as an act of principle.', 'That’s the essence of the short statement today authored by Will Lewis, the publisher of The Washington Post. According to Lewis, the paper is not making an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race in order to make a brave declaration about its independence. “We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader,” Lewis wrote. “We also see it as a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds,” he added.', 'Lewis, a former Rupert Murdoch associate hired less than a year ago by Post owner Jeff Bezos, picked an awfully convenient moment to embrace readers’ decision-making.', 'Over the course of his tenure, the Post ‘s editorial page has shown little hesitation about helping its readers decide about important things: It wants them to support Democrat Angela Alsobrooks for Senate. It wants them to support Democrat Eugene Vindman for the House of Representatives. It wants them to support a District of Columbia ballot measure called Initiative 83, which involves ranked choice voting and semi-open primaries. It has even told readers when and where to tip at restaurants.', 'Befitting a high-quality editorial page, the endorsements tend to be nuanced and thoughtful, a useful rundown of the issues even for those who might see things the other way.', 'But now, all of a sudden, Lewis is saying that venerable Post principles require the editorial page to stay mum on the highest-profile debate in the country?', 'According to a Columbia Journalism Review report, editorial page editor David Shipley signed off on an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris only to have Lewis kill it.', 'If nothing else, Lewis got religion at an awkward stage in the process: It comes 11 days before a presidential election and right at a moment many Democrats worry that the momentum has shifted to former President Donald Trump, the same candidate who has sought to mess up the federal contracts of detractors — a population that includes Bezos, since Amazon’s data centers do huge business. Amazon previously accused Trump of costing it $10 billion via a vendetta against a Pentagon contract during his presidency.', 'The news also comes days after a similar decision by another plutocrat-owned paper, the Los Angeles Times. There, owner Patrick Soon-Shiong intervened to block publication of an endorsement of Harris, whom the paper has supported in the past. Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong — whose fortune comes from the highly regulated medical-product industry — has non-journalistic reasons to worry about being at war with the federal government.', 'At the Post, too, it’s hard to imagine something as important as a presidential endorsement happening without an owner’s input.', 'That’s where the decision feels like a gut punch. The endorsement itself is not so important: I bet there aren’t many subscribers to high-end American newspapers who are still uncertain about how they’ll vote next month. But as a sign of how elite institutions grapple with a political environment in which one side has vowed retribution against enemies, it feels like a big warning sign, one that Lewis’ terse statement is not doing anything to chill.', 'For years, people have thought of billionaires as terrific newspaper owners because they can afford the risks of the modern media economy. Yet it turns out that even the richest among them, like Bezos, have points where they are vulnerable to unscrupulous government power. Retaining public trust is going to mean explaining how they’ve insulated journalistic decisions from those pressures — something utterly missing from Lewis’ statement.', 'In Los Angeles, the abrupt decision not to endorse led to a spate of resignations and a swift backlash. Within a few hours of the Post’s decision, which was announced at a tense internal meeting, one prominent editorial page voice, Robert Kagan, had quit. I’m sure there will be others. In an email to opinion staff just before Lewis’ statement went live, Shipley asked staff to “read it and digest it” and promised a town hall meeting to discuss.', 'The reaction from institutional loyalists outside the house has also been withering. “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty,” the legendary former Post editor Martin Baron wrote on X. “@realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others). Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.”', 'This kind of backlash strikes me as particularly dangerous for the Post, which has suffered financial setbacks and where Lewis was brought in to build back its subscription base. Earlier in Bezos’ ownership, the paper adopted a swaggering, righteous slogan: “Democracy dies in darkness.” A chest-beating motto, though, can make an institution look especially craven and hypocritical when it acts weak. Lewis’ non-endorsement statement would look a lot better without a macho refrain a few inches away.', 'The weird thing is, there’s a solid argument that presidential endorsements aren’t very useful to anyone. It’s hard to imagine that many people would have their minds changed if the Post, as it has for 32 years, endorsed the Democratic candidate. Especially since most people started consuming media online, where readers can’t tell whether they’re looking at the editorial page or the news section, institutional endorsements have been a point of confusion, something that irks straight-news reporters on the other side of the Chinese wall.', 'A lot of publications, including this one, don’t do endorsements at all.', 'And if the Post had wanted to join that list, it would have been fine. Six months or a year ago. With lots of groundwork-laying in advance and perhaps an opportunity for a less rushed statement of principles from the new publisher. But the timing of this stinks — a self-inflicted wound at best, and something a lot more sinister at worst.', 'The Post did not respond to a detailed request for comment.', 'No matter who wins the election — but especially if it is Trump, with his vows of retribution and his history of norm-busting — we’re entering another period where the institutions of a free society are going to be tested: courts, bureaucracies, advocacy groups, law enforcement and news media. During the Trump presidency, a lot of the same institutions embraced their role as guardrails of democracy. But there’s no reason it would have to be that way a second time. I’ve written before that Washington’s psychology may look a lot different in a second Trump era, motivating many former stalwarts to turn turtle.', 'If that’s what happened at the Post, it’s a pretty grim first whiff of what may lie ahead.', '', '© 2024 POLITICO LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Nor in any future presidential election. We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.', 'As our Editorial Board wrote in 1960:', '“The Washington Post has not ‘endorsed’ either candidate in the presidential campaign. That is in our tradition and accords with our action in five of the last six elections. The unusual circumstances of the 1952 election led us to make an exception when we endorsed General Eisenhower prior to the nominating conventions and reiterated our endorsement during the campaign. In the light of hindsight we retain the view that the arguments for his nomination and election were compelling. But hindsight also has convinced us that it might have been wiser for an independent newspaper in the Nation’s Capital to have avoided formal endorsement.”', 'The Editorial Board made two other points — ahead of an election that John F. Kennedy won — that will resonate with readers today:', '“The election of 1960 is certainly as important as any held in this century. This newspaper is in no sense noncommittal about the challenges that face the country. As our readers will be aware, we have attempted to make clear in editorials our conviction that most of the time one of the two candidates has shown a deeper understanding of the issues and a larger capacity for leadership.”', 'However, it concluded:', '“We nevertheless adhere to our tradition of non-endorsement in this presidential election. We have said and will continue to say, as reasonably and candidly as we know how, what we believe about the emerging issues of the campaign. We have sought to arrive at our opinions as fairly as possible, with the guidance of our own principles of independence but free of commitment to any party or candidate.”', 'And again in 1972, the Editorial Board posed and then answered this critical question ahead of an election which President Richard M. Nixon won: “In talking about the choice of a President of the United States, what is a newspaper’s proper role? … Our own answer is that we are, as our masthead proclaims, an independent newspaper, and that with one exception (our support of President Eisenhower in 1952), it has not been our tradition to bestow formal endorsement upon presidential candidates. We can think of no reason to depart from that tradition this year.”', 'Follow Opinions on the news', 'That was strong reasoning, but in 1976 for understandable reasons at the time, we changed this long-standing policy and endorsed Jimmy Carter as president. But we had it right before that, and this is what we are going back to.', 'We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects. We also see it as a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions — whom to vote for as the next president.', 'Our job at The Washington Post is to provide through the newsroom nonpartisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds.', 'Most of all, our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent.', 'And that is what we are and will be.', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

We endorsed in the presidential race (Kamala Harris) and we’ve endorsed in contested state and local races.', 'The presidential endorsement is the one I struggle with. With other races, our endorsements are sources people use to make up their minds.

But the theme that struck me was about responsibility. The texters told me that we are an important institution, a much-needed independent voice in partisan time. They take pride in their support of us and our principles. To not endorse, they felt, would be a betrayal. Or cowardice.', 'That was enough for me. Our duty is to the readers.', 'We still have occasions when we don’t endorse. We did not in the Issue 1 abortion amendment last November. Abortion is the most divisive issue in the country, one for which people are entrenched. (Well, everyone except Donald Trump and JD Vance, who seem to change their positions with each gust of wind.) Rather than endorse in that issue, we asked our Editorial Board members to write essays on how they felt about the amendment.', 'Endorsing does cost us something. Several longstanding subscribers wrote to say they were canceling because we endorsed Harris. I feel for them. They’ve obviously gotten something out of subscribing all these years – news, sports and entertainment stories they could not get anywhere else, investigative reporting, comics and more. They’re depriving themselves of that enjoyment to take a principled stand. I salute people who take principled stands.', 'In light of the Los Angeles Times owner bigfooting his opinion writers, I want to note that in the 11 years I’ve been editor here, overseeing the Editorial Board, we’ve had no bigfooting. None of our presidents has ordered up an editorial or stopped one. We have four community members on the board, and if anyone usurped the board majority, I suspect they’d leave. We discuss the issues with civility and form positions by consensus.', 'Sometimes that puts me on the losing side. We endorsed the arts tax on the Cuyahoga County ballot next month. I was on the losing side. I’d have recommended a no vote. The people behind the tax promised a decade ago to come up with more equitable funding than a cigarette tax, and they failed. I recommended rejecting this one and forcing them to live up to their word. The majority disagreed.', 'Finally, if you are a conservative getting ready to ask if we ever endorse Republicans, take note.

Why these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/politics/pennsylvania-haley-voters-trump-harris/index.html,"['', 'Michael Pesce is conservative in the truest sense of the word.', 'He speaks with an economy of words. He holds himself to a high standard but prefers not to judge others. He gets through tasks methodically, wasting no time or energy – even when enjoying his hobbies.', 'Pesce is a hunter, and Pennsylvania deer season overlaps with election season. Archery hunting is open now, with a rifle hunting period set to open in November. So Pesce stopped by the ranges at a state park recently to check his gear.', '“Hunting season is starting,” Pesce said. “That’s more important than any election for a lot of people.”', 'First, several shots at the archery targets, where Pesce at one point used a dime to adjust his bow sight. Once satisfied, it was down to the nearby firearm area. Pesce set his target 100 yards down range, and set his .30-6 hunting rifle on its stand.', 'A few stalls down, two men were firing AR-15-style assault rifles. Dozens of shots, the empty shells piling up at their feet. Pesce quietly made note of how loud it was, then got about his business: just three shots to adjust his rifle scope, then two more to allow a visitor to test his aim and get a feel for the rifle.', 'Then time to pack up, taking even the empty shells Pesce recycles for new bullets. A Coast Guard veteran. A Reagan Republican. A Nikki Haley voter in the April GOP primary who will be a Kamala Harris voter a week from Tuesday.', 'Pesce’s conservative principles tell him he can never vote for Donald Trump. And they tell him he has to vote for Harris, to try to keep Trump out of the White House, even though Pesce doesn’t like surprises and does not believe the vice president has clearly laid out a governing vision.', '“That’s the scary part,” Pesce said. “I am not voting for a candidate. I’m not voting for a policy. I’m voting against a candidate and policies, and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness. Some of the things he says are truly scary.”', 'Pesce is part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of potentially decisive voting blocs.', 'In Pesce’s case, he’s one of the Republicans in the counties that surround Philadelphia who supported Haley in the primary even though the former South Carolina governor had exited the race weeks before. They’re voters who view Trump as anything but conservative or principled. In many cases, they believe Trump must be defeated again to shake their party out of his spell.', '“If Trump loses, then I think Republicans will start coming back to what they were,” Pesce said. “Because they won’t have that radical right side. They won’t have the craziness and instability.”', 'It was our third visit in five months, and Pesce, true to his conservatism, has been consistent: He said in May he would vote for President Joe Biden even as he raised concerns about his age and took issue with some of his agenda. In conversations since the switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, Pesce has made clear he sees a duty to try to block Trump.', 'He recently traveled West through several states that are reliably Republican. Turning on the TV or the radio was different. He returned to Pennsylvania even more mindful that he lives in the biggest of the presidential battleground prizes.', '“No one’s ever been through anything like this,” he said of the 2024 campaign. “Is this an election for Americans, or is this for those seven states?”', 'It is important to remember our project is anecdotal reporting; the voters we are tracking, in this case Haley primary supporters, are not necessarily representative of the full universe of such voters. Yet they still provide us with valuable and sometimes telling insights. And they live in places that will be critical to the final math of who wins Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.', 'This time, we met Pesce at a state range in New Tripoli, which is in blue-collar Lehigh County. He lives a few miles away in Bucks County, which in recent elections has been the most competitive of the suburban collar counties that surround Philadelphia.', 'Those collar counties represent one of the crucial 2024 math tests: Can Harris hold or build on Biden’s 2020 suburban strength or will Trump claw back at least to his 2016 performance, when he lost the Philadelphia suburbs but by a smaller margin than in 2020? In a state so competitive, tiny shifts can make the difference.', 'Joan London and Berks County offer another glimpse at the battlegrounds within the battlegrounds.', 'Berks is still red when you look at election maps, and it is too far out to be considered a Philadelphia suburb. But as the suburbs grow and change, often the exurbs do, too. Still farmland, but more given up to homes and services. Still plenty of Trump signs, but in some pockets surprising competition.', '“This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs,” said London, an attorney who was born closer to Philly, in Montgomery County. “This is a primarily Republican leaning borough, always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.”', 'A walk down London’s leafy street in Wyomissing proves her point. No Trump signs but Harris signs on several of the lawns on her block.', 'Not her house. London’s lawn has one sign supporting a Republican legislative candidate.', 'But London is voting for Harris – the first time she will vote Democrat for president.', '“Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second and Republican third,” London said.', 'Her decision is a shift from when we first met in May. Then, London told us she voted in the GOP primary for Haley but then switched her registration to independent because she opposes Trump and what she sees as his dangerous populism.', 'But back then she said she would write in a conservative because she could not support Biden. She was even more firm in that belief just after Harris took over the ticket because she views the vice president as more liberal than Biden.', 'She had settled on Pat Toomey, a conservative former senator from Pennsylvania, as her write-in choice. Then she watched the Trump-Harris debate, and it stirred why, back at the age of 18, she chose to be a Reagan Republican.', '“The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine,” London said. “When he said we have to have a negotiated settlement. … For someone who claims to be a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It’s appeasement. It’s dangerous.”', 'She slept on what that debate answer stirred in her. And she awoke a Harris voter because, like Pesce, she believes the only way to get her party back is for Trump to be defeated.', '“I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again,” London said. She knows the polling in Pennsylvania and other swing states is tight and that Trump could well win.', '“I don’t want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that,” London said.', 'London is reluctant to speak for others but believes she may have company among at least some fellow local conservatives.', '“I was surprised by how many people came up to me and kind of whispered, ‘I feel the same way as you do,’” she said. “So I have a feeling there are quite a few private conversations that are occurring behind the scenes in Republican and conservative circles.”', 'It could matter if London has company. Hillary Clinton lost Berks County by 18,189 votes. Biden lost it, too, but by a slightly smaller margin: 16,841.', 'That 1,348 vote difference seems tiny, maybe insignificant, when you note that Pennsylvania has more than 9 million registered voters.', 'But ‘every vote counts’ is not a cliché in the battlegrounds: Trump’s winning margin here in 2016 was just 44,292; Biden’s in 2020 was 81,660.', 'Cynthia Sabatini is another Haley voter who now factors into the battleground math.', 'She lives in Media, in suburban Delaware County.', 'Sabatini is a registered Republican but she has never voted for Trump. And she says she never will.', '“Trump is a non starter for me,” she said in a recent interview at home.', 'But she is not sold on Harris, either, and her questions track what we hear from a lot of voters in our travels, even committed supporters of the vice president.', '“I don’t know who she is,” Sabatini said. “I really don’t. Because she had different positions than she does now. But she continues to say they are within her value system. So connect the dots for me.”', 'What can Harris do to win her vote in these final days?', '“You need to answer questions on point,” Sabatini said. “You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about your vision for this country.”', 'Sabatini wrote in a Republican senator in 2016 when Trump won Pennsylvania. She voted for Biden in 2020. She is well aware of the 2024 math, and friends voting for Harris aren’t shy about reminding her how critical it is for the vice president to get big margins in the suburbs.', '“I don’t care what they personally think about that,” Sabatini said. “I don’t want to be forced into making a decision between one of the two.”', 'She meditates frequently, sometimes twice a day, and says it can clear the mind for tough choices.', 'As she ponders hers, she shares this: “I think Trump is going to win.” That, she said, is based on betting lines, not the polls.', 'Sabatini does not want Trump back in the White House. She has a mail-in ballot and plans to drop it off on Election Day. Her decision could come as late as that morning.', 'She will make it according to her beliefs: Either Harris will win her over or she will cast another write in, with Haley her leading choice if it comes to that.', '“The lion’s share of my friends are Democrats,” she said. “They think at the 11th hour people will have such reservations about Trump that it will cause them to vote for Harris.

Last month marked my 40th year of proud work for the institution, in the newsroom and in the Opinions section. I have never been more disappointed in the newspaper than I am today, with the tragically flawed decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential race.', 'At a moment when The Post should have been stepping forward to sound the clarion call about the multiple dangers that Donald Trump poses to the nation and the world, it has chosen instead to pull back. That is the wrong choice at the worst possible time.', 'I write — I dissent — from the perspective of someone who spent two decades as a member of The Post’s editorial board. (I stepped away last year.) From that experience, I can say: you win some and lose some. No one, perhaps not even the editorial page editor, agrees with every position the board takes. At bottom, the owner of the newspaper is entitled to have an editorial page that reflects the owner’s point of view.', 'In addition, let’s not overestimate the significance of presidential endorsements. As much as we might like to believe otherwise, they have limited persuasive value for the vanishingly small number of undecided voters. They are distinct from endorsements for local office, involving issues and personalities about which voters might have scant knowledge; in these circumstances, editorial boards can serve as useful, trusted proxies. A presidential endorsement serves a different purpose: to reflect the soul and underlying values of the institution.', 'Follow Ruth Marcus', 'A vibrant newspaper can survive and even flourish without making presidential endorsements; The Post itself declined to make endorsements for many years before it began doing so regularly in 1976, as publisher and chief executive officer William Lewis pointed out in his explanation for the decision to halt the practice. If The Post had announced after this election that it would stop endorsing presidential candidates, I might have disagreed with that decision, but I would not consider it out of bounds. The practice of endorsements comes with some costs. The newsroom and the Opinions section maintain rigorous separation, but it is difficult to make that case to an official aggrieved by the failure to secure an endorsement.', 'This is not the time to make such a shift. It is the time to speak out, as loudly and convincingly as possible, to make the case that we made in 2016 and again in 2020: that Trump is dangerously unfit to hold the highest office in the land.', 'This was The Post on Oct. 13, 2016: “Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is dreadful, that is true — uniquely unqualified as a presidential candidate. If we believed that Ms. Clinton were the lesser of two evils, we might well urge you to vote for her anyway — that is how strongly we feel about Mr. Trump,” the editorial board wrote in endorsing Hillary Clinton. Trump, it — we because I was a member of the board then — said, “has shown himself to be bigoted, ignorant, deceitful, narcissistic, vengeful, petty, misogynistic, fiscally reckless, intellectually lazy, contemptuous of democracy and enamored of America’s enemies. As president, he would pose a grave danger to the nation and the world.”', 'Every word of that proved sadly true.', 'This was The Post on Sept. 28, 2020: It — we — called Trump “the worst president of modern times,” in endorsing Joe Biden “Democracy is at risk, at home and around the world,” the editorial warned. “The nation desperately needs a president who will respect its public servants; stand up for the rule of law; acknowledge Congress’s constitutional role; and work for the public good, not his private benefit.”', 'What has changed since then? Trump’s behavior has only gotten worse — and we have learned only more disturbing things about him. Most significantly, he disputed the results of a fair election that he lost and sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. He encouraged an insurrection that threatened the life of his own vice president — leading to his second impeachment — and then defended the insurrectionists as “hostages.” He will not accept the reality of his 2020 loss or pledge to respect the results of next month’s voting, unless it concludes in his favor.', 'He has threatened to “terminate” the Constitution. He has demeaned his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, as “mentally impaired.” He has vowed to fire the special counsel who brought two criminal cases against him and “go after” his political enemies. He wants to use the military to pursue domestic opponents — “radical left lunatics” like former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) or Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California) — and rout out “the enemy from within.”', 'I could keep going but you know all this, and you get my point: What self-respecting news organization could abandon its entrenched practice of making presidential endorsements in the face of all this?', 'Lewis, in his publisher’s note, called this move “consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.” It was, he added, “a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions — whom to vote for as the next president.”', 'But asserting that doesn’t make it so.

Nor in any future presidential election,” Lewis wrote on the newspaper’s website Friday. “We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.” The newspaper, Lewis writes, didn’t endorse in presidential races from 1960 to 1972 but did from 1976 to 2020.', ' ', 'The newspaper endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. It endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, but almost three months before that, it had declared Trump “a unique threat to American democracy.” As The Washington Post did, from 2008 to 2020, the L.A. Times endorsed Barack Obama twice and then Clinton and Biden. Importantly, the L.A. Times endorsed Harris in 2014 when she was the state’s attorney general running for re-election and then endorsed her successful 2016 U.S. Senate run.', 'To Garza’s point, the stakes are high in this election, at least for people who aren’t billionaires. And we have to consider the possibilities that the leaders of these newspapers are OK with Trump — or terrified of him. Given the size and influence of these papers, neither of those possibilities is comforting. On X, Marty Baron, a former executive editor of The Washington Post who was in charge when the paper adopted “Democracy Dies in Darkness” as its slogan, responded to Lewis’ piece: “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” He said Trump “will see this as invitation to further intimidate” Bezos, and he called it “Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.”', 'According to a Washington Post story about the nonendorsement that cited two sources briefed on the events, “The decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.”', 'It certainly appears that Soon-Shiong and Bezos are less concerned with their newspaper’s duty to the public and to history and more worried about what might happen to them if Trump wins and carries out his plans of retribution.', 'As important as it is to save newspapers, an obvious downside of billionaires coming to the rescue is their influence on those publications and their editorial pages. (On top of that, these billionaire owners have not put an end to the layoffs of journalists or the offers of buyouts that plagued major publications before they were “rescued” by them.)', 'Granted, there are questions about how effective endorsements are.', 'According to the American Presidency Project, which looked at the country’s top 100 newspapers by circulation, in 2016, 57 newspapers (with a combined circulation of 13,095,067) endorsed Clinton for president. Another three newspapers with a combined circulation of 3,243,140 urged their readers not to vote for Trump, and 26 didn’t endorse. The Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Florida Times-Union (combined circulation of 315,666) were the only two that endorsed Trump.', 'Granted, there are questions about how effective endorsements are.', 'Little good that did Clinton, though. She lost. Not the popular vote, of course, but, still, she lost.', 'What’s striking is that in 2020, there were almost as many of those newspapers that didn’t endorse (44) as the 47 that endorsed the eventual winner, Biden. (Trump received seven endorsements that time.) There are likely multiple reasons for smaller newspapers declining to endorse, including public assumptions that endorsements govern news coverage and the anger that such endorsements inevitably cause.', 'It is far more likely that a newspaper subscriber will cancel their subscription if the paper endorses the candidate they oppose than it is that someone who doesn’t subscribe will become a reader because their candidate was endorsed. It’s a high-risk/no-reward proposition. But it’s still something newspapers do, and if other owners and publishers can take the risks, then billionaires certainly can.', ' ', 'Soon-Shiong posted a comment on X Wednesday that mischaracterizes what editorials boards do:', 'The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation. In addition, the Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years. In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years. Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'An endorsement is not an analysis. It’s an opinion. It picks a candidate in the same way readers will pick one. The path that Soon-Shiong said he suggested is not a path editorial writers and editors would take. Because editorial writers take sides.', 'That said, Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review that she’d received no such request from Soon-Shiong to write an analysis of the candidates.', 'In 2016, almost three months before The Washington Post endorsed Clinton’s candidacy, it published an editorial identifying Trump as “a unique threat” to democracy. It should be noted that the newspaper did that years before “saving democracy” became a theme. Trump’s threat to democracy is even more obvious today.', 'And, yet, the newspaper that tells us that “democracy dies in darkness” can’t be bothered to put up a fight for it.', 'Yes, there may have been hell to pay if the paper had endorsed Harris and Trump won and then turned against the press as he has promised to do. But hell will be visited on more vulnerable people to a much greater degree. It is unforgivable that the ultra-wealthy who have purchased these huge and influential platforms appear to be more concerned with their own interests than the interests of the readers they serve.', 'Jarvis DeBerry is an opinion editor for MSNBC Daily.', ""Catch up on more stories from MSNBC Daily featuring the top voices and opinions driving today's conversation"", '© 2024 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The paper came out refusing to endorse the candidate in the forthcoming election who will defend the rule of law, against the convicted criminal who has shown time and again – not least on 6 January 2021 – that he explicitly aims to overturn it.', 'The Post’s British chief executive, Will Lewis, wrote an editorial that stated the Post would sit on the fence for the most significant US election of modern times (bringing to mind that old truth “the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing”).', 'That editorial, however, was followed by an act of open sedition from the news desk of the Post, which broke the inside story of the alleged influence on that decision from Jeff Bezos, the Amazon oligarch who bought the newspaper for $250m in 2013.', 'Bezos now finds himself in what might be called the “libertarian” billionaire’s dilemma. Having guaranteed the editorial independence of the Post, he can’t quite be seen to shut down the current story of his own interference; the result is that – at a paper that trumpets “democracy dies in darkness” – the craven decision-making of owner and chief executive stand exposed for all to see.', 'And for those many of us who first nurtured the idea of becoming journalists after watching All the President’s Men, it is cheering to read Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein still to the fore in this latest deep throat exposé.', 'At the Serpentine North Gallery in London’s Hyde Park there is an intriguing exhibition devoted to perhaps the most consequential legal struggle of our times – the question of who owns individual human creativity: are the words of writers and the melodies of musicians simply data to be “scraped” by AI companies, who seek to replicate them for their own profit, or should those individual human acts be protected, in the normal way, by copyright?', 'The Call, a collaboration between artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, dramatises this question in compelling ways – including with a cacophony of “vocal datasets” that are made to swell with human voices in digital concert.', 'The exhibition invites the idea that, used thoughtfully, AI can help the world to sing in perfect harmony. But there is another age-old principle at stake here: cui bono, follow the money.', 'If multinational conglomerates are so very keen to use all of our ideas to train their machines, the obverse has to apply: their highly guarded content-creating algorithms must also become open, for the transparent and regulated benefit of us all.', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", '', 'Few acts of vandalism have had quite the same emotional impact as the chopping down of the beloved Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland.

In small part, I confess, this was an act of overdue contrition to all those kindly correspondents who have written to me and colleagues over the years to enquire, politely: “How many trees had to die for this bollocks to be printed?”', 'What better chance finally to begin to redress the balance?', 'Tim Adams is an Observer columnist']"

The news broke yesterday afternoon: For the first time in almost 50 years, The Washington Post would not be endorsing a presidential candidate. In fact, it would be ending the practice altogether. An endorsement—of Kamala Harris—had been drafted by “editorial page staffers,” a Post article reported, but then came the decision not to publish it. That choice was made not by the paper’s editorial board or newsroom leadership, the Post (and others) reported, citing anonymous sources, but by its owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.', 'Bezos, as it happens, has billions of dollars in contracts before the federal government. It did not take long for people to start suggesting that the decision not to endorse might have had little to do with journalistic principle and much to do with the relationship between Bezos and the famously vindictive person who, if elected president of the United States, could soon have major influence over his businesses. “This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,” Martin Baron, a former Post executive editor, told NPR. “Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” (Bezos has not commented on the endorsement decision.

The paper that’s long dined out on its reputation as a principled foe of a paranoid, authoritarian Republican regime announced on Friday that it wasn’t going to endorse a presidential candidate this time out (or indeed ever again), even though the twice-impeached, criminally convicted Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a mere piker in the realm of unhinged abuses of maximum executive power.', 'The newspaper that still has the temerity to envision itself as a heroic guardian of the country’s embattled democracy rolled over for the MAGA thugocracy under the flimsiest imaginable pretext: It intends to safeguard an “independent space” for voters who don’t want to be told whom to vote for, editorial-page editor David Shipley reportedly told outraged staffers of the paper in what NPR media reporter David Folfenflik called a “tense meeting.” Never mind that Americans are already told whom to vote for on a never-ending loop in every imaginable public venue, and seem to emerge with their delicate sensibilities intact. Never mind that the whole idea of an op-ed section is to assemble voices arguing over what people should say and do. And never mind that there’s no such thing as an impartial “independent space” in a battle over how and whether America’s formal democracy can continue. What Shipley was actually doing was saying, “My corporate paymasters want to wallow in Donald Trump’s tax cuts and avoid jeopardizing their lucrative federal contracts,” but the phony rhetoric of noncommittal journalistic objectivity is far better suited to newsroom meetings where you’re trying to get reporters to toe the management line.', 'Shipley had reportedly already drafted an endorsement of Harris, but per the Post’s own reporting, it was overruled by Post owner and retail predator Jeff Bezos, the centibillionaire owner of Amazon. During Trump’s first administration, the then-president threatened to withhold key tax breaks and postal subventions in retaliation for the Post’s critical coverage of Trump. When the editorial board weighed its 2020 endorsement, Bezos approved its choice of Joe Biden; this time out, the paper’s owner is hedging his bets against economic penalties in a second Trump term, to say nothing of the resolution of several pending antitrust actions against his company unlikely to break his way in a Harris administration. And like his fellow billionaires, King Amazon is clearly warming to the prospects of more pelf in his coffers thanks to Trump’s pledge to continue lavishing giveaways on our economic oligarchy.', 'It’s worth noting that the same scenario played out at the Los Angeles Times, where its billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, blocked the paper’s planned endorsement of Harris. In addition to being a standard-issue plutocrat with a pharmaceutical fortune sure to prosper under a more lax Trump-appointed FDA, Soon-Shiong is a longtime pal of Elon Musk, the man-child centibillionaire who’s gone all in on Trump’s reelection. (Indeed, in a fine irony, the Post published a front-page account of how Musk’s Starlink satellite company stands to rake in billions more in government dosh in a second Trump term, on the very day the paper’s managers announced their craven capitulation to Musk’s would-be benefactor.)', 'What’s different about the shameful LA Times saga is that the paper’s editorial-pages editor, Marial Garza, recognized the actual  journalistic and political stakes of having the paper’s voice squelched by a billionaire’s diktat. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,” Garza told Columbia Journalism Review editor Sewell Chan:', 'In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.… This is a point in time where you speak your conscience no matter what. And an endorsement was the logical next step after a series of editorials we’ve been writing about how dangerous Trump is to democracy, about his unfitness to be president, about his threats to jail his enemies. We have made the case in editorial after editorial that he shouldn’t be reelected.', 'As for David Shipley, here’s the brutal assessment of one Post employee: “The story about Shipley has long been that he got the job because he knows how to get along with rich men.” Jacob Heilbrunn, a former colleague of Shipley’s at The New Republic, concurs: Back then, he was “earnest, conventionally liberal,” but “now seems to have morphed into a total empty suit.”', 'Indeed, while Shipley said he “owned” the Post’s cowardly decision in that heated staff meeting, the official rationale for it was published under the byline of Bezos’s handpicked publisher, Will Lewis, the former Murdoch lackey still neck-deep in the fallout from Britain’s phone-hacking scandal.', 'In an arrogant and obtuse editorial, Lewis waved away the paper’s recent history of presidential endorsements by citing its non-endorsement in the 1960 presidential race—a statement of putative journalistic principle that chiefly succeeded in being weaselly and pompous in equal measure: “We have said and will continue to say, as reasonably and candidly as we know how, what we believe about the emerging issues of the campaign,” the 1960 editorial read in part. “We have sought to arrive at our opinions as fairly as possible, with the guidance of our own principles of independence but free of commitment to any party or candidate.” Translation: We don’t relish candor as anything more than an expedient rhetorical posture, and must shy away from the clear moral implications of our own journalistic work.', 'That’s the gist of Lewis’s own slapdash argument, as well. Dismissing the notion that his quisling pose doubles as “as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another” Lewis asserts that it is, in fact, “consistent with the values the Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.” If the Post indeed cherishes those values, it’s objectively impossible to square them with sitting out an election that could restore maximum power to a multiply convicted lawbreaker, bigot, sexual assaulter, abuser of executive power, and self-styled agent of political retribution whose own former cabinet members regard as a fascist. Readers of the Post’s editorial page would have been better served by an entirely blank space or a horoscope or word game, in place of Lewis’s self-congratulatory bilge.', 'Yet long-suffering Post readers couldn’t be all that surprised by Lewis’s moronic, self-canceling reasoning. This was also the paper that sat for three years on the damning news that Martha-Ann Alito, the wife of the Supreme Court justice who stans for Trump’s maximal executive power and gleefully struck down women’s rights to their own bodily autonomy, flew an upside-down flag outside of the couple’s home in a gesture of solidarity with the failed coup of January 6. And according to NPR’s Folfenflik, Lewis dangled the prospect of an exclusive interview with him in exchange for the writer’s pledge to bury developments in the phone-hacking case in his reporting.', 'This is a universe or so removed from the high-minded standards of character and public probity that Lewis professes to uphold in embracing a morally indefensible posture of nonalignment in a moment of democratic crisis. But it’s what you get when you staff the top of a masthead exclusively with people who know how to get along with rich men.', 'In the coming election, the fate of our democracy and fundamental civil rights are on the ballot. The conservative architects of Project 2025 are scheming to institutionalize Donald Trump’s authoritarian vision across all levels of government if he should win.', 'We’ve already seen events that fill us with both dread and cautious optimism—throughout it all, The Nation has been a bulwark against misinformation and an advocate for bold, principled perspectives. Our dedicated writers have sat down with Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders for interviews, unpacked the shallow right-wing populist appeals of J.D. Vance, and debated the pathway for a Democratic victory in November.', 'Stories like these and the one you just read are vital at this critical juncture in our country’s history.

Why The Washington Post decided to opt out of a presidential endorsement,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-washington-post-decided-to-opt-out-of-a-presidential-endorsement,"['Amna Nawaz', 'Leave your feedback', 'For the first time in 36 years, The Washington Post will not endorse a presidential candidate. Publisher and CEO William Lewis explained, ""We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.” It comes after The Los Angeles Times publisher blocked a planned endorsement of Vice President Harris. Amna Nawaz discussed more with Sewell Chan of Columbia Journalism Review.', 'Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'For the first time in 36 years, The Washington Post will not endorse a presidential candidate this election.', 'Publisher and CEO Will Lewis explained the decision, saying — quote — ""We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as an abdication of responsibility. We don\'t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for, a statement in support of our readers\' ability to make up their own minds.""', ""That comes after The Los Angeles Times' publisher blocked a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. Both papers are owned by billionaires, and their potential role in all of this is now being questioned."", ""For a closer look, I'm joined now by Sewell Chan, executive editor of Columbia Journalism Review."", ""Sewell, it's good to see you. We should note, too, that you have worked at The Washington Post and the l.A. Times. You have led The Texas Tribune. So you have some insight into how these kinds of decisions are made, but what do we know about what went down behind the scenes at The Washington Post, how this decision was made?"", 'Sewell Chan, Columbia Journalism Review:', 'Well, Amna, we know that it was made rather suddenly.', 'The editorial writers — and we — I reported who they are — had begun drafting this editorial and had gone through the normal process that a very important editorial or endorsement like this would have gone through, several drafts, edits, critiques, feedback.', ""And up until a week ago — there had been some nervousness that it wasn't moving forward. But a week ago, I have been told that the editorial page editor reassured the staff that things were moving forward. And then, suddenly, very suddenly, they learned that the piece had been pulled."", 'And, today, you have an explanation from the publisher. But you have an explanation from the publisher as to why not to endorse, but not really why now.', ""And I think what's unusual for both of these cases is that the staff had already gone ahead, drafted these endorsements. So why were they suddenly pulled so quickly and so soon before the election?"", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'So, in the case of The Washington Post, the former executive editor, Marty Baron, today called that decision cowardice. He also claimed that former President Trump will see this as what he called an invitation to further intimidate owner Jeff Bezos.', ""Is there truth to this idea, Sewell, that Bezos is somehow hedging his bets against a potential Trump presidency and doesn't want to see his business interests harmed? What do we know about that?"", 'Sewell Chan:', ""We know that Bezos was behind this decision. The Post itself confirmed that that's the case. We don't know precisely why."", 'Now, of course, Jeff Bezos is one of the wealthiest people on Earth. Amazon is facing an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Biden administration, actually. Bezos is involved in space exploration efforts. There are many area — A.I. So there are many areas of his interests that would touch upon areas of federal regulation.', ""So I can't speak to his motivations, but I can say that this does not look great for The Post, particularly since, when Marty Baron was editor, The Post had framed itself as countering autocracy. Democracy dies in darkness was the slogan Bezos had coined and decided to use as The Washington Post slogan."", 'So now some people are seeing Bezos as kind of caving to political pressure.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'What have we seen in the way of reaction at The Washington Post from editors and reporters and staff?', 'Sewell Chan:', 'Well, the staff I have talked to are very demoralized and very upset.', ""Several of them have said to me, and I kind of agree with this, that maybe it's time to rethink whether presidential endorsements are useful. But you could have done that a year ago and said, we're going to set a new policy. We're only going to endorse in local and state races. We're not going to endorse in presidential. Most people have made up their minds anyway. I think actually that would have been a very reasonable decision."", ""But that's not what happened here. It was instead the opposite at both The Post and The L.A. Times, the expectation of an endorsement, an endorsement written, drafted, backing Vice President Harris, and then pulled pretty much at the last minute by the owner in both cases."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'So, Sewell, we now have two major publications here, The L.A. Times and The Washington Post, both owned by billionaires, Bezos in the case of The Post and in the case of The L.A. Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, breaking with years of practice, not endorsing a presidential candidate.', 'Is this a concerning trend of some kind? What does it say to you?', 'Sewell Chan:', ""Well the trend — I want to be — it's a great question."", ""I think that endorsements, we have to think of their utility and usefulness. When — I believe that at the state and local level, when newspapers help people decide, for example local judgeships, ballot questions, of which there are so many in states like California, things where there's not a lot of news and publicity, that editorials can actually add great insight, because these editorial board members, who are reporters, they're journalists, they're interviewing the people on pros and cons of issues."", ""So you can make an argument that, at the presidential level, it's less useful because there is so much attention. People are getting information from so many places. And if The New York Times or Chicago Tribune says, vote this way or that way, it may not carry weight the way it once did. So I think that that's a legitimate discussion to have."", ""What I think is very disturbing right now to a lot of people in the journalism community and in these two newsrooms is doing it so suddenly and without a lot of transparency. I mean, Will Lewis said in his editorial today — op-ed today, we don't see it as an abdication of our responsibility. We just want to let people make up their minds."", ""The challenge is, though, that both The Post and The L.A. Times endorsed Biden in 2020, they have run editorials about raising concerns about Trump's policies over many years now, and so a lot of people are left asking, well, what has changed? Why now this sudden shift in direction?"", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'That is Sewell Chan, executive editor of The Columbia Journalism Review.', 'Sewell Chan, thank you.

"The Washington Post Declines to Endorse for President, and Civilization Melts",https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-washington-post-declines-to-endorse-for-president-and-civilization-melts/,"['National Review', 'The Downside of the ‘Vibe Shift’', 'Judge Orders Virginia to Restore Aliens to Voter Rolls', 'Electric Vehicles: Another Volt Farce', 'Donald Trump to Bring Back Tallow Fries (Maybe)', 'Is TSMC’s Arizona Success a Win for the CHIPS Act?', 'The Washington Post — newspaper of the federal clerisy, official organ of the Resistance, the place where “Democracy Dies in Darkness” — announced this afternoon that not only will it not be endorsing either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president in 2024, but that it will never make an endorsement again. (This is truly a shame; as a colleague lamented to me, now I guess we’ll just never know how these people really felt about 2024.)', 'The reactions across media have ranged from disgust to outright garment-rending peals of agony — resignations have already been filed — and you’d have to have a heart of stone not to be laughing until tears roll down your cheeks at every last one of them. I’d be remiss if I didn’t share a few, if only to illustrate the absurdity of it all.', 'Let’s get one thing out of the way first, however: This was a business decision by Jeff Bezos. Publisher and CEO Will Lewis wrote the piece announcing the Post’s decision not to endorse (erm . . . “change its policy going forward,” that is), but all other reporting (including, hilariously, the Post’s own employees’ union) clearly indicates that this is a directive from on high, one that Lewis was willing to go along with. I think I know why — and it’s not the dull and obvious answer of “Bezos just worries about Trump regulators hurting Amazon” — but hold that thought for now.', 'Because before that we should note that Bezos wasn’t actually the first to act on this. Only yesterday, the media world flew into a similar outrage over the owner of the Los Angeles Times blocking his editorial board from issuing a presidential endorsement. The editorial page editor resigned after owner Patrick Soon-Shiong asked the board to — this is not a joke, dear readers — write a sober “pros and cons” analysis of each candidate instead. (I am deeply disappointed myself, because nobody should have been denied the comedy of reading the Times rate Donald Trump’s good qualities.)', 'The reactions to the Times kerfuffle were muted, because to be perfectly honest, nobody reads or cares about the Los Angeles Times. But the news from the Post was greeted with a collective grand mal seizure from online media lefties. There are simply too many denunciations from the cheap seats to mention here, but internally it was ugly: Editorial board member Robert Kagan announced his immediate resignation, while former editor Marty Baron tweeted “this is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty” (leading one to assume he wrote the Post’s current masthead slogan, among other things). Meanwhile, notoriously surly race-harridan Karen Attiah first fell into stunned silence on Twitter, tweeting only “Jesus Christ” and “Today has been an absolute stab in the back.”', 'Others from the elite world of media and Democratic politics piled on, and oftentimes they weren’t helping. Obama-era U.N. ambassador Susan Rice called on every other member of the Washington Post’s editorial department to “walk out,” which didn’t do anything at all to lessen the pressure on poor Jennifer Rubin, who in an ill-starred fit of high dudgeon was demanding just last night that the Los Angeles Times’ editorial staff writers all resign in solidarity with their editor to protest the non-endorsement of Kamala already discussed above. (Timing is everything, Jen.). Perhaps, as Charlie Cooke charitably sought to explain it, Rubin really only meant that other people should resign. As for myself, I’m still not convinced this isn’t a fiendishly clever move to trick all the right people into resigning — it beats pricey buyouts, after all.', 'In many ways, the reaction only proves why the Post was correct to make the decision it did. Believe me, it’s not about wanting to delude people into believing that the Post’s editorial board isn’t stocked top to bottom with azure-blue Democrats. It’s rather about the fact that the Post’s entire branding for the last eight years has been “resistance, resistance, resistance,” and not only has it led them to wade hip-deep into some of the most massively discrediting media disgraces over that span of time — the Russiagate hoax, suppressing news of Hunter Biden’s laptop, and their Covid-19 coverage being only the most memorable of them — it has utterly killed their business. The Post’s readership reached new heights during the Trump era, when it billed itself as the flagship vessel of “Resistance” narratives and commentators, but has been cratering all throughout the Biden era, to a point where it now has roughly half the audience it once did. This doesn’t sell anymore, even if you wholeheartedly believe that its activist turn has resulted in great and noble feats of muckraking defiance.', 'But the fact is that it hasn’t; the Post is threadbare and repetitive these days and hasn’t produced a quality of reporting and national journalism comparable to that of the New York Times or even the Wall Street Journal for several years now. The rot is internal, on a coverage level, not just an ideological one. That’s almost a secondary consideration — the economic bottom line is the primary one, particularly for an organization in as much financial distress as it is — but one that touches me personally. I grew up with the Post and loved it when it had the best sports section in the nation, a Style section I would read front to back, and an op-ed page full of interesting and divergent voices.', 'I’d like to see that Washington Post return. But it never will on its current trajectory, not until it shakes free from the madness of both openly embracing the crudest of activist politics and positions and also pretending to act as a sober-eyed tribune of the people.
