Should You Invest in Silver Bullion? (Updated 2024),https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-invest-silver-bullion-updated-2024,"['October 23, 2024 ‚Äî 04:50 pm EDT', 'Written by Melissa Pistilli for Investing News Network ->', 'Investing in silver bullion has pros and cons, and what‚Äôs right for one investor may not work for another.', 'Interest in thesilver markettends to flourish whenever the silver price increases, with investors beginning to wonder if it is the right time to add physical silver to their investment portfolios.', 'While silver can be volatile, the precious metal is also seen as a safe-haven asset, similar to its sister metal gold. Safe-haven investments can offer protection in times of uncertainty, and with tensions running high, they could be a good choice for those looking to preserve their wealth in difficult times.', 'With those factors in mind, let‚Äôs look at the pros and cons of buying silver bullion.', 'Silver bullion is often considered a good safe-haven asset. As mentioned, investors often flock to precious metals in times of turmoil, politically and economically. For example, physical silver and gold have both performed strongly in recent years against a background of geopolitical instability and high inflation.', '""What you can know with absolute certainty is that good money ‚Äî so physical gold, physical silver in your possession ‚Äî is the single safest thing that you can do to protect yourself from all of those issues, plus so many more,"" Lynette Zang of ITM Trading told the Investing News Network at the 2024 Vancouver Resource Investment Conference.', 'While cash, mining stocks, bonds and other financial products are accepted forms of wealth, they are essentially still digital promissory notes. For that reason, they are all vulnerable to depreciation due to actions like printing money. A troy ounce of silver bullion, on the other hand, is a finite tangible asset. That means that, although it is vulnerable to market fluctuations like other commodities, physical silver isn‚Äôt likely to completely crash because of its inherent and real value. Market participants can buy bullion in different forms, such as silver coins or silver jewelry, or they can buy silver bullion bars.', 'Compared to gold bullion, silver is significantly cheaper, which makes it more accessible for investors looking for an affordable entrance to the precious metals market. This can make it easier for investors to build up a portfolio over time.', 'Another benefit is that investors who need to convert their precious metals to currency will have an easier time selling a portion of their silver portfolio than those looking to sell part of their gold. Just as a US$100 bill can be a challenge to break at the store, divvying up an ounce of gold bullion can be a challenge. As a result, silver bullion is more practical and versatile, particularly for everyday investors who need flexibility in their investments.', 'Silver tends to move in tandem with gold: when the price of gold rises, so too does the price of silver. Because the white metal is currently worth around 1/86th the price of gold, buying silver bullion is affordable and stands to see a much bigger percentage gain if the silver price goes up. In fact, silver has outperformed the gold price in bull markets. It‚Äôs possible for an investor to hedge their bets with silver bullion in their investment portfolio.', 'Silver and gold have been used as legal tender for thousands of years, and that lineage lends them a sense of stability. Many buyers find comfort in knowing that silver has been recognized for its value throughout a great deal of mankind‚Äôs history, and so there‚Äôs an expectation that it will endure while a fiat currency may fall to the wayside. When individuals invest in physical silver, there is a reassurance that the metal has value that will continue to persist. Additionally, its increasing use as an industrial metal in the energy transition has improved the metals fundamentals even further.', ""Unlike most other investments, such as stocks, holding silver bullion can leave investors vulnerable to theft. And of course, the more physical assets, including silver jewelry, that reside within your home, the more at risk you are for losing significantly if a burglary takes place. It's possible to secure your assets from looting by using a safety deposit box in a bank or a safe box in your home, but this will incur additional costs."", 'Silver may not perform as well as other investments, such as real estate or even other metals. Mining stocks, especially silver stocks that pay dividends, may also be a better option than silver bullion for some investors. Royalty and streaming companies are another option for those interested in investing in silver, as are exchange-traded funds and silver futures.', 'When investors try to buy any bullion product, such as an American silver ounce coin known as a silver eagle, they quickly find out that the physical silver price is generally higher than the silver spot price due to premiums used by sellers. What‚Äôs more, if demand is high, premiums can go up fast, making the purchase of physical silver bullion more expensive and a less attractive investment.', ""Silver bullion coins are not legal tender, meaning they can't be used for every day purchases. Since the metal is usually used as an investment, this isn't often an issue. However, it does mean that if silver needs to be sold in a hurry to cover expenses, investors will need to find a buyer. If you can't access a bullion dealer and are in a jam, pawn shops and jewelers are an option, but they won't necessarily pay well."", 'youtu.be', 'Mark Yaxley: Gold, Silver, PGMs ‚Äî Stock Market Suffering, How to Build a Physical Portfolio', ""Interested in adding silver to your portfolio?

Forget Everything Else and Buy These Silver Stocks!,https://www.wealthdaily.com/forget-everything-else-and-buy-these-silver-stocks/,"['Jason Williams', 'Posted October 24, 2024', 'Dear Reader,', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'But silver is starting to show its historic outperformance. After lagging gold for the first two years of the rally, silver started to catch up and outpace its sister metal. But as you can see from the chart below, silver prices still have a lot of swing to go before they rebalance the relationship:', '', 'That‚Äôs not the only thing suggesting a surge in silver stocks, though. There‚Äôs also a ratio that‚Äôs pointing to a MASSIVE move in silver stocks. And it‚Äôs another relationship between the prices of silver and gold‚Ä¶', 'The gold-silver ratio describes how many ounces of silver it takes to purchase one ounce of gold. It‚Äôs a good judge of how the two metals are being valued compared to each other (as opposed to the U.S. dollar). And right now that ratio is sitting around 80, meaning it takes 80 ounces of silver to pay for 1 ounce of gold.', 'Historically, this ratio swings between two extremes: overvalued and undervalued. At 80, we‚Äôre sitting at the undervalued end of the scale where silver is undervalued compared to gold. But the other end of the spectrum is in the 40s, where gold is undervalued in terms of silver.', '', 'Silver has a lot of catching up to do in terms of its relative value to gold. And as all signs point to gold continuing its record-setting climb, that means silver will have to climb even faster to reset the equilibrium. That means silver stocks are going to absolutely FLY üí∏.', 'So, now that you understand why silver is poised for massive gains, let‚Äôs talk about how you can take advantage of that by investing in silver stocks. And the first silver stocks I want to share aren‚Äôt actually stocks at all. But they behave just like stocks and can deliver solid profits, too.', 'I‚Äôm talking about funds that help you invest in a basket of silver stocks or just in a basket of silver itself. And the biggest one of those out there is the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE: SLV). It‚Äôs a fund that invests directly in physical silver and gives shareholders exposure to the metal itself. So far this year, it‚Äôs up about 45% as it tracks the ‚Äúother‚Äù precious metal‚Äôs ascent. But there‚Äôs a lot more room to run here.', '', 'And when you‚Äôre talking about funds that give exposure to silver stocks, you also have to discuss the ones that invest in the companies producing the metal. Fortunately there‚Äôs a fund for that as well. The Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) gives investors exposure to silver stocks through its investments in the biggest silver mining companies in the world. And the thing about miners is that they move even more than metals when prices start to rise. So, while this one is also up 45% in 2024, it could have even bigger returns ahead of it.', 'Now, those two ETFs are likely enough exposure to silver stocks for a lot of investors. But if you‚Äôre willing to take on a little more risk and bet on individual companies, then some of the major silver miners in that Global X ETF might make the best silver stocks for your investments‚Ä¶', '', 'In that field, you‚Äôve got lots of great options to choose from. One of the bigger allocations of the fund and a big silver miner that‚Äôs done very well is Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE: WPM). Wheaton is more focused on gold these days, but it‚Äôs silver investments and long history of success make it one of the top silver stocks for retail investors. Shares are up 41% this year.', 'There‚Äôs also a personal favorite of mine, Silvercorp Metals Inc. (NYSE: SVM). Now, Silvercorp isn‚Äôt one of the Global X top holdings, but it very well could be in the near future. So far this year, shares are up over 100% as the company capitalizes on the moves in precious metals prices. This is definitely one of the top silver stocks and could soon become one of the biggest, as well.', 'Another option if you‚Äôre looking for major miners to add to your list of silver stocks is Coeur Mining, Inc. (NYSE: CDE). Focused on the rich silver and gold fields of the western U.S., Coeur Mining is up over 170% in 2024 as investors have seen its untapped value among other silver stocks.', 'We‚Äôve definitely got a great list of silver stocks going here with our ETFs and individual major miners. But just like silver moves bigger than gold and miners move bigger than metals, junior miners move bigger than major miners. So let‚Äôs add some top minor miners to our silver stocks list‚Ä¶', '', 'First up on that list is a little company called Kuya Silver Corporation (OTC: KUYAF). Kuya explores for silver at its two projects in central Peru and northern Ontario. The company is still very small and speculative, but shares are up 60% as investors have taken notice of its progress.', '', 'Next is Silver One Resources Inc. (OTC: SLVRF) out of Vancouver. It primarily explores for silver and primarily explores in the United States. It‚Äôs currently working on developing two properties in Nevada and a third in Arizona. And shares have jumped over 90% in 2024 as investors have taken notice of the potential in those projects.', '', 'And rounding out our list of top silver stocks is perhaps my favorite minor miner. It‚Äôs a company called Apollo Silver Corp. (OTC: APGOF) that‚Äôs already given shareholders a 110% return this year. It‚Äôs focused on mining silver deposits here in the U.S. as well. And the management team is one of the best in the business, having already built several other very successful mining operations.', 'The bottom line here is that we were right about nuclear stocks. And we were right about gold stocks. We‚Äôre going to be right about silver stocks too. And we want you along for the extremely profitable ride.', 'Silver stocks are poised for a historic rally and fortunes are almost certainly going to be made as things all play out. Will you use these silver stocks to help build a family legacy? Or will you pass up another opportunity to be ahead of the crowd?', 'I sure hope you take the first option and ride the wave of profits these silver stocks are poised to deliver all the way to the top.

What‚Äôs Driving the Strength in Global Equities?,https://www.lordabbett.com/en-us/financial-advisor/insights/markets-and-economy/what-s-driving-the-strength-in-global-equities-.html,"['Global equity markets have continued their strong showing through the third quarter of 2024, building on the rally that began in late 2023. Year to date through September 30, the S&P 500¬Æ Index advanced 22%, while the MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index) climbed 19%. Here, we‚Äôll look at some of the factors driving that strong performance and offer some insights about how investors might approach the asset class in the fourth quarter and beyond.', 'One development supporting markets in 2024: The global disinflation narrative is intact. The annualized August U.S. core consumer price index (which excludes food and energy prices) decreased to 3.3%, year over year, in September after peaking at 6.1% in September 2022. Many economies overseas are ahead of the U.S. on this front, with headline inflation in the Eurozone, Germany, the U.K., and Canada now at 1.8%, 1.6%, 2.2%, and 2.0%, respectively. (All inflation data are sourced from government agencies of the respective areas.)', 'This moderation in inflation has allowed central banks globally to begin easing monetary policy, with the U.S. Federal Reserve notably cutting rates by 50 basis points (bps) on September 18, the European Central Bank delivering two 25-bp cuts in the last three months, and the Bank of Canada cutting rates three times since June, with more cuts expected.', 'Meanwhile, economic growth is expected to moderate but stay positive in most developed markets, while maintaining a stronger profile in emerging markets (see Figure 1), bringing a so-called ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù into view. Historically, this type of environment tends to be positive for risk assets, as evidenced by the performance of the major indexes referenced above. (There can be no assurance that such conditions will continue in the future.)', 'In a setting where yields are declining, European companies‚Äîhaving a larger share of floating-rate debt‚Äîare positioned to gain, as the interest payments on this debt periodically adjust according to current market interest rates. Reduced interest expense should lead to improved profitability and enhanced cash flow for corporate borrowers, freeing up capital that can be used to reduce debt, reinvest into the business, or return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.', 'While we believe the U.S. equity market rally still has momentum, given a resilient U.S. economy and the continued investment in, and increasing adoption of, generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), it is prudent to look at non-U.S. equity markets as well for their diversification benefits, cyclical and secular tailwinds. International markets are much more diverse, providing potential opportunities for active managers to win in different environments.', 'That diversity is evident when one looks at the composition of major equity indexes. The U.S. equity market has, over the years, become very tech-concentrated, resulting in an equity allocation that is skewed toward growth and dominated by just a handful of the biggest companies. In fact, the S&P 500‚Äôs five largest stocks make up over a quarter of the market capitalization of the index (as of September 30) and are all technology-related. This growth skew has been a key driver of returns in U.S. markets recently. On the other hand, the five largest stocks in the MSCI EAFE make up less than 10% of the index and represent multiple industries and regions (see Figure 2), while also being significantly more value-oriented. We think a diversified portfolio of U.S. and international equities makes a lot of sense given the widely differing composition of these markets. ', 'The appeal of a broader geographic exposure becomes evident when one considers the many secular drivers that are positioned to benefit companies outside the United States. For example, the increasing adoption of AI could benefit AI-adjacent companies in Japan, many of which are smaller concerns that play in other parts of the supply chain outside of chip manufacturing. The increasing use of GLP-1 drugs to treat both diabetes and obesity could provide a boost to global pharmaceutical firms. There are also companies benefiting from the shifting of global supply chains in a post-pandemic world. In fact, according to Morgan Stanley Research, the percentage of U.S. imports from China has come down from a peak of just over 20% in 2018 to approximately 12% in 2024.', 'As we have observed, both cyclical and long-term factors make a compelling case for global equities. But what is the most effective way to invest in this asset class? While index investing is a common approach in U.S. equity markets, it may not be the best fit for international markets. Given the vast array of options, ‚Äúowning the entire market‚Äù in a broader geographic universe also means holding companies with weak fundamentals, such as low returns on invested capital, negative earnings, poor or stagnant earnings growth, and high debt levels.', 'Therefore, we advocate a more selective approach to global equity investing, one that emphasizes identifying businesses with sustainable competitive advantages. These strengths enable firms to demonstrate robust quality indicators, including high returns on invested capital (ROIC), free cash flow, and healthy margins‚Äîtraits that are characteristic of companies with a strong competitive ‚Äúmoat.‚Äù In fact, we have found that over the last decade, the top decile (top 10%) segment of the MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index, based on annual ROIC growth, outperformed the bottom decile by 57.4% (see Figure 3).', 'One final observation: Active management teams with deep and broad research and security valuation capabilities may be particularly well positioned to capitalize on the trends that could drive future growth across global equity markets.

In the real world, these factors eat into returns.', 'The core assumption is that physical assets, like Gold and Silver, will continue their historical behaviour in the future. However, their prices will be determined by supply and demand, which like most things, is unpredictable.', 'While our analysis goes back to the year 2000, Gold ETFs in India have only been available since 2007, and Silver ETFs even more recently since 2022. Until then, implementing such an allocation strategy would have required owning the metals physically, making yearly rebalancing significantly harder. Fortunately, ETFs have made it much easier for investors to gain exposure to precious metals in a portfolio.', ""This approach is not for those who constantly compare their portfolio's performance to the market. The optimal portfolios from our efficient frontier analysis both trail the Nifty on three- and five-year rolling returns nearly 60% of the time. Any multi-asset portfolio combining lower-return assets will lag equities over long periods, especially during bull markets. This can make the decision to allocate to staid assets like Gold appear foolish."", 'Holding uncorrelated assets like Gold and Silver can provide a psychological boost during equity market downturns. When stocks are plummeting, watching the value of your precious metals holdings rise can help you stay the course and avoid panic selling. As the saying goes, ‚ÄúPut 10% in Gold and hope it doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù', 'A portfolio primarily allocated to equities, supplemented by moderate Gold exposure, can offer not only more stable risk-adjusted returns but also potentially higher absolute returns with reduced drawdowns compared to a Nifty/Equities-only allocation strategy. Given its historical performance, Silver only merits a small allocation in constructing a low-volatility portfolio.', 'Ironically, the urge to switch all allocation to equities is strongest precisely when exposure to other assets is most needed. As the legendary investor Benjamin Graham advised, ‚ÄúThe best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you‚Äôre beating the market but by whether you‚Äôve put in place a financial plan and a behavioural discipline that are likely to get you where you want to go.‚Äù', 'As an investor, it‚Äôs worth asking yourself: Is my portfolio adequately prepared for future uncertainties? A judicious allocation to gold alongside equities may provide resilience and peace of mind to stay invested in the long run.', 'Anoop is on Twitter @CalmInvestor', 'Speak with a Capitalmind Client Advisor about a customised investment strategy consultation to see if Capitalmind PMS / AIF fits your long-term investment needs.', 'Deepak Shenoy', 'Krishna Appala', 'Anoop Vijaykumar', 'Deepak Shenoy', 'Make your money work as hard as you do.', 'Investing is not one size fits all', 'Learn more about our distinct investment strategies and how they fit into your portfolio.', 'Unlock your wealth potential', 'Start your journey today', 'Copyright ¬© 2024 Capitalmind Financial Services Private Limited‚Ä¢ All rights reserved', '(Formerly known as Wizemarkets Analytics Private Limited).', 'Capitalmind Wealth (PMS)', 'SEBI Regd.
