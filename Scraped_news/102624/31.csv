But it appears that Apple is going to start 2025 in a big way.', 'According to a new report by Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman, Apple is gearing up to start production of the M4 MacBook Air for a release in ‚Äúearly 2025.‚Äù How early? Gurman states that Apple has a December software update planned (likely macOS 15.2), and then after that, Apple will release the M4 MacBook Air between January and March of next year. The new MacBook Air will simply be a chip update from the M3 to the M4 for both the 13- and 15-inch models, which Gurman said have the codenames J713 and J715. The M4 MacBook Air release will come about a year after the M3 MacBook was released in March of this year.', 'Gurman also reports that the new Mac Studio once had a similar schedule as the M4 MacBook Air, but Apple has decided to push it back to a March or June release. The current Mac Studio, released in June 2023, features an M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip. It is presumed that Apple will outfit the new Mac Studio with M4 Max and M4 Ultra chips since the company is phasing out the M3 series. The rescheduling will mean the Mac Studio will go two years between updates.', 'Gurman reports that an M4 Mac Pro is still in the works but offered no updates on its release schedule. Gurman had previously reported that the M4 Mac Pro could be available in late 2025 or at WWDC in June at the earliest.', 'But the first half of 2025 isn‚Äôt just for the Mac. Gurman reports that for the ‚Äúspring product release cycle,‚Äù Apple plans to release ‚Äúa revamped iPhone SE, fresh iPad Air models and upgraded iPad keyboards‚Äù as well as the 11th-generation iPad. As heavily rumored, the iPhone SE will represent a complete redesign for the budget phone, with an iPhone 14-style design, Apple Intelligence support, and the first Apple-design modem.

It\'s not clear if the hands-on event will feature new Macs, but if it does, presumably Apple needs to announce the upcoming devices before journalists and influencers check them out.', 'The announcement could come that Wednesday or on Tuesday October 29, if Apple makes the announcement early.', 'Apple is inviting media/creators at different appointment times throughout the day on 10/30 in my town of LA ‚Äî they seemingly aren‚Äôt bringing a group together to watch a keynote video.

As exciting as that is for iPad fans, it's leaving many Mac fans wondering when their devices will get an M4 refresh."", 'On May 7, Apple unveiled its cutting-edge M4 chip designed to take AI capabilities on Apple Silicon to a new level, launching right in the heat of an AI boom in consumer tech. However, while the iPad Pro M4 is certainly a sleek device, Macs remain the preferred Apple products for power users.', 'Luckily, we may not have to wait much longer to see the M4 Mac line-up. In fact, Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman says Apple plans to release new M4-powered MacBook Pros, iMacs, and Mac mini models ""this year.""', ""Here's everything we know so far about the potential release window for the M4 Macs, the chips each model could get, and why Apple put the iPad first this year."", 'While Apple still has yet to officially announce the M4 Mac line-up, it did reveal macOS 15 ""Sequoia"" and Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024 on June 10. Both will run on upcoming M4 Macs, which we expect to see later this year, potentially as early as October 30 based on a rumor from Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman that Apple will host a hands-on experience on that date.', ""With Gurman's reliable track record, it's likely this claim is true. If Apple is indeed hosting a hands-on experience on October 30, new M4 Macs should be announced right before or at the event."", 'The most recent rumors about the M4 Macs hint that the first trio of models Apple launches will include the MacBook Pro M4, Mac Mini M4, and iMac M4 while the M4 MacBook Air, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio will arrive in 2025.', 'Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.', ""Here's a look at some of the recent news and rumors on the M4 Mac line-up:"", '', ""As surprising as it is to see the powerful M4 chip launch in an iPad first, the Mac might not be far behind. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple may be gearing up to announce the first M4 Macs at the end of the year with more to follow in 2025. His most recent prediction is that Apple plans to host a hands-on experience on October 30 ‚Äî that sounds like the perfect opportunity to unveil M4-powered Macs."", ""Considering Apple announced the first M3 Macs in October 2023, an October launch for M4 Macs makes the most sense. However, it's possible they could debut in early November as well."", 'The entire Mac line-up is getting an M4 makeover, too. There will reportedly be at least three varieties of the M4 chip, most likely following a similar pattern to the current M3 line-up, which includes the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max.', ""The M2 series had a fourth member, the M2 Ultra, which has yet to appear in M3 form. Apple may bring the Ultra back with the M4 series, although it likely won't arrive until 2025 if Apple still plans to release an M3 Ultra Mac."", 'In July 2024, Mark Gurman hinted that the group of M4 Macs launching in 2024 includes the MacBook Pro M4, Mac Mini M4, and iMac M4. The Mac Mini M4 is rumored to be the smallest computer Apple has ever released. The MacBook Air M4, Mac Pro M4, and Mac Studio M4 will follow sometime in the first half of 2025, most likely in either March or June.', 'For the MacBook Air M4 specifically, Gurman estimates it could launch between January and March 2025.', 'That means the M4 Mac line-up release dates could be as follows:', ""The highlight of the M4 generation is AI, so we can expect to see Apple show off on-device AI capabilities when they unveil the first M4 Macs. After all, Apple Intelligence ‚Äî Apple's new AI platform ‚Äî was first announced at WWDC 2024 in June and is finally set to debut in iOS 18.1 on October 28, just days before the rumored launch of M4 Macs. At an October 30 event, it'd be easy for Apple to show off new AI features on both iPhones and M4-powered Macs."", '', ""It's difficult to understate the importance of AI in the next generation of Apple products. While it was a little late to the party, Apple has joined the AI boom with the announcement of its new Apple Intelligence platform. This upcoming suite of AI features will roll out in stages over the next several months and into 2025, possibly even later."", 'In a recent interview between The Wall Street Journal and Craig Federighi, Apple\'s Senior VP of Software Engineering, it was made clear that Apple doesn\'t plan to rush out any of its AI features. Federighi told the WSJ: ""This is a many-year, honestly, even decadeslong arc of this technology playing out, and so we‚Äôre going to do it responsibly.""', ""Despite the potentially long waiting period for all Apple Intelligence features to roll out, it'll no doubt play a major role in Apple's plans for the M4 Macs."", ""When Apple announced Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, it focused heavily on privacy and security, which have become major concerns after controversy surrounding leaders in the AI world like OpenAI. Privacy has always been a top priority for Apple, so it's no surprise that the company is making it a central part of its AI plans."", ""However, making AI completely private is no small feat. The best strategy for ensuring privacy is keeping all of the AI's processing on the user's device (that is, no data gets sent to a cloud server where it might be saved, exposed, or exploited). The only challenge is, on-device AI requires quite a bit of processing power."", '', ""That's where Apple's M-series chips come in. Apple has been slowly beefing up the neural processing units (NPUs) in its M-series chips, which means these chips are getting better and better at processing AI tasks all by themselves ‚Äî no cloud servers required."", ""NPU performance got a slight nod in Apple's announcement for the M4 chip in May with the new iPad Pro's arrival, but it will probably be a star of the show in the M4 Mac presentation since people are far more likely to use a Mac for AI tasks than an iPad."", 'The first round of Apple Intelligence features is out on macOS 15 as of October 21. With the iOS 15.1 update, users can take advantage of basic Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools, Smart Replies, Clean Up in Photos, an enhanced Siri, and more.', 'With Apple Intelligence features live on M3 Macs before M4-powered Macs debut, Apple will want to emphasize that the M4 Macs have the strongest on-device AI performance yet, both to promote the new Macs and encourage people to try out Apple Intelligence.', 'The M4 Pro and M4 Max chips will also likely get a greater NPU performance boost to offer even more AI processing power.', '', ""Since the launch of Apple Silicon in 2020, Apple has announced new M-series chips in Mac devices first. So it's perplexing that Apple chose to start with the iPad for the M4 generation."", ""One possible reason for this unusual release schedule could simply be awkward timing. Apple launched the first round of M3 Macs in October 2023, but it didn't release any new iPads in 2023. Rather than launching an M4 Mac only 7 months later, Apple opted for a new iPad Pro instead."", ""Plus, it was no secret back in May that several of Apple's competitors were getting ready to launch devices with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, one of the only AI processors that can compete with the M4 chip. Apple likely wanted to announce the M4 chip before the first devices with the Snapdragon X Elite hit shelves, which happened in mid-June, just days after WWDC 2024."", 'Due to the timing of its Mac release schedule, starting with an M4 Mac may have been technologically unfeasible and could have hurt M3 Mac sales. The iPad, on the other hand, was long overdue for a refresh.', ""The iPad is also a less complicated device than the Mac line-up, particularly the high-end Macs. The iPad doesn't need the more powerful versions of the M4 chip like the M4 Pro or Max. By starting with the iPad, Apple was able to get the M4 generation out the door while still giving its product development teams more time to get the more powerful versions of the M4 chip ready for the Mac line-up."", ""While Mac fans may be disappointed they won't be getting the M4 chips first, it looks like they won't have to wait much longer. We'll be covering all the latest rumors and news on the M4 Macs, Apple Silicon, and Apple Intelligence, so stay tuned for more info."", 'Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in keyboards, peripherals, gaming gear, and mobile tech.

Along with recent rumors surrounding production of the M4 MacBook Air, it looks like it could be a very exciting week for Apple fans - so here‚Äôs what we expect to see."", '', 'With Apple‚Äôs M4 Pro and Max chips yet to be unveiled, this upcoming showcase could be the ideal opportunity to show off the powerful M4 variants, especially as the M4 MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch models will almost certainly be revealed, with Apple hopefully highlighting the major performance leap from the previous M3 Pro and Max chips.', 'Russian YouTuber Wylascom supposedly leaked a new model of the MacBook Pro that comes with the standard M4 chip, which if legitimate, means the base configuration of the laptop will utilize a 10-core CPU and GPU just like the M4 iPad Pro, as opposed to the M3‚Äôs 8-core CPU, potentially indicating a new focus on Apple Intelligence (the company‚Äôs fledgling attempt at artificial intelligence) - though Wylascom‚Äôs info should of course be taken with a grain of salt.', 'The one change over last year‚Äôs M3 version we do hope to see is that the base model of any new MacBook Pro comes with at least 16GB of unified memory rather than 8GB - this will be highly beneficial for gaming, which is becoming a prominent new focus for Mac devices with recent releases like the Resident Evil 4 remake. Of course, any laptop that‚Äôs marketed at content creators and professionals in 2024 really shouldn‚Äôt be coming with just 8GB of memory.', 'Expected alongside the M4 MacBook Pro reveal is a redesigned M4 Mac mini, with Apple‚Äôs plans to make it the smallest computer it has made - at least, as reported by Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman (who has a strong reputation as a reliable leaker of all-things Apple). Its size is expected to be similar to the Apple TV, which should prove to be highly beneficial for those looking for sleek desktop setups.', 'Fortunately, its unified memory will reportedly be starting at 16GB, and maxing out at 32GB. As we mentioned earlier, 8GB of RAM for Windows PCs and Macs has been criticized as underpowered for a long while, and it will be great to see Apple finally step away from this trend for its M4-powered devices.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', '', 'Gurman‚Äôs reporting (amongst other leaks) has suggested that we‚Äôll also be getting an updated iMac as part of next week‚Äôs slate of reveals. Besides the M4 chip itself, there isn‚Äôt much we can tell you about the upcoming iMac - although the good news is that Apple is also reportedly ready to unveil its new Magic accessories, which will include a new Magic Mouse.', 'With the M4 iMac, we would love to see 16GB of unified memory as standard here as well - the M3 model was configurable up to 16GB or 32GB, but the base model only had 8GB, and we really hope that Apple doesn‚Äôt repeat this.', 'As we mentioned earlier, the M4 MacBook Air is almost definitely still coming - in fact, it‚Äôs rumored to be the top priority for Apple‚Äôs 2025 release schedule. This makes sense considering the recent poor sales of Mac products, and how popular the MacBook Air is - Apple will likely be keen to announce a new and improved version of its biggest laptop seller as soon as possible (without annoying anyone who has recently bought the M3 model).', 'As reported by Mark Gurman, the M4 MacBook Air will reportedly remain the same in terms of its design, with the M4 chip being the only major alteration.', 'This is good news for anyone looking forward to buying a MacBook Air. The difference between 8GB and 16GB unified memory models was very significant on the M3 model, so expect the same to apply to the incoming M4 MacBook Air.', '', 'Finally, since Apple‚Äôs focus is supposedly zeroed in on M4 MacBook Air production for early 2025, the somewhat unloved chunky boy that is the Mac Studio is expected to arrive with M4 at a later date (again, according to Gurman‚Äôs sources). The Mac Studio is essentially a powerful mini PC that looks like a bulkier Mac mini, but aimed at creative professionals. It was claimed to be in simultaneous production alongside the MacBook Air, but this has apparently changed - the current expectation is between March and June, so not too long after the MacBook Air.', 'Do you have a particular Mac product you‚Äôre looking forward to? Be sure to let us know on social media - for Apple, the new MacBook Pro is doubtless the main event planned for this incoming ‚Äòweek of announcements‚Äô, but to be honest we‚Äôre more interested in a reimagined Mac mini if it‚Äôs truly set to be the smallest computer from Apple.', ""Isaiah is a Staff Writer for the Computing channel at TechRadar.

It had long been rumored that Apple would release M4-powered iMacs, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros and a redesigned Mac mini by early 2025, and now it appears to be doing so ahead of the peak holiday shopping season.', ""New hardware isn't the only thing Apple has lined up for next week.

He continues to expect the next Mac mini to feature a ""revamped"" design, in line with his previous reporting that said the new model will be nearly as small as an Apple TV and gain two front-facing USB-C ports.', 'No major design changes are rumored for the next MacBook Pro and iMac models, but the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to gain an additional Thunderbolt port compared to the current model, based on alleged leaks earlier this month.', 'It\'s not entirely clear if Apple plans to hold an online event this month, like its ""Scary Fast"" event on October 30 last year, or if the new Macs will be announced with Apple Newsroom press releases only like the iPad mini 7.

The debate traces back to 2012 when Apple introduced the first Retina MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM as standard. Remarkably, Apple still continues to offer 8GB as the base memory configuration for several models, including the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 iMac, and M3 MacBook Airs.', ""However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Apple is testing four new Mac models equipped with an M4 chip, and all of them have either 16GB or 32GB of unified memory. Gurman previously reported that Apple is planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac with M4 chips this year. One possibility is that Apple has deemed that 16GB of RAM should be the new workable minimum for future AI features introduced under the Apple Intelligence banner, but that is merely speculation at this point."", ""Last year, Apple introduced a base 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, which replaced the discontinued M2 13-inch MacBook Pro in Apple's Mac lineup.

Users can opt for 16GB or 24GB at checkout, but these configuration options cost an extra $200 and $400 at purchase, respectively, and cannot be upgraded at a later date because of Apple's unified memory architecture."", 'This has left Apple open to criticism from users who believe that 8GB is not a sufficient amount of RAM for most creative professional workflows, and that 16GB should be the bare minimum for a machine that is marketed as ""Pro,"" rather than an additional several hundred dollar outlay. Apple previously argued that 8GB on an M3 MacBook Pro is probably analogous to 16GB on other computers because of the efficiency gains of using unified architecture.

Here's what I said back in 2022:"", '""I did think about buying the M1 Ultra model simply to future-proof the machine for a few more years.

Mac Minis, way back in 2012, had an SD card slot on the back. It was inconvenient to get to, and Apple discontinued it. But then, after many years, Apple put an SD card slot on the front of the device of a Mac Studio.

That's what I did for years. But the extra cable and dongle add to the clutter on my desktop, and that simple slot right in front is just so convenient."", ""So that's it. I'm probably not going to buy the new M4 Mac Mini. I'll probably hold off six months or more until the new Mac Studio comes out.

The M4 also includes an improved Neural Engine that fuels accelerated AI workloads.

I just broke the first rule of buying Apple products ‚Äî I bought a new Mac Mini ahead of the M4 Mac launch,https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/desktop-computers/i-just-broke-the-first-rule-of-buying-apple-products-i-bought-a-new-mac-mini-ahead-of-the-m4-mac-launch,"['Sometimes you just have to try things out for yourself', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.', 'Apple is expected to announce a brand new, completely redesigned Mac mini M4 early next week. However, last Friday, I finally decided to pick up a Mac mini for myself after eying up Cupertino‚Äôs smallest Mac for what seems like ages.', 'It‚Äôs not everyday I outright buy a new computer, though I do get a chance to try out a lot of different machines as part of my job testing and reviewing the best mini PCs. The problem is that there‚Äôs one very iconic mini PC I just haven‚Äôt had a chance to try yet and come next week, the Mac mini M2 will likely be completely overshadowed by this new model.', 'Just like with the best iPhones, you definitely don‚Äôt want to pick up a new Mac days ahead of the release of its successor, especially since Apple products tend to remain at or around their launch price for years. However, when I found out that this was the year that Apple would finally give the Mac mini‚Äôs design a major revamp while ditching its USB-A ports, I figured what did I have to lose.', 'To that end, I ordered the base model of the Mac mini M2 as I also wanted to put the company‚Äôs claims about 8GB of RAM being enough for most people to the test. I did consider upgrading to 16GB of RAM but that configuration needs to be ordered directly from Apple with a longer wait time if you don‚Äôt want to end up overpaying a third-party seller online. Fortunately, we might soon be able to put this debate to rest once and for all as the base models of its M4 Macs will reportedly ship with 16GB of RAM as the new standard. I guess we‚Äôll find out next week.', 'As for me, I just spent a week with the base Mac Mini M2 after not having used macOS for almost 20 years. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still a great mini PC even if it‚Äôs about to be replaced by something even smaller and much more powerful thanks to the addition of Apple‚Äôs M4 chip.', '', 'While the Mac mini got its iconic aluminum unibody redesign back in 2010, the original version was first introduced by Steve Jobs all the way back in 2005. At that time, Jobs described it as ‚Äúvery, very tiny‚Äù and the ‚Äúmini‚Äù in its name actually comes from the iPod mini.', 'Before the Mac mini, Apple sold desktops, all-in-one computers and laptops but not a device that was ‚ÄúBYODKM‚Äù or bring your own display, keyboard and mouse. The reasoning behind this new Mac not shipping with a mouse and keyboard was that people likely already had their own accessories and being able to use them on their new computer made it a lot easier to switch from Windows to Mac.', 'The Mac mini has changed quite a lot over the years too. The original had a white polycarbonate plastic top, aluminum sides and a disc drive. The top eventually became aluminum as well and the disc drive became unnecessary as the years went by too.', 'Mac mini M2: was $599 now $500 @ Amazon\nThe Mac mini M2 is the most affordable Mac you can get and right now, you can save $100 off the base model with an M2 chip, 8GB unified memory and a 256GB SSD. While there aren‚Äôt any ports on the front, around back you get two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, a headphone jack and an Ethernet port.', 'In the coming days, we‚Äôll likely see an even smaller Mac mini as it‚Äôs rumored to sport similar dimensions to the current Apple TV. It could also be a bit taller though, which would make it look a lot more like a scaled down version of the Mac Studio. The resemblance will be even more striking if Apple adds extra ports to the Mac mini M4‚Äôs front panel like some recent reports have suggested it will.', '', 'Besides the upgrade to an M4 chip and a smaller footprint overall, the other big change we‚Äôre likely to see with the Mac mini M4 is with its ports. Yes, we‚Äôre potentially getting more of them but at a steep cost ‚Äî at least in my opinion. While the standard Mac mini M2 has two Thunderbolt ports and two USB-A ports, the Mac mini M2 Pro (pictured above) has four Thunderbolt ports.', 'With the Mac mini M4, Apple is apparently going to get rid of the device‚Äôs USB-A ports altogether and go with five Thunderbolt ports instead. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love USB-C as it‚Äôs a huge improvement over Micro USB but I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for USB-A. Going from USB-A to USB-C is great for things like connecting external displays or charging, but the same can‚Äôt be said when it comes to accessories.', 'If you switch between computers as often as I do, unpairing and then repairing Bluetooth devices gets to be quite annoying. This is why I often use 2.4 Ghz USB dongles with the best mechanical keyboards and my trusty trackball mouse when possible. That way, I just unplug the dongle on one machine and then plug it into another and I‚Äôm ready to go.', 'This switch from USB-A to all USB-C ports is one of the reasons I picked up a Mac mini M2, even though I‚Äôve been eagerly awaiting the release of the Mac mini M4. However, since the design of the Mac mini has remained unchanged for more than a decade, there are a lot of great accessories for it and this was the other reason I wanted to try out this particular Mac.', '', 'In order to make the Mac mini work for me, I was going to need some more ports as well as a microSD card reader. Fortunately, there are several docks and hubs that do just this. However, none of them look quite as clean and mesh with the Mac mini as well as the Satechi Mac Mini Hub.', 'It slides right under your Mac mini ‚Äî or even your Mac Studio ‚Äî to give you extra ports on the front of your computer. In total, you get a USB-C port, three USB-A ports, a microSD and SD card reader and a headphone jack that‚Äôs easier to reach. There are also two versions: one with a slot for an M.2 SSD on the bottom and a slightly cheaper one that you can‚Äôt add extra storage too.', '', 'Satechi sent over the former for me to test out after I did a story on adding their aluminum USB headphone stand to my desk setup. Before going through the setup process on my new Mac mini M2, I flipped over the USB hub and used the included tiny screwdriver to add a 1TB M.2 SSD to the bottom. This took only a minute or so to do but now, I wouldn‚Äôt be limited by the 256GB SSD on my base model Mac mini nor would I need to invest in more iCloud storage.', '', 'The best part, you get all these extra ports and card readers and you only have to give up one Thunderbolt port on the back. This worked out perfectly for me as I planned on using the Mac mini‚Äôs HDMI port to connect to an ultrawide monitor and the other Thunderbolt port with a portable monitor for a quick and easy dual-monitor setup. Also, the non-pro Mac mini M2 only supports two external displays anyway.', 'Satechi Mac Mini Hub & Stand with SSD Enclosure: was $99 now $89 @ Amazon\nThis hub from Satechi goes under your Mac mini or Mac Studio to give you more ports and you can even install a M.2 SSD on the bottom. All of these extra ports are on the front so they‚Äôre easy to reach and this hub is powered by a single Thunderbolt port on the back of your Mac.', '', 'Instead of swapping out the Acemagic F2A mini PC that‚Äôs currently set up at my main desk, I decided to build a new desk setup from the ground up just for the Mac mini M2. This way I‚Äôd always be able to run back to the comfort of my office if the Spinning Wait Cursor ‚Äî also known as the Spinning Beach Ball of Death (SBBOD) ‚Äî did me in. And this was a very real possibility given the sheer amount of Chrome tabs I have open at a time while working.', 'For this particular desk setup, I used one of the best standing desks from Uppeal. I figured the company‚Äôs 2 Leg Desk ($1,129, Uppeal) would help me channel my inner Steve Jobs as it‚Äôs one of the only desks you can use while sitting on the floor which he was known for doing in Apple‚Äôs early days. I paired this desk with one of the best office chairs in case floor sitting wasn‚Äôt for me though and I thought the black and white design of X-Chair‚Äôs XS-Vision chair ($599, X-Chair) was a perfect fit for this setup.', '', 'I initially thought going back to macOS after almost two decades of using Windows exclusively would be difficult but surprisingly, it was a lot like getting back on a bike for the first time in ages. That iconic Mac startup sound hit me with a wave of nostalgia and it reminded me of turning on my Power Mac G4 for the first time back in 2001.', 'Once the initial setup process was complete, I reacquainted myself with macOS. From the Menu Bar at the top to the Dock at the bottom of my screen, I was reminded of all things I used to love about my big old Mac desktop. After I started dragging apps into the operating system‚Äôs Applications folder and I mounted my recently installed 1TB SSD on the Mac mini‚Äôs desktop, I was ready to start using Apple‚Äôs smallest Mac for work.\n\nI started off pretty easy by checking my email, jumping on a few video calls with the rest of the Tom‚Äôs Guide team and doing some research on upcoming stories. Just like with my Windows PCs though, I wanted to use this computer the way I liked which is why I downloaded and installed Chrome instead of switching to Safari. Fortunately, Google added a Memory Saver mode to its browser a few years back but even with it turned on, I knew I was getting close to the threshold of my Mac mini‚Äôs available RAM. To be sure, I pulled up the Activity Monitor app every now and then and as I thought, I was using 7 out of 8GB of RAM.', '', 'The switch from using my favorite Windows keyboard shortcuts to their Mac equivalents threw me through a bit of a loop too. I knew this would be difficult though, so I used my favorite mechanical keyboard for traveling as it has both operating system‚Äôs key names on the bottom row. I do have a NuPhy Air60 on hand too but in the rush to build a desk, assemble a chair and get everything set up, I didn‚Äôt want to be bothered with switching keycaps. I might do that later on though as the Ukvey C68 keyboard ($40, Amazon) pales in comparison to one of NuPhy‚Äôs low-profile keyboards.', 'Another thing that threw me off at first was not having native window snapping like in Windows or even ChromeOS. To that end, I downloaded and set up Rectangle before remembering that Apple had in fact added window snapping with the release of macOS Sequoia just last month.', 'So did I make a mistake by buying a Mac mini M2 just days ahead of the Mac mini M4‚Äôs launch? Kind of. Buyer‚Äôs remorse could set in big time next week but given my penchant for USB-A ports, I still think the older design of the Mac mini M2 is the right choice for me. Granted though, I definitely should have gone with the M2 Pro version for the extra RAM and larger storage.', 'I still have a few days left to make my final decision but part of me really just wants to return the base model Mac mini M2 and splurge a bit on the Mac mini M2 Pro. Overall, I really do prefer smaller mini PCs but I can‚Äôt justify a thinner and lighter device at the cost of a very standard port that‚Äôs been going strong for 28 years now. Then again, I‚Äôm sure Satechi and other Mac accessory makers are already working on similar hubs for the Mac mini M4.', 'We‚Äôll see, maybe Apple can convince me that the Mac mini M4 really is the better choice after all. For that though, I‚Äôd need to see an actual presentation instead of learning about the new iPad mini like I did in a press release earlier this week. Fingers crossed we get an epic MacBook Air-style reveal for the Mac mini M4 after a ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù from Tim Cook.', 'Either way, I‚Äôm glad I took the time to give macOS another shot after all these years and one way or another, I plan on living a multi-OS life going forward to get the best from both Windows and Mac.', 'Here at Tom‚Äôs Guide our expert editors are committed to bringing you the best news, reviews and guides to help you stay informed and ahead of the curve!', 'Anthony Spadafora is the security and networking editor at Tom‚Äôs Guide where he covers everything from data breaches and ransomware gangs to password managers and the best way to cover your whole home or business with Wi-Fi.

Among the new models, which include a redesigned Mac mini, will be the first refresh to the entry-level MacBook Pro released next year. Normally, such an update would be nothing more than a chip upgrade from the M3 to the M4. But a series of reports claim that there will be more to this update‚Äìand could make the 14-inch base model a near-perfect laptop for just about everyone.', 'The first report was by leaker VNChocoTaco on X, who posted a photo they received of the box label for the new MacBook Pro revealing key specs. The second report is from Russian YouTuber Wylsacom, who apparently got their hands on the M4 MacBook Pro, laptop and all.', 'If the information in these two reports holds up, and it would be a very elaborate hoax if it doesn‚Äôt, we could be seeing some big changes in the base M4 MacBook Pro. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs being reported and what it could mean.', 'The current base M3 14-inch MacBook Pro has one glaring problem: It has only 8GB of unified memory. Apple will tell you that‚Äôs more than enough and 8GB is useable and for many buyers that‚Äôs probably true. But considering how much RAM higher-end software uses nowadays, 8GB in a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù laptop is not enough. Still not convinced? How about this: The MacBook Air, Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù laptop, the laptop for ‚Äúeveryone else,‚Äù also starts at 8GB of memory. The MacBook Pro is supposed to be the workstation laptop for, as the name says, the ‚ÄúPro.‚Äù The other models all start at 18GB‚Äîdoes 8GB seem proper for a MacBook that costs $1,599?', 'Both reports by VNChocoTaco and Wylsacom show what appears to be a specifications label from the base M3 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, that shows a laptop with 16GB of memory. Assuming the model isn‚Äôt a higher-end configuration, that would mean Apple is finally addressing the biggest flaw of the entry-level Pro. With 16GB of RAM, pro users will be able to run their apps and feel comfortable about the laptop‚Äôs performance‚Äìthey may still need more and upgrade to 24GB or more, and even then, it won‚Äôt be as expensive as starting from a standard configuration is 8GB.', 'VNChocoTaco‚Äôs photo is low resolution and much of the text is garbled, but it seems to show that the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro will have three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Wylsacom‚Äôs label says the same and he shows off the laptop‚Äôs three ports in his video. This seems to indicate that Apple is adding one more Thunderbolt/USB 4 to the base M4 model. This would put the laptop in line with the higher-end MacBook Pro models with Pro and Max chips; it would no longer have the same two ports as the MacBook Air, another step toward making it an actual ‚ÄúPro‚Äù laptop.', 'When Apple introduced the M3 MacBook Pro, it revealed a new Space Black color option available only on the M3 Pro or M3 Max models. According to these reports, Apple is going to make Space Black an option on the base model, too.', 'I‚Äôm currently using a Space Black MacBook Pro, and my first impression of the color was that it was nice, but it should be darker. But after having used the laptop for nearly a year now, I love Space Black and it‚Äôs now my color of choice. If it‚Äôs coming to the M4 MacBook Pro, it‚Äôs going to be a popular choice‚Äîand put the entry-level model on par with the others.', 'There are other specs revealed by these reports, such as the M4‚Äôs 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and the same starting 512GB SSD. But the three changes above are going to make the base M4 MacBook Pro a popular laptop‚Äìespecially if Apple keeps the price at $1,599.', 'It would be the first time in a long time that buying the least-expensive MacBook Pro didn‚Äôt mean you had to make a significant compromise, such as the 8GB of RAM, fewer ports, hampered performance, or even an old design, as was the case when Apple kept the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar around after the Apple silicon redesign was announced.', 'If and then this MacBook Pro does ship, it will fit right in with the M4 Pro and M4 Max models in the lineup and give users a real choice, rather than force them to the upper models due to cut-rate specs.

This will allow for a better performance for Apple Intelligence features.', '', '', 'Apple is planning to launch a new MacBook Air device featuring the latest M4 chip by early 2025, according to Bloomberg. Production of the updated models is expected to commence soon, with the launch likely to take place between January and March next year.', 'The previous MacBook Air was updated in March 2023 with the M3 chip, and Apple had also introduced a 15-inch variant powered by the M2 chip in June 2023.', '']"
Apple‚Äôs M4 Macs are set for an 'imminent' launch in the coming days,https://www.techradar.com/computing/apples-m4-macs-are-still-set-for-an-imminent-launch-in-the-coming-days,"[""We now seemingly have a date for Apple's media event"", 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works.', ""We‚Äôve been eagerly anticipating updated M4 Macs for what seems like months now ‚Äì and the recent iPad mini 7 launch has sparked some concern that Apple might be running out of time to launch the devices in 2024. Fortunately, they are still on track to arrive soon, according to a prominent leaker who's now revealed what could be the date of Apple's media event."", 'The ‚Äúimminent‚Äù updates are coming to the MacBook Pro, the iMac, and the Mac mini, according to Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman, who frequently shares accurate information about Apple‚Äôs future plans and releases. And he\'s now revealed on X (formerly Twitter) in a new post that Apple is ""inviting media/creators at different appointment times throughout the day on 10/30 in my town of LA"".', 'It seems that event on October 30 isn\'t for a keynote video, with the announcement instead likely to be ""online only (video and press releases)"". If that date is for hands-on experiences of the new devices, it means the M4 Macs will likely be announced sometime before that date ‚Äì most likely early next week.', 'In a further sign that upgrades are on the way, Gurman earlier stated that ‚Äúinventory at Apple retail stores is very low on iMacs, Mac mini and MacBook Pros, Magic Keyboards, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad.‚Äù This is often a sign that Apple is planning to replace these existing products with new versions, and it‚Äôs something that Gurman himself has previously reported on.', 'Indeed, there have also been claims that the peripherals Gurman mentions ‚Äì the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad ‚Äì are also due for an update. This would make a lot of sense, since Apple still hasn‚Äôt outfitted them with USB-C ports, which it has recently added to the majority of its other devices.', '', 'Gurman had previously predicted that Apple would release new Macs fitted with M4 chips on or around November 1. This left little time for Apple to host an in-person Mac event, given how little time it would give attendees to organize travel, so an online event looked on the cards ‚Äì and that now looks even more likely.', 'This is the approach the company took for its Scary Fast event last October, which was also focused on new Mac releases.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', 'Alternatively, Apple might decide to simply announce its new M4 Macs using a series of press releases. This might seem odd given that the Mac mini is expected to get an all-new design, as you‚Äôd think Apple would want to spend time on-stage showing off the product‚Äôs new look.', 'But Apple has already introduced the M4 chip ‚Äì it arrived in the latest iPad Pro in May 2024 ‚Äì so one of the biggest changes in the upcoming Macs has already been known to the world for the last six months. Perhaps that means an event isn‚Äôt necessary.', 'However Apple decides to reveal its new Mac lineup, it seems these devices are still coming in the near future ‚Äì keep your eyes peeled for more news in the next week.', ""Alex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

Apple presents new Macs from Monday: Announced per X,https://www.heise.de/en/news/Apple-presents-new-Macs-from-Monday-Announced-per-X-9994092.html,"['New MacBooks with M4, Mac mini and iMac ‚Äì expectations are high. However, there will not be a real event, but instead a ""Week of the Mac"".', 'Screenshot from the video by Greg Joswiak: The logo winks.', '(Image: Greg Joswiak, Screenshot: heise online)', 'Apple\'s global head of marketing Greg Joswiak has promised a ""week full of exciting announcements"" about new Macs on Platform X starting next Monday (October 28, 2024). This is unusual in several respects, as Apple\'s main accounts usually announce such events themselves, and the product launches are usually made in a single major event ‚Äì or via a simple press release.', 'It is not clear from the post in what form the new Macs will be presented, whether only via video or perhaps in several live events. However, the fact that there were no invitations for a press event speaks against this. However, there will probably be an event for ""Creator"" in Los Angeles next week, as was reported this week.', ""Since Joswiak explicitly alludes to Macs, at least the direction is clear: Apple's latest SoC, the M4, was also introduced in the iPad Pro back in May, so it's high time to bring it to Macs too."", 'The announcement was obviously necessary for Apple because rumors have been piling up in recent weeks. A new Macbook Pro, an iMac and a redesigned Mac mini are said to be on the agenda. The latter is expected to be much smaller than its predecessors, which have remained unchanged for around ten years, and offer five USB-C ports. All computers are to be equipped with Apple Intelligence, which is also to be launched in the form of updates to the operating systems (iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1) on October 28, 2024.', 'It is not yet known whether Apple will also update the expensive professional devices Mac Studio and Mac Pro to the M4. According to earlier reports, this will not be the case until next year. However, the aforementioned ""Creator Event"", which according to earlier reports by Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman Apple has planned for next Wednesday in LA, could at least theoretically be used for this ‚Äì or the other three new Mac series could be shown. However, Apple is sparing itself an event in Cupertino, at its headquarters, this time. The iPad mini 7 was only presented in a press release.', 'Mit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.', 'Ich bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.
