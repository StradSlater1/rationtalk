I think if we win three more games, Freddie’s is going to be right up there with it.”"", 'The parallels between the two magical moments are uncanny.

These are the teams that last coexisted in the Fall Classic in 1981, when the Dodgers’ rotation was led by a rookie phenom named Fernando Valenzuela.', 'History pulsates in the postseason, all the more when iconic clubs clash. And Valenzuela’s death earlier this week only added to the emotional heft of what is taking place here.

Ohtani rocketed a Tommy Kahnle changeup for a double off the top of the right-center field wall. Juan Soto’s one-hop throw back to the infield bounced off Gleyber Torres’ glove, and Ohtani was able to advance to third.', ""“Difficult bounce,” Torres said. “I'm just trying to cover the cutoff and realized the ball was back to Soto really quick, and just tried to get back to the base and make a tag.”"", 'Betts then drove Ohtani in on a sac fly to center field, and the score was tied at 2.', 'Moments after his error, Torres sparked the most interesting “defensive play” of the evening, when his long fly ball to left-center in the top of the ninth found the glove of a fan positioned at the wall in the pavilion seats. Because the fan had clearly reached over the wall to make the snag, it was ruled -- and upheld on replay review -- a ground-rule double rather than a go-ahead homer. In a gutsy move, the Dodgers intentionally walked Soto to face Aaron Judge with two aboard, and Blake Treinen came on to get Judge to harmlessly pop out to end the inning.', 'This became the third consecutive World Series Game 1 to go to extra innings, and, thanks to Jazz Chisholm Jr.’s single and two stolen bases, the Yankees had runners on the corners with one out in the 10th. When Anthony Volpe grounded to short, Edman made a nice diving stop on the ball but had trouble with the transfer and couldn’t complete a potential double play. Chisholm motored home.', 'So the Yankees took a 3-2 lead into the bottom of the 10th. Ohtani came to the plate with two on and one out.

Greatest World Series Game 1 ever? Freddie Freeman provides jaw-dropping end to epic Dodgers-Yankees opener,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/greatest-world-series-game-1-ever-freddie-freeman-provides-jaw-dropping-end-to-epic-dodgers-yankees-opener/,"['', ""LOS ANGELES -- I'm still in awe. My jaw is on the Dodger Stadium floor. Did we all just witness the best Game 1 in World Series history? "", ""It's entirely possible. I can't in good conscience declare it the best World Series game ever because there was no one facing elimination. The best World Series games are Game 7s (1960, 1991, 2014, 2016, etc.). There were some other elite-tier games later in the series in recent memory (how about 2011 Game 6?). But holy smokes, what more could we have asked for from Game 1 of the 2024 World Series between the Dodgers and the Yankees? "", ""To use a quote from another historic Game 1 in this ballpark -- and we'll get to that -- I don't believe what I just saw."", ""The win probability chart after the fifth inning resembles the Rocky Mountains, where we'll be crossing hopefully twice this series. "", ""I was going to say I'm not even sure where to begin, but we have to begin where it ended, obviously, the swing that made the scoreboard read Dodgers 6, Yankees 3. Freddie Freeman was on one leg in the NLCS. He has a sprained right ankle and the smart money is on him not making it to the end of the series if it's a long one. "", 'He moved gingerly in warmups this afternoon. Five hours later, he hit the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history. ', 'Yes, the World Series has been played every year since 1905 and there were even nine before that. This is the 120th World Series and there has never before been the play that we just witnessed to end the instant classic that was Game 1. ', ""If this wasn't the greatest Game 1 in World Series, perhaps it was another hobbled player right here in Dodger Stadium hitting a walk-off homer. Yep, this one definitely felt at least a little reminiscent of Kirk Gibson's legendary game-winning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers against the A's."", 'Freeman was asked about the Gibson homer after the game. ', '""I played the whole game, though,"" he joked, as Gibson was only a pinch hitter in his timeless moment. ', ""It is amazing to consider two of the greatest Game 1s in World Series history both happened in Dodger Stadium with MVPs (Gibson won his in 1988, though Freeman's was back in 2020) hitting hobbled home runs. "", ""To be fair, last year's Game 1 was pretty incredible, too, with Corey Seager's game-tying homer in the ninth leading to Adolis García's walk-off homer in the 10th, but let's be real: That series included an 84-win Diamondbacks team. This one has the two No. 1 seeds in the playoffs and arguably baseball's two biggest brands. We're going to find out the ratings pretty soon, but -- spoiler alert -- they're going to be very high compared to any recent World Series. To all the casual fans out there who rarely watch baseball: It isn't always this awesome, but the 2024 World Series was always bound to deliver and then some. These are great and relatively evenly matched teams. "", 'Just look at all the big moments in this one. ', 'Starting pitchers Jack Flaherty and Gerrit Cole put zeroes on the board against two totally loaded offense through four-and-a-half innings. The Dodgers were able to get a run in the fifth, but then big Giancarlo Stanton crushed a two-run homer in the top of the sixth to give the Yankees a 2-1 lead. ', 'It actually looked like that score might hold, but then Shohei Ohtani sent a rocket to right field in the bottom of the eighth. Gleyber Torres misplayed the throw into second base and that allowed Ohtani to take third. He came home on a sac fly. ', ""The Ohtani shot looked like it might be a game-tying homer off the bat, but he came home nonetheless. In the top of the ninth, it looked like Gleyber Torres might've hit the go-ahead home run, but it was actually robbed by a Dodgers fan. It was correctly ruled a double with fan interference, but surely many Yankees fans had visions of Jeffrey Maier, making it another memorable moment. Torres would be stranded. "", 'And then we went to extra innings for the third straight World Series Game 1. How about that? ', ""The Yankees grabbed a run after Jazz Chisholm Jr. stole second and third. He had three steals in the game, becoming the first player to ever do so in his World Series debut. He's rendered to a footnote now. "", 'With one out in the bottom of the 10th, Gavin Lux drew a walk, meaning only a double play would prevent Shohei Ohtani from coming to the plate as the winning run. Yankees pitcher Jake Cousins got his groundball, but Oswaldo Cabrera at second -- in for Torres -- had to dive for the grounder and misplayed it. Everyone was safe and two runners were on for Ohtani. ', ""The Yankees then brought in Nestor Cortes, who hadn't yet pitched in the playoffs due to injury. He got Ohtani to foul out on an incredible play by left fielder Alex Verdugo, who fell into the netting. It was a big deal, because him falling into the net allowed the runners to move up to second and third. With a lefty on the mound, Mookie Betts coming to the plate and lefty-swinging/hobbled Freeman coming to the plate, it seemed like an easy decision to walk Betts. "", 'Then Freeman hit his first home run since Sept. 16. He didn\'t even have an extra-base hit in the playoffs before his ""triple"" (it should\'ve been a double and an error on Verdugo) in the first inning in this one. With that injured ankle, he loses some power from his swing. It just didn\'t seem realistic to imagine he\'d be able to park one. ', ""And yet he did just that, crushing a 92.5 mph fastball 409 feet. If the Dodgers win this World Series, that will go down in history alongside Gibson's unlikely blast in 1988, but this game was more than just one swing of the bat. "", ""Man, we saw everything. Great pitching. Great defensive plays. Defensive gaffes. Big-time home runs, including one that'll go down as legend. It was a signature moment. "", ""Dodgers manager Dave Roberts once had one of those. Remember, he stole a base that led to a Red Sox comeback in Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS. His steal started a chain reaction that led to one of the most famous series comebacks in sports. And yet, he says Game 1 of the 2024 World Series might be the biggest thing he's ever seen. "", '""It\'s arguably one of the -- might be the greatest baseball moment I\'ve ever witnessed, and I\'ve witnessed some great ones,"" Roberts said after the game. ""... Just pure elation. You don\'t see teams celebrate after a game, a walk-off like that, but I just think it was certainly warranted. Man, it was a great game before that, but the way it finished, I just couldn\'t be more excited for our guys.""', 'Roberts, too, recalled the Gibson home run.', '""That\'s iconic,"" he said. I think we win three more games, that\'s going to be right up there with it.""', 'Game 1 of the 2024 World Series was already a classic when it went to extra innings. That Freeman swing made it legendary. And we might have six more of these. ', ""Now everyone catch your breath and we'll do it again Saturday. "", '© 2004-2024 CBS INTERACTIVE.

Yes, they did. ', 'As Freeman limped into the batter’s box on a cool, brisk Friday night, facing New York Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes, the tension inside Dodger Stadium was buzzing with electricity, like a swarm of bees locked inside a jewelry box.', 'Just like Gibby did before him, Freddie was hobbled by a sprained ankle, nursing weeks of wear that had him in and out of the lineup throughout the postseason. ', 'The reality was that with the injury, Freeman was a shell of himself at the plate. Batting .219 with no home runs, no extra-base hits, and just one RBI in the playoffs up until the biggest moment of his life befell him.', 'Surely this weak, feeble, and one-legged former MVP can’t do the impossible can he?', '52,394 fans all held their collective breath; the Yankees could feel the victory just inches away from their mighty grasp.', 'And then the ball erupted off Freeman’s bat like an explosive firecracker on the Fourth of July. CRACK! The sound echoed across Chavez Ravine and traveled all the way back to the Bronx.', 'As the ball sailed half-way up the right-field pavilion, Dodger Stadium quaked with the sheer force of the crowd that realized they had just witnessed something mesmerizing and magical. It’s something they will talk about about for the rest of their lives, something they will ask others one day: Do you remember where you were when Freddie Freeman stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the 10th inning in Game 1 of the 2024 World Series?', '“That was awesome,” said Max Muncy, the last Dodgers’ player to hit a walk-off homer in the World Series at Dodger Stadium. “To feel the ground shaking from the crowd. To see the reactions from all our teammates, that was just an unbelievable moment.”', 'As Freeman watched the first-ever walk-off grand slam in World Series history take flight, he looked back towards his father sitting behind home plate, and pointed his bat to the sky, as if to tell Fernando Valenzuela, “we got you.” ', 'As he casually released his bat, and rounded the bases, all of the emotion of the last three months of his life poured out onto the field. ', 'Freeman played through a broken finger earlier in the year, then missed two weeks at the end of July after his three-year old son Max was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition in which the body’s immune system attacks its nerves, causing weakness, numbness, and in the case of Max, full-body paralysis.', '“These last few months have been a lot. They’ve been a grind,” said Freeman reflecting on his tumultuous journey to this moment in time. “I love the history of this game, so to be a part of it, it’s special.”', 'Freeman returned to the team, but suffered a high-ankle sprain during the final regular season game at Dodger Stadium. A 7-2 victory that clinched the Dodgers 11th NL West pennant in the last 12 seasons.', '“Knowing what Freddie has gone through, it’s super special for him to have this moment,” said teammate Mookie Betts, who was intentionally walked so that Freeman could have his opportunity at the plate. “I’m glad it was him that did it.”', 'FOX broadcaster Joe Davis, in a nod to Dodgers legendary voice Vin Scully, called the moment with the same words that etched Gibson’s historic homer into baseball lore: “She is gone!”', 'And just like Scully before him, it felt perfect and timeless. Instead of Scully’s classic call, “In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened.” Davis gave birth to a new chapter when he uttered, “Gibby, meet Freddie,” and in that instant it wasn’t just a home run–it was a cinematic score, playing out in front of our eyes. ', 'As Freeman limped around the bases, he flexed for the bullpen, he yelled and screamed in exultation, as his teammates stormed home plate, waiting for their hero in an ecstatic frenzy.', '“Everything was the same outside of the fist pumps,” joked Dodgers’ manager Dave Roberts on how Freeman’s homer compared to Gibson’s. “Gibson’s was iconic. I think if we win three more games, Freddie’s is going to be right up there with it.”', 'The parallels between the two magical moments are uncanny. ', 'Both Gibson and Freeman were underdogs in the moment, physically compromised, backs against the wall, their teams down to their final out.', 'Each saw a rally born out of a walk, and ultimately, each drove a pitch deep into the same part of the pavilion at Dodger Stadium. ', '“Freddie is going to be a first-ballot hall of famer. Anytime he’s at the plate, one foot or not, you feel pretty good about what he can do,” said Dodgers’ second baseman Gavin Lux, who started the rally with his one-out walk. “You felt like he was going to get a big hit there. You could see the look in his eyes. You can’t make it up.”', 'For the sake of history, there have been 62 walk-offs in the 120 iterations of the World Series. ', 'The Dodgers have had five walk-offs in the World Series. ', 'There have only been three walk-off homers by teams that were trailing–Joe Carter for the Blue Jays in 1993, Gibson in 1988, and now Freeman in 2024. What do they all have in common besides the weight of history sitting upon their shoulders? They all made history with one perfect swing.', 'I myself was a child when Gibson took his perfect swing. The next 36 years hearing the generation older than me discussing where they were and what they were doing when Gibby changed the course of history. ', 'For myself and Dodgers fans across the globe, Friday night felt like 1988 all over again. Only it was a moment etched in time for our generation. As fans hugged and high-fived, pointing their camera phones at the field and then at themselves, the echoes of history hung in the air. ', '“That might be the greatest baseball moment I’ve ever witnessed,” said Roberts, eyes gleaming with the kind of reverence Gibson had inspired in Dodgers fans for decades. “And I’ve witnessed some great moments. It was just pure elation.”', 'Minutes after his blast, Freeman sat at the podium to address the media, still buzzing with adrenaline. “I want to run through this table and tackle all of you guys (laughter),” he joked of how he was feeling. “This is pretty cool. It’s going to be hard to sleep tonight.”', 'Maybe when he does fall asleep and begins to dream, Freeman will relive the night in its entirety. ', 'The game began with a solemn tribute to the recently departed Fernando Valenzuela–the number 34 emblazoned on the mound, and a moment of silence as the Valenzuela family tearfully gathered down the third base line–then, as if the Ravine was filled with the strength from Valenzuela himself, they began to chant “Fer-nand-do…Fer-nan-do…” ', 'Three hours later, those chants shifted, eventually growing louder, and louder, as their hero stepped to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 10th. “Fred-die…Fred-die…”', '“Those are the scenarios that you dream about when you’re five years old,” said Freeman, smiling like the five-year old version of himself, looking up, lost in the moment. “Two outs, bases loaded in a World Series game. For it to actually happen and get a walk-off grand slam. That’s as good as it gets right there.”', 'Game 1 of the World Series on Friday night will reverberate in our hearts and minds for a lifetime.

It did not work out.', 'The World Series started six miles from Hollywood, and it felt like a writer’s hand was all over this game. Titanic lead changes, a dramatic pitching decision that initially paid off, and a twist ending. For fans of 28 other franchises, this must have been a hell of a game. For the Yankees, they’re down 1-0 in the series, losing tonight 6-3.', 'I don’t think there’s much point in starting anywhere but the end, the bottom of the 10th inning with the Yankees up by a run. Jake Cousins got Will Smith to kick off the frame, but No. 8 hitter Gavin Lux before an infield single from Tommy Edman put two men on. Edman’s dribbler was corralled by Oswaldo Cabrera in the hole at second, but the recently-inserted defensive replacement was unable to get an out anywhere.', 'That meant Shohei Ohtani was at the plate, with the winning run on first base. Aaron Boone had to pick between Tim Hill and Nestor Cortes, the two lefties in his bullpen and one of them just activated from the IL. He went with Nestor, who hadn’t pitched in a month.', 'On one pitch Cortes got a popout from the Dodger DH, thanks to a little help from Alex Verdugo:', 'The problem with the lefty specialty is now you’re facing Mookie Betts with two out, and the Yankees elected to walk him, setting up a left-on-left showdown with Freddie Freeman, in theory the most hobbled of the Dodgers’ Big Three. And, well ... he had his Kirk Gibson Moment.', 'Aaron Boone has done a pretty good job pushing the right buttons this October, but this one may have been the wrong one. Ohtani was 2-for-12 against Cortes for his career, but the pitch he threw to Freeman was just tailor-made for a lefty with the balance of contact and power the future Hall of Famer boasts:', 'Maybe a pitcher who wasn’t so rusty wouldn’t have thrown that, or maybe Tim Hill’s sinker-heavy approach would have made it harder for Freeman to elevate, or maybe that wouldn’t have happened at all. This is going to be one of the great what-ifs in recent Yankee history, but the loss is a loss regardless.', 'We do have some other things to talk about.', 'We had some déjà vu all over again when Giancarlo Stanton came to the plate in the sixth, with the Yankees down 1-0. If you remember last Saturday, he took two atrocious swings to start a plate appearance — the kind of swings that make you want to reach through the TV and shake him by the lapels. Of course a couple of pitches later he hit the second-biggest home run of this playoff run.', 'It may now be the third-biggest. Facing Jack Flaherty for the third time, he took two atrocious swings — the kind of swings that make you want to reach through the TV and shake him by the lapels. Of course, a couple of pitches later...', 'Stanton has said that Dodger Stadium was the place that made him fall in love with baseball, and for some kid in the Bronx, Big G’s big blast in that old yard might be the reason he falls in love. Yankees grab the lead, 2-1.', 'Gerrit Cole handled the Dodgers lineup well, making a push for his third straight World Series start of seven innings, but was yanked after Teoscar Hernández led off that frame with a single. Clay Holmes then immediately hit the first batter he faced, raising the stakes in the one-run game further. Holmes did get two outs — albeit one a gift sac bunt — before Tommy Kahnle was called upon to put out the fire.', 'Ohtani had been pretty quiet on the night, but you can’t keep a guy like that down forever. Leading off the eighth with a double, Gleyber Torres muffed the throw in from Soto, and the likely NL MVP ended up at third. Mookie Betts’ sac fly brought Ohtani in, and we were all tied up. You really do need to score more than two runs in regulation against a team like the Dodgers, but that miff from Torres might end up standing as the most impactful play of all.', 'Knotted up going into extras, we got some shine from Jazz Chisholm Jr. A single became a double when the third baseman stole second, and then after Anthony Rizzo was walked, Jazz took third as well, setting up Anthony Volpe in a situation where any fly ball would give the Yankees the lead. Volpe didn’t actually get the ball off the ground, but had a happy little mistake in just the right spot:', 'I feel bad for Volpe — this wasn’t the kind of at-bat that gets replayed much, but it was a big World Series moment for a player who has struggled to find consistency. That it’s almost immediately forgotten is a tough pill to swallow.', 'Such is baseball, such is life. The Yankees have to wash the taste of this one out of their mouths quickly, with Game 2 in less than 24 hours. While they probably should be headed into Saturday up 1-0, they’re not. Carlos Rodón will be tasked with ensuring the club comes back east with at least a split, and first pitch from erstwhile Yankees offseason target Yoshinobu Yamamoto will be on Fox at 8:08pm ET.', 'Box Score', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

The game began at 5:11 p.m. PT and was 3 hours and 27 minutes -- over at 8:38. 1988 Game 1 had a 5:35 p.m. start and 3:04 time of game -- over at 8:39.', 'Here’s a look at 10 stats and facts from an epic Game 1.', '• Freeman’s grand slam was the third walk-off home run while trailing in World Series history. The other two are homers that fans would recognize by name alone: Joe Carter’s, in 1993 Game 6 for the Blue Jays against the Phillies, and Kirk Gibson’s, in 1988 Game 1 for the Dodgers against the A’s.', '• The similarities with Gibson’s are remarkable -- a hobbled superstar in Game 1 at Dodger Stadium. In fact, his and Freeman’s are the only walk-off homers in World Series history where the team was down to its final out. The only other such homer in any postseason round was by Houston’s Yordan Alvarez in the 2022 American League Division Series Game 1.', '• It was the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history and the second in the postseason, joining the Rangers’ Nelson Cruz in the 2011 AL Championship Series Game 2. The slam was the fifth of the postseason overall, tying ‘21 and 1998 for the most in a single postseason. The Dodgers are the 14th team with multiple grand slams in a single postseason, and they are one shy of tying the 2021 Red Sox and 1998 Braves at three for the most.', '• The Dodgers became the 10th team to win a World Series Game 1 in walk-off fashion. They joined the 2023 Rangers, ‘15 Royals, ‘00 Yankees, 1988 Dodgers, 1977 Yankees, 1958 Braves, 1954 Giants, 1949 Yankees and 1939 Yankees. Eight of the nine previous teams went on to win the series, with the Braves being the only loss.', '• Not to be lost among the walk-off heroics, Freeman also had a first-inning triple, becoming the first player with a stolen base and a triple in a single postseason at age 35 or older since Mark Ellis in 2013, also for the Dodgers. Freeman is the third with a grand slam and a triple in a postseason game, joining the Rockies’ Kaz Matsui in the ‘07 National League Division Series Game 2 and Cleveland’s Elmer Smith in the 1920 World Series Game 5.', 'Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.', '• Kiké Hernández added a triple, too, making the Dodgers the first team with two triples in a Fall Classic game since the Yankees in 2000 Game 4. They weren’t just any two triples -- they were the first two hits of the series for the Dodgers. Los Angeles is the second team to triple for its first two hits of a World Series, joining the 1953 Yankees, from Hank Bauer and Billy Martin, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.', '• Giancarlo Stanton made his mark earlier in the game with a two-run homer, his fourth straight game going yard. He’s the first player in postseason history with multiple streaks of homering in at least four straight games. Stanton is the third to hit at least six home runs in multiple postseasons, joining Corey Seager and Cruz.', '• When we say “made his mark,” we really mean it. The 116.6 mph exit velocity on Stanton’s homer made it the hardest-hit batted ball in the World Series under Statcast (2015). And each of his last five hits have been home runs, tied with himself in ‘20 and the Pirates’ Bob Robertson in 1971 for the longest such streak in a single postseason, per Elias.', '• Jazz Chisholm Jr.’s three stolen bases tied the World Series record, with 2016 Game 5 Rajai Davis (Cleveland), 2008 Game 3 B.J. Upton (Rays), 1968 Game 3 Lou Brock (Cardinals), 1967 Game 7 Brock, 1965 Game 5 Willie Davis (Dodgers) and 1909 Game 3 Honus Wagner (Pirates). Two of Chisholm’s steals came in the 10th inning, making him the second player with multiple stolen bases in a World Series extra inning, along with the Cubs’ Jimmy Slagle in 1907 Game 1.', '• Birthdays are important. Juan Soto became the first player with a birthday hit in the World Series since the Royals’ Eric Hosmer in 2014 Game 3. He’s the second with a hit and walk in a World Series birthday game, joining the Cardinals’ Keith Hernandez in 1982 Game 7.', 'Sarah Langs is a reporter/editor for MLB.com based in New York.

The American and California flags in center field and on top of the upper deck flew at half-mast. At the main entrance to Dodger Stadium, the large sign welcoming visitors turned into a miniature shrine with flowers, votive candles, Mexican flags and banners.', 'Before the game, a tribute video accompanied by live Mariachi music featured photo montages of Valenzuela pitching, hitting, signing autographs and even jumping over lassos with Mexican vaqueros. Dodger players wore uniforms with a black sleeve patch featuring his name in white above his jersey number, 34, in blue with white trim.', 'Instead of throwing out the first pitch, two of Valenzuela’s former teammates, Steve Yeager and Orel Hershiser, both wearing jerseys with his number, commemorated his career by placing the baseball at a “34” stenciled on the back of the mound.

Leads lost.', 'No sporting event in Los Angeles would be complete without the locals displaying some of their laid-back attitude. In the sixth inning, after Giancarlo Stanton’s two-run home run gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead, some fans in the stands near the left-field foul pole continued a well-known local tradition.

A dedicated fan of Freeman, Zac has a few shirts bearing the first baseman’s name and number, and he has been closely following Freeman’s journey throughout the year. “He was already a huge Freeman fan, but after last night, it’s on another level,” Nico shared.', 'The day had started with an entirely different plan — Zac’s long-awaited orthodontist appointment to have his braces removed. But Nico had other ideas. “I surprised him with tickets,” Nico said. “There was no better way to celebrate.” This game, marking their first visit to Dodger Stadium since the passing of legendary Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, held special significance for the family. They had previously witnessed the ceremony retiring Valenzuela’s number, deepening their connection to the team’s history and spirit.', 'The stadium was electric as the Dodgers took on the Yankees, and Nico, who grew up a Mets fan before moving west and embracing the Dodgers, was as caught up in the moment as Zac. “I’m in shock,” he shared. “We went to game one of every round this year — the Padres, the Mets — but nothing compares to this.” Sitting in right field, an area he describes as having “a special energy"".', 'Zac is more than a casual fan, Nico said. “He’s serious about the game; he keeps score, knows the stats.” And last night, his knowledge paid off. As Freeman launched the ball into the night sky with two outs, Nico captured the moment on his phone. In a twist of fate, the ball ricocheted into Zac’s path. In awe, the young fan clutched it to his chest, tears streaming down his face.', '“A walk-off usually means everyone walks off,” Nico noted, “but no one did. The team stayed on the field, and the fans didn’t leave for ages. It was fantastic. And when you went out to the parking lot, everyone was yelling, ‘Go Dodgers!’ It was just wild.”', '“This stadium is something magical,” Nico added.', 'For Nico and Zac, October 25 will be a day remembered for both the family tradition of Dodgers baseball and an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime catch that brought history home to Venice.', '', '', ' ', ' ', '']"

A sold-out Dodger Stadium crowd of 52,394 went into a frenzy. Teammates spilled out of the dugout in uncontrollable glee. And for Freeman -- limited all month by a severely sprained right ankle, grinding through the tail end of a bizarre, at-times disheartening season -- it was almost as if time stood still.

Cortes, a veteran left-handed starting pitcher who had been recovering from a flexor strain and hadn't appeared in a game since Sept. 18, was summoned from the bullpen to face Ohtani. On Cortes' first pitch, Ohtani lofted a fly ball to foul territory in left field. Alex Verdugo made a spectacular lunging catch, but he also rolled over the fence and out of play, prompting both runners to automatically advance. With first base open, the Yankees elected to intentionally walk Betts and set up the left-on-left matchup with Freeman."", ""Freeman faced Cortes three times earlier this year, when the Dodgers visited Yankee Stadium on June 8.

He remembered how Cortes' fastball had ride to it, and he wanted to look for it on the inner half, partly to stay away from chasing the cutter and slider away. He told himself to stay on top of the pitch."", '""I wanted to be on time,"" Freeman said, ""and I was.""', ""The ball left Freeman's bat at 109.2 mph and went 409 feet into the right-field pavilion.

At 8:38 p.m. PT Friday, they were with him as he vigorously high-fived first-base coach Clayton McCullough, flexed toward the left-field fans on his way to third, got swallowed by bobbing teammates at home plate and sprinted to the backstop to celebrate with his father, Fred Freeman, who was seated nearby."", '""I was shocked,"" Fred said of his son coming over. ""I was so excited and proud of him.""', 'It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, motivated by all of those days Fred tossed his son batting practice.', '""My swing is because of him. My approach is because of him,"" Freeman said. ""I am who I am because of him.""', 'The past three months have been a whirlwind for Freeman. His young son, Max, had a scary bout with Guillain-Barré syndrome before making a miraculous recovery, prompting Freeman to be away from the team for 10 days. Freeman then suffered a nondisplaced fracture in his right middle finger. On Sept. 26, the night the Dodgers clinched their 11th division title in 12 years, Freeman rolled his right ankle on a play at first base.', 'Every day that followed has been a fight.', '""He\'s doing something that is basically heroic to put himself in a position to even be available,"" Dodgers utility man Enrique Hernandez said.', '""Freddie\'s a competitor, a fighter,"" Betts added. ""He\'s a part of this group, and this group loves each other. Him, like the rest of us, will do whatever it takes to play. It couldn\'t happen to a better human being. Freddie goes through so much. He doesn\'t complain.

The two most famous franchises in baseball, genuine elites of their coasts, fought. And then with one swing, on a first-pitch 93 mph fastball from Nestor Cortes, Freeman managed to deliver the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history and limp around the bases 36 years after Kirk Gibson famously did the same.', '""Just look at this game,"" Freeman said, and he started listing everything that had unfolded. Four innings of shutout baseball. The Dodgers manufacturing a run on a sacrifice fly. Giancarlo Stanton countering with a towering two-run home run. The Dodgers punching back with a run off Yankees closer Luke Weaver. The Yankees seemingly going ahead on what appeared to be a Gleyber Torres home run, only for it to be ruled interference when a Dodgers fan reached over the fence to snag it, which was confirmed by replay. New York tagging Los Angeles\' best reliever, Blake Treinen, for a run in the 10th. And the tension of the bottom of the 10th: a walk and an infield single to bring up Shohei Ohtani, whose foul out to left advanced the runners to second and third, opening up a base for Yankees manager Aaron Boone to intentionally walk Mookie Betts, giving Freeman the matchup against Cortes, who hadn\'t thrown a pitch since Sept. 18.', 'We have your one-stop shop for everything you need to keep up with all the action this October.\nSchedule, bracket, standings »', '""Back-and-forth moments -- that\'s what creates classics,"" Freeman said. ""And I think we created one tonight.""', ""The tens of millions who watched it, in the United States and Japan and around the world, know that they did. Great baseball can be as filled with good (Jazz Chisholm Jr. stealing second and third before scoring in the 10th inning) as it is with bad (he was able to do so because of Treinen's slow delivery). It can include great defense (Dodgers shortstop Tommy Edman saving a run in the sixth knocking by keeping a grounder in the infield) and unsightly (both of the Yankees' corner outfielders playing doubles into triples)."", '""Some people think a slugfest is a good game,"" Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy said. ""Some people think a pitcher\'s duel is a good game. I don\'t know. I think if you just add a little bit of all the elements, it\'s pretty fun.""', ""Doolittle: How Yankees broke through »\nGonzalez: Edman has lifted Dodgers »\nCastillo: Inside Weaver's rise to closer »\nPassan: Mets' run just the beginning »"", 'This game had plenty. Before the first pitch, there was already built-in tension for the starters: Gerrit Cole and Jack Flaherty, two right-handers who grew up in Southern California. The Dodgers had tried desperately to sign Cole when he was a free agent, and the Yankees tried to trade for Flaherty in July only to back away, and the two men, now playing against their one-time suitors, spent the early innings one-upping each other.', ""Stanton's sixth-inning home run and subsequent stare -- not to mention Flaherty's forlorn face after realizing the mistake he'd made -- left the Dodgers trailing 2-1, and marked the beginning of the scheming between Boone and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who had left in Flaherty for the third time through the order and paid dearly. Boone turning to Weaver in the eighth after Ohtani doubled off the top of the wall and advanced to third thanks to New York's sloppy defense was strategically sound but failed to prevent the Dodgers from tying the score."", ""Two innings later, it could have been Ohtani again or Betts or anyone, really, in the Dodgers' top-to-bottom scary lineup. That it was Freeman, the 35-year-old first baseman, was as exceptional a denouement as imaginable."", '""I was hoping Mookie would get a hit to take the pressure off him,"" said Freeman\'s father, Fred, to whom Freeman ran after the home run, interlocking hands through the netting that surrounds the field. ""Then they walked him. And I was like, \'Oh, Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.\' And then first pitch.""', 'Does Aaron Judge have an October problem? Are the Dodgers the team to beat? We size up the biggest postseason storylines.', 'Jeff Passan »', ""Over the past month, watching Freeman has been painful. Not only because throughout the Dodgers' first 11 playoff games he hadn't mustered an extra-base hit. Freeman is clearly in pain. His sprained ankle throbs. His body aches. He is an eight-time All-Star, a future Hall of Famer, a World Series champion with Atlanta in 2021. He had been through a brutal year already, with his 3-year-old son, Max, suffering through a bout of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Freeman kept pushing through the pain, hoping the five days off since the NLCS would do his body enough good to do something memorable."", 'His first-inning triple, with him hobbling around the bases, indicated he was primed to. Little did anyone know an even better finale was to come.', '""In my eyes, he\'s a superhero, really, honestly and truly,"" Dodgers reliever Anthony Banda said. ""Watching him get through the injury and seeing the rehab he put in, the time he put in and just trying to get back to health, to get back on the field, doing everything he can -- that speaks volumes of him as a player and as a person. He really cares about this group. He cares about the organization. He cares about winning, and that\'s what drives us all.""', ""That's true of everyone on the field Friday, including the Yankees, who now must recover from as knee-buckling a gut punch as can be thrown. The good news is, there remains plenty of baseball to be played, countless opportunities for the Yankees to do so, and the standard set for the rest of the series has gone from high to stratospheric."", 'To suggest any of the games, however many remain, can match Game 1 is unfair -- unless this is the sort of series where magic courses throughout, where two teams are so good, so evenly matched, so ready for the moment, so keen to win, that the hype is simply an accelerant. Maybe Game 2 on Saturday night continues where Game 1 so clearly delivered.', '""The ending,"" Dodgers center fielder Kiké Hernández said. ""I mean, it doesn\'t get better than that.""', ""It does, actually, because Hernández is forgetting one thing. When it comes to the Dodgers and Yankees, the 120th World Series, this battle of the titans who have so much more great baseball in them, it's just the beginning.""]"

Unbelievable game.”', 'It ended with Freeman, the modern-day Gibson, what with a sprained ankle making him seem during much of this postseason like a beer-league softball player when he broke from the box.
