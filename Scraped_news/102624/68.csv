Scientists detect molecules that store carbon in space,https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-detect-molecules-that-store-carbon-in-space/,"['A team of researchers led by MIT has discovered a significant amount of pyrene, a large carbon-rich molecule known as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), within a distant interstellar cloud. ', 'This finding provides new insights into the origins of carbon in our solar system and supports theories about the molecular building blocks that contributed to its formation.', 'The interstellar cloud in question, known as TMC-1, contains a mix of dust and gas similar to what eventually formed our own solar system. Pyrene’s discovery in this environment suggests it may have played a crucial role in seeding our solar system with carbon. ', 'This idea is further supported by recent findings that pyrene is abundant in samples from the near-Earth asteroid Ryugu, returned by Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission.', '“One of the big questions in star and planet formation is: How much of the chemical inventory from that early molecular cloud is inherited and forms the base components of the solar system?” said senior author Brett McGuire, an assistant professor of chemistry at MIT. ', '“What we’re looking at is the start and the end, and they’re showing the same thing. That’s pretty strong evidence that this material from the early molecular cloud finds its way into the ice, dust, and rocky bodies that make up our solar system.”', 'Detecting pyrene in space is a complex process, as its symmetrical structure makes it invisible to conventional radio astronomy methods. To overcome this, the researchers focused on an isomer called cyanopyrene, a version of pyrene modified by cyanide. ', 'This alteration breaks the molecule’s symmetry, allowing it to be detected through its unique rotational spectra – patterns of light emitted as the molecule rotates in space.', 'The team used the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia to identify these signals within TMC-1. This discovery builds on earlier work by McGuire and others, who had identified smaller PAHs in the same region, such as benzonitrile and cyanonaphthalene.', 'The researchers found that cyanopyrene accounts for approximately 0.1 percent of all the carbon present in TMC-1. ', 'McGuire noted that while 0.1 percent doesn’t sound like a large number, most carbon is trapped in carbon monoxide (CO), the second-most abundant molecule in the universe besides molecular hydrogen. ', '“If we set CO aside, one in every few hundred or so remaining carbon atoms is in pyrene. Imagine the thousands of different molecules that are out there, nearly all of them with many different carbon atoms in them, and one in a few hundred is in pyrene,” said McGuire.', '“That is an absolutely massive abundance. An almost unbelievable sink of carbon. It’s an interstellar island of stability.”', 'The detection of pyrene marks the discovery of the third-largest molecule found in space and the largest yet identified using radio astronomy techniques.', 'Interstellar clouds like TMC-1 have the potential to birth stars and planetary systems as clumps of dust and gas come together, forming new celestial bodies. ', 'The presence of pyrene in TMC-1 and similar molecules in the Ryugu asteroid suggests that such carbon-rich compounds might be directly inherited by forming planetary systems, including our own.', ' “We now have, I would venture to say, the strongest evidence ever of this direct molecular inheritance from the cold cloud all the way through to the actual rocks in the solar system,” McGuire explained.', 'The study’s findings have drawn attention from the broader scientific community. Ewine van Dishoeck, a professor of molecular astrophysics at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, highlighted the importance of the discovery. ', '“It builds on their earlier discoveries of smaller aromatic molecules, but to make the jump now to the pyrene family is huge,” said van Dishoeck.', '“Not only does it demonstrate that a significant fraction of carbon is locked up in these molecules, but it also points to different formation routes of aromatics than have been considered so far.”', 'The research team now aims to explore whether even larger PAH molecules exist within TMC-1, providing further insights into the early chemical processes that shape star systems. ', 'The experts are also investigating whether pyrene formed within TMC-1 itself or originated elsewhere in the universe, potentially carried across space by high-energy processes like those found near dying stars.', 'This study not only offers a deeper understanding of carbon’s role in the formation of planetary systems but also opens new avenues for exploring the molecular origins of life in the cosmos.

Astronomers Discover Complex Carbon Molecules in Interstellar Space,https://www.sciencealert.com/astronomers-discover-complex-carbon-molecules-in-interstellar-space,"['A team led by researchers at MIT in the United States has discovered large molecules containing carbon in a distant interstellar cloud of gas and dust.', 'This is exciting for those of us who keep lists of known interstellar molecules in the hope that we might work out how life arose in the Universe.', ""But it's more than just another molecule for the collection. The result, reported today in the journal Science, shows that complex organic molecules (with carbon and hydrogen) likely existed in the cold, dark gas cloud that gave rise to our Solar System."", 'Furthermore, the molecules held together until after the formation of Earth. This is important for our understanding of the early origins of life on our planet.', 'The molecule in question is called pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon or PAH for short. The complicated-sounding name tells us these molecules are made of rings of carbon atoms.', 'Carbon chemistry is the backbone of life on Earth. PAHs have long been known to be abundant in the interstellar medium, so they feature prominently in theories of how carbon-based life on Earth came to be.', ""We know there are many large PAHs in space because astrophysicists have detected signs of them in visible and infrared light. But we didn't know which PAHs they might be in particular."", 'Pyrene is now the largest PAH detected in space, although it\'s what is known as a ""small"" or simple PAH, with 26 atoms. It was long thought such molecules could not survive the harsh environment of star formation when everything is bathed in radiation from the newborn suns, destroying complex molecules.', 'In fact, it was once thought molecules of more than two atoms could not exist in space for this reason, until they were actually found. Also, chemical models show pyrene is very difficult to destroy once formed.', 'Last year, scientists reported they found large amounts of pyrene in samples from the asteroid Ryugu in our own Solar System. They argued at least some of it must have come from the cold interstellar cloud that predated our Solar System.', ""So why not look at another cold interstellar cloud to find some? The problem for astrophysicists is that we don't have the tools to detect pyrene directly – it's invisible to radio telescopes."", 'The molecule the team has detected is called 1-cyanopyrene, what we call a ""tracer"" for pyrene. It is formed from pyrene interacting with cyanide, which is common in interstellar space.', 'The researchers used the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia to look at the Taurus molecular cloud or TMC-1, in the Taurus constellation. Unlike pyrene itself, 1-cyanopyrene can be detected by radio telescopes. This is because 1-cyanopyrene molecules act as small radio-wave emitters – tiny versions of earthly radio stations.', 'As scientists know the proportions of 1-cyanopyrene compared to pyrene, they can then estimate the amount of pyrene in the interstellar cloud.', 'The amount of pyrene they found was significant. Importantly, this discovery in the Taurus molecular cloud suggests a lot of pyrene exists in the cold, dark molecular clouds that go on to form stars and solar systems.', 'We are gradually building a picture of how life on Earth evolved. This picture tells us that life came from space – well, at least the complex organic, pre-biological molecules needed to form life did.', 'That pyrene survives the harsh conditions associated with the birth of stars, as shown by the findings from Ryugu, is an important part of this story.', ""Simple life – consisting of a single cell – appeared in Earth's fossil record almost immediately (in geological and astronomical terms) after the planet's surface had cooled enough to not vaporise complex molecules. This happened more than 3.7 billion years ago in Earth's approximately 4.5 billion history."", ""For simple organisms to then appear so quickly in the fossil record, there's just not enough time for chemistry to start with mere simple molecules of two or three atoms."", ""The new discovery of 1-cyanopyrene in the Taurus molecular cloud shows complex molecules could indeed survive the harsh conditions of our Solar System's formation. As a result, pyrene was available to form the backbone of carbon-based life when it emerged on the early Earth some 3.7 billion years ago."", 'This discovery also links to another important finding of the last decade – the first chiral molecule in the interstellar medium, propylene oxide. We need chiral molecules to make the evolution of simple lifeforms work on the surface of the early Earth.', 'So far, our theories that molecules for early life on Earth came from space are looking good.', 'Maria Cunningham, Honorary Senior Lecturer, School of Physics, UNSW Sydney', 'This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

', 'Since the 1980s, astronomers had suspected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, were floating around interstellar clouds and at the margins of stars. ', 'The molecules are toxic to humans, and often form through the burning of organic matter like fossil fuels or wood. Look for the molecules closer to home and you’ll find them in the soot in ringing a fireplace or char on the outside of steak cooked on a barbecue, said Ilsa Cooke, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia’s department of chemistry and a co-author on the study. ', '“On Earth, they actually have a pretty bad reputation,” Cooke said. “If you kind of stick your head out of the back of a car, you would inhale some.”', 'While toxic in a human body, PAHs also have similar chemical backbones and structures to the molecules that make up life, said Cooke. They could account for as a much as a quarter of all carbon in the universe. And until recently, identifying them has been one of the great cosmic mysteries plaguing our understanding of what makes up space. ', ""“If you point a telescope at the sky, you see these really bright celestial features, kind of like fingerprints of molecules,” said Cooke. “For a long time, astronomers could see these throughout our galaxy and in other galaxies, but they didn't know the identity of them.”"", 'To unravel the identity of what were long seen as unidentified bands of light, the team of researchers had to match their chemical fingerprint on Earth.', 'They turned to a synthetic chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who manufactured the molecule and its 16 carbon atoms.

', 'Pointing the radiotelescope at the Taurus cloud, considered a star nursery that could one day form its own solar system, was like peering back to the beginning our planet’s own origins, said Brett McGuire, the study’s senior author and chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.', 'The team compared the more than 1,500 hours of data from the interstellar cloud with the light fingerprint they measured in the lab. They matched. ', 'McGuire said about 0.1 per cent of the cold interstellar cloud — which sits at about minus 263 degrees Celsius, just above absolute zero — is made up of the large hydrocarbon.', 'In the past, scientists thought small PAHs would be destroyed by shock waves and cosmic UV rays faster than they can be created. Pyrene, on the other hand, has four particularly stable aromatic rings that make them difficult to destroy. ', 'Its abundance, say the scientists, suggests such clouds supply young planetary systems with carbon.

Astronomers Discover Complex Carbon Molecules In Space – Clues To Life’s Origins,https://www.outlookindia.com/brand-studio/blogs/astronomers-discover-complex-carbon-molecules-in-space-clues-to-lifes-origins,"['BLOGS', 'Astronomers find large carbon molecules in space, offering new insights into life’s origins and the chemical precursors of life on Earth.', 'Astronomers have just gotten one step closer to making sense of life’s origins with the discovery of large, carbon-based molecules in space. Led by MIT researchers, the team found complex organic compounds in a distant cloud of gas and dust, adding new insights into the chemical precursors of life. This finding, published in the journal Science, suggests that complex organic molecules (carbon-hydrogen-based compounds) existed in the cold, dense clouds that gave rise to our Solar System. Surviving through the formation of stars and planets, these compounds may hold critical clues about how life first emerged on Earth.', 'The molecule found in space is called pyrene, which belongs to a group of compounds known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms arranged in ring structures, and they play a key role in theories about the development of carbon-based life. While PAHs have been seen in space before, pyrene is the largest one discovered so far, consisting of 26 atoms in its complex structure. This finding indicates that such complex molecules can survive the harsh conditions of space, even during the intense radiation that happens when stars are forming.', 'Pyrene’s survival in space challenges earlier assumptions. Scientists once believed molecules larger than two atoms would be destroyed by the intense radiation during star formation. However, pyrene and other PAHs have now been shown to be resilient, especially after being found in samples from the asteroid Ryugu in our Solar System. These findings imply that pyrene may have been present in the cold cloud that predated our Solar System, providing a direct link to the carbon-based molecules that eventually arrived on Earth.', 'Directly identifying PAHs like pyrene in space is incredibly difficult due to their weak radio signals. Pyrene itself is essentially ""invisible"" to radio telescopes, which limits scientists’ ability to detect it through traditional methods. To overcome this, the researchers used a related compound, 1-cyanopyrene, as a “tracer.” This molecule forms when pyrene interacts with cyanide, a molecule that is relatively abundant in space and easily detected by radio telescopes. Unlike pyrene, 1-cyanopyrene emits radio waves that can be picked up by telescopes, acting as a kind of “radio beacon” for its parent molecule.', 'To track 1-cyanopyrene, the MIT-led team used the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, a powerful radio telescope capable of detecting faint radio emissions from deep space. The telescope scanned a region known as the Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC-1) in the constellation Taurus, a cold and dark environment ideal for studying the early stages of star formation. Because 1-cyanopyrene is more detectable than pyrene itself, scientists could use its presence to estimate the quantity of pyrene in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. Their findings revealed a substantial amount of pyrene, suggesting that complex organic compounds may be widespread in the interstellar clouds that eventually form stars and planets.', 'The survival of pyrene and similar complex molecules in the interstellar environment supports the idea that life’s building blocks may have originated in space. Earth’s geological record shows that single-celled life appeared about 3.7 billion years ago, shortly after the planet’s surface cooled enough to support complex molecules. Given how quickly life emerged, it seems unlikely that such complex chemistry could have developed from scratch on Earth in such a short period. It’s therefore plausible that some of life’s essential molecules were delivered to Earth from interstellar clouds, allowing life to gain an early start.', 'This theory, known as panspermia, suggests that prebiotic (life-building) molecules existed in the cold, dense molecular clouds that later formed stars and solar systems. If molecules like pyrene were indeed present in these clouds, they may have survived through the chaotic process of star formation, eventually making their way to young planets like Earth. Once here, these compounds could have provided a foundation for early biochemical processes, setting the stage for the development of cellular life.', 'This discovery is also linked to another important finding from the recent years: the detection of the first chiral molecule, propylene oxide, in space. Chirality means that molecules can exist in ""left-handed"" or ""right-handed"" forms, which is essential for life because biological molecules usually have specific chiral orientations. The presence of chiral molecules in space suggests that the prerequisites for life’s chemistry may have already been in place before Earth even formed.', 'The discovery of pyrene in the Taurus Molecular Cloud opens up exciting possibilities for the study of astrobiology and the search for extraterrestrial life. If complex molecules can survive the intense radiation of star formation, it’s possible they could be present in other regions of the universe where stars and planets are born. The abundance of PAHs like pyrene in interstellar clouds suggests that the basic ingredients for life may be scattered throughout the cosmos, potentially supporting life’s emergence on other planets.', 'Moreover, as researchers continue to identify complex molecules in space, they are gradually piecing together a picture of how life might arise under various conditions. Each new discovery provides additional evidence that life’s building blocks could exist in many different environments, from cold molecular clouds to the surfaces of young planets. The resilience of molecules like pyrene, which can survive the harsh conditions associated with star formation, adds weight to the theory that life may not be unique to Earth but rather an outcome of universal chemical processes.', 'Future research will probably aim to find more PAHs and complex molecules in space by using advanced telescopes and better detection methods. With tools like the James Webb Space Telescope, scientists will have new chances to examine the chemical makeup of far-off areas where stars are forming, helping us learn more about the origins of life.', 'The discovery of complex carbon molecules like pyrene in space is an exciting new avenue in our journey to understand life’s origins. As scientists discover more about these molecules, we get closer to answering profound questions about our place in the universe. Are we alone, or is life a natural consequence of the chemical processes occurring throughout the cosmos?', 'The presence of life-essential compounds in the dark clouds of space suggests that Earth’s story of life may not be an isolated one. Instead, it may be part of a broader narrative playing out across the universe, with organic molecules serving as a foundation for life wherever conditions permit. This finding makes us to keep exploring further, both within our Solar System and beyond, to uncover the secrets of life’s cosmic existence.', 'Each discovery takes us closer to understanding the origin of life, not only on Earth but potentially across other star systems. As research advances, we are reminded that our own existence might be deeply connected to the vast and dynamic processes that shape the universe. The story of pyrene and other organic molecules might just be one chapter in a larger, universal tale of life.', 'Kaise Yeh Ugly Sandals Ne Banayi 10 Billion Dollar Ki Company?! | फ Se Fashion By Nazar Ya!', 'Kya Aapki Food Cravings Nutrient Deficiency Ka Signal Hain? | Nazar Ya!
