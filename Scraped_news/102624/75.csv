The findings were generally consistent across secondary clinical outcomes and pre-specified patient, pathogen, and syndrome subgroups.', '“These findings underscore the effectiveness of a shorter antibiotic regimen in patients with bloodstream infections, which is welcomed as we look to identify evidence-based prescribing guidelines for serious bacterial infections,” presenting author Nick Daneman, MD, clinician scientist in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto, said in an IDWeek press release.', 'Including preset treatment orders in the electronic medical records of children with ear infections dramatically improved compliance with antibiotic treatment guidelines, researchers reported at IDWeek 2024.', 'In a study conducted at the University of Colorado/Children’s Hospital Colorado, researchers analyzed data on 34,324 children aged 61 days to 18 months who visited emergency and urgent care centers in the health system for acute otitis media (AOM) from January 2019 to September 2023. Their aim was to assess the effectiveness of a bundled intervention for AOM that included an electronic health record (EHR) order set (implemented in April 2021) that pre-selected a 5-day antibiotic course for children 24 months and older and a local clinical care pathway (implemented in December 2022) that encouraged observation and pain management for children with non-severe AOM. ', 'Presenting author Joana Dimo, DO, a doctoral fellow at the University of Colorado, said the bundle was developed to address a common problem in antibiotic prescribing for AOM: while most cases (up to 75%) resolve without antibiotics, most children receive antibiotics, often for longer than needed.', '“We noticed at our institution that children were being prescribed a lot of antibiotics for ear infections, and that the duration of antibiotics was longer than we thought necessary,” Dimo said at a press briefing.', 'Although antibiotic prescribing remained high throughout the study (88% to 93%), the researchers found that after the EHR order set was implemented, compliance with the recommended antibiotic duration of 5 days rose from 3% to 83%. Rates of amoxicillin prescribing fell from 77% to 74%, a finding the study authors attribute to an amoxicillin shortage that began in October 2022.', '“With this initiative, we were able to show a dramatic 80% improvement in prescribing 5-day durations of antibiotics for children over 2 with a simple and cost-effective strategy that did not lead to increased treatment failures or complications,” Dimo said, adding that shortening the antibiotic duration effectively cut antibiotic use for AOM in half.', 'The recommendations were made to shore up protection in vulnerable groups and add clarity for patients and healthcare providers.', 'The disease continues to spread in the Americas, with Ecuador and Guyana recently reporting their first cases.', ""The CDC said the rise in M pneumoniae in children ages 2 to 4 is notable, because it isn't typically known as a leading cause of pneumonia in the age-group."", 'Dairy workers in California continue to face a daunting threat from a virus surge in the state’s dairy cows, as federal officials confirmed 15 more outbreaks today.', 'The variant appears to have greater infectivity and immune-evasion properties, which could help it edge out KP.3.1.1.', 'COVID-19 patients were more at risk for seven particular symptoms, notably neurological, cognitive, and fatigue issues.', 'Vaccines must promote mucosal immunity to prevent infection by respiratory viruses and limit spread.', 'The spurt of infections in Washington state is reminiscent of what Colorado experienced over the summer with illnesses in poultry cullers.', 'As health officials brace for more cases in farm workers, Utah ag officials are moving quickly to monitor dairy cattle near a large outbreak at a layer farm.', 'Two patients who were intubated for multiple organ failure were successfully extubated, thought to be a first in Africa for Marburg.', ""Help make CIDRAP's vital work possible"", 'CIDRAP - Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy\nResearch and Innovation Office, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN', 'EMAIL US', '© 2024 Regents of the University of Minnesota.

Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Infections Have Been Increasing,https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infections-have-been-increasing.html,"['', '', 'Bacterial infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae increased in the United States since late spring and have remained high. The proportion of patients discharged from emergency departments with a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae-associated pneumonia or acute bronchitis has been increasing over the past six months, peaking in late August.', 'CDC is closely tracking the recent rise in M. pneumoniae infections using various surveillance tools to better understand any differences in demographics, severity of illness, and outcomes as compared to M. pneumoniae infections prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC is also reaching out to healthcare providers and health departments to raise awareness of increasing M. pneumoniae infections and working to monitor for antibiotic resistance.', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of mild respiratory illness. Since late spring, the number of infections caused by M. pneumoniae has been increasing, especially among young children. This differs from published studies in previous years, when most infections were observed among school-aged children and adolescents.', 'Mycoplasma is a bacterium that can infect different parts of the body. M. pneumoniae is a type of Mycoplasma that can cause respiratory tract infections. The bacteria can damage the lining of the respiratory tract, including the throat, windpipe, and lungs.', 'M. pneumoniae infections are generally mild and mostly present as a chest cold but may also present as pneumonia. Symptom onset is typically gradual and can include fever, cough, and a sore throat. When an M. pneumoniae infection progresses to pneumonia, it\'s typically a less severe form of bacterial pneumonia commonly referred to as ""walking pneumonia.""', 'While uncommon, serious complications from infection can occur that require hospital care, including new or worsening asthma, severe pneumonia, and encephalitis (brain disease). M. pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial infection among people who need hospital care due to community-acquired pneumonia.', 'M. pneumoniae infections can occur at any age, but they most often occur among children ages 5–17 years and young adults. Younger children may have different symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, wheezing, or vomiting).', ""M. pneumoniae infections are common, with an estimated 2 million infections occurring each year in the United States. However, the true number of people affected every year is unknown as there's no national reporting or dedicated surveillance system to track these infections. M. pneumoniae infections may occur more often in summer and early fall."", 'In 2023, M. pneumoniae began to re-emerge globally, after a prolonged period of low incidence of infections since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC routinely monitors emergency department care of people with pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. So far in 2024, CDC has seen an increase in the percentage of pneumonia-associated emergency department visits with a discharge diagnosis of M. pneumoniae.', ""The M. pneumoniae discharge diagnosis data from March 31 through October 5, 2024, show an increase among all age groups across the United States, peaking in August, and remaining high. The increase, however, was highest among children. The percentage grew from 1.0% to 7.2% among children ages 2–4 years and from 3.6% to 7.4% among children ages 5–17 years in that time frame. The increase in children ages 2–4 years is notable because M. pneumoniae historically hasn't been recognized as a leading cause of pneumonia in this age group."", 'CDC is also able to look at data showing how frequently patients are testing positive for M. pneumoniae (i.e., test positivity). These data show that test positivity for M. pneumoniae has also gone up since late spring for all age groups, from 0.7% to 3.3%. These data come from lab testing results reported to the bioMérieux BIOFIRE® Syndromic Trends\nprogram, which tracks pathogen circulation trends using lab data from across the United States.', 'M. pneumoniae bacteria are spread by inhaling respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Other people can get infected if they breathe in those droplets. Strategies that prevent respiratory viruses, such as handwashing and covering coughs and sneezes, also prevent these bacteria from spreading.', 'Outbreaks occur mostly in crowded environments such as schools, college residence halls, and nursing homes. Outbreaks can be prolonged due to:', ""Most people who spend a short amount of time with someone who is sick with M. pneumoniae don't get infected. However, people who spend a lot of time with someone who is sick with M. pneumoniae are at increased risk."", 'Some people are more likely to get infected than others. For example, people recovering from respiratory illness and those with a weakened immune system are at increased risk for serious infection.', 'Testing for M. pneumoniae infection most often occurs in emergency department or hospital settings. Less commonly, testing may be performed in outpatient settings or clinics. To test for M. pneumoniae, healthcare providers collect a specimen, often a swab from the nose or throat or, less commonly, a blood sample.', 'M. pneumoniae testing typically occurs as part of a respiratory panel that tests for many pathogens, including flu, respiratory syncytial virus, COVID-19, and other viruses and bacteria. Healthcare providers also often examine the patient physically and look for signs of respiratory illness. If clinically indicated, they may order a chest X-ray to see if the patient has pneumonia.', ""Most people with a mild M. pneumoniae infection will recover on their own without medicine. Over-the-counter medicines can help you feel better while you're recovering."", 'Healthcare providers can use several types of antibiotics to treat people with pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae bacteria are naturally resistant to certain antibiotics (e.g., beta-lactams such as amoxicillin) that are commonly used to treat other kinds of bacterial pneumonia. Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) are the first-line antibiotic treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae remains relatively uncommon in the United States.', 'Accurately identifying M. pneumoniae infections and appropriately treating people who may be infected is complicated by unique challenges, including:', ""Information on NCIRD's mission, work, and organizational structure."", '', '']"

Whooping cough, or pertussis, cases – which also cause a prolonged cough – are five times higher than they were at this time last year, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is also rising in parts of the US.', 'In the past, it’s been difficult to test for Mycoplasma.

With so many germs making kids cough this fall, it’s crucial that doctors use these new tests to get the right diagnosis, he said.', '“This is the exact time where we need to be using these diagnostic tests that can guide treatment,” he said.', 'Awareness of the Mycoplasma trend is important, the CDC says, since first-line antibiotics for kids such as amoxicillin and penicillin don’t kill this type of bacteria. The infection is usually easily treated with other antibiotics, however, such as azithromycin.', 'According to the CDC, which monitors discharge data from a network of hospitals as well as test results from commercial laboratories, the number of children ages 2 through 4 who were seen in the ER for pneumonia and who tested positive for Mycoplasma increased from 1% in April 2024 to 7.2% in early October, a sevenfold increase.

Creech said he expects they will continue to be high for another month or so, then should begin to taper off later into the fall.', 'On an X-ray, Mycoplasma infections can give lungs a cloudy or “white lung” appearance.', 'Last year, China, Denmark and France all reported increases of this kind of pneumonia in kids.', 'The rise in cases is probably due to at least three factors, said Dr. Geoffrey Weinberg, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center.', 'The first is that rates of Mycoplasma infections are returning to where they were before the Covid-19 pandemic.', '“It seems very dramatic now, but it’s more because during the peak of the Covid pandemic, just about everything else went down,” Weinberg said. “But the actual countrywide rates are fairly similar to what it was before 2019.”', 'The second reason is that most infections cycle, so some years are worse than others. Doctors tend to see spikes of Mycoplasma pneumonia every 3 to 7 years, as people lose their immunity to the virus, Creech said.', '“Sometimes you just have a bad year, combined with not noticing it for a while, now we’re getting it more,” Weinberg said. Having a lot of cases after not having many at all can make the spike feel even bigger, he added.', 'The third reason is that doctors have more advanced tests – called multiplex tests – that can check for multiple types of viruses and bacteria at the same time, so it could be that this infection is just getting picked up more often.', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae are bacteria that travel through respiratory droplets. People catch them when they’re near another person’s coughs and sneezes, the CDC said. For that reason, this type of pneumonia easily spreads through crowded settings like schools, college residence halls and nursing homes.', 'These bacteria are tricky too because they hang around for a while – from one to four weeks in the body – before they make a person sick. By the time symptoms start, a person usually has little memory of what they may have been exposed to.', 'Mycoplasma infections start off pretty generically, with a headache, a sore throat, a low fever and chills. People often feel crummy but can still get around, hence the term “walking pneumonia.”', 'The cough is typically a dry cough, without phlegm. It starts gradually and slowly increases over a period of two to three weeks, becoming almost constant.', 'Not everyone who gets a Mycoplasma infection will need treatment. Weinberg says that as many as 75% of kids and young adults will get over it without any therapy.', 'Sometimes, however, the infection will exacerbate pre-existing conditions like asthma and make people seriously ill.', 'Rarely, these germs can travel outside the lungs.

Still, it’s important to be aware of symptoms to protect your children.', 'Cases of walking pneumonia are on the rise among toddlers ages 2 through 4, according to a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nreleased on Friday. While the bacterial infection, known clinically as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, is rare for this age group, parents should not panic: Young children have been experiencing mostly mild symptoms.', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae generally isn’t the most common form of pediatric pneumonia seen in this age group. “Usually, babies and toddlers have viral respiratory pneumonia or bronchiolitis such as RSV, respiratory syncytial virus, infections,” says Zachary Hoy, M.D\n., a board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tenn.', 'While there is no reason to panic, mindful monitoring is still recommended. Understanding the symptoms of walking pneumonia in kids and some simple, protective steps can help keep your child and others safe.', 'There is no national surveillance system to track the actual rates of walking pneumonia cases in any population, including children, the CDC says\n. However, reports show that almost 10% of all pediatric emergency room visits were for walking pneumonia in August, when cases peaked. As of September, this was down to 7%.', 'It’s important to note that while these rates are high for recent years, they still remain lower than pre-COVID-19 levels, according to a February 2024 CDC report\n.', 'While the precise reason for the current rise is unclear, it’s plausible that during COVID, social distancing kept people from getting ill with other infections, too, explains John Schieffelin, M.D., a service line chief for infectious disease with Children’s Hospital New Orleans. ', 'While staying informed about the spread of infectious diseases in your area is important, Dr. Schieffelin doesn’t want parents to panic. “Most cases are mild, and many are so mild patients do not ever seek medical care,” he says. “It is rarely life-threatening.”', 'It’s actually nicknamed “walking pneumonia” because people often feel better than they usually would with a lung infection, the CDC explains. Still, mindful attention to your child’s health is important and will help parents flag issues with their care team.', '“Monitor symptoms, and if any illness is lasting longer than four to five days, seek medical attention for evaluation of atypical pneumonia,” says Inderpal Randhawa, M.D.,\na California-based board-certified pediatric pulmonologist.', 'Mycoplasma pneumonia symptoms can start gradually. Early symptoms to watch for include:', 'Cough', 'Fever ', 'Sore throat', '“Especially in toddlers, high fever cycles for more than three days may indicate an atypical pneumonia,” Dr. Randhawa says.', 'Symptoms more specific to a walking pneumonia diagnosis in kids are:', 'Increased tiredness', 'Not eating as well', 'Sneezing more', 'GI issues, such as diarrhea or vomiting', 'The CDC says many people don’t need medical treatment for walking pneumonia and can get by with rest and over-the-counter options to soothe symptoms. Sometimes, an antibiotic may be necessary.', '“In the US, most strains are sensitive to macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin commonly given as a five-day course,” Dr. Hoy says.', 'However, the CDC mentions they are monitoring antibiotic resistance.', '“There is some resistance, especially in other countries,” Dr. Hoy says. “Usually, resistance would present as someone who is on day three to four of the antibiotic and symptoms are not improving or worsening...If there is concern about resistance, there should be a respiratory swab sent for testing to confirm mycoplasma diagnosis and evaluate for co-infections such as flu or RSV.”', 'Other antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, can be used, Dr. Hoy says. However, he says these antibiotics have broader use and might have different side effects, so doctors don’t prescribe them as often.  ', 'While your child should have received all doses of their pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) by age 2, there is no vaccine specifically for walking pneumonia. ', '“Some experts have thought that being vaccinated for other respiratory illnesses, such as RSV, flu, or COVID, could help decrease those illnesses, which could, in turn, make someone less susceptible to mycoplasma infections,” Dr. Hoy adds. “Wash your hands frequently, and consider wearing a mask in high-risk situations.”', 'It’s also important to remind your children not to share utensils and try to avoid people with the infection. Protecting other children – especially those with underlying conditions that make them prone to more severe cases of walking pneumonia – is also important.', '“Because it is spread when infected individuals cough, symptomatic children should stay at home and not go to school,” Dr. Schieffelin says.', 'Was this article helpful?', 'Yes', 'No', '', '', '', '', '', ""Beth Ann Mayer is a contributing writer for BabyCenter, the world's number one digital parenting resource.

Doctors tend to see spikes of Mycoplasma pneumonia every 3 to 7 years, as people lose their immunity to the virus, Creech said.', '“Sometimes you just have a bad year, combined with not noticing it for a while, now we’re getting it more,” Weinberg said. Having a lot of cases after not having many at all can make the spike feel even bigger, he added.', 'The third reason is that doctors have more advanced tests – called multiplex tests – that can check for multiple types of viruses and bacteria at the same time, so it could be that this infection is just getting picked up more often.', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae are bacteria that travel through respiratory droplets. People catch them when they’re near another person’s coughs and sneezes, the CDC said. For that reason, this type of pneumonia easily spreads through crowded settings like schools, college residence halls and nursing homes.', 'These bacteria are tricky too because they hang around for a while – from one to four weeks in the body – before they make a person sick. By the time symptoms start, a person usually has little memory of what they may have been exposed to.', 'Mycoplasma infections start off pretty generically, with a headache, a sore throat, a low fever and chills. People often feel crummy but can still get around, hence the term “walking pneumonia.”', 'The cough is typically a dry cough, without phlegm. It starts gradually and slowly increases over a period of two to three weeks, becoming almost constant.', 'Not everyone who gets a Mycoplasma infection will need treatment. Weinberg says that as many as 75% of kids and young adults will get over it without any therapy.', 'Sometimes, however, the infection will exacerbate pre-existing conditions like asthma and make people seriously ill.', 'Rarely, these germs can travel outside the lungs.
