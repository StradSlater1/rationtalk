He says since Nick Aldis told him last week that he couldn't face Owens at Crown Jewel as it was above his pay grade, he wants to talk to Triple H about it and claims that he's protecting Owens from him. He then calls Triple H down to the ring, and he makes his way out."", ""Triple H says while he would rather have not done this in public and disputes Orton's claims that he's protecting Owens. He tells Orton that he will not face Owens at Crown Jewel, but Orton insists that Triple H is protecting Owens. Triple H tells Orton that he's actually trying to protect him rather than Owens, and says he's known both him and Owens for a long time. He says Owens has never had a friend in business because he's all about the business and money, but for the first time ever, he let his guard down and trusted Orton and Cody Rhodes. He says while he's not sure why that's the case, Owens liked and trusted them.

He says if Triple H was in his shoes, he wouldn\'t let things slide and would handle business in the middle of the ring. He then demands a match against Owens at Crown Jewel once again, and Triple H finally agrees but warns Orton to protect himself at all times.', 'LA Knight then makes his way down to the ring.

Jax informs Stratton that she's recruited Candice LeRae to help them take care of Bayley and Naomi before LeRae and Indi Hartwell walk in and LeRae promises Jax that she'll take care of Naomi tonight.

GUNTHER follows.', '', ""GUNTHER asks Rhodes what he wants to talk about, and Rhodes says it's fairly obvious what he wants to talk about. GUNTHER says he wants to talk about Rhodes before he gets to that, and says it was unnecessary for Rhodes to bring up his daughter last week as their Champion vs. Champion Match at Crown Jewel is all about naming the first Crown Jewel Champion. He says unlike Rhodes' reason for doing everything he does being his family, his is for himself. A fired up Rhodes responds to GUNTHER and says that he comes from a dramatic family, then asks GUNTHER where he was yesterday and the day before that. He says he was in Las Vegas doing media for WrestleMania 41 while GUNTHER was at home sleeping. He says that while GUNTHER is World Heavyweight Champion, he's missing the responsibility of being titleholder."", 'GUNTHER gets defensive and says he tells higher ups no to their media request because he has the guts to say no.

Sabin then delivers a dropkick to Tonga off the ropes and charges at him, but accidentally hits the referee. Loa blindsides him from behind and grabs a couple of chairs from the timekeeper's area.

New WWE Tag Team Champions were crowned and Jey is back with Jimmy.', 'Crown Jewel is coming together with a huge card.', 'Here are some key takeaways from SmackDown on October 25, 2024:', ""Randy Orton delivered a stellar promo that set the stage for his Crown Jewel match against Kevin Owens. Right from the start, Orton was emotional and passionately demanded answers from his friend Triple H. The tension skyrocketed when Triple H tried to spare Orton's feelings, but finally revealed he wasn’t protecting Owens but rather safeguarding his former Evolution factionmate. Triple H did a good job of selling the idea that Owens had become unhinged. Orton's reaction showed he was devastated that his friend didn't have faith he could handle his own problem."", ""Orton sold every moment, showcasing raw emotion and conviction. This match is being added to the Crown Jewel card at the last minute, but it's immediately become one of the big draws of the show based on this promo. This was a masterclass in how to sell a match, and these two did so without Owens even being in the building."", 'Up until tonight, WWE’s buildup for the Crown Jewel showdown between Cody Rhodes and Gunther has fallen flat, especially in selling the animosity between the two. Even on Friday, the first half of this segment lacked intensity as Gunther’s mockingly casual ""What do you want to talk about"" fell short of creating real tension. Cody’s response felt equally lackluster, lacking the fire one WWE needs to make this match a must-see.', ""When each was asked why they thought the other could win, both recited their credentials but their answers didn't really make sense. Gunther did a better job, but the segment suffered from poor direction, with two top-tier performers struggling to turn a forced script into a heated rivalry. It was a huge relief when these two started fighting."", 'Things picked up only when chaos finally erupted between the two, leading to Ludwig Kaiser and Randy Orton’s involvement. That turned into a tag match for next week. It feels like WWE should have amped up the hatred earlier, setting the stage with far more fire and intensity.', 'The Motor City Machine Guns’ unexpected victory on SmackDown was a huge way to set the ending of the show in motion. In a night full of twists, Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin not only shocked fans by capturing the Tag Team Championships but also became the unlikely center of WWE’s escalating Bloodline saga.', 'Initially earning the No. 1 Contender spot with a win over DIY, the Guns were immediately challenged by The Bloodline for an impromptu title match, despite objections from GM Nick Aldis. Chaos quickly ensued as Jimmy Uso and Roman Reigns got tangled in a backstage brawl with Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu.', ""When Tonga Loa and Tama Tonga went for chairs to take out The Machine Guns, Jey Uso showed up in a thrilling reveal. He was the hooded figure who helped neutralize The New Bloodline's interference. He got the Bloodline back for costing him the Intercontinental Title on Raw. It was Jey who ensured the tag team titles went elsewhere."", 'The night ended on an emotional note with the Uso brothers reuniting in the ring. This tag team title change marks a seismic shift in WWE’s tag team division and shows WWE really believes in this new team. And, with Roman Reigns watching the Uso reunion, which way is he going to lean next week?', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'We want to hear from you!

He immediately calls Triple H out to the ring, accusing him of protecting Kevin Owens. Owens, of course, sneak attacked Orton a couple of weeks ago after the latter tried to keep him from attacking Cody Rhodes. Like Rhodes at Bad Blood, the parking lot was the scene of the crime and last week's video from Owens indicating he didn't know whether he even wanted to continue wrestling or not had a chilling effect on Smackdown."", 'Orton attempted to get SmackDown GM Nick Aldis to make the match, but Aldis said it was above his paygrade. Now, he got to the top. ', ""Triple H comes out and after constant pressuring about protection he snapped back that he's in fact protecting Orton and his steel rod back.

Hayes kicks out and Andrade lands on Knight, starting a series of almost-hit-the-refs that ends with a Superkick that takes Knight out. Hayes blocks the third of the Three Amigos and lands a Cutter for what would be a 3-count but no ref. Knight drags Hayes out the ring and slams him into the table. Andrade takes offense and Knight BFT\'s Andrade and then Hayes before storming out the ring, rings the bell and grabs the mic and declares himself the winner.', 'Backstage, Aldis confronts Knight and tells him that he only earned himself a Triple Threat Match at Crown Jewel.', 'Naomi vs Candice Lerae', ""Prior to Knight's backstage scene, Toffany Stratton tried to volunteer to take on Naomi for Nia Jax, but Jax told her not to worry about it.

The chemistry just isn't there though, these face offs just keep falling flat and this was a slight step up.

You can check out spoiler results from the tapings here.', 'With that being said, here are the hits and misses from 10/25 Friday Night SmackDown.', 'Two absolute legends of this business going back and forth on the mic. Doesn’t get any better than that. The crowd was chanting RKO. It sucks that Hunter can no longer get physical because of the defibrillator otherwise we’d have seen him go at it. Overall, the promo did a fantastic job of setting up Orton versus Owens in Saudi Arabia.', 'What’s the point of doing a Best of 7 when you aren’t going to give the fans a decisive winner? Yes, the whole point was to set up the triple threat for the United States Championship at Crown Jewel. But Melo versus Andrade needed a winner because that was the point of this entire feud. An underwhelming ending to an otherwise brilliant feud. I’m looking forward to the match though.', 'Nothing’s more dangerous than a cold, calculated heel that makes sense. Gunther telling Cody he didn’t show up to work because he refused was such a fantastic line. It seems that are slowly peeling away the “Good Guy” mask from Cody with all these promos and segments featuring Owens, Orton, and now Gunther on WWE SmackDown.', 'A decent match at best. I’m glad that Candice LeRae is once again starting to get some love from WWE Creative. Naomi seems to be the one to challenge Nia Jax for her title after Crown Jewel. Let’s see how Bayley fits into the whole picture.', 'After giving arguably the match of the night against #DIY, MCMG capped off the show with a huge title win over The Bloodline. Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin have wrestled just three matches in WWE and they’re already the tag team champions on SmackDown. The blue brand couldn’t have asked for a better team to represent its tag team division.', 'The Usos are back together.

Before Orton walks through the curtain, he stops and argues with Triple H. We can’t hear what they are saying over Orton’s theme music. Orton walks off and makes his way to the ring.', 'Orton says he’s been doing everything he can to get his hands on Kevin Owens at Crown Jewel. Orton notes that he got stonewalled by SmackDown GM Nick Aldis. Orton knows who he needs to talk to because it seems like Triple H is protecting Kevin Owens from Orton.

Triple H gets frustrated and says he’s trying to protect Orton. Triple H says Owens let his guard down with Orton and Rhodes. Owens trusted him. In Owens’ mind, Orton and Rhodes turned on him. Triple H says this isn’t the same Kevin Owens. Something is different in him. Triple H says he just got Orton back and doesn’t want him to end up back on the shelf. Orton says that’s not going to happen.', 'Orton didn’t ask the COO of this company to come to the ring. He wants The Game. What would The Game do if he were in Orton’s shoes? Orton begs Triple H for a match with Owens at Crown Jewel. The crowd cheers. Triple H tells the crowd he hopes they understand what they are asking for. Triple H agrees to give Orton his match against Owens at Crown Jewel. As he leaves the ring, Triple H tells Orton to protect himself at all times.', 'Great opening segment. Adding Triple H to this angle adds even more weight and emotion. Triple H has a deep history with Orton and Owens, and if someone as sadistic as Triple H is worried about what Owens will do to Orton, it gives us a clear picture of what Orton is in with the NEW Kevin Owens. This match is going to slap.', 'Andrade floors Hayes with his feint elbow strike as soon as the bell rings. Hayes kicks out.

Knight grabs a mic and says he’s the winner and walks off.', 'No Contest', 'I can watch these two fight all day. This match was great until the finish. This is obviously leading to a triple-threat match for the title, but a B.S. finish diminishes this fun contest.', 'Naomi and LeRae trade shots. LeRae ends up out of the ring.

Even with LeRae being featured, Naomi is in line for a title shot. Having her lose here would kill all of her would be counterproductive. Naomi gave LeRae a lot here, but not too much to take away from what this match was: a vehicle to push forward the angle between Naomi/Bayley/Jax/Stratton.', 'WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes is out first. Gunther’s music interrupts the crowd, who are singing Rhodes’ song. Gunther mockingly asks Rhodes what he wants to talk about. Rhodes says he wants to know why Gunther thinks he’ll leave Crown Jewel with the Crown Jewel Championship. Gunther tells Rhodes that he was out of line for mentioning his daughter last week.

Rhodes says he is who he is. Gunther smirks. Rhodes asks Gunther where he was yesterday. Rhodes says he was doing press for WrestleMania, and Gunther clearly couldn’t be bothered to get out of bed. Rhodes exclaims that Gunther has the gold but that he is missing out on responsibility.', 'Gunther notes that he gets the same request as Rhodes. He is just brave enough to say no. Gunther says the reason Rhodes doesn’t say no or put himself first is that if he stops being everyone else’s servant, his story is over. That makes Rhodes a gutless champion. A gutless champion will always be secondary to Gunther. Rhodes says they may call Gunther the “Ring General,” but that’s not what he sees.', 'He sees a General that leads no one. A man out only for himself. If Gunther wants to talk about guts, that’s what Rhodes has built his whole career on. Guts is ending a civil decision like this and taking the first shot. Rhodes uppercuts Gunther. Rhodes beats down Gunther. Ludwig Kaiser attacks from behind. Randy Orton runs down to the ring. Gunther and Kaiser powder.', 'Shelley and Gargano kick off the match, trading submission holds and takedowns. Shelley and Sabin double-team Gargano with a chancery into a dropkick.

Did you ever think you would see #DIY face the Motor City Machine Guns on SmackDown? This match was exactly what you would expect, for better or worse. Triple H is booking SmackDown like it’s OG NXT, and it’s still unclear if that’s a good or bad thing. With that, these four men, not shockingly, work well together, and they balanced the graps with solid high-flying action. Fun match.', 'After the break, SmackDown GM Nick Aldis is in the ring, standing between MCMG and the Bloodline. Aldis says this isn’t going down like this. Solo Siko says they are just here to introduce themselves. Sikoa tells the crowd to acknowledge him. Everyone boos. The crowd is all over Sikoa, booing him mercilessly whenever he tries to speak. Sabin tells Sikoa they will take their title match any time, any place, anywhere. Sikoa says he knows they want to make an… IMPACT… so why not right here, right now? Aldis steps in and says he’ll be damned if he lets MCMG get cheated out of the title shot they earned. Shelley interrupts and says the Bloodline’s tag titles are the most important on the planet.

Doesn’t get any better than that. The crowd was chanting RKO. It sucks that Hunter can no longer get physical because of the defibrillator otherwise we’d have seen him go at it. Overall, the promo did a fantastic job of setting up Orton versus Owens in Saudi Arabia.', 'What’s the point of doing a Best of 7 when you aren’t going to give the fans a decisive winner? Yes, the whole point was to set up the triple threat for the United States Championship at Crown Jewel. But Melo versus Andrade needed a winner because that was the point of this entire feud. An underwhelming ending to an otherwise brilliant feud. I’m looking forward to the match though.', 'Nothing’s more dangerous than a cold, calculated heel that makes sense. Gunther telling Cody he didn’t show up to work because he refused was such a fantastic line. It seems that are slowly peeling away the “Good Guy” mask from Cody with all these promos and segments featuring Owens, Orton, and now Gunther on WWE SmackDown.', 'A decent match at best. I’m glad that Candice LeRae is once again starting to get some love from WWE Creative. Naomi seems to be the one to challenge Nia Jax for her title after Crown Jewel. Let’s see how Bayley fits into the whole picture.', 'After giving arguably the match of the night against #DIY, MCMG capped off the show with a huge title win over The Bloodline. Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin have wrestled just three matches in WWE and they’re already the tag team champions on SmackDown.

He then makes his way out.', '-Orton says he’s been doing everything he can to get his hands on Kevin Owens at Crown Jewel but Owens is off limits for some reason. He says since Nick Aldis told him last week that he couldn’t face Owens at Crown Jewel as it was above his pay grade, he wants to talk to Triple H about it and claims that he’s protecting Owens from him. He then calls Triple H down to the ring and he makes his way out.', '-Triple H says while he would rather have not done this in public and disputes Orton’s claims that he’s protecting Owens. He tells Orton that he will not face Owens at Crown Jewel but Orton insists that Triple H is protecting Owens. Triple H tells Orton that he’s actually trying to protect him rather than Owens and says he’s known both him & Owens for a long time. He says Owens has never had a friend in business because he’s all about the business and money but for the 1st time ever, he let his guard down and trusted Orton & Cody Rhodes. He says while he’s not sure why that’s the case, Owens liked and trusted them. He says Orton just came back from an 18 month long recovery from injury.', '-Orton says he didn’t ask Paul Levesque or the COO of a multi billion dollar company to come down to the ring but rather The Game. He says if Triple H was in his shoes, he wouldn’t let things slide and would handle business in the middle of the ring. He then demands a match against Owens at Crown Jewel once again and Triple H finally agrees but warns Orton to protect himself at all times.', 'Non Title 7th & Final Match Of The Best Of 7 Series\nSpeed Champion Andrade (3) vs. Carmelo Hayes (3)', 'Andrade hits 3 Amigos on Carmelo Hayes but Hayes sends him crashing into the mat and goes for a pin.', 'LA Knight pulls Hayes out of the ring and sends him crashing onto the announce desk then hits BFT to Andrade in the ring and lands another one on Hayes.', 'Knight then rings the bell himself and says it’s his game rather than a game of Best of 7.', 'Winner: No One (No Contest)', '-We then head backstage to Women’s Champion Nia Jax & Miss Money In The Bank Tiffany Stratton. Jax informs Stratton that she’s recruited Candice LeRae to help them take care of Bayley & Naomi before LeRae & Indi Hartwell walk in and LeRae promises Jax that she’ll take care of Naomi tonight.', '-After the break Nick Aldis berates Knight for his actions as special guest referee and informs him that he will be defending the United States Title against both Hayes & Andrade at Crown Jewel.', 'Non Title Match\nWomen’s Speed Champion Candice LeRae vs. Naomi', 'Naomi connects with a kick to Candice LeRae’s head but Indi Hartwell sends her crashing into the ring post and dumps her back in the ring.', 'Bayley’s music hits and she runs down to the ring to take out Hartwell.', 'She sends her crashing into the barricade opening the door for Naomi to send LeRae crashing into the mat with a sit out Full Nelson for the win.', 'Winner: Naomi', '-World Heavyweight Champion Gunther asks Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes what he wants to talk about and Rhodes says it’s fairly obvious what he wants to talk about. Gunther says he wants to talk about Rhodes before he gets to that and says it was unnecessary for Rhodes to bring up his daughter last week as their Champion vs. Champion Match at Crown Jewel is all about naming the 1st Crown Jewel Champion. He says unlike Rhodes’ reason for doing everything he does being his family, his is for himself. A fired up Rhodes responds to Gunther and says that he comes from a dramatic family then asks Gunther where he was yesterday and the day before that. He says he was in Las Vegas doing media for WrestleMania 41 while Gunther was at home sleeping. He says that while Gunther is World Heavyweight Champion, he’s missing the responsibility of being champion.', '-Gunther gets defensive and says he tells higher ups no to their media request because he has the guts to say no. He says Rhodes is a gutless champion and that will always make him secondary to him. Rhodes says he doesn’t see Gunther as The Ring General because he leads no one but himself. He says he had the guts to make a name for himself outside of WWE then attacks Gunther. Ludwig Kaiser appears out of nowhere and clocks Rhodes.

Solo Sikoa demands that Brooklyn acknowledge him then welcomes Motor City Machine Guns to Smackdown before he introduces himself and the rest of The Bloodline. Sabin says it’s an honor to meet Sikoa then introduces himself and Shelley to Sikoa. Sika then suggest a WWE Tag Team Titles match right here and now, but Aldis intervenes and demands that Sikoa show them some respect. Shelley tells Aldis that if Tama Tonga & Tanga Loa want to put their titles on the line right now, they’re good to go.

Then they cut to Gunther and then Cody Rhodes as Michael Cole noted they’d be in the same ring tonight. Also, Chris Sabin & Alex Shelley backstage followed by Johnny Gargano & Tomasso Ciampa.', '-The camera followed Ramdy Orton to the Gorilla position. He stopped at the curtains and turned around and had a chat with Paul “Triple H” Levesque. Levesque seemed a bit taken aback. Orton then made his way to the ring. Corey Graves said that conversation had to be about Nick Aldis telling Orton last week that asking for a match against Kevin Owens goes over his head considering Owens is essentially suspended for his attack on Cody outside the arena two weeks ago after Hell in a Cell.', 'Orton called Levesque to the ring. He said he suspects he’s protecting Kevin Owens from him. They cut backstage to Levesque exhaling and taking off his headset after his music began to play. Graves said Levesque runs the show, so Orton has to be careful. He said he’d have preferred not to do that out at the ring, but since he never seems to show up to work on time, “which we can talk about later,” I guess we’ll do this now. Orton said everyone know that he’s protecting KO from him. Levesque denied that as he entered the ring.', 'Levesque said he is just doing his job. Orton said Levesque has a soft spot for Owens. He told him to admit he’s protecting him over and over. Levesque said he is not protecting him. “I am trying to protect you!” Levesque said. Fans “oohhh’d.” Fans chanted “RKO! RKO!” Levesque said he’s known both Orton and Owens since the day they stepped into WWE. He said Owens wanted to be known as “a prize fighter” because it’s always about business. He told Orton he knows what that is like. He said Owens never had an actual friend, but for some reason recently he let his guard down around him and Cody Rhodes.', 'He said maybe he was attracted to the good person he wants to be in Cody and he sees the “miserable prick” in Orton he doesn’t want to be. He said Owens trusted them and he felt betrayed. He said when he talked to Owens, he sensed there was something different in his eyes and disconnected in him now. “Quite frankly, I don’t want to put him in the ring with you,” he said. He explained that Orton just came back after 18 months on the shelf. He said he had steel rods put in his back and he was told he’d never wrestle again, “but here you are and I just got you back.” He said he doesn’t want to see him go back on the shelf, perhaps permanently this time.', 'Orton assured him that won’t happen. He said he didn’t ask Paul Levesque to come out, the guy in a suit. He said he wanted Triple H, the guy in a leather jacket with a sledgehammer. He said he wanted the guy who beat the miserable prick out of him on his front lawn. He said he’s not the old Orton who was impulsive. He said he knows what’s at stake in his career now. He said Levesque knows as well as anyone what it’s like to have everything taken away from him. He said people like them need to handle their business in the ring. “Please, I beg of you, Hunter,” he said. Fans chanted, “Let them fight!”', 'Levesque said, “I hope to god you all know what you’re asking for.” He agreed to book him against Owens at Crown Jewel, then told him to protect himself at all times, then left the ring as Orton’s music played.', '(Keller’s Analysis: This is a slight augmentation of the ol’ “don’t suspend him, let me wrestle him” plea that territory bookers employed for years in past decades when someone overstepped the bounds like Owens did. I like Levesque really selling the idea that Owens is dangerous and Orton is at risk with his recent surgery and long layoff. It makes the stakes feel higher.)', '-They went to Cole and Graves at ringside. Cole said Levesque heard Orton’s compelling argument and was persuaded. He wondered if Orton got caught up in the situation too much emotionally. Graves said Orton just forced Triple H’s hand and he might regret getting what he asked for. Cole pivoted to plugging the Andrade vs. Carmelo Hayes match.', '-A video package aired on their past six matches in the series.', '-L.A. Knight made his ring entrance to be special referee. He was wearing his U.S. Title belt around his waist. [c]', '(1) CARMELO HAYES vs. ANDRADE – Match Seven in the Series', 'Andrade made his entrance. Carmelo made his entrance. When the bell rang 22 minutes into the hour, Andrade landed a quick spinning elbow for a two count. Knight continued to wear his title belt. Cole said he’s never seen that before. Andrade kicked away at Hayes in the corner. Knight admonished Andrade. Hayes leaped and hit Andrade, then exchanged words with Knight. Andrade knocked Hayes to the floor. Knight blocked Andrade from doing a dive. Knight then began counting Hayes out. Andrade leaped over Knight and landed on Hayes. They cut to a double-box break at 3:00. [c/db]', 'During the break, they fought at ringside and then back into the ring. Hayes grounded Andrade. Andrade fought back and after the break landed a springboard Spanish fly. Both were down and slow to get up. Andrade took control and landed double-knees in the corner. When Hayes kicked out of Andrade’s cover, Andrade landed on Knight. Hayes rolled up Andrade, but Knight was recovering from being landed on. Hayes tried to superkick Andrade, but he caught Knight by mistake. Andrade then gave Hayes two unreleased vertical suplexes, but Hayes blocked a third and landed a cutter. Knight yanked Hayes out of the ring and threw him into the announce table.', 'Knight then confronted Knight in the ring. Andrade took a swing at him. Knight ducked and gave him a BFT. Graves said that wasn’t very impartial. Hayes confronted Knight, so Knight gave him a BFT. Knight dropped to the floor and rang the bell. He then stood on the announce desk and said, “To hell with game seven.” He said there is still just one man who is still U.S. Champion. Cole said, “I’m not sure how I feel about that.” Graves said two of the best athletes in the world were competing and Knight made it all about him. “I’m done with this guy,” said Graves, emphatically.', 'WINNER: No contest in 11:00.', '(Keller’s Analysis: Knight’s babyface character and popularity isn’t dependent on him being level-headed or fit to be a referee, but this did feel like a really cheap way to end what turned into a Best of Seven series. The good news, fans weren’t that invested in the outcome probably, so there won’t be outrage over this.)', '-Backstage Tiffany Stratton told Nia Jax she is there and ready to serve her. Jax said she needs someone to Naomi because she can’t get her off her back. Tiffany eagerly volunteered. Jax said she already found someone – Candice LeRae. She said she pinned Bayley last week. LeRae walked in with Indi Hartwell. She said she’s going to take care of Naomi, so Tiffany can just relax.', '-Cole hyped Naomi vs. LeRae. [c]', '-Aldis confronted Knight and asked, “What the hell was that?” He said he’s made himself the center of attention, so he’ll get both guys in a Triple Threat match at Crown Jewel.', '(2) NAOMI vs. CANDICE LERAE (w/Indi Hartwell)', 'Naomi made her “glow” ring entrance. The bell rang 41 minutes into the hour. Graves touted LeRae being the first WWE Speed Champion in the women’s division. They battled onto the ring apron where LeRae delivered a faceplant on Naomi on the edge of the ring apron. They cut to a break at 2:00. [c]', 'Indi interfered and shoved Naomi into the ringpost. Bayley ran out and attacked Indi at ringside. Naomi then attacked LeRae from behind as LeRae was looking down at Bayley. She leveraged her shoulders down for a three count.', 'WINNER: Naomi in 9:00. [c]', '-They showed Lin-Manuel Miranda in the front row.', '-They showed the Crown Jewel Title belt glistening at ringside.', '-Cody Rhodes made his ring entrance.', '-As Gunther made his entrance, Cole noted that in the last two Royal Rumbles, Cody eliminated Gunther. Graves said Gunther knows that and it gnaws at him every night. Gunther asked Cody what he wanted to talk about. Cody said he wants to know why he thinks he’ll leave Crown Jewel as champion. Cody paused. Gunther then said he’d interrupted Cody. (It’s not interrupting if the other person stopped talking and a second or two of silence took place.) Gunther said Cody didn’t need to bring his daughter into it. He said they should find out who the Crown Jewel Champion is.', 'Gunther told Cody what he doesn’t understand is him dragging the people closest to him into his business. He said it’s all for the legacy of his dad, Dusty Rhodes. He said he now wants to be “the quarterback of this operation” and keeps asking for John Cena’s schedule just to live up to somebody else’s standards.” He said he thinks he’s doing it just to make things “a little more dramatic than they actually are.” He said his reason is himself. “I am the greatest professional wrestler in this company right now,” he said. “So my reason is to live up to myself.” He told Cody to do him a favor and imagine they were in the arena alone, without the fans present, and tell him his real reason why if there really is any.', 'Cody said for a man so well-educated and well-dressed, “that is the dumbest question that has ever been asked of me in a wrestling ring.” He said none of this exists without all of the fans. He said he had the nerve and gumption to take away their “whoa!” in his song. He led the fans in getting it out of their system. He said they are dramatic. He said they don’t call them Cody Crybabies for nothing. He said he is a bit of a messy king.', 'Cody asked where he was yesterday or the day before that. He said he was doing media rounds promoting WrestleMania 41 “but you couldn’t be bothered to get out of bed.” He said the part he’s missing is the giant responsibility that comes with his title. Gunther insisted he is the work horse champion of the company. “I know everything about responsibility!” he said. He said he gets the same requests that Cody does, “but I have the guts to say no” to any media request or charity appearances. He said the reason Cody doesn’t put himself first is that if he stops being the servant of everybody else, his story is over. He said that makes him a gutless champion “and the gutless champion will always be secondary to me.”', 'Cody said they call Gunther the “Ring General.” He said he’s 6-4, 250 terrorizing the planet, but he commands no one but himself. He said all he does is show guts. “The path less traveled has been made up of my guts!” He said guts is ending a civil discussion like they’re having and taking the first shot. He attacked Gunther. Ludwig Kaiser quickly joined the fight. He and Gunther attacked Cody. Orton ran out for the save. Graves said he thinks Gunther found the chink in Cody’s armor. [c]', '-They showed aerial shots of Manhattan including Madison Square Garden, but labelled it “Brooklyn, N.Y.”', '-A video package aired on the Raw main event with Bron Breakker beating Jey Uso to retain the Intercontinental Title after The Bloodline showed up at ringside.', '-A bunch of women wrestlers were arguing. The G.M.’s of NXT (Ava), Smackdown, and Raw (Adam Pearce) told Bianca Belair & Jade Cargill that at Crown Jewel they’ll defend their tag titles in a Fatal Four-way tag match against the other three teams – Iyo Sky & Kairi Sane, Chelsea Green & Piper Niven, and Jakara Jackson & Lash Legend. The camera panned over to the teams who went into cartoon mode reacting to the news.', '-As DIY made their way to the ring, Cole said this is the kind of match pro wrestling fans have craved for years.', '(3) DIY (Tomasso Ciampa & Johnny Gargano) vs. THE MOTOR CITY MACHINE GUNS – No. 1 Contendership match', 'The bell rang 27 minutes into the hour. Cole said Shelley taught Gargano the Gargano Escape. Graves said Shelley used to sleep on his floor when they were indy wrestlers dreaming of making it big. Gargano battled Shelley at first. Ciampa tagged in next. They cut to a break a few minutes in. [c]', 'As the action continued, Graves joked that he and Shelley sat on his couch years ago and said Gargano would never make it out of Cleveland. Ciampa connected with a running knee on Sabin for a near fall at 10:00. He and Gargano set up the Meet in the Middle, but Shelley yanked Ciampa out of the ring. Gargano and Shelley, meanwhile, exchanged leverage two counts. Gargano tried to superkick Sabin, but Sabin ducked so he superkicked Ciampa instead. Shelley and Sabin then landed Skull & Bones for the win. Graves said they’re making believers out of WWE fans.', 'WINNERS: Machine Guns in 12:00.', '(Keller’s Analysis: Good action, and really just a teaser of a match they could have if given 5-15 more minutes.)', '-As the Guns celebrated, The Bloodline made their way out. [c]', '-Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and Jacob Fatu were in the ring. Aldis had joined them and said they aren’t going to fight tonight. Solo said there’s no problem there. Fans chanted, “OTC!” Solo told them to shut their mouths. He said they just came out to introduce themselves to the no. 1 contenders for their tag titles. He told Brooklyn, New York to acknowledge him. Fans booed. He welcomed Sabin and Shelly to Smackdown. He said he is their Tribal Chief. Sabin introduced himself to Solo. He said they’re always read, so let them know when they want to face them. Solo said if they want to “make an impact for themselves,” how about a tag title match “right here, right now.”', 'Aldis said those men have fought and sacrificed for 20 years, so he won’t let them get their fairly earned title shot when they’re anything less than 100 percent. Shelley interjected that if they want to do it right here, right now, they’re ready. Aldis called for a referee. Graves said it wasn’t a smart decision.', '(4) TAMA TONGA & TONGA LOA vs. THE MOTOR CITY MACHINE GUNS – WWE Tag Team Title match', 'The bell rang 48 minutes into the hour. Shelley and Sabin threw Tama and Loa to the floor and then set up a dive, but Tama and Loa re-entered and dropkicked them. They cut to a very early double-box break. [c/db]', 'Tama and Loa dominated during the break. Cole talked about these teams having a history in New Japan. When Shelley avoided top rope splashes, Solo stood on the ring apron. Jimmy Uso showed up and yanked him down and threw him into the ringside steps. He superkicked a charging Fatu. Fatu and Solo, though, double-teamed him at ringside. Roman Reigns’s music played and he came out, which froze Solo and Fatu. Roman walked out,. Fatu charged after him, but Reigns hit him with a Superman Punch. Roman and Jimmy brawled with Fatu and Solo up the ramp.', 'Meanwhile, Sabin battled Tama in the ring. When Shelley charged at Tama, Tama pulled the ref into his path. Loa attacked Shelley. With the ref down, Tama and Loa were about to use chairs when Jimmy Uso showed up in a hood. He speared Tama and then lowered his hood and facemask. Shelley and Sabin then finished Tama with a double-team Skull & Bones splash for the win. Cole said it was only their third match in WWE. As Sabin and Shelley celebrated their way up to the entrance stage, Cole said, “Guys, welcome to the show!”', 'WINNERS: Machine Guns to capture the WWE Tag Team Titles in 8:00.', '(Keller’s Analysis: Wow. That’s pretty cool for Sabin & Shelley. I think they’ve made a good enough impression on fans early on and were talked up enough in general by announcers that even fans barely or not-at-all familiar with their impressive track record will see them as credible fast-rising champs rather than fluke champions.)', '-Jimmy entered the ring and approached Jey apprehensively. He moved in and they hugged. Fans exploded with cheers. They showed Roman watching from the stage. Fans chanted “OTC!” Roman didn’t reveal his emotions.', 'CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO OUR POST-SHOW PODCAST', '', 'PWTorch editor Wade Keller will be joined by ProWrestling.net’s Jake Barnett to review Smackdown LIVE.

The night kicked off with Gunther, Cody Rhodes, and tag teams DIY and Motor City Machine Guns arriving at the arena, signaling a night filled with intense clashes and rivalries. As WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes came face-to-face with Gunther, tensions quickly escalated into a heated exchange. Rhodes stood his ground against Gunther, who was supported by Ludwig Kaiser. But as things started to turn violent, Randy Orton made a timely intervention, rescuing Rhodes from an impending attack.', 'One of the night’s most riveting moments came when Randy Orton, eager for a match with Kevin Owens, directly confronted Triple H. The backstage tension between Orton and Triple H reached new heights as Orton demanded the match he had long awaited. When Orton accused Triple H of protecting Owens, Triple H initially dismissed the idea, citing concerns for Orton’s health due to his recent recovery. Yet, the tension between them simmered as Orton called Triple H out, urging him to step into his old “Cerebral Assassin” persona. The verbal clash ended with Triple H reluctantly granting Orton his request, setting up an explosive showdown against Kevin Owens at Crown Jewel.', 'The feud between Andrade and Carmelo Hayes reached a thrilling climax in a match with special guest referee LA Knight. Both competitors pushed their limits, showcasing incredible moves including an inverted Spanish fly from Andrade and a spinning facebuster from Hayes. But the intense competition took a chaotic turn when LA Knight intervened, dealing his BFT finisher to both Andrade and Hayes in the ring. His actions didn’t go unnoticed—Nick Aldis later announced that LA Knight, Andrade, and Carmelo Hayes would face off in a Triple Threat Match for the U.S. Championship at Crown Jewel, raising the stakes even higher.', 'In another hard-fought match, Naomi took on Candice LeRae, who was supported by Indi Hartwell. Despite Candice’s advantage, Naomi’s resilience shone through. A distraction from Bayley helped Naomi secure the win, adding momentum to her ongoing feud.', 'The night saw a shocking reunion of the Usos as they joined forces against the current Bloodline faction. The reunion of the original Bloodline, sparked by the Usos’ fierce loyalty, marked a pivotal moment in WWE’s ongoing storyline dynamics.', 'As WWE heads toward the Crown Jewel event, the SmackDown action promises even more electrifying drama, pitting WWE’s fiercest competitors against each other in a night that will be remembered for its explosive confrontations, dramatic feuds, and unforgettable matchups.', 'Halie Heaney is an accomplished author at SpeaksLY, specializing in international news across diverse categories.

WWE SmackDown 10/25/2023: 3 Things We Hated And 3 Things We Loved,https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1698292/wwe-smackdown-october-25-2023-3-things-we-hated-3-things-we-loved/,"['', 'Welcome to Wrestling Inc.\'s weekly review of ""WWE SmackDown,"" the show that now features the only team in history to win tag title gold in WWE, ROH, TNA, and NJPW. As you might expect, the WINC crew has a lot to say about the Motor City Machine Guns unexpectedly winning the WWE tag titles Friday night, as well as the surrounding Bloodline drama that ended in a big Ucey hug in the middle of the ring. There was a lot going on and there\'s a lot to unpack.', 'Between that, the show-opening Randy Orton promo, the Cody Rhodes/GUNTHER promo, and ""Game 7"" of Andrade vs. Carmelo Hayes, we have tons of stuff to go over, and certainly not enough room for everything. If you want to read about what happened in the Candice LeRae vs. Naomi match, you\'re going to want to check out our ""SmackDown"" results page. If not, here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 10/25/24 episode of ""WWE SmackDown!""', '', 'Everything in a professional wrestling storyline is always done for a reason, but sometimes there are better, more effective, and less convoluted ways of getting to where they need to go. The opening segment of ""SmackDown"" that featured Randy Orton demand a match against Kevin Owens from Triple H at Crown Jewel is a great example of such.', ""It seems counterproductive to have Triple H refuse to give Orton a match against Owens and list off several reasons why he shouldn't make the match official only for him to turn around after Orton made a somewhat flimsy and basic case to him that he would've done the same thing if he was still wrestling. While I can see what WWE was trying to get at and it makes perfect sense for Orton to desperately want a match against Owens, Triple H is now a high profile WWE executive now rather than still being a wrestler. Storyline wise, it would make much more sense for him to decline to give Orton in order to do what's best for the company and Orton himself, have Orton relentlessly ask Triple H for the match, and Triple H agree to give it to him in an unsanctioned capacity."", 'Written by Olivia Quinlan', '', 'This feels strange to me to write a ""hated"" section about LA Knight, because I\'ve been a big fan of his and jumped on the bandwagon during his meteoric rise. I was one of those fans who thought he deserved the United States Championship a heck of a lot sooner than when he actually won it from Logan Paul, but now, I feel like I\'m questioning a lot of my own choices after tonight. Knight was set to be the special guest referee for ""game seven"" of Carmelo Hayes and Andrade\'s best of seven series. Initially, that felt like it made sense, considering both Hayes and Andrade had previously lost to Knight, then kept fighting each other, seemingly inevitably leading to the winner of the series facing Knight again, but that\'s not what we got here. What we are getting is a triple threat match at Crown Jewel, which I don\'t necessarily hate, but the way we got there on ""SmackDown"" tonight was quite irksome.', ""Special guest referees are usually quite distracting in any match they're involved in, but Knight took the cake when it came to distracting tonight. He refereed wearing sunglasses, which got on my nerves for whatever reason, and also wore the championship while he did so, at least for the first half of the match. While that was all kind of goofy, but really on brand for Knight, Hayes got in Knight's face for missing a pinfall after Hayes sent Andrade crashing in to the champion and Hayes also smacked him with an accidental big super kick. That peeved the champion off enough that he pulled Hayes out of the ring and sent him flying over the announce desk before hitting a BFT to Andrade in the ring. He followed up with one on Hayes for good measure, then the most egregiously bad part of the segment happened, as if it needed to get any worse."", 'Knight run the ring bell himself before grabbing a mic and literally saying ""to hell with game seven."" To hell with game seven?!? Why have I been watching the same match (albeit a very good one) over and over, then? Knight went as far as declaring himself winner of game seven... but that is absolutely not how that works. Even as a usual fan of Knight\'s, I just didn\'t like this one bit. It got us what has the potential to be a pretty cool triple threat next weekend, but we had to suffer to get there. Andrade and Hayes deserve better, and I hope one of them walks away in Saudi Arabia with the title, because it seems like Knight is more interesting in the chase.', 'Written by Daisy Ruth', '', '""We are proud to be dramatic,"" Cody Rhodes said to WWE World Heavyweight Champion GUNTHER. ""We are proud to be a bit of a messy king.""', ""We're in a little bit of a slough with WWE booking. Rhodes was involved in some weird and complicated angles with Roman Reigns, his friendship with Kevin Owens — which he is now fully dissociated from, storyline-wise — fell through in dramatic fashion, and he is trying to prove his chops to GUNTHER in order to hype up their match for what is essentially an accessory championship with no real consequences. Friday's promo segment between Rhodes and GUNTHER reflected this recent slough, and while no real points are made, a new character poked its head over the horizon and met our eyes with a small, coy wink."", 'After weeks of Rhodes acting like the moral standard and self-righteous savior, it is so incredibly refreshing to get ""The American Nightmare"" to admit that he is a bit of a messy king. If this is indicative of an incoming messy girl era for Rhodes, I am ready.', 'Rhodes\' acknowledgement of his messiness is a great example of character archetype subversion, and the potential for entertainment these subversions contain. Instead of acting like the epitome of moral righteousness, as he has done most notably in his explosive segments with Kevin Owens, Rhodes told GUNTHER that yes, he is a messy king, but his messiness does not change his credibility as a fighter, nor as a champion. Rhodes told GUNTHER that yes, his fanbase are called ""Cody Crybabies"" for a reason, but they are simultaneously ""Cody Bada**es,"" and that both realities can exist. So often, it feels like champions — more often than not, babyface champions — have to be stoic, to have this insane grip of their emotions, and to some extent, they do. However, that does not negate the entertainment value of a babyface who shirks those expectations, who fully plays into this nearly nebulous, somewhat selfish, partially petty dramatics. This is even more impactful when it is performed by the epitome of American hypermasculinity — by literally the last person you would think of. I am in love with every sliver of messy girl era Cody Rhodes we can get.', 'Even if you don\'t particularly enjoy petty characters or the subversion of personality archetypes, one can appreciate the change that Rhodes is going through, as a character, in a part of his career that feels so stagnant. It has been clear to everybody that Rhodes and WWE are sitting on Rhodes\' true potential as a champion until Roman Reigns and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are fully committed and booked for a WrestleMania-level storyline. As such, his title defenses and character as a champion have felt lukewarm, like he is just sitting around waiting for his true rivals to come back. At least with this lean into the dramatic, messy girl side of his personality, Rhodes is creating opportunities to be dynamic in this pre-WrestleMania booking limbo we find ourselves in.', 'Written by Angeline Phu', '', 'After years in the making, wrestling fans got a dream match they never thought they\'d see when Motor City Machine Guns faced #DIY to name the Number 1 contender for the ""SmackDown"" tag titles. Unlike Wade Barrett, Michael Cole understands the importance of The Guns to modern wrestling, specifically to tag teams. He spoke of their history in wrestling and with their opponents, particularly Johnny Gargano, who posted on social media this week about looking up to Alex Shelley and them eventually becoming friends. Shelley responded with his own kind words about Gargano.', 'This match allowed MCMG to show the WWE Universe more of what they can do and why they deserve to be on a big stage. #DIY went toe-to-toe with one of the very best. Early on in the match, Shelley bested Gargano in a sequence that left Gargano holding up his fingers and saying ""this close."" The match had added tension with Ciampa not liking Gargano\'s admiration of Shelley. The tension deepened when Gargano took Ciampa down by mistake when his opponent moved out of the way. The Guns won and became the No. 1 contenders as expected.', ""As a big fan of both teams, I really wish that match had gotten more time. We now know why that happened, but for a dream match on a one week (or weak) build, it deserved more time. Hopefully we'll get a rematch in the future and it'll get the time it should. Perhaps a rematch with the tag titles on the line."", ""I'm happy to see the Guns win the titles so quickly. Last week, Nick Aldis told them they were there to shake up the tag team division on the blue brand and they've already done a week later. Hopefully they'll get a meaningful title run — the first of many."", 'Written by Samantha Schipman', '', 'Yes, I just loved MCMG winning the tag titles. But I am also conflicted about how it happened.', 'Of course MCMG barely had time to celebrate when The New Bloodline made their usual main event appearance. When they got in the ring, the fans were chanting for Roman Reigns. The Guns were no longer the most important people in the ring. Solo Sikoa introduced himself as the Tribal Chief. Sabin introduced himself and his partner before saying, ""...whenever you\'re ready to hand those championships over, just let us know. Any place, any time."" That time and place was right then and there.', ""The match itself was alright. Sikoa and Fatu got involved early on. There was a ref bump. The Usos interfered, not to help MCMG, but to screw The New Bloodline (not that it wasn't deserved, especially after they cost Jey the Intercontinental Championship on Monday). When you're in the Bloodline's orbit (new or original), you are the least important part of the story. The Bloodline has been the cornerstone of the Blue brand's show for five years. The show ended not with the new champions celebrating in the ring, but with Reigns brooding at the top of the ramp because The Usos hugged and the fans went nuts."", ""So while I am very happy for Shelley and Sabin to have the titles after only three matches, the Bloodline stench is hanging over it. I hope that it isn't a precursor to the rest of their title reign. I also hope that their title reign lasts longer than #DIY's run a few months ago (LESS THAN A MOON CYCLE!). MCMG are truly one of the best tag teams of their generation and have earned the chance to have a meaningful reign, especially being belted this early into their WWE careers."", 'Written by Samantha Schipman', '', 'The Samoan Dynasty soap opera that is The Bloodline tale continued to unfold during this week\'s ""WWE SmackDown,"" a night that saw Solo Sikoa\'s hubris and underestimation of the Motor City Machine Guns become his group\'s undoing as the Guerillas of Destiny lost their tag titles in the main event.', 'MCMG weren\'t without help on their side, however, as Roman Reigns and Jimmy Uso emerged to even the odds and attack Sikoa and Jacob Fatu. As the ""Original Tribal Chief"" and ""Big Jim"" fought their kin to the back, the soon-to-be new champs were still left with Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa. When the referee took a bump it felt like a truly familiar story of Bloodline interference squashing yet another challenger, and I was gearing up to hate the bones of it. So you can imagine the welcome surprise of seeing a third babyface invade enter the frame: ""Main Event"" Jey Uso.', ""What I specifically found cool about the moment was the logic behind his appearance, coming after his twin brother and Reigns had already disappeared from the arena in a deliberate act of pure vengeance – a title for a title – after The Bloodline cost him the Intercontinental Championship on Monday. He wasn't shoehorned into a reunion with his family right away, further continuing the gradual and logical build to resolution while taking time to preserve each character's arc. When the bell had rung and the new champions had celebrated their way up the ramp, Jey stood alone in the ring as a familiar face walked back down the ramp; six months after standing opposite one another at WrestleMania, Jey and Jimmy Uso emotionally hugged it out. It was yet another emotional turn in the brothers' tale over the past four years. They had fought together, won together, reigned together, and lost together, catalyzing their spell at odds with one another, and at what cost? The Bloodline as they knew it is gone, their in-fighting providing the window for invaders like Fatu and G.O.D to enter the fold, and now there is more that should unite them than divide them."", ""However, that isn't the case as it pertains to Jey and Roman, and that was equally communicated to great effect. Reigns watched on as his cousins re-united, giving a contemplative stare towards the proceedings as the show drew to a close. It was Reigns that had driven the wedge between the brothers to begin with, hammered them both verbally and physically throughout their joint-service to The Bloodline, and sought to stunt their ambitions to keep himself at the top. That sort of trauma doesn't disappear because he is no longer the champion or the chief, he is still a walking memory of a dark time in Jey's career. This closing segment did really well to capture the longing and regret of a cousin on the outside, knowing his road to redemption isn't going to be an easy one after all he put them through."", 'Written by Max Everett', '', '', '', '', '']"

Gunther and Cody were also shown entering the building. Ditto for Motor City Machine Guns, #DIY and Randy Orton, the last of which featured Orton stopping on the way to the ring to talk to Paul Levesque in Guerrilla Position. Levesque motioned for Orton to go the ring.', 'The Randy Orton/Paul Levesque segment', 'Well, it was fun to have Levesque out there, and it was fun seeing Orton walk past him backstage before ultimately getting to the ring and calling Levesque out. They tried with the promo. Hard. Really hard. Noticeably hard. But I am interested in seeing what this means for how Owens approaches their match at Crown Jewel. If he’s going to be painted as a ruthless, angry fella, he better be both ruthless and angry and he better not hold back – especially after all this.', 'Orton noted how he wanted to get his hands on Kevin Owens, but it looks like Owens is off limits. Orton then invited Levesque to the ring. Orton said he thought Levesque was protecting Owens from Orton. The Triple H music then hit and Levesque was seen getting up from Guerrilla and Levesque appeared in the entranceway. Levesque said Orton never shows up to work on time and because of that, they had to “do this now.”', 'Orton yelled that Levesque is protecting Owens, but Levesque said he wasn’t protecting anybody. Levesque told Orton that the match isn’t going to happen and Orton kept yelling it is because Levesque is trying to protect Owens and finally Levesque shut orton up and said he was trying to protect Orton. The crowd chanted “RKO!” Levesque explained that Owens has never had a friend in this business. Levesque noted how Owens is all about nothing but business. Levesque said for the first time, Owens let his guard down and trusted Orton and Cody. Levesque worked in calling Orton a “miserable prick.” Levesque then noted how Cody and Orton turned on Owens.', 'Levesque said he talked to Owens and he doesn’t think Owens is the same Kevin Owens and he doesn’t want to put him in the ring with Orton. Levesque referenced how steel rods were just put into Orton’s back and he said he doesn’t want to see Orton go back on the shelf – perhaps permanently. Orton said none of that would happen and he didn’t ask “Paul Levesque” to come to the ring – instead, Orton wanted the Cerebral Assassin and The Game. Orton referenced how The Game used to beat the hell out of him, including in his front lawn. Orton asked Levesque what he would do if he was in Orton’s shoes. Orton said this was him talking man to man. Orton said Levesque knows what it’s like to have everything taken away from him and if Levesque was in Orton’s shoes, he would want to handle his business the only way he knows how – in the middle of the ring. Orton begged Levesque for the match against Owens.', 'Levesque said he hopes to God Orton knows what he’s asking for and noted how if Orton wants Owens at Crown Jewel, he’s got him. Levesque then left the ring after saying he hopes Orton protects himself at all times.', '**********', 'Andrade vs. Carmelo Hayes ended in a No Contest [9:45]', 'Lame. Lame on every level. Lame on every single solitary level. Even the live crowd agreed as the finish fell flat and Knight, who is typically super-over everywhere he goes, got little to no response as he spoke on the microphone. WWE stumbled into a great wrestling-focused program with Andrade and Melo and this is how they blow it off? Obviously, this won’t be the real blow off, but to tease a Game 7 like that and then do this? It’s a betrayal of trust to any fan who bought into the Melo/Andrade series organically based almost exclusively on the fact that they had good wrestling matches. You could see this coming. But it was still dumb.', 'Knight was wearing his vest, sunglasses and his U.S. title during the match. Andrade went for a quick pin after a back elbow and got a two-count out of it. Hayes rolled to the outside and Hayes threw Andrade into the barricade. Back in the ring, Andrade retook control with some chops and stomps. Knight was yelling at Andrade and Hayes took advantage of it until Andrade simply pushed Hayes over the top rope. Andrade ran for a splash, but Knight stopped him to start a count. As a result, Andrade flipped over Knight and landed on Melo as the show went to a commercial break.', 'The show returned and there was an inverted Spanish Fly off the second rope, but both guys sold the effects. Knight, at this point, had his belt and sunglasses off. Hayes and Andrade traded blows until Hayes planted Andrade with a tilt-a-whirl face-buster for a two-count. “This is awesome!” chants began from the crowd. Andrade set up for The Message, but it turned into a Destroyer from Andrade onto Hayes. Andrade hit a double-knees in a corner and got a two-count out of it. When Hayes kicked out, he threw Andrade onto Knight, which meant Knight wasn’t free to count a pin. Melo then accidentally super-kicked Knight. Andrade went for Three Amigos, but it turned into a Melo planting Andrade. Knight then threw Hayes into the commentary table and hit a BFT on Andrade. Knight did the same to Melo.', 'Knight walked to the outside and rang the bell and grabbed a microphone. Knight said “to hell with Game 7.” Knight said he was the United States Champion and he was the winner of Game 7. Knight’s music hit and Knight walked to the back and the match was off.', '**********', '– Nia Jax and Tiffany Stratton were talking backstage and Candice LaRae walked into the frame. LeRae said she’d take care of Jax’s Naomi problem and Stratton looked disgusted.', '– Knight was walking backstage and walked into GM Nick Aldis, who was angry and booked Knight, Melo and Andrade in a triple threat for the U.S. title at Crown Jewel.', 'Naomi defeated Candice LeRae [8:53]', 'I was kind of hoping LeRae would somehow get the win, but it was not to be. As such, does this mean LeRae’s momentum is halted after that win last week? I hope not. Time will tell. As for this match, it was fine. It started slow and was a little clunky to start, but the women worked hard and got to the next gear by the time the finish came around, so good for them. I’d just prefer a better way to get out of this match, but those decisions are not mine to make.', 'LeRae had control early until Naomi hit a kick to the head. LeRae came back with a cross-body and a couple pin attempts. Naomi earned the upper hand with a kick and a Bulldog into the turnbuckle. Naomi went to the top and LeRae caught Naomi, planting her on the apron. The show then went to a commercial break.', 'The show returned and Naomi had control until LeRae pulled Naomi down by her hair. LeRae worked a ground-and-pound. Naomi fought back and planted LeRae to even things out. Naomi then landed a series of dropkicks and a Bulldog. Naomi went for another Bulldog, but LeRae countered and Naomi went to the outside. Indi Hartwell ran Naomi into a ring post and rolled Naomi into the ring. Bayley’s music hit and Bayley took Hartwell out. This distracted LeRae and Naomi hit her finish on LeRae for the win.', '**********', '– Lin-Manuel Miranda was shown in the front row and he even gave the camera the Suck It sign. Cody’s music hit and at the 9 p.m. EST turn, we went to the Cody/Gunther segment.', 'The Cody/Gunther face-to-face', 'Undoubtedly the best segment of the night. This was great. Tell me where Gunther is telling lies and I’ll tell you that you’re wrong. He has such a way of keeping his badass-ness, taking pot shots and maintaining composure in such a unique way – a way that’s even kind of impossible in today’s world of smart wrestling fans. There is absolutely nothing anyone should ever change about that character. Cody, for his part, showed up, too, and this was a major improvement from last week. Good fire. Good verbal jabs. Good stuff all around.', 'As Cody was about to do the third (or fourth?) “Whoa!” inside the ring, Gunther’s music hit to ruin the fun, which was great. The crowd chanted “Cody!” Gunther asked Cody what he wanted to talk about, which was funny. Cody told Gunther he wanted to know why he wanted to be Crown Jewel Champion. Gunther said it was “totally unnecessary” to mention his daughter last week, so he clearly reads this website regularly. Gunther talked about how Cody finished his story and it was all for the legacy of Dusty Rhodes.', 'Gunther mocked Cody for asking for the “John Cena schedule,” just to live up to other standards. Gunther said Cody just loves the dramatics. Gunther said his only reason is himself and he is the greatest pro wrestler in the company and the crowd responded in kind. Gunther said he simply just wanted to live up to himself. Gunther asked Cody what the real reason was that he wanted the Crown Jewel Championship.', 'Cody responded by saying that was the dumbest question he’s ever been asked in a wrestling ring. Cody said none of it exists without all the fans. Cody then led the crowd in a “Whoa!” and he even counted it in. Cody said, “you bet your ass I’m dramatic,” and he said he was proud to be dramatic. He also celebrated the Cody Crybabies. Cody talked about he was making the media rounds and he realized that what Gunther was missing was the responsibility that came with being a champion. Gunther interrupted Cody and said he knows everything about responsibility. The crowd actually cheered.', 'Gunther told Cody he gets the same requests Cody does, but Gunther just tells them no because he has the guts to say no. Gunther said he has the guts to say no “to all of them,” referring to the fans, who booed. Gunther said the reason Cody doesn’t say no is because his “little story is over,” and that makes Cody a “gutless champion.” Gunther said the gutless champion will always be secondary to Gunther. Cody mocked Gunther for being a “ring general” and said he sees no general because he leads no one but himself.', 'Cody said his whole career has been built on guts and out of nowhere dropped down and hit Gunther with a punch. Ludwig Kaiser ran in and stopped Cody and as a result, Kaiser and Gunther attacked Cody. Gunther hit a lariat on Cody, but Randy Orton ran out and chased the heels out of the ring. The crowd chanted “Randy!” Cody’s music hit the end the segment.', '**********', '– A video recapping last week’s Bloodline developments aired.', '– A ton of women were arguing backstage. Adam Pearce, Ava and Aldis walked into the frame. Aldis said at Crown Jewel Bianca Belair & Jade Cargill will defend their tag titles against Damage CTRL, Piper Niven & Chelsea Green, and Jakara Jackson & Lash Legend in a Fatal Four-Way.', '– Next week, Liv Morgan and Nia Jax will go face-to-face. Also, Cody Rhodes & Randy Orton will go up against Gunther & Ludwig Kaiser. Plus, the Fatal Four-Way for the women’s tag titles will take place on SmackDown – and not Crown Jewel.', 'Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley & Chris Sabin) defeated #DIY (Johnny Gargano & Tommaso Ciampa) to become the No. 1 Contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship [11:17]', 'This was a very good match, if not a tiny bit predictable. Perhaps the most interesting development is the inevitable dissension between Gargano and Ciampa. In a weird way, I’m hoping they aren’t pulling the trigger on a breakup yet, but at the same time, we know they both probably work better as singles acts. Either way, the tag action was great here and this was a big step up from last week’s debut match from MCMG. And good on them for it. All four guys felt like they had something to prove and the result was a very good tag team wrestling match. The Bloodline vs. MCMG should be a lot of fun.', 'Gargano and Shelley started the match. The two traded pin attempts and things restarted. Ciampa tagged in and before long, Sabin came in to hit Ciampa with a series of rapid-fire double-team moves. Gargano tagged in and #DIY hit their own double-team moves on Sabin. Gargano kicked Sabin’s head for a two-count. Gargano chopped Sabin and tagged in Ciampa, but Sabin tagged in Shelley. Things broke down and Ciampa was recipient of a Meet In The Middle from MCMG. Gargano hit a spear on Sabin and Ciampa worked over Shelley on the outside. Gargano and Ciampa celebrated and the show went to a commercial break.', 'Back from the break and Sabin was battling both Gargano and Ciampa. Ultimately, Shelley tagged in and the two worked over #DIY, complete with a wild double-team move that involved all four wrestlers. Sabin tagged in and lifted Gargano, but Gargano rolled Sabin up before kicking Sabin in the ear. Ciampa tagged in and hit an assisted Fairytale Ending. Ciampa landed a running knee on Sabin for a good near-fall. Gargano tagged in and they set up for a Meet In The Middle, but that resulted in multiple failed pin attempts. Gargano then accidentally super-kicked Ciampa. Shelley tagged in and they hit Skull & Bones to win the match.', 'After the match, Gargano and Ciampa argued a little on the outside of the ring. The Bloodline’s music hit and Solo Sikoa walked out with his crew as MCMG stood in the ring. The Bloodline walked to the ring and the show went to a break.', '**********', '– The show returned and Nick Aldis was in the ring. Aldis said the tag match would not happen tonight and the crowd chanted “OTC!” Sikoa told Brooklyn to “shut your mouth.” Sikoa said he just wanted to come out and introduce themselves to the No. 1 Contenders. The crowd booed loudly. Sikoa then did his “acknowledge me!” bit to Brooklyn and got a lot of heat for it. Sikoa welcomed MCMG to SmackDown and told MCMG to acknowledge Sikoa as their Tribal Chief. Sabin introduced MCMG and said they’d wrestle any place, anytime. Sikoa said that was funny and if they wanted to make an “impact” – which was funny – they could have the match now.', 'Aldis chimed in and said MCMG has given everything to the business and he’d be damned if he’d standby and let … Shelley interrupted Aldis and said Aldis knows more than anyone else what they put into the industry. Shelley said if they want a match right now, they can have it. Aldis asked MCMG if that’s what they want, they said yes and a match was made.', 'Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley & Chris Sabin) defeated The Bloodline (Tama Tonga & Tonga Loa) to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. [7:27]', 'I love it. I don’t care that the Bloodline nonsense had to happen. I don’t care if it feels too soon. I don’t care if the title change is overshadowed. Sabin and Shelley deserve this and more and to see it happen in real time is almost surreal, especially if you’ve followed them all these years. Goodness, that was a lot of fun. This was a show that had a borderline terrible first hour and a borderline perfect second hour. Pro wrestling, man. There’s nothing like it.', 'The four guys brawled to begin the match, but Tonga and Loa dropkicked MCMG to take them down. The show went to its final commercial break. The show returned and Tonga was working over Shelley. Loa and Tonga went for a double splash, but Shelley moved and Jimmy Uso appeared to attack Sikoa and Fatu on the outside. Sikoa and Fatu quickly fought back and Roman Reigns’s music hit. Reigns then walked out and gave Fatu a Superman Punch. Reigns, Jimmy, Sikoa and Fatu fought to the back.', 'Sabin tagged in and Sabin worked over Tonga and hit a shotgun dropkick. The Bloodline fought back and moved the referee in the way of a splash. With the referees out, Tonga and Loa grabbed chairs. Another man in a hoodie appeared and it was Jey Uso. He took out Loga and threw him over the commentary table. Jey then hit Tonga with the chair and landed a spear on Tonga before revealing himself. MCMG set up their finisher, hit it and got the win.', 'After MCMG made it to the back, Jey was alone in the ring and Jimmy walked back out to the ring. Jimmy and Jey hugged hard in the middle of the ring. Roman stood in the entranceway and watched. Roman looked contemplative as the show went off the air.', '', '', 'EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO PODCASTS AND NEWSLETTERS', '© 2024 FIGURE FOUR WEEKLY. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.']"

This is the third episode of SmackDown during the four week build towards Crown Jewel, which takes place on Nov. 2.', 'Andrade and Carmelo Hayes have evenly split their previous six matches on SmackDown, but the series finally comes to an end tonight in Game 7. Whoever wins will earn another chance to lose against United States Champion LA Knight.', 'General Manager Nick Aldis decided to spice things up by making Knight the special referee for this match. The megastar said he’ll call things down the middle. I think the idea is that he won’t show favoritism since he’s already beaten both of these guys and likely doesn’t sweat either one.', 'But didn’t you know that most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions? LA has a short fuse, and all it might take is for Carmelo to shove Andrade into Knight, for example, to set him off. In other words, if Knight gets caught up in the physicality between Andrade and Carmelo, he may very well deliver a BFT to whichever wrestler he feels did him wrong.', 'Also, what’s the deal with these General Managers choosing inexperienced and potentially biased referees to call the most important match between two wrestlers? That kind of foolish decision-making is just begging for something to go very wrong and for there to be a controversial finish. Speaking of which, is it possible that Knight beats up both of these guys and there is no winner at all, setting up a future triple threat match for his belt?', 'Will Game 7 be won by Andrade or Carmelo Hayes? Tune into SmackDown to find out.', 'Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes has invited World Heavyweight Champion GUNTHER to come to SmackDown for a face-to-face confrontation. Will fists fly ahead of their match in Saudi Arabia, or will both men shake hands after realizing that they don’t actually want to win that hideous Crown Jewel Championship?', 'Motor City Machine Guns vs. DIY is booked for tonight, with the winner earning a future shot at The Bloodline’s WWE Tag Team Championship. There’s no way Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin are losing this match, right?', '- Last week, Roman Reigns told Jey Uso that he was proud of him for being the Intercontinental champion. Jey wasn’t interested in making up and he bounced, leaving Roman and Jimmy Uso to once again get beat up by Solo Sikoa’s Bloodline. Will Jey change his mind and now join Roman and Jimmy after Solo’s henchmen screwed him out of the Intercontinental title on Raw?', '- Kevin Owens is pissed off at WWE and doesn’t know if or when he’ll return to SmackDown. The big problem with KO’s approach is that Randy Orton wants to kick his ass at Crown Jewel. Nick Aldis said there’s nothing he can to do help Randy get what he wants, indicating that people above him in the decision-making process are handling this matter. Orton happens to have a long history with some of those people and said he knows who he needs to talk to. Will we see that conversation take place tonight?', '- Candice LeRae filled in for Tiffany Stratton last week and impressed WWE Women’s Champion Queen Nia Jax when she pinned Bayley in their tag team match. Will Jax look to keep LeRae around as an ally going forward?', '- Does YouTube douchebag Logan Paul have something better to do than return to WWE and collect the big Saudi payday for a match at Crown Jewel? As of right now it doesn’t look like Logan will be part of that event.', '- Has Chelsea Green gotten rid of that terrible odor from the Dumpster match yet?', '- Will Shinsuke Nakamura finally return to SmackDown tonight? If so, will he be a babyface or a heel?', '- Legado del Fantasma blew last week’s opportunity to chase the WWE Tag Team Championship. Does that mean Nick Aldis is putting them back on the sidelines?', '- Maybe Grayson Waller and Austin Theory aren’t breaking up, after all.', '- Giovanni Vinci is completely screwed being on this SmackDown roster, isn’t he?', '- Where the f*** is Baron Corbin?', 'What will you be looking for on SmackDown?', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Their crowning moment was coupled with the long-awaited reunion of Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso on WWE SmackDown."", ""The Bloodline had the deck stacked against the Machine Guns on Friday night. Unfortunately for The Bloodline, karma threw a wrench in Solo Sikoa's plan. A vengeful Jey Uso was the difference maker in an impromptu WWE tag team title match that saw Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa lose the belts."", 'SmackDown set the stage for three new matches at Crown Jewel, including Randy Orton vs. Kevin Owens.', 'CBS Sports was with you all night with recaps and highlights of all the action from Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Motor City Machine Guns (Shelley and Sabin) def. #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa) via pinfall to become the No. 1 contenders for the WWE tag team championships.

MCMG capitalized with a neck breaker, top rope splash combo to secure the win.', ""The Bloodline appeared post-match to size up their challengers. SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis interfered before things escalated. Sikoa promised there would be no hostilities. Sikoa, speaking over a chorus of boos, welcomed the Machine Guns to SmackDown. Sikoa introduced The Bloodline and himself as their Tribal Chief. Sabin introduced MCMG as the top contenders for the tag team titles, saying they'd challenge The Bloodline anytime and anyplace. Sikoa took them up on the offer by suggesting they have their tag title match tonight. Aldis interjected, refusing to let decorated veterans like MCMG have their first WWE tag team title match at less than 100%. Shelley stopped Aldis.

Reigns and Uso took the brawl with Sikoa and Fatu backstage as the tag title match took back center stage. Tonga pulled the referee in, sandwiching the official between Tonga and Sabin. The Bloodline took advantage of the referee\'s absence by introducing steel chairs. Tonga and Loa were foiled by another masked assailant. A disguised Jey took out Tonga and Loa, avenging his intercontinental loss to Bron Breakker on Monday due to The Bloodline\'s interference. Sabin and Shelley hit the neck breaker-top rope splash combo to win the titles. ', 'Post-match, the crowd erupted as Jey and Jimmy embraced. Reigns watched from the stage as the twin brothers hugged it out.', 'What a way to send the crowd home happy. The Motor City Machine Guns have been an influential, elite tag team for nearly 20 years. Seeing them rewarded with a WWE tag team title run in their 40s is heart-warming. It was almost as heartwarming as seeing Jey and Jimmy reunite after 14 months apart. The Bloodline got their comeuppance for messing with Jey, and the sides are just about even in The Bloodline vs. Bloodline storyline. A fantastic episode of pro wrestling television.
