The organization both praised Trump for his supposed “peace-focused” approach to ending the war in Gaza and condemned Harris for helping facilitate a so-called “genocide.”', '“After meeting with President Trump, it was clear to me he is the right leader for Muslims to get behind,” Rabiul Chowdhury, co-founder of Muslims for Trump and former co-chair of the “Abandon Harris Movement,” said in a statement.', 'Chowdhury added that during his discussions with Trump, the former president vowed to “ending the escalation of wars and bringing peace to war-torn regions.” In contrast to Trump’s promise to stop the “bloodshed” in Gaza, he claimed, Harris has “recklessly pushed us toward World War III.”', 'Chowdhury, a self-described “peace advocate,” urged the Muslim community not to fall victim to supposed “misinformation” campaigns by the media and Democrats that paint the former president as hostile to immigrants. He claimed that the former president’s focus is on “ending war, not dividing families through false immigration claims.”', 'Samra Luqman, chair of the Michigan chapter of Muslims for Trump, underscored the need to punish the Biden administration for what he described as supporting a “genocide” in Gaza. ', '“The goal of this election is to hold the Biden administration accountable for a genocide. No amount of fear mongering or scare tactics will persuade my community into forgiving the mutilation, live-burning, and genocide of over 200,000 people,” he said.', 'According to data produced by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, roughly 40,000 people have died in Gaza since the war began last October. Israel has said that its forces have killed about 20,000 Hamas terrorists during its military campaign.', 'Israel says it has gone to unprecedented lengths to try and avoid civilian casualties, noting its efforts to evacuate areas before it targets them and to warn residents of impending military operations with leaflets, text messages, and other forms of communication.', 'On the organization Muslims for Trump’s official website, it claims that the Abraham Accords, a series of historic, Trump administration-brokered normalization agreements between Israel and several countries in the Arab world, helped stabilize the Middle East. It also says that had Trump not lost the 2020 presidential race, the so-called “genocide” could have been prevented.', '“Under Trump’s leadership, the Abraham Accords were brokered, fostering peaceful relations between Israel and several Arab countries. Supporters might argue that Trump’s diplomacy prioritized peace and stability in the Middle East, reducing the likelihood of large-scale conflicts like genocide,” the group wrote. ', 'Over the course of his campaign, Trump has repeatedly touted his support for the Jewish state during his singular term in office. Trump has boasted about his administration’s work in fostering the Abraham Accords, promising to resume efforts to strengthen them if he were to win November’s US presidential election. ', 'Harsh US sanctions levied on Iran under Trump crippled the Iranian economy and led its foreign exchange reserves to plummet. Trump and his Republican supporters in the US Congress have criticized the Biden administration for renewing billions of dollars in US sanctions waivers, which had the effect of unlocking frozen funds and allowing the country to access previously inaccessible hard currency.', 'Trump also recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic region on Israel’s northern border previously controlled by Syria, and also moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing the city as the Jewish state’s capital.', 'Despite Harris’s repeated efforts to woo Muslim voters, polling data indicates that the demographic has made a dramatic swing away from the Democratic Party. Polling data from the Arab American Institute reveals that Trump slightly edges Harris among Muslim voters by a margin of 42 to 41 percent.

He was joined onstage by what his campaign described as “prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community,” including Imam Belal Alzuhairi, who described Trump as the “peace” candidate.', '“We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace – he promises peace, not war,” Alzuhairi said. “We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine.”', 'Trump has criticized Israel’s war in Gaza on public relations grounds, saying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his military need to “get it over with fast.” He has also slammed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for not adequately supporting Israel, though the current administration – and Harris’ campaign – has largely refused to criticize Israel or consider halting weapons shipments to the country.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nWith worst-case scenario averted for now, White House and Harris campaign still face a serious risk in Middle East conflict', 'In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on the first anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks inside Israel, Trump mused about real estate prospects in beleaguered Gaza, home to roughly 2 million Palestinians.', '“You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place – the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,” Trump said. “It could be so beautiful.”', 'During his first month as president, in 2017, Trump issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and blocked all refugees from entering the US for four months. (After a lengthy court battle, the “travel ban” survived in part. Biden revoked the orders in 2021 immediately after being sworn in.)', 'The Trump campaign and its allies, though, have sought to seize on Arab American and Muslim anger over continued US support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and, more recently, Lebanon, by criticizing Harris and Biden from both sides – telling anti-war voters that Trump would secure peace and claiming to pro-Israel voters that the Democrats don’t have their back.', 'Trump has frequently questioned why Jewish Americans would consider voting for Harris, repeatedly saying that Jewish Democrats “should have their head examined.” At an event in September billed as opposing antisemitism, he even warned that “the Jewish people would have a lot to do” with his potential loss in November.', 'Harris, who has called for a ceasefire in Gaza and has said she supports a two-state solution in the region, has taken more heat from pro-Palestinian and anti-war activists, who have pleaded with her to break from Biden and say she supports conditioning military aid to Israel.', 'During a brief meeting three weeks ago in Flint, Michigan, a group of Arab American advocates and leaders pressed Harris “to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don’t agree with,” as Wa’el Alzayat, the CEO of Muslim American advocacy group Emgage Action, told CNN afterward.', 'Trump at his rally on Saturday claimed that “Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, Mormons, Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before and now the most wonderful thing is happening.”', '“The Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East.

Trump Touts Endorsement from ‘Great’ Anti-Israel Mayor,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-touts-endorsement-from-great-anti-israel-mayor/,"['National Review', 'The Downside of the ‘Vibe Shift’', 'The Washington Post Declines to Endorse for President, and Civilization Melts', 'Judge Orders Virginia to Restore Aliens to Voter Rolls', 'Electric Vehicles: Another Volt Farce', 'Donald Trump to Bring Back Tallow Fries (Maybe)', '“I think the mayor is great, and he’s given us his total endorsement,” Donald Trump said this week of Amer Ghalib, an Arab American who was elected America’s first Muslim mayor in Hamtramck, Mich., in 2021. “He’s somebody [who has] got a lot of future in this country.”', '“He’s not for men playing in women’s sports. He’s not for transgender operations — the transformation, or the transition into, you know, a male into a female. He’s not into that,” Trump continued. “I think for the most part, the Arab world isn’t into that, and I’m not into that either. But the radical left is totally into it.”', 'Trump’s promising mayor is staunchly anti-Israel. Ghalib’s city council voted unanimously in May to approve a resolution divesting from “Israeli apartheid,” a measure Ghalib said meant, “For now, the city will do its best to refrain from buying, investing or contracting with companies that support the Israeli genocide.” Hamtramck’s all-male and all-Muslim city council was one of the few in America to pass a divestment proposal. Ghalib said after the vote to divest that Palestine is “fighting for a good cause. Some people call them ‘terrorists,’ which doesn’t make no sense.” The only “ethical exit” for Israel “is to declare defeat and give it up and accept the exchange of prisoners and leave the people to live in their land,” Ghalib said in June, according to local media.', 'In September, Ghalib met with Trump before a town hall in Warren, Mich. He posted to Facebook a photo of himself with Trump, and said in the caption that “before taking this picture, [Trump] said: let me take a good picture with the greatest mayor in the whole world.”', 'Ghalib has accused President Joe Biden of perpetuating claims that Palestinian terrorists beheaded babies and raped Israeli women — claims Ghalib denies. “You fueled . . . Islamophobia by spreading false information and lies (e.g. beheaded babies and raped women),” Ghalib said. “You make us feel unsafe by trying to justify your support for the criminal and unethical attack on the civilians of Gaza using lies and made up stories. Be a man and apologize for your moral and historic downfall, otherwise the blood of thousands of children and innocent people will be a curse that will follow you to your grave.” Multiple autopsy reports, survivor testimonies, and photographic evidence prove that Hamas terrorists did behead, rape, assault, and maim Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023.', 'The mayor also pressed the city council to push a resolution renaming a town street to “Palestine Avenue,” as a “gesture of solidarity.” City councillors were deadlocked over the resolution, which Ghalib cast the tie-breaking vote to pass. Also, when city council candidate Nasr Hussain posted a disturbing message on Facebook — “Was the Holocaust God’s advance punishment of the ‘Chosen People’ for the savagery they’re committing today against the innocent Palestinians children and civilians? A heinous act proving that they’re as savage and cruel as the Nazis themselves, or even worse.” — Ghalib would not condemn the statement. “You can ask Nasr about that,” Ghalib said instead. “What do I have to do with his posts! I don’t have to comment on every resident’s opinion, otherwise I would have commented on some posts that insult Islam and other religions, which are posted frequently by some residents on that same Facebook group.”', 'Few women are involved in local Hamtramck politics. On his election night, the BBC reported:', 'Mr Ghalib, the mayor-elect, was surrounded by a jubilant Yemeni-American crowd in a post-election party serving baklava and kebabs. More than 100 supporters were there, all of them men.', 'Women participated in his campaign, Mr Ghalib said, but segregation of the sexes remains traditional, even as it is being challenged by younger generations who have become more “Americanised”, he said.', 'Some Muslim communities in Michigan have turned their backs on the Democratic ticket, because, they say, Biden has been too supportive of Israel. Trump, though, is a “man of principles” who doesn’t want war, Ghalib said — a compliment Trump is eager to tout.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2024 National Review', 'Newsletters', '']"

Ghalib, who is from Yemen, became the first Arab American and first Muslim to govern the city. And he was working with what was believed to be the first all-Muslim City Council in the country.', 'Two years later, Ghalib created another stir when he and other socially conservative Muslims banned the LGBTQ+ Pride flag from publicly owned flagpoles, alarming liberals who said the move was discriminatory and harmful to the city’s welcoming reputation.', 'Their fears only heightened last month, after Ghalib endorsed Donald Trump, who as president had ushered in what is known as the Muslim ban, blocking immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations, including Ghalib’s home country. Adding to the tensions was a visit by Trump, who hoped the mayor’s support could peel off a meaningful number of Muslim voters in Michigan, a swing state.', 'Explaining his support, Ghalib pointed to a distaste for liberal social views, anger at President Joe Biden’s support of Israel and a belief that Trump will end the conflict in the Middle East.', 'In Hamtramck (pronounced “ham-tram-ick”), many longtime liberal residents, including members of the LGBTQ+ community, say they were dejected.', 'Over the years, they had actively encouraged the city of 30,000 residents, just north of downtown Detroit, to welcome immigrants. When Muslims won a majority of seats in the six-member City Council in 2015, they cheered the change as a rebuke to the anti-immigrant rhetoric used by Trump.', 'They had not expected this outcome.', 'In this election year, when immigration has been debated, distorted and vilified, Hamtramck offers an example of how the issue can cut in politically complex and surprising ways. The city’s longtime residents, committed to diversity and liberal values, celebrated the newcomers. But Ghalib, along with some other immigrants, brought to Hamtramck their own principles, priorities and ambitions.', 'Ghalib, in particular, found more in common with MAGA Republicans, who actively courted him, than with Democrats.', '“Languages and cultural distinctions create their own barriers,” said Saeed Khan, a professor of Near East and Asian studies at Wayne State University in Detroit.', '“In Hamtramck, you have people from Bangladesh who have a particular cultural perspective, as do the Yemenis, as do the Bosnians,” he said. “And because their experiences as immigrant communities differ so widely, that plays out on the streets when it comes to civic and political engagement.”', 'On the surface, Hamtramck’s infighting is hard to see.', 'It is a humble place. Working class. In every neighborhood within the city’s 2 square miles, people of all backgrounds live side by side, their narrow homes packed tightly together like well-worn novels on a bookshelf.', 'The Muslim call to prayer mixes easily in the air with church bells. Women in hijabs buy potato pancakes at a Polish restaurant, and tattooed hipsters eat murtabak — bread stuffed with beef, tomatoes and onions — at a Yemeni cafe.', 'Karen Majewski, the former mayor, is partly responsible for the city’s vibe.', 'In 2004, she was sworn into the City Council as part of a liberal movement wresting government control from a long-established, Polish American power base that was solidly Democratic, but also more socially conservative. Elected mayor in 2005, she maintained control for 16 years and was the last of a continuous, century-old line of ethnic Poles to hold the office.', 'In an interview at her home, Majewski recalled how white progressives in Hamtramck welcomed Arabs and Muslims with open arms. Today, the city swells with Muslims from Yemen, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Albania. About a quarter of residents have roots in Yemen. Nearly another quarter are from Bangladesh.', '“This was part of Hamtramck’s identity,” she said. “We’ve always prided ourselves on immigration as a source of our identity and distinctness, on being a place that welcomed people from all over the world.”', 'In the early 2000s, Majewski was a member of the City Hall leadership that codified the right of mosques to broadcast the call to prayer outdoors, for all to hear.', 'After Trump won the 2016 presidential election with a promise to get tough on immigration, Majewski, as mayor, posted a message underscoring that Hamtramck would remain a safe place for everyone. “And most specifically,” Majewski recalled, “the Muslim community.”', 'When Trump announced the Muslim ban in 2017, liberals in Hamtramck were part of local protests.', 'How do she and her friends feel now that their Yemeni-born mayor has gotten behind the former president?', '“Disillusioned, pissed off,” Majewski said. “There’s a lot of outrage and a lot of disgust.”', 'Later, she noted that liberals have largely stopped going to City Council meetings because their voices were not being adequately heard. “The feeling is pretty much, why bother?” she said.', 'For his part, Ghalib, 44, said he hoped his endorsement, and Trump’s visit, would “help the Muslim community come together and stop negative rhetoric toward Republicans.”', 'But shortly after the mayor’s endorsement, Mohammed Hassan, a City Council member and a leader within the city’s Bangladeshi Muslim community, publicly backed Vice President Kamala Harris.', 'Hassan rallied two others from the City Council to the cause. He also held a Harris rally, filling a local restaurant with dozens of Muslim voters.', 'Hassan noted that he works with the mayor on many issues. But not this time. He vowed to energize most Bengalis to vote for Harris, while picking off votes from the mayor’s base. “One-third of Yemenis listen to me all the time,” Hassan said.', 'Democratic policies, he said, help the poor and middle class, while Trump scapegoats immigrants. Hassan also believes Harris would better handle negotiations over the war in the Middle East, partly because of her composure: “She is not crazy like him,” he said.', 'Ghalib has been the center of controversy before, mainly over social media posts that he now disavows or says were taken out of context by liberals.', 'He told The New York Times that he began turning toward Republicans when, as mayor, he faced bitter division in his city over social issues, mainly over LGBTQ+ rights.', 'He noted that in 2022, he stood behind conservative Muslim parents who complained about LGBTQ+ books in school libraries. The books, he said, were part of the “gay agenda.”', 'The Pride flag, Ghalib said, needed to be taken down in the name of neutrality, so the city could avoid being forced to fly banners from hate groups.', 'Majewski, the former mayor, called its removal “completely about bigotry.”', 'Republicans seized on the infighting by reaching out to Ghalib.', 'In July 2023, Ghalib appeared on a podcast hosted by Tudor Dixon, an evangelical conservative Republican who had recently lost the Michigan governor’s race to Gretchen Whitmer. On the podcast, Ghalib complained about aggressive behavior and abusive attacks from liberal opposition. He sent a warning: If you “discontinue supporting me, why do you think I’ll continue to support you?”', 'Then Ghalib led a meeting with Muslim leaders and Gen. Michael Flynn, a conservative firebrand and conspiracy theorist who briefly served as national security adviser during the Trump presidency. Flynn, who had previously called Islam “a cancer,” now spoke of forming a conservative coalition between Christians and Muslims.', 'Soon, emissaries for Trump were reaching out to the mayor. Eventually, Ghalib said, the two had a private conversation at a Trump rally.', 'Ghalib told the Times that he and other Muslim Americans feel dismissed and overlooked by Democrats. He cited the Biden administration’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas, and noted that more than 100,000 people protested by voting uncommitted in Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary. But, he said, “nothing changed” in terms of Biden’s policies.', 'Ghalib, smiling proudly, said Trump showed him respect.', 'Trump has denigrated Palestinians, called Middle Eastern immigrants “known terrorists” and encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to “finish the job” in the Gaza Strip.', 'None of that swayed Ghalib’s confidence in the former president. “He kept repeating to me that his goal is to end the chaos in the Middle East,” the mayor said.', 'Though he does not agree with Trump on everything, Ghalib called him a “decisive and family-oriented person” who is “very principled.”', 'Reminded of Trump’s frequent spreading of disinformation, as well as his conviction for covering up an affair with a porn actor, Ghalib said such matters were in “the media,” but “who knows?”', '“I hope he will not disappoint me,” Ghalib said. “We’ll see.”', 'This article originally appeared in The New York Times.', 'Local journalism is essential.', ""Give directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.
