In another update today, the ministry reported no new cases or deaths. Two people are in treatment, and 46 people have recovered from their infections.', ""Regarding Rwanda's latest two cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an outbreak update today that one of the cases involves a healthcare worker who had been caring for Marburg patients, and the other is linked to a site where the index patient was exposed."", 'At a weekly press briefing yesterday hosted by Africa Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (Africa CDC), Rwanda Minister of Health Sabin Nsanzimana, MD, PhD, said the index patient is thought to have contracted the virus in a cave where fruit bats, known to carry the virus, were living. He added that the cave is located in a mining area and that a current focus is making sure fruit bats are not interacting with humans.', ""The WHO said the index patient is a man between the ages of 20 and 30. The agency said it doesn't yet know the date of symptom onset. The incubation period for Marburg infection can range from 2 to 21 days, with symptoms such as high fever, headache, and severe malaise that can appear abruptly.

It said the South and West are now in the low category.', 'In updated variant proportion estimates today, the CDC said KP.3.1.1 is still dominant, making up 57% of viruses, similar to last week. However, levels of XEC—a recombinant of two JN.1 viruses—continue to rise steadily and are estimated to make up 17% of viruses, up from 10% 2 weeks ago. XEC has mutations that are thought to increase infectivity and evade immune response. The CDC said that, because the variant stems from JN.1 viruses, vaccines will likely provide protection because they include a JN.1 strain.', 'In its weekly respiratory virus overview, the CDC said it expects to see a winter COVID peak higher than the summer peak, similar to COVID trends over the past 4 years.', 'Flu activity, meanwhile, is minimal, the CDC said. And respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity remains low nationally, but there are signs of increased activity in the southeast, especially in young children.', 'A study by an international team of researchers suggests that widespread use of an antibiotic to prevent liver disease is causing cross-resistance to a last-resort antibiotic for treating vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). The findings were published this week in the journal Nature.', 'To understand the mechanisms behind increasing reports of daptomycin resistance in VRE, which is a multidrug-resistant pathogen and leading cause of hospital-related infections, a team led by researchers at the University of Melbourne conducted a combined genomic and phenotypic analysis of 998 VRE isolates collected in Australia from 2015 through 2018, 19.4% of which were daptomycin-resistant. ', ""The analysis revealed that daptomycin resistance in VRE is caused by an amino-acid substitution (rpoB) within the bacterial RNA of VRE that's associated with the use of rifaximin, an antibiotic predominantly prescribed to prevent recurrent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis, who are frequently colonized with VRE."", 'Further analysis showed that the emergence of the rpoB mutations coincided with the first clinical use of rifaximin in 2006, that patients with recent exposure to rifaximin were more than eight times more likely to be colonized with VRE with rpoB mutations, and that VRE isolates with rpoB mutations have spread globally. In addition, animal experiments showed that administering rifaximin to VRE-colonized mice led to the emergence of daptomycin-resistant VRE strains within the gastrointestinal tract.', '""We’ve shown that rifaximin makes VRE resistant to daptomycin in a way that has not been seen before,"" senior author Glen Carter, PhD, of the University of Melbourne, said in a university press release. ""It is also of concern that these daptomycin-resistant VRE might be transmitted to other patients in the hospital; a hypothesis that we are presently investigating.""', 'Carter and his colleagues say the findings are surprising, since rifaximin was previously thought to be a low risk for resistance. They suggest daptomycin should be avoided for empiric therapy of VRE in patients receiving or recently treated with rifaximin, due to the higher risk of daptomycin resistance, and that rifaximin should remain a second-line option for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis.', 'We’ve shown that rifaximin makes VRE resistant to daptomycin in a way that has not been seen before.', 'A white-tailed deer in Kalispell, Montana, has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), the first detection of the fatal disease in a wild herd in Hunting District (HD) 170 in the Flathead Valley, Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) reported yesterday.', 'FWP said wildlife biologists euthanized a buck with CWD symptoms at the Flathead County Landfill after receiving reports on the animal.

While sporadic outbreaks have occurred in various parts of Africa since the first recognized cases in Germany in 1967, this outbreak is so far the third largest outbreak of MVD ever recorded. The Government of Rwanda has implemented public health measures to respond to the ongoing outbreak, including the detection, investigation, isolation and testing of all suspected cases. The Government has also conducted extensive contact tracing to limit the outbreak to the existing chains of transmission. All confirmed cases are isolated and treated at a designated Marburg treatment centre. Since the outbreak declaration, all new confirmed cases have been reported within the hospital clusters in Kigali.

Both cases are currently in isolation and receiving treatment. As of 24 October 2024, a total of 64 confirmed cases, including 15 deaths (CFR: 23.4%), have been reported. Excluding the recently confirmed cases, 70% of the 62 initially confirmed cases were among males, and 48% were among adults between 30 and 39 years of age. Health workers from two health facilities in Kigali account for over 82% of confirmed cases.

Marburg and Ebola viruses are both members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People are infected with Marburg virus when they come into close contact with Rousettus bats, a type of fruit bat, that can carry the Marburg virus and are often found in mines or caves. Marburg virus then spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health workers have previously been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.', 'The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptoms onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.', 'Seventeen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most recent outbreaks were reported in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania between February and June 2023. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda.', 'Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) that causes Ebola virus disease. MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high CFR (24-88%). In the early course of the disease, MVD is challenging to distinguish from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis.', 'With 64 confirmed cases reported, this is the third largest MVD outbreak reported to date, with 82% of confirmed cases reported among healthcare workers. Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and listing and daily follow-up of all contacts.  ', 'Based on the outbreak investigation which included record review in health facilities, review of epidemiological data, serology and genomic sequencing, as well as environmental and animal testing, the source of the outbreak is reported to be of zoonotic origin, linked to exposure in a cave inhabited by fruit bats. However, the dates of symptom onset of cases is still unknown to WHO.', 'On 30 September, WHO assessed the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level. However, based on the evolution of the outbreak and ongoing investigations, this risk assessment may be revised. MVD is not easily transmissible (i.e. in most instances it requires contact with the body fluids of a sick patient presenting with symptoms or with surfaces contaminated with these fluids). In addition, there are ongoing public health measures in place, including active surveillance in facilities and communities, testing suspected cases, isolation and treatment of cases and contact tracing.', 'MVD outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, including prompt isolation and case management; surveillance including active case search, case investigation and contact tracing; a laboratory service; infection prevention and control, including prompt safe and dignified burial; and social mobilization – community engagement is key to successfully controlling MVD outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Marburg virus infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission in healthcare facilities and in communities:', 'Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel restrictions or any trade restrictions with Rwanda.

Other evidence suggests that the first person to become infected in the outbreak probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave that hosts a species of bat known to harbour the virus.', 'Multiple introductions from animals to humans would have raised fears that the virus is more widespread in Rwanda than was previously thought. Multiple introductions could also have raised the prospect of new outbreaks, as could an unknown provenance for the virus.', '', 'Deadly Marburg virus: scientists race to test vaccines in outbreak', '', 'Rwanda’s response to the virus has also kept the outbreak from being even worse, researchers say. Scientists praise the country’s efforts to control the outbreak, investigate its origins and share data with the scientific community. “As soon as they realized it was a problem, they started contact tracing, conducted a thorough epidemiological investigation, identified the [first] patient and potentially the source of the infection — and managed to roll out an experimental vaccine trial within a week,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. This shows that, with the Marburg virus disease, “a rapid urgent response can mitigate severity of the outbreak”, she adds.', 'The findings, which have not yet been published in full or peer reviewed, were posted on the social-media platform X and discussed at a media briefing on 20 October.', 'The outbreak, which was declared on 27 September, is Rwanda’s first; Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea recorded their first Marburg outbreaks last year, and Ghana’s first was in 2022. Outbreaks of Marburg — which causes high fever, severe diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding from the nose or gums — now occur about once a year. Before the 2020s, they were detected at most a few times each decade.', 'Since the outbreak began, reports of new infections have dropped off notably. Rwandan health officials have recorded one new case and no deaths in the past 10 days, and only two people remain in isolation and treatment. A Marburg outbreak can be declared over when no new cases have been reported for 42 consecutive days.', '', 'Lethal Marburg virus is on the rise in Rwanda: why scientists are worried', '', 'There is no proven vaccine or treatment for infections with the virus, which is closely related to Ebola virus, both in its symptoms and in its transmission, which is primarily through contact with bodily fluids. Health officials are offering a candidate vaccine, made by the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington DC, to the contacts of infected individuals. More than 1,200 doses have been administered so far.', 'This outbreak has one of the lowest fatality rates — about 24% — on record for Marburg; previous outbreaks reported fatality rates as high as 90%. This is probably a result of there being quick diagnoses, access to medical care and that most infections are in relatively young health-care workers.', 'In fact, two people who were infected with the virus and put on life support were successfully intubated and later extubated as they recovered. This marks the first time that people with Marburg virus disease have been extubated in Africa, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, said at a briefing on 20 October. “These patients would have died in previous outbreaks,” he said.', 'To help inform outbreak control, researchers at the Rwanda Biomedical Centre in Kigali sequenced the Marburg virus genome of several infected people. They found that all samples closely resembled one another, suggesting that the virus spread rapidly in a short period of time and that they shared a common origin. They also found that the virus strain is closely related to one detected in Uganda in 2014 and to one found in bats in 2009, Yvan Butera, Rwanda’s minister of state for health, who co-led the research, tells Nature.', '', 'COVID spurs boom in genome sequencing for infectious diseases', '', 'Comparison of the 2014 strain with the one causing the current outbreak shows a “limited mutation rate”, Butera says, suggesting that there have probably been few changes to the virus’s transmissibility or lethality over the past decade. Generally, viruses collect mutations as they replicate over time; if it is true that the mutation rate is low, Rasmussen wonders how the virus lingers in its animal reservoir — the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) — without major changes.', 'Researchers say that environmental threats, such as climate change and deforestation, have made people more likely to encounter animals that can pass on infections. More data on how the virus persists in bats — and in which tissues it does — could help to inform surveillance efforts, which would give health officials a better picture of virus hotspots, Rasmussen adds.', 'Butera says that the genomic analyses are being finalized; he and his colleagues hope to share the full data by the end of the week, he says.', 'doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03457-4', 'Reprints and permissions', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Dairy cows inoculated with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1', 'ARTICLE 15 OCT 24', 'AI scans RNA ‘dark matter’ and uncovers 70,000 new viruses', 'NEWS 11 OCT 24', 'Why hasn’t deadly bird flu reached Australia yet?', 'NEWS 04 OCT 24', 'The Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine (http://mgm.unm.edu/index.html) is seeking...', 'University of New Mexico, Albuquerque', 'UNM - HSC', 'Join the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Illinois College of Medicine Peoria as a full-time Neonatologist.', 'Peoria, Illinois', 'University of Illinois College of Medicine Peoria', 'The Department of Physics (www.phys.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich invites applications for the above-mentioned position.', 'Zurich city', 'ETH Zurich', 'Job Title: Associate or Senior Editor, Nature Communications (Structural Biology, Biochemistry, or Biophysics) Locations: New York, Philadelphia, S...', 'New York City, New York (US)', 'Springer Nature Ltd', 'The Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) at the University of Chicago invites applications for multiple faculty positions (open rank) in ...', 'Chicago, Illinois', 'University of Chicago, Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering', '', 'Climate change will force new animal encounters — and boost viral outbreaks', 'Why do bat viruses keep infecting people?', 'Could Africa be the future for genomics research?', 'Marburg virus outbreak: researchers race to test vaccines', 'An essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.', '', 'Nature (Nature) ISSN 1476-4687 (online) ISSN 0028-0836 (print)', '© 2024 Springer Nature Limited']"

Beginning in late September, 62 cases and 15 deaths had been reported by 17 October, mostly among healthcare workers in Kigali, the capital city.', 'More than 800 contacts of infected people have been followed up in an effort to catch infections early and prevent further transmission, two of whom travelled to Belgium and Germany but were given the all-clear. As of October 21, no new cases or deaths had been reported in six days, but the threat of the outbreak hasn’t gone away.', '', 'Read more', 'The 5 best things you can do to boost the chance of a vaccine working', '', 'Advertisement', 'Marburg virus is from the same family of viruses as those that cause Ebola, which are “among the most lethal pathogens known to infect humans”, according to a perspective article in The New England Journal of Medicine.', 'They can cause similar symptoms, such as fever, chills and headache, as well as muscle aches and pains. Within a few days, people may develop a rash on their chest, back and abdomen. They may also experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.', 'Marburg virus damages blood vessels and disrupts clotting, which can lead to blood in vomit and faeces, as well as bleeding from the nose and gums. In extreme cases, the infection causes internal bleeding and sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.', 'Get the most essential health and fitness news in your inbox every Saturday.', 'The virus was first identified in 1967, after one-off outbreaks in the German cities of Marburg and Frankfurt, and in Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. These cases were linked to lab experiments to improve polio vaccines that involved African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) from Uganda.', 'Since then, the virus has typically caused a few outbreaks per decade, often in East African countries such as Uganda, as well as its neighbour the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is in Central Africa.', 'The virus was identified in Guinea, in West Africa, in 2021. Outbreaks have since occurred annually in different parts of the continent. For example, Ghana had its first outbreak in 2022 and Equatorial Guinea had its first cases last year. The Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) lives in different parts of Africa and can carry Marburg virus, says Emma Thomson at the University of Glasgow, UK.', 'Exactly why outbreaks seem to be occurring more frequently is unclear. It could be down to improved case surveillance and people coming into contact more regularly with Egyptian fruit bats, says Thomson. Miles Carroll at the University of Oxford thinks the same.', 'People can catch Marburg virus if they visit caves or work in mines where the bats live. This may be happening more, but increased deforestation is also bringing people closer to these animals, says Carroll.', 'Marburg virus’ fatality rate has varied hugely from 24 per cent to 88 per cent in past outbreaks, similar to the 25 per cent to 90 per cent fatality rate seen with Ebola.', 'The range in mortality rates is probably due to differences in the capacity of countries to detect cases and the resources of their hospitals, say Thomson.', 'On 20 October, the World Health Organization’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus released a statement saying that the agency is impressed with the level of critical care people have been receiving in Rwanda. He referred to two people with multiple organ failure who were on life support and had received mechanical ventilation. “We believe this is the first time patients with Marburg virus have been extubated in Africa,” he said. “These patients would have died in previous outbreaks.”', 'Rwanda’s ongoing outbreak is the third largest so far, for both cases and deaths. It comes behind the DRC’s outbreak in 1998 to 2000, when 154 cases were recorded and 128 people died, and Angola’s outbreak from 2004 to 2005, when 252 people were infected and 227 died.', 'There have been relatively few known cases since Marburg virus was identified, which makes it difficult to know who is most at risk of severe infection, says Thomson. But those with suppressed immune systems, such as people who are older or pregnant, are probably more vulnerable, she says.', 'Few cases have ever been reported during pregnancy, but the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says the infection is generally more severe during pregnancy, when immune function is altered anyway.', 'Ebola is also more severe among older people, so the same is probably true for Marburg virus, says Thomson.', 'Genetic sequencing of cases in Rwanda has revealed that the virus jumped from an animal, like an Egyptian fruit bat or an African green monkey, to a person just once in the ongoing outbreak, the country’s health minister tweeted on 20 October.', 'The remaining transmission therefore happened between people. This can occur if viral particles in someone’s blood or other bodily fluid enters another person’s body through broken skin or via their eyes, nose or mouth. Burial ceremonies where people touch the deceased body of an infected person also raise the risk of transmission.', '', 'Read more', 'How to tell if your immune system is weak or strong', '', 'There is no evidence that Marburg virus spreads through droplets that are expelled when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes, says Carroll.', 'No drugs have been approved to specifically treat Marburg virus. People who require hospital care are usually given intravenous fluids to replace the water they lost through vomiting and diarrhoea. Painkillers can also help ease discomfort.', 'In 2021, researchers found that combining the antiviral drug remdesivir with antibodies against the virus protected four out of five rhesus monkeys from lethal doses of the infection. On 15 October, Rwanda started trialling the approach in people.', 'There is no approved vaccine against Marburg virus, but researchers are trialling an experimental one in Rwanda, where 1700 doses had been delivered and 669 doses administered as of 14 October.', 'This vaccine’s regimen consists of a single shot that contains the engineered genetic sequence of an adenovirus, which cause cold-like symptoms. Researchers have tweaked the adenovirus to contain a protein that Marburg virus uses to infect cells. Once injected, the adenovirus enters cells and produces copies of the virus protein, so the immune system can learn to recognise it.', 'Vaccinating the contacts of infected people would probably be the most efficient use of vaccine doses to slow the virus’s spread, says Thomson.', 'Rwanda has ramped up testing among the contacts of infected people, who are being quarantined, but there is still always the potential for the virus to spread, says Carroll.', '', 'A new understanding of how your blood type influences your health', 'We now know that there are at least 45 different blood types and that yours may influence your risk of disease, from malaria to cancer', '', '“The possibility of local spread within the region to neighbouring countries is currently very concerning,” says Thomson. Rwanda shares borders with Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and the DRC. The virus could also spread further afield in Africa or even cause occasional cases elsewhere in the world if people travel to these areas, she says.', 'In early October, a platform of Hamburg train station was cordoned off after two passengers with suspected Marburg symptoms who had recently visited Rwanda were onboard a train from Frankfurt. They were later confirmed not to have the virus.', 'Countries need to warn people travelling from Rwanda about the risks and signs of a Marburg infection, says Carroll.

For example, beta-lactam was associated with increased risk of nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain (risk difference [RD] per 100, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10 to 0.57), non–C difficile diarrhea (RD per 100, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.68), and vulvovaginal candidiasis/vaginitis (RD per 100, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.69).
