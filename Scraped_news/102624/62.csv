One of the best-known passages describes a military siege that reduced Sigurdsson’s castle, Sverresborg, to ruins—but before it was destroyed, the marauders tried to eliminate its holed-up inhabitants by dropping a dead body down a nearby well, thereby poisoning their water supply. ', 'While using decaying and infected cadavers as a form of biological warfare was a relatively common practice in both the medieval and ancient worlds, historians weren’t sure this particular event actually took place. Although texts like the Sverris saga form the foundation of our understanding of early Nordic history, the contents must always be inspected with a healthy dose of skepticism unless they’re backed up with archaeological evidence.  ', 'In the case of the body thrown down the well, researchers got lucky in that regard. Scientists from several Scandinavian universities have identified human remains found in a well at the Sverresborg site, near modern-day Trondheim, as Norwegian in ancestry and dating from the 12th century, corroborating the saga’s account of the castle siege.', 'The bones of the “Well Man” were discovered in 1938, about the time archaeological excavations of the Sverresborg site began. World War II interrupted plans to further investigate the well and researchers lacked the technology for any examination beyond a visual description. While the Well Man’s skeleton showed signs of trauma, researchers could not determine whether these injuries occurred before or after his death, though blunt force injuries on the left side of the skull suggested the body could have been thrown. ', 'Studies conducted between 2014 and 2016 revealed that the Well Man was in fact male and had been around 30 to 40 years old at the time of his death. Radiocarbon dating concluded his remains were roughly 900 years old, meaning he—or, rather, his diseased body—could have been present at the raid on Sverresborg. ', 'In the most recent study, published in the journal iScience, researchers ground up one of the Well Man’s teeth to sequence his genome. DNA markers revealed that he likely had blue eyes and blond or light-brown hair. Comparisons of the Well Man’s genome with the DNA profiles in a huge database of modern Norwegians suggested that he hailed from the southernmost area of Norway, which is now the county of Vest-Agder.', 'To sequence the DNA of a 900-year-old human is one thing, but to corroborate the physical evidence with a tale in a legendary saga is quite another. “This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” senior author Michael D. Martin, a professor of natural history in the NTNU University Museum at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said in a statement. ', 'In the future, Martin hopes to apply the technique that identified the Well Man to the remains of Saint Olaf, another medieval Norwegian king, whose is thought to have been buried somewhere inside Trondheim Cathedral.

Now, scientists have an array of analytical techniques at their disposal, including genetic sequencing and radiocarbon dating.', 'A new study on the remains, published Friday in the Cell Press journal iScience, reveals unprecedented insights into Well-man’s appearance based on in-depth research on samples of his teeth.', '“This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” said study coauthor Michael D. Martin, a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim, in a statement.', '“There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.”', 'The findings not only shed fresh light on what Well-man looked like but also who he was, with a surprising twist about how he ended up in a Norse saga.', 'The Sverris saga is a window into the ambitious rise of King Sverre, who lived from 1152 to 1202 and reigned over Norway during the second half of the 12th century. The text includes revelations about Norway’s early history, describing periods of political instability and conflict — with wars caused by disputes over who would succeed to the throne after King Sigurd Munn, according to the study.', 'Sverre threw his name into the mix when he claimed to be a son of Munn. Munn was killed by his brother in 1155, which sparked the succession scuffle.', 'While many of the Norse sagas derive from oral traditions and older lost manuscripts, the Sverris story appears to have been written in tandem with the events described within it — by someone close to the king. The text is rich in detail, including full names, locations, battles and military strategy as well as Sverre’s speeches.', 'Throughout the narrative, Sverre’s men are referred to as Birkebeiner, meaning ”birch legs,” reportedly due to their use of primitive birch bark as footwear and leg coverings. Meanwhile, Sverre’s opponents, organized by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, were called the Baglers, derived from the Norse “bagall,” meaning ”bishop wand,” the study authors noted.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\n‘Vittrup Man’ violently died in a bog 5,200 years ago. Now, researchers know his story', 'In 1197, as King Sverre spent the winter in Bergen along Norway’s western coast, the Baglers carried out a surprise attack hundreds of miles away against Sverresborg castle, which the monarch built in 1180 in what’s now the city of Trondheim. The Bagler army crept into the stronghold through a secret door as residents dined, burning everything inside, according to the study.', 'Well-man appears in one line in the text: “They took a dead man and cast him into the well, and then filled it up with stones.”', 'Some of his skeletal remains were uncovered beneath large stones during an excavation of the well in 1938. More of his bones turned up in new excavations in 2014 and 2016 along the southern side of the well, including parts of his left hand (the left arm was missing) and skull, which researchers found disconnected from the body.', 'Research carried out along with the more recent excavations suggested that the bones belonged to a man 30 to 40 years old at the time of death. It’s been difficult for scientists to determine how much of the trauma recorded by his bones occurred after death, but a blunt force injury to the rear left part of the skull, as well as two sharp cuts in the skull, likely happened before he died, according to the study authors.', 'For the latest study, Martin and his colleagues wanted to bring together historical, archaeological and genetic context for Well-man’s remains.', 'An initial radiocarbon dating analysis helped the research team confirm that Well-man’s remains were about 900 years old, which aligns with the timeline in the Sverris saga.', 'The team was hoping to sequence Well-man’s genome from his bones, given that they appeared to be in good condition, but surprisingly, the DNA was poorly preserved inside them, Martin said.', 'Lead study author Dr. Martin Ellegaard at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology instead used samples of a tooth to sequence the genome, which enabled the team to discover that Well-man likely had a medium skin tone, blue eyes, and blond or light-brown hair.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\n‘Bone biographies’ reveal what life was like for everyday medieval people', 'The researchers collaborated with Agnar Helgason to compare Well-man’s genome with the genomes of anonymous modern Norwegians stored in reference databases at Iceland’s deCODE Genetics, where Helgason is the head of anthropology.', 'The results showed that Well-man was closely related to people in southern Norway.', 'King Sverre’s defeated army came from parts of central Norway, while the raiding Baglers were from the south.', '“The biggest surprise for all of us was that the Well-man did not come from the local population, but rather that his ancestry traces back to a specific region in southern Norway. That suggests the sieging army threw one of their own dead into the well,” Martin said.', 'While it’s impossible to know the true intent of the Baglers when they threw the body down the well, the Sverris saga says the raiders wanted to make the castle uninhabitable and undefendable for King Sverre and his people.', 'Placing a corpse into the only nearby source of drinking water would cause pollution, which may have been amplified if Well-man had a disease. No pathogens were discovered when studying Well-man’s teeth, but that may have been due to the destructive techniques used in examining the tooth.', 'To sequence Well-man’s genome, the researchers had to remove the tooth’s outer surface to avoid contamination potentially caused by anyone who previously handled it during excavation, and then ground half the tooth into powder, which means the sample can’t be used for future tests. But other teeth from the remains could be tested.', '“Though there are other teeth available from this individual we need to consider if new techniques in the future will provide additional information than what is available with today’s methods,” Ellegaard said. “Another consideration is the scientific value we obtain. In this case we only have one side of the story — the saga — which has a clear agenda, and so here we can justify our approach to corroborate the one-sided written words, as opposed to if there were several records or other means of data available.”', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nDNA from 3,600-year-old cheese sequenced by scientists', 'Maja Krzewińska, a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, Sweden, found the study’s methodology to be well-executed but said she was most impressed that the remains could be linked to an event described in a historical source. Krzewińska was not involved in the study.', '“There is always uncertainty about such old descriptions, so finding a correctly dated male skeleton in this context already adds to the interpretation,” Krzewińska wrote in an email.\n“However, showing that his genetic origin may have been in southern rather than central Norway, as was originally expected, changes our perception of the circumstances surrounding the decision of the victors to deposit this particular human carcass in the well. It opens up new possibilities for interpretation (for why the body was dumped) and allows for a deeper understanding and novel insights into stories we thought were largely understood.”', 'While Well-man’s exact identity may never be known, he’s now more than just the anonymous “dead man” from the saga, Martin said.', '“Archaeological science, ancient DNA and genetic analyses give us tools to separate fact from fiction, which eventually should give us a more objective and complete view of human history,” Martin said.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Now, a new study, published Friday (Oct. 24) in the journal iScience, combines radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis to determine that he probably died in 1197 during a raid on the castle of the Norwegian king Sverre Sigurdsson near Trondheim, in central Norway. The events are recorded in ""Sverris Saga,"" one of the ""King\'s Sagas,"" or prose poems, written in Norway and Iceland between the 12th and 14th centuries to glorify Norse kings.', 'Study co-author Michael Martin, an evolutionary geneticist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, told Live Science this may be the first time a person in the Norse sagas had been found.', 'He noted genetic analysis was used to identify the remains of England\'s king Richard III, but they were from 1485.

It details many of the battles fought by his soldiers, called ""Birkebeiner"" or ""birch legs"" after the birch-bark wrappings they wore to protect their lower legs; while Sverre\'s main enemies were a rival faction called the ""Baglers,"" the study authors wrote.

Medieval DNA Reveals Skeleton’s Link to Norse Saga,https://www.medievalists.net/2024/10/medieval-dna-reveals-skeletons-link-to-norse-saga/,"['Medievalists.net', 'WHERE THE MIDDLE AGES BEGIN', '', 'A passage in the Sverris Saga, an 800-year-old Norse account, describes a military raid in 1197 during which a body was thrown into a well at castle in Norway. Now, a new study published in iScience has brought this tale to life, as researchers have used ancient DNA to corroborate the saga and uncover details about the so-called “Well-man.”', '“This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” says Professor Michael D. Martin of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim. “There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.”', 'Bones were first discovered in the well at Sverresborg Castle in 1938, but all we know about that discovery was a brief description and newspaper articles from that time. It was not until excavations from 2014 and 2016 that the remains were recovered, with about 90% of the body being found. The person had several injuries on the body, although it is difficult to tell if they happened before or after he died. Most interestingly, his head was found not connected to his body.', 'Today, advanced techniques like radiocarbon dating and gene sequencing have enabled researchers to paint a more detailed picture of the Well-man. Radiocarbon dating confirms the remains are around 900 years old, and studies from 2014 and 2016 identified the individual as a male who was between 30 and 40 years old when he died.', '“The text is not absolutely correct—what we have seen is that the reality is much more complex than the text,” says archaeologist Anna Petersén of the Norwegian Institute of Cultural Heritage Research in Oslo. In the Sverris Saga, a work from the early 13th century that recounts the life and reign of King Sverre Sigurdsson of Norway (r. 1177–1202), one episode details the war between two factions – the Birkebeiners (who supported Sverre) and the Baglers. The Baglers launched a sneak attack against the Birkebeiner stronghold at Sverresborg Castle near present-day Trondheim. The saga relates what happens next:', 'The Baglers seized all the property in the castle, and then burnt every building of it. They took a dead man and cast him into the well, and then filled it up with stones. Before they left. the castle they called upon the townsmen to break down all the stone walls; and before they marched from the town they burnt all the King’s long-ships. After this they returned to the Uplands, well pleased with the booty they had gained in their journey. ', '“We can corroborate what actually happened in a more neutral way,” explains Dr. Martin Rene Ellegaard, also from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Ellegaard, in his work toward a doctoral degree, used a tooth from the Well-man to sequence his genome.', 'In the article, the researchers write:', 'Our genomic analyses confirm that the Well-man was indeed a male and augment the historical text with predictions about his physical appearance: that he likely had blue eyes and blond or light-brown hair. More interestingly, our results show that his ancestry can be traced to the southernmost counties of Norway, most probably Vest-Agder. The defeated holders of the castle were King Sverre’s Birkebeiners, who are thought to have been mainly from central Norway. Conversely, it is the Baglers, the invading victors from the south of Norway, who are described as having thrown the man into the well. Accordingly, previous reports had assumed that the Well-man was a central Norwegian, from the losing side of Birkebeiners. Our results unequivocally show that the Well-man’s ancestry was typical of the present-day population of the southern Agder counties, but of course cannot tell us whether the Well-man belonged to the Birkebeiner or the Bagler army. We note that the passage in Sverris Saga states that the Well-man was dead before the Baglers threw him into the well. Perhaps the Baglers threw one of their own dead into the well.', 'This insight was possible thanks to reference data from modern-day Norwegians’ genomes, provided through collaboration with Professor Agnar Helgason at deCODE Genetics in Iceland. “Most of the work that we do is reliant on having reference data,” explains Ellegaard. “So the more ancient genomes that we sequence and the more modern individuals that we sequence, the better the analysis will be in the future.”', '“Those reference data are literally thousands of genomes of modern Norwegians and many thousands of other European genomes,” Martin adds.', 'However, this method does have its drawbacks. To sample the Well-man’s genome, researchers had to grind the tooth into a powder, rendering it unusable for future tests. This also meant they couldn’t test for pathogens the Well-man may have carried.', '“It was a compromise between removing surface contamination of the people who have touched the tooth and then removing some of the possible pathogens… there are lots of ethical considerations,” says Ellegaard. “We need to consider what kind of tests we’re doing now because it will limit what we can do in the future.”', 'Looking ahead, researchers hope to apply these techniques to other historical figures. “The important Norwegian Saint Olaf is thought to be buried somewhere in Trondheim Cathedral,” Martin notes, “so if his remains are eventually uncovered, there could be efforts to describe him physically and trace his ancestry using genetic sequencing.”', '', 'Reflecting on this new intersection of history and science, Petersén remarks, “It’s a fantastic result on what Ellegaard and Martin’s method can bring to archaeology in such a strange or rare context like this.”', 'The article, ""Corroborating written history with ancient DNA: The case of the Well-man described in an Old Norse saga,"" by Martin R.

Researchers analyzed the DNA of a skeleton found in a well outside Trondheim in central Norway. This study of “Well Man” matched the events the saga recounted.', '“This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” Michael Martin of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim, Norway and an author of the study, said in a press release. “There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.”', 'The bones were discovered in 1938 — but scientists then lacked the tools to understand their origins. Since then, radiocarbon dating matched the demise of Well Man to the period described in the saga. More recently, a Norwegian team of scientists used genomics tools to learn more about his past.', 'DNA analysis shows that Well Man was between 30 and 40 years old at the time of his death. He most likely had blue eyes and blond or light-brown hair, and his ancestors probably came from the southernmost Norwegian county now named Vest-Agder. The researchers could draw these conclusions because Norway has collected reference data that details the genetics of contemporary Norwegians.', 'Read More: Everything Worth Knowing About ...

Finally, they used genetic tools to examine the tooth powder.', 'Their tests did not show what disease — if any — Well Man might have carried to his grave. Since that particular sample cannot be re-used, his cause of death may remain a mystery. Any pathogen on the tooth’s surface would have been destroyed while processing the sample.', '“It was a compromise between removing surface contamination of the people who have touched the tooth and then removing some of the possible pathogens […] there are lots of ethical considerations,” Martin Rene Ellegaard of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology Ellegaard and an author of the study, said in a press release. “We need to consider what kind of tests we’re doing now because it will limit what we can do in the future.”', 'The researchers intend to test samples from other historical figures — once they uncover their bones.

'Extraordinary' Skeleton Found in Castle Well Corroborates Medieval Saga,https://www.newsweek.com/skeleton-found-castle-800-year-old-medieval-saga-1975008,"['', '', '', 'A study of a remarkable medieval skeleton found in a well at a castle in Norway has helped to corroborate events detailed in an 800-year-old Norse saga.', 'In the study, published in the journal iScience, a team of researchers analyzed the human remains originally discovered at Sverresborg Castle outside Trondheim in 1938. They determined that the timing of the individual\'s death and other contextual information matched ""very well"" with a story documented in a historical text known as the Sverris Saga.', 'Michael Martin, one of the authors of the study with the University Museum, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, told Newsweek the skeleton is ""extraordinary"" given that the Sverris Saga, which is thought to have been written more than 800 years ago, provides an account of how it came to rest at the bottom of the castle well.', 'The Old Norse sagas are narrative prose works written in a former North Germanic language spoken during the medieval period. They tell stories of historical figures and legendary heroes, often mixing history, legend, and mythology, making them a fascinating blend of fact and fiction.', 'They were largely composed by Icelandic scholars, although their stories sometimes extend beyond Iceland, depicting events in Norway, Greenland, the British Isles, and even locations farther afield, such as North America. The sagas were often written centuries later than the described events, likely building on oral traditions and earlier lost manuscripts.', 'The Sverris Saga details the life and reign of Norwegian king Sverre Sigurdsson (1151–1202), describing his ambitious rise to power as sovereign over Norway in the second half of the 12th century.', '""Much of Norway\'s early history is known from this single text, which depicts a period of political instability characterized by conflicts and civil wars lasting more than a century,"" the study authors wrote.', 'It is widely believed that most of the saga text was written around the same time as the events it describes, making it somewhat unusual among the Old Norse sagas. The author is thought to have been someone close to the king, possibly the Icelandic abbot Karl Jónsson.', '""The text, clearly in favor of Sverre, is rich in names, places, and events, spanning an impressive 182 verses, and is unique in its detailed depiction of the many battles, and recounting a large cast of individuals, military strategic considerations, and the many speeches made by Sverre,"" the authors wrote.', ""Despite the author's apparent close connection to the events, the Sverris Saga is not purely historical. It still contains literary embellishments and political biases, especially since it seeks to legitimize Sverre's controversial claim to the throne. As a result, while it's an invaluable near-contemporary source, it also requires careful interpretation."", 'One passage in the Sverris Saga describes a military raid on Sverresborg Castle in A.D. 1197. During the event, a body was thrown into a well, possibly in an attempt to poison the main water source for the local inhabitants.', 'Radiocarbon dating work conducted by the authors of the latest study supports the view that the individual found in a well at the castle in 1938 is the person documented in the Sverris saga. The radiocarbon data agree well with the expected dates of the castle raid.', 'Previous research had indicated that the human remains in the well belonged to a male who was between 30 and 40 years old at the time of death. The authors wanted to shed new light on the ""well-man,"" so they also sequenced his genome.', '""We sequenced the genome of this person and used that information to confirm that he was a man and to deduce that he likely had blonde hair, blue eyes, and an intermediate skin tone,"" Martin told Newsweek.', '""We also used databases of reference human genetic data to determine that the man\'s ancestry does not trace back to the local area but to a specific county in southern Norway. That was a big surprise to us given that the attacking army came from southern Norway, and we would not have expected them to disrespect one of their own dead by throwing him in the well.""', 'According to the authors, when knowledge of the past is primarily based on historical texts such as the Sverris Saga, it is valuable to have independent sources of information that can verify or add to our understanding of protagonists and events.', '""What we highlight in our study is that genetic information from ancient human remains can be used in some cases to separate fact from fiction—this event did happen and is corroborated by our study—and even to sketch out physical descriptions and life stories of otherwise anonymous side characters in these texts,"" Martin said.', 'Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well,https://www.popsci.com/science/well-man-norway/,"['BY LAURA BAISAS', 'POSTED ON OCT 25, 2024 11:00 AM EDT', 'The fusion of history, archaeology, and genetics is cracking an 800-year-old Nordic mystery. Researchers from Norway used ancient DNA to corroborate a story from the Sverris Saga, where a man’s body was thrown into a well. Genetic analysis reveals what the man might have looked like and where his ancestors came from. The findings are described in a study published October 25 in the Cell Press journal iScience and the methods used could help scientists identify other historical figures. ', '“This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” Michael D. Martin, a study co-author and genomicist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said in a statement. “There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.”', '[Related: Stone circles unearthed in Norway mark ancient children’s graves.]', 'The Old Norse Sverris Saga details the reign of King Sverre Sigurdsson and is an important source of knowledge about the region in the late 12th and early 13th Century CE. One of the passages describes a raid on Sverresborg Castle outside Trondheim in central Norway that occurred in 1197 CE. The writer mentions a dead man thrown into the well, but the reason why he was thrown into the well is much more sinister than just a run of the mill drowning. Historians suspect that the body was thrown in as a way to poison the local main water source.', 'In 1938, the bones believed to be that of the “Well-man” were found within the castle’s walls, but scientists at the time couldn’t do much beyond visual analysis. Today’s scientists have radiocarbon dating and advanced gene-sequencing technology that allowed them to craft a more solid picture of the Well-man’s identity.

Research from 2014 and 2016 also confirmed that the body belonged to a male who was between 30 and 40 years old when he died.', '“The text is not absolutely correct—what we have seen is that the reality is much more complex than the text,” study co-author and Norwegian Institute of Cultural Heritage Research archaeologist Anna Petersén said in a statement.', '“We can corroborate what actually happened in a more neutral way,” study co-author Martin Rene Ellegaard of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology added.', 'In this new study, the team used samples of a tooth from the Well-man’s skeleton to sequence his genome. The team was then able to determine that he most likely had blue eyes and blond or light-brown hair. His ancestors were likely from the southernmost Norwegian county of present-day Vest-Agder.', 'To analyze this very old genome, they used a large pool of reference data from the genomes of modern-day Norwegians and other Eureopeans through a collaboration with Agnar Helgason at deCODE Genetics in Iceland.', '“Most of the work that we do is reliant on having reference data,” Ellegaard said. “So the more ancient genomes that we sequence and the more modern individuals that we sequence, the better the analysis will be in the future.”', '[Related: Some modern-day Scandinavians lack the ancestral diversity of Vikings.]', 'According to the team, the discovery of the remains of the Well-man and their connection to this  passage in Sverris Saga gave them the opportunity to bring inferences based on ancient DNA into historical study. ', '“While we cannot prove that the remains recovered from the well inside the ruins of Sverresborg castle are those of the individual mentioned in Sverris Saga, the circumstantial evidence is consistent with this conclusion,” the authors wrote in the study. ', 'Even with all of this data and better research methods, there are still limitations to this technology. Sampling the Well-man’s genome required removing the outer surface from his tooth, to keep it from being contaminated with any DNA from those who handled it during excavation. The tooth also had to be ground into a powder and the sample can’t be used for further tests. The team were not able to obtain any data on pathogens that the Well-man may have been carrying at his time of death.', '“It was a compromise between removing surface contamination of the people who have touched the tooth and then removing some of the possible pathogens … there are lots of ethical considerations,” said Ellegaard. “We need to consider what kind of tests we’re doing now because it will limit what we can do in the future.”', 'The team would also like to test samples from other historical figures, including Saint Olaf–the patron saint of Norway–who is believed to be buried near Trondheim Cathedral.', '“So I think that if eventually his remains are uncovered, there could be some effort to describe him physically and trace his ancestry using genetic sequencing,” said Martin.

Scientists at that time were only able to carry out a visual analysis.', '', '', 'With multiple analytical techniques now available including genetic sequencing and radiocarbon dating, the researchers have now been able to link the skeletal remains to the saga, according to CNN.', 'A study in this regard was published in the Cell Press journal iScience on Friday, revealing major insights into the appearance of the ""Well-man"" based on in-depth research on samples of his teeth.', 'The co-author of the study, Michael D Martin said in a statement that this was the first time when a person ""described in these historical texts has actually been found"".', ""Mr Martin is a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's University Museum in Trondheim."", '""There are a lot of these mediaeval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they\'re increasingly being studied using genomic methods,"" Mr Martin added.', 'The radiocarbon dating analysis helped the researchers determine that the skeletal remains were around 800 years old, aligning with the timeline of the Sverris saga.', ""Mr Martin said that they initially hoped to sequence the body's genome from its bones, considering that they appeared to be in good condition, but the DNA was poorly preserved inside them. So, they used samples of a tooth for genome sequencing. The result showed that the man likely had a medium skin tone along with blue eyes, and light-brown hair."", 'Then they compared the genome of ""Well-man"" with the genomes of anonymous modern Norwegians that are stored in reference databases at deCODE Genetics in Iceland.', 'As a result, it came out that the ""well-man"" was closely related to the natives of southern Norway.', 'Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world']"
Centuries-old remains found in a well may be man from Norse saga,https://www.wcbu.org/npr-news/2024-10-26/centuries-old-remains-found-in-a-well-may-be-man-from-norse-saga,"['In the 12th and 13th centuries, Norway was racked by civil war. It’s a period chronicled in an ancient Norse text called the Sverris Saga, which is named after king Sverre Sigurdsson.', 'The saga tells of the king’s ongoing feud with his chief enemy, the archbishop.', '“He ordered one of his closest associates to write his story to have a record of everything that happened in his life, “so the Sverris Saga has a strong bias to King Sverre,"" says Anna Petersen, an archaeologist with the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research.', '“Battles are described in detail,” she says, including one that took place around the year 1180 near the present-day city of Trondheim, in central Norway. The archbishop’s fighters attacked the king’s castle when the king was away.', '“They let everyone go,” she says. “They saved their lives. But they completely destroyed the castle. They burned all the houses.”', 'Then, Petersen says, “the archbishop’s people wanted to do something nasty.”', 'The saga reads: “They took a dead man and cast him into the well headfirst, and then filled it up with stones.” Petersén says most scholars have assumed he was connected to the king.', 'Perhaps they wanted to poison the water supply or humiliate the king and his men.', 'Either way, the text adds “nothing about who this dead man was, where he came from, what group he belonged to,” says Petersen.', 'Now, in a study published in the journal iScience, Petersen and her colleagues describe sequencing the genome of a sample of 800-year-old DNA that may well be the man thrown down that well centuries ago. The research offers a glimpse into where he came from and what he may have looked like before he met his tragic end.', '', '', 'In 1938, a partial excavation of the well some 21 feet deep revealed a man’s skeleton — possibly that of the person described in the saga. The remains were left in place.', 'Then, a decade or so ago, Petersen and her colleagues started the hard work of lifting out the uneven and slippery stones — along with a lot of rubbish — and uncovered the skeleton.', '“He had a bad back and he has evidence of heavy manual labor all his life,” she says. “So he was a tired man already before his death.”', 'Petersen knew there must be more to the story, so she teamed up with evolutionary genomicist Michael Martin from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.', '“We managed to take a sample from two different bones from the skeletal remains,” he says. “From the cranium and the leg bone.”', 'Martin and one of his students, Vanessa Bieker, donned double gloves, hairnets, and booties, and entered the lab to collect as much DNA as possible from those old bones. “It’s not a very comfortable working environment,” he says.', '“We’re very frustrated to find that it was almost entirely bacterial DNA,” says Martin. There’s been a lot of degradation of the original human DNA.”', 'Then, another student, Martin Ellegaard, had the idea to look for more skeletal material.', '“Once he got a hold of the teeth,” Martin recalls, “then things really changed.”', 'The root of one of those teeth had enough DNA that the researchers could sequence the man’s genome and compare it to people today, including thousands of Norwegians.', '“We were able to deduce that he was a male,” says Martin. “We could say that he was very likely to have blue eyes, blonde hair and an intermediate skin tone and that his ancestry traces back to a very specific county in southern Norway.” This last piece of information suggested that people moved around in Medieval times.', '', '', 'Martin says the findings add new detail to the centuries-old story. “Just finding the remains shows [these stories are] not made up,” he says. “They might be elaborated and exaggerated, but they’re based on fact.”', 'The researchers say this is the oldest genome to be sequenced of a specific person from an old text. Was he a king’s man, though?', 'Dana Kristjansson, a genetic epidemiologist at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health who wasn’t involved in the study, agrees the results support the story of the man pitched down the well, but it’s circumstantial.', '“We can’t prove that this person is actually that which was described,” she says. “Some of the stories tend to be more accurate than others, even if they involve real people and events.”', 'Still, this skeleton did belong to someone who lived at the time documented by the Sverris Saga, and these new details about his appearance and origins that are inscribed in his DNA personalize him.', '“He has been no one, says Petersen. “But now he has become someone. He has had a life.”', 'Copyright 2024 NPR', '', 'Become a WCBU sponsor']"
