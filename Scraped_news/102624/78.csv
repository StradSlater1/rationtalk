(WAFB) - Depending on the makeup of your breast tissue, it can be more difficult for radiologists and breast specialists to detect cancer, but they believe using the right technology and staying on top of screenings can help.', 'After getting a mammogram, most women look at the bottom of their results to see if they are clear of cancer or not. However, Breast Surgical Oncologist Dr. Linsey Fauveau said you should also look at the top of the report for your density levels.', '“That actually indicates how easy is this mammogram to be able to be read by the radiologist and so you want to at least know what are your odds of something hiding in your dense breast tissue,” said Fauveau.', 'Dr. Ashley Grindol is one of the radiologists who read your scans at Woman’s Hospital. She explains that denser breast tissue can overlap masses and lumps in a mammogram and make it more difficult to see. That’s why they use 3D imaging instead. This gives Dr. Grindol a better look and better results.', '“The 3D gives you the image from multiple different planes and you’re able to see some of those masses easier,” said Grindol.', 'However, Breast Surgical Oncologist Dr. Cecilia Cuntz said having denser tissue does not automatically mean cancer is lurking.', '“There’s a lot of risk factors that increase or decrease your risk for breast cancer and breast density is one of those so knowing your breast density is important but it’s just a piece of the puzzle,” explained Cuntz.', 'That’s why Dr. Fauveau believes consistency is key. She said you should go to the same facility and use the same machines when you do your routine mammogram to make sure the quality of the imaging is the same. You should start getting yearly mammograms at 40-years-old if you have an average risk of breast cancer. If you have a family history of breast cancer before the age of 40 or are at a higher risk, you should get a baseline mammogram at 35-years-old. Dr. Fauveau said your doctor can recommend this and most insurance providers will cover an earlier mammogram.', 'Dr. Grindol said it is also important to stay on top of getting one done so they can catch any changes early.', '“We might not see something that is cancer that we would’ve seen a change from the prior year so having them every year is helpful for us to catch those cancers at an early stage and treat you,” said Grindol.', 'Most women get screened in October during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

What are dense breasts? How this common condition complicates cancer detection,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/dense-breasts-cancer-risk,"['If you’ve been told you have dense breasts, your mammogram results might not tell the full story. Here’s how breast density affects cancer detection—and which extra screenings can help.', 'After receiving her routine mammogram results, 46-year-old Nicole Pearl found herself in what she calls “no man’s land.” The letter from her doctor said she was “clear” of cancer, but also mentioned she had dense breasts—leaving her uncertain about what that meant for her health. “So, I may not actually be clear and have the option for more testing,” she says.', 'Pearl’s experience is far from unique. According to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, around 40 percent of women have mostly dense breasts, and 10 percent have extremely dense breasts. Younger women are more likely to have dense breast tissue, although it typically decreases with age.', 'But the issue isn’t dense breasts themselves; it’s how they can obscure cancer on mammograms. Both cancer and dense tissue show up white, making it harder to detect abnormalities. While dense breasts are linked to a higher cancer risk, the exact risk depends on other factors. Here’s what you need to know.', 'Dense breasts aren’t larger, lumpier, or smoother than average, says Richard Reitherman, medical director of breast imaging at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California.', 'Instead, they have more fibrous and glandular tissue compared to fatty tissue, which makes it harder to detect cancer on mammograms.', 'Reitherman says there are four levels of breast density—A, B, C, and D. The top two levels (C and D) are considered “dense” and are the most concerning. “You can’t see much at all on a mammogram,” he says.', '(Do increased breast cancer screenings save lives? Doctors can’t agree.)', 'Research across 29 studies shows combining mammograms with ultrasound increases cancer detection in women with dense breasts by 40 percent. However, mammograms still matter greatly for all women because they can detect “alterations and distortion” that ultrasounds can’t see, Reitherman says.', 'You can’t determine breast density just by feel or appearance—it requires diagnostic testing. And “you can’t tell by age,” says Laurie Margolies, vice chair of breast imaging at Mount Sinai Health System in New York.', '“Breast density is very often related to your [genetics],” she says. Women with a lower body mass index (BMI) are more likely to have dense breasts, but this isn’t always the case, she adds. ”The only way you know for sure is mammography, or occasionally a chest CT,” says Margolies.', '(New research shows how genes can identify risks of breast cancer.)', 'In March 2023, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) updated the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) to require that all mammography reports include information about breast density, ensuring that patients are informed about this important aspect of their results. This regulation is set to take full effect by September 2024. However, the challenge for many women comes after receiving this information—what should they do next?', 'While dense breasts can make it harder to spot cancer, they don’t mean you have cancer. In fact, a 2023 study found that women with dense breasts often have an inaccurate “perceived personal” risk of breast cancer, leading to overestimating their risk of breast cancer.', 'But, “you can do more than a mammogram for early detection,” says Margolies, who suggests discussing options like ultrasound or MRI with your doctor. She adds that for every thousand women with dense breasts, additional screenings with ultrasound can uncover about three more cancers, while MRI could detect up to 16 more.', '(When should you get screened for breast cancer—and how often?)', 'So why aren’t patients with dense breasts just routinely scheduled for additional testing? “The reason we can’t do that is because we’re only seeing one part of you, your mammogram,” says Kemi Babagbemi, a board-certified radiologist specializing in Women’s Imaging at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.', 'Some places may not routinely offer or recommend MRIs unless other risk factors are present, as these tests are more expensive and can lead to false positives. “Your primary provider needs to be doing a risk assessment to determine what other risk factors for breast cancer you have to go to the next step,” Babagbemi adds.', 'It’s scary to hear stats of increasing breast cancer rates and to wonder if your testing was correct. But, Reitherman says that there are steps you can even take on your own to determine your risk, in addition to, not in place of, a mammogram.', 'For younger women under 40, breast cancers tend to be more aggressive, so it’s important for younger women to fully understand their breast densities and advocate for proper testing. Black women, who are statistically more likely to die from breast cancer, along with other high-risk groups, should also be particularly mindful of their results.', '“I encourage any woman wanting to explore her risk of breast cancer, download each of these models, put in the requested information, and compare the outcomes,” says Reitherman. He suggests tools like the IBIS Breast Cancer Evaluation Tool, the ACSC Advanced Breast Cancer Risk Calculator, and the National Cancer Institute’s Online Calculator. It’s also helpful to review these results with your healthcare provider, he adds.', 'Finally, experts agree on one key point: advocate for yourself. Ask questions, push for additional testing if needed, and don’t skip your annual screenings.', 'Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

When we look at breast and we can see it really clearly on a mammogram, you may have a patient that’s mostly fatty replaced so the density that we see, which is their Fibro glandular tissue, is minimal,” Wiatrek said.', 'There are four stages of breast density. They range from breasts with mostly fat to breasts with less fat and more density.', 'Stage one: Experts consider stage one breasts as breasts that consist of mostly fatty tissue.', 'Stage two: Experts consider stage two breasts as breasts with scattered fibro glandular tissue.', 'Stage three: Experts consider stage three breasts as breasts with more dense breast tissue. This stage is called heterogeneously dense, meaning there are pockets that are denser than others.', 'Stage four: Experts consider stage four as extremely dense breasts. This breast type is harder to actually see in mammograms, this type of density masks cancer underneath it.', '“When you have a really dense breast number one, it’s hard to compress it, so it’s harder to see on mammogram. It’s also a little harder to see through that to see any sort of cancers or atypical lesions,” Wiatrek said.', 'Experts once believed the reason for the increased risk was the masking component that happens when breasts are examined through mammograms but, newer studies show that it has to do with the amount of cells in the breasts that have the propensity to turn into breast cancer.', '“We don’t exactly know why a dense breast may be more likely to have or develop a breast cancer, we’re still trying to figure that out, but we do know it increases the patient’s risk based on the most recent studies,” said Wiatrek.', 'As of Sept. 10, the Food and Drug Administration issued a rule to update the mammography regulations under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. This new rule requires health care providers to provide patients with information such as breast density.', '“For a patient that is doing self exams, dense breast tissue does feel different than a fatty replaced breast, and can sometimes feel like you have a masses in your breast, but it’s actually dense breast tissue the first exam you have with your gynecologist, or that they should be able to tell you and give you a comparison on that, but the standard of knowing how dense it is is going to be a mammogram,” said Wiatrek.', 'Mammograms and breast screening can help detect cancer early and help doctors better understand the best type of care a patient needs.', 'Experts recommend starting mammogram screenings at age 40, unless they are in a different risk category. Clinical exams and screenings should start at age 25 and up unless otherwise recommended by your doctor.', '“The gynecologists that women are seeing are great at knowing what those recommendations are and make sure that you don’t miss a baseline screening,” Wiatrek said.', 'Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Historically, women’s health issues have been deprioritized in the U.S., leading to what is known as “women’s health gap.” On average, women experience nine years of poor health – 25% more than men – impacting their quality of life and their productivity at home, at work and within their communities.1', 'Access to even the most basic health necessities like nutritional meals and regular medical check-ups, including preventative screenings, also remains out of reach – with a reported 1 in 4 U.S. women behind on critical breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings.2 As primary decision-makers in families, women often focus on the health of others over their own, with a recent Hologic-Gallup survey highlighting that more than 6 out of 10 women admit having a hard time prioritizing their health.3', 'This issue is even more acute among women living in rural and underserved areas who, despite a lower incidence of breast cancer compared to their urban counterparts, face unique challenges that often lead to late-stage diagnoses.4 This is largely due to limited access to screening facilities and healthcare services in rural areas, where only 10% of the nation’s physicians practice, forcing many to travel great distances – more than twice as far than those who live in urban areas – for care.4,5,6 Additional barriers, including the financial ability to take time off from work, can also have an impact.7 And the health disparities between urban and rural areas appear to be getting worse, tripling between 1999 and 2019.8', 'Bayer has been committed to addressing the healthcare needs of families across America. Through its mission of “Health for all, Hunger for none,” the company is supporting educational awareness about breast cancer imaging and access and ensuring food accessibility and affordability for families. Recognizing the complex and interconnected nature of these issues, Bayer is committed to making a difference but acknowledges that broader collaboration is needed among providers, policymakers and industry to increase education and awareness, provide access to care and enact new policies.', 'Nearly half of all women aged 40 or older who get mammograms are found to have dense breast tissue, which only a radiologist can identify through a mammogram.9 Characterized by high amounts of glandular and fibrous connective tissue and relatively low amounts of fatty breast tissue, dense breast tissue can lead to delayed or even missed cancer diagnoses. For many with dense breasts, the more widely accessible and typical screening technologies may fall short of a conclusive diagnosis – requiring supplemental imaging with technologies that may not be available at nearby health clinics. Many rural women face barriers accessing these specialized screening facilities needed for accurate detection of dense breast tissue.4', 'Compounding this issue, lack of adequate nutrition has a major impact on a person’s chances of surviving cancer. Research has found that people facing food insecurity face a higher risk of cancer death, with food insecurity cited as the strongest link between poverty and higher cancer death rates.10,11', 'The need to drive greater awareness about the importance of access to health, including regular screenings and proper nutrition, inspired Bayer’s “Take Care, Now” initiative. Partnering with country superstar Luke Bryan, Kroger, Feeding America as well as University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), the campaign aims to increase awareness and enhance access to health and nutrition while providing free health screening events at local Pennsylvania food banks to support rural women and their families. Inspired by Bayer’s annual Farm Tour which hosted a concert in Smithton, Pennsylvania, the team organized nearby health and nutrition events at local food banks for women in rural and underserved communities and offered free shuttles to screening facilities nearby. This effort has contributed to approximately 100 screenings so far.12', '“Early detection of breast cancer through annual mammography examination is the single most important way to diagnose cancers early,” said Dr. Margarita Louise Zuley, professor and chief of Breast Imaging at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC. “Recognizing that it’s not always easy for patients to access care, we have important community outreach events, just like this, so we can provide breast screenings in areas where there are unmet needs. Now, with Senator Ward’s legislation in Pennsylvania, we can also provide additional supplemental breast screening services such as breast MRI for those with dense breast tissue, where mammography may not be able to pick up the early cancers.”', 'Updated FDA regulations, which took effect in September 2024, now require mammography facilities in all 50 states to provide patients with an overall assessment of their breast density as part of their mammography report. Bayer supports these updated regulations and the proposed “Find It Early Act,” which seeks to extend insurance coverage for necessary supplemental imaging to all women.', 'Efforts to enhance access to breast cancer genetic testing and screenings are also supported by state and local officials. For instance, in Pennsylvania, Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, who recently participated in a “Take Care, Now” event in Pittsburgh, was instrumental in establishing landmark legislation that eliminates out-of-pocket costs associated with BRCA-related genetic testing and counseling and supplemental screening, such as breast MRI and ultrasound, for women at high-risk (e.g., extremely dense breast tissue).', 'Prior to passing Senate Bill 8, now Act 1 of 2023, the bipartisan legislation mentioned above, Senator Ward found herself facing a breast cancer diagnosis. “Just a few weeks after I was elected Pennsylvania’s first woman Senate Majority Leader, I heard the words: You have cancer. I was fortunate enough to have access to the resources and experts I needed to treat my cancer with confidence – but that isn’t the same for all women.”  She added, “Early detection saves lives. And as policymakers we have a responsibility to ensure the residents of the communities we serve have the ability to access screening tools with little to no costs. I am proud to celebrate Act 1 as a first of its kind in the nation legislation – but hope this milestone can become standard practice across all states.” ', 'Bayer recognizes that improving women’s healthcare and access to healthy nutrition is a community effort and remains dedicated to fostering partnerships and advocating for policy reform. By working together, we can ensure that every woman and family, especially those in remote areas, has the opportunity for a healthy life. “It takes a village to drive change,” notes Sven Schmidt, Head of Region, Radiology, Bayer. “Through collaboration, we can create a future where no one is left behind in their health journey, regardless of their location.”     ', 'If you’re interested in improving and advancing women’s access to breast cancer screening and diagnosis in your state, consider contacting your Congressperson or Senator.', 'For guidance on how to help advance and improve access to breast cancer screening and diagnosis in your state, visit Find It Early Act | DenseBreast-info, Inc.', 'October 2024\nPP-DSA-US-0004-1', '1.

In 2016 she began working in Surgical Oncology, primarily in the Breast Program.', 'My first question was about dense breast tissue. A term used a lot recently. “Dense breast tissue is common,” Ridgeway said. “Approximately 50 percent of women have dense breast tissue and it is completely normal. Genetics can play a role, and younger women tend to have more dense tissue as opposed to older women who have gone through menopause.”', 'Ridgeway explained that breast density is not a physical exam finding, but the mammographic appearance of the amount of glandular tissue compared to fat. An increase in the proportion of glandular tissue leads to greater mammographic density.', 'She went on to explain that there are four categories of breast density. “Approximately 10 percent of women have fatty tissue, 40% scattered fibroglandular, 40 percent heterogeneously dense tissue, and 10 percent have extremely dense tissue.”', 'The FDA recently came out in September and said radiologists must comment on breast density after a mammogram, which MUSC Hollings Cancer Center has been doing for many years. “A woman should talk to her provider about having additional imaging if she has dense tissue. Abnormalities may show up on ultrasounds that a mammogram might not detect.”', 'According to Ridgeway, dense breast tissue affects breast cancer in two ways. 1) Dense breast tissue can decrease the sensitivity to detect abnormalities hence obscuring a cancer and 2) Increased density is an independent risk factor as most cancer develop in the glandular tissue.', 'But Ridgeway added that while increased density can be associated with a higher risk of the possibility of developing cancer, it does not correlate with higher mortality.', 'If biopsies are recommended, she also reassured that about 80 percent of breast biopsies are benign. “There are a lot of findings that are not cancer, such as cysts or simple fibroadenomas, which carry no risk.”', 'When asked about the risk factors for getting breast cancer, Ridgeway listed: being female, increasing age, family history, overall exposure to hormones, i.e., an early menstruation (before age 12) and later menopause (after 55), never having children, having a first child after 35, having known genetic mutations and being overweight.', '“Women want to aim for having a body mass index under 30. Having a healthy BMI is important, especially if you are post-menopausal.” Ridgeway recommends 150 minutes of cardio exercise a week. And while there are inclusive factors about supplement recommendations, she did say a Mediterranean diet may be beneficial.', 'Other factors that are helpful in reducing breast cancer risk: not smoking, no more than one alcoholic drink a day, breastfeeding and reducing stress. “And continue with yearly mammograms. The earlier cancer is detected, the less likely it is to spread and the better the long-term outcome.”', 'The current recommendation from The American College of Radiology is for average risk women to begin having mammograms at age 40.', 'One thing I asked Ridgeway was if women should still do monthly self-breast exams, as there have been conflicting opinions. “I encourage breast awareness. Women should do self-examinations to become familiar with their body and their ‘normal.’ Be mindful of changes,” she said. “Areas of concern are typically persistent and progressive. They don’t move around, and they don’t play hide and seek.”', 'When asked if there is anything else a woman should look out for, Ridgeway mentioned nipple discharge and skin changes — such as swelling, redness and an orange peel like appearance. “And while breast cancer is typically painless, persistent pain can be a sign.”', 'Finally, Ridgeway offered what she would say to encourage a woman who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. “We will be there to walk you through it every step of the way,” she said. “A diagnosis of breast cancer is not a death sentence. With the advances in imaging we are identifying areas of concern at an earlier stage, so the overall mortality rate is improving. The many advances in systematic treatments also improve morbidity and mortality.”', 'Additional support can be found through the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center monthly Zoom meeting, moderated by providers with expertise in the psychological experience of people going through breast cancer. The virtual meeting is held on the third Tuesday of every month from noon to 1 p.m. For more information visit https://hollingscancercenter.musc.edu/patient-care/patient-resources/support-groups', '', 'Receive Moultrie News promotions directly to your inbox!', '', '', 'By submitting this form, you are consenting to receive marketing emails from: The Post and Courier, 148 Williman Street, Charleston, SC, 29403, US, https://www.postandcourier.com.

A closer look at molecular breast imaging: The benefits for dense breast tissue,https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/closer-look-at-molecular-breast-imaging,"['Women with dense breast tissue have access to a reliable new breast cancer screening called molecular breast imaging (MBI).', 'This breakthrough technology was developed at Mayo Clinic and is available at Mayo Clinic locations and Mayo Clinic Health System locations in La Crosse and Eau Claire, Wisconsin.', 'MBI is a fundamentally different approach to breast imaging than mammography.', '3D mammography detects slightly more cancers than standard 2D mammography. MBI is significantly better than either type of mammography at detecting breast cancer in women with dense breast tissue.', 'During a 3D mammogram, individual images are captured by X-ray and combined to simulate ""slices"" of breast tissue.', 'MBI, on the other hand, is a type of functional imaging that uses a special gamma camera to create an image of the breast based on cell activity in the tissue. The images created show differences in the activity of the breast tissue.', 'During MBI, a small amount of a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer attaches to breast cancer cells that the gamma camera can then detect. MBI identifies tumors based on molecular activity, and areas that absorb more tracer appear as bright spots on the images.', 'MBI provides the most significant benefit for women with dense breasts. Breast tissue is made up of milk glands, milk ducts, fatty tissue and supportive, or dense, breast tissue. Women with dense breasts have more supportive breast tissue than fatty tissue.', 'As the density of breast tissue increases, the ability to detect breast cancer with screening mammography becomes more challenging. Both dense breast tissue and cancer appear white on a mammogram, which can make it more challenging to detect whether there is breast cancer in the images.', 'However, breast density has minimal effect on the detection of breast cancer with MBI screening.', 'Healthcare professionals may request MBI to help evaluate a breast lump, review an unusual area detected on a mammogram or recommend if other imaging tests produce inconclusive results.', 'Studies show that combining molecular breast imaging and a mammogram leads to finding three times more breast cancers than a mammogram alone.', 'MBI imaging does a better job of distinguishing between dense tissue, benign tumors and cancerous tissue. MBI also has fewer false positives for breast cancer.', 'Molecular breast imaging is a safe procedure and received Food and Drug Administration clearance over two decades ago in 1999.', ""The level of radiation exposure during an MBI is comparable to that from a mammogram. It's also less than the natural radiation the body absorbs from the environment annually."", 'MBI does not replace, but is supplementary to, screening mammography for early breast cancer detection.', 'For women with dense breasts, the current recommendation is to use 3D mammography and MBI screening together.', ""At the start of the MBI test, you'll receive an injection of the radioactive tracer into a vein in your arm. Fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells, will quickly absorb the tracer. "", 'Two small gamma cameras in the molecular breast imaging system detect gamma rays that the tracer emits. ', 'The breast is placed on top of one gamma camera, and the second gamma camera is lowered on top of it just enough to hold it in place during the test.', ""The gamma cameras record the tracer's activity for 10 minutes, and then the breast is repositioned for a second image. If you are having both breasts imaged, the process is repeated. Two images are created of each breast, and each image takes about 10 minutes."", 'If you are told you have dense breasts, as 50% of women do, talk with your healthcare team about breast cancer screening options, including 3D mammography and molecular breast imaging.', 'Next steps:', 'Cameron Leitch, M.D., is a radiologist in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.', '', '', '', '', '']"

"Breast density increases breast cancer risk, according to health experts",https://www.yahoo.com/news/breast-density-increases-breast-cancer-182938923.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'AUSTIN (KXAN) — Experts say, based on recent studies, denser breasts are more at risk of developing breast cancer.', 'Breast density not only makes your risk of developing breast cancer higher, but it also makes it difficult for medical professionals to read and see cancer in your mammograms.', 'Dr. Rebecca Wiatrek, a surgical oncologist with Texas Oncology and St. David’s Medical Center said, it is important to understand how different breast size is in comparison to breast density and the different stages of breast density.', 'Breast density is determined by the amount of breast cells in the breast as opposed to the fat cells found in breasts, according to Wiatrek.', '“You may have a smaller, compact breast or a larger breast that has a lot of extra breast cells in it. When we look at breast and we can see it really clearly on a mammogram, you may have a patient that’s mostly fatty replaced so the density that we see, which is their Fibro glandular tissue, is minimal,” Wiatrek said.', 'There are four stages of breast density. They range from breasts with mostly fat to breasts with less fat and more density.', 'Stage one: Experts consider stage one breasts as breasts that consist of mostly fatty tissue.', 'Stage two: Experts consider stage two breasts as breasts with scattered fibro glandular tissue.', 'Stage three: Experts consider stage three breasts as breasts with more dense breast tissue. This stage is called heterogeneously dense, meaning there are pockets that are denser than others.', 'Stage four: Experts consider stage four as extremely dense breasts. This breast type is harder to actually see in mammograms, this type of density masks cancer underneath it.', '“When you have a really dense breast number one, it’s hard to compress it, so it’s harder to see on mammogram. It’s also a little harder to see through that to see any sort of cancers or atypical lesions,” Wiatrek said.', 'Experts once believed the reason for the increased risk was the masking component that happens when breasts are examined through mammograms but, newer studies show that it has to do with the amount of cells in the breasts that have the propensity to turn into breast cancer.', '“We don’t exactly know why a dense breast may be more likely to have or develop a breast cancer, we’re still trying to figure that out, but we do know it increases the patient’s risk based on the most recent studies,” said Wiatrek.', 'As of Sept. 10, the Food and Drug Administration issued a rule to update the mammography regulations under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. This new rule requires health care providers to provide patients with information such as breast density.', '“For a patient that is doing self exams, dense breast tissue does feel different than a fatty replaced breast, and can sometimes feel like you have a masses in your breast, but it’s actually dense breast tissue the first exam you have with your gynecologist, or that they should be able to tell you and give you a comparison on that, but the standard of knowing how dense it is is going to be a mammogram,” said Wiatrek.', 'Mammograms and breast screening can help detect cancer early and help doctors better understand the best type of care a patient needs.', 'Experts recommend starting mammogram screenings at age 40, unless they are in a different risk category. Clinical exams and screenings should start at age 25 and up unless otherwise recommended by your doctor.', '“The gynecologists that women are seeing are great at knowing what those recommendations are and make sure that you don’t miss a baseline screening,” Wiatrek said.', 'Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
