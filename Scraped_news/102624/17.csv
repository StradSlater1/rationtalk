Starmer says he wants to ‘look forward’ and not talk about slavery reparations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/keir-starmer-slavery-reparations-commonwealth-summit,"['UK prime minister would rather work with nations on ‘future-facing challenges’ at Commonwealth summit', 'Keir Starmer has insisted he wants to “look forward” rather than have “very long endless discussions about reparations on the past” in his first comments on the issue before the Commonwealth summit.', 'The prime minister is under pressure to discuss reparatory justice with Commonwealth countries, most of which are former UK colonies, in Samoa this week.', 'Speaking to reporters travelling with him for the summit, Starmer said Commonwealth countries were “facing real challenges on things like climate in the here and now”.', '“That’s where I’m going to put my focus, rather than what will end up being very, very long, endless discussions about reparations on the past,” he said. “This is about stance, really, looking forward rather than looking backwards.', '“Slavery is abhorrent … there’s no question about that. But I think from my point of view and taking the approach I’ve just taken, I’d rather roll up my sleeves and work with them on the current future-facing challenges than spend a lot of time on the past.”', 'Caricom, a group of 15 Caribbean countries, has indicated it will push Starmer and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, on the issue at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Samoa.', 'In 2018 Lammy, then a backbench Labour MP, called for reparations to be paid to Caribbean nations. But in government Labour has ruled out apologising over Britain’s role in transatlantic slavery.', 'Starmer said the focus of the summit should be “growth and trade” between Commonwealth countries.', 'The government also announced a new UK trade centre of expertise based in the Foreign Office, which will advise developing countries on competing in global markets and connect them with UK businesses.', 'The trade centre is intended to boost economic ties with the Commonwealth. Six members – Bangladesh, Guyana, India, Mozambique, Rwanda and Uganda – are projected to be among the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world by 2027. The combined GDP of the Commonwealth is expected to exceed $19.5tn in the next three years.', 'Starmer’s comments on reparations prompted criticism from historians and campaigners who said they showed a lack of leadership and a fundamental misunderstanding about what leaders in the global south had been calling for.', 'Eric Phillips, the chair of the Guyana Reparations Committee, said: “I just don’t understand the relevance of the Commonwealth if PM Starmer takes this cruel approach.”', 'Sign up to The Long Wave', 'Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world', '', 'He argued it had been slavery that underpinned, nurtured and rewarded “the rampant capitalism that has today created the climate change crisis”, adding: “Britain … wants to trade with Commonwealth countries now that Brexit has hurt its economy. The trading principles are purely capitalistic and against the interest of former colonies. No reparations, no trade should be the new motto of countries that seek reparations.”', 'Liliane Umubyeyi, the director of African Futures Lab, said: “Heads of states like the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, have been saying that the demands for reparations don’t concern only what happened in the past, they concern contemporary conditions of inequality.”', 'Prof Verene A Shepherd, of the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination and director of the Centre for Reparation Research at the University of the West Indies, described Starmer’s remarks as dismissive.', 'She said they “will not make the campaign go away, and I hope that those who continue to be affected by the legacies of British colonialism will tell him so when they see him at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting”.', 'The veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said: “It is disappointing that the PM has been so dismissive of the opportunity to debate reparations … the descendants of slaves live with the consequences of the transatlantic slave trade in the here and now.”']"
Singling Britain out for reparation demands perpetrates a historical scam,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/26/singling-britain-out-for-reparation-demands/,"['Those demanding reparations base their case on a narrative that is not merely one-sided but caricature of the past', 'It is hard to know where to begin on the subject of slavery reparations, or “reparatory justice” as it is now euphemistically called.  ', 'The simple approach would be to dismiss it as a transparent attempt to extort a vast amount of money from a Britain seen as gullible. The absurd amount of money being demanded – equal to several years’ total GDP – shows that those making the claim are not really serious.  They are presumably hoping that a future British government might feel it gets off lightly by only paying out a few hundred million.  ', 'Those demanding reparations – mainly certain Caribbean governments and Sir Hilary Beckles, their spokesman, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies, and the chairman of the Caricom Reparations Commission – base their case on vague and contentious assertions (including continuing ‘psychological trauma’), and a historical narrative that is not merely one-sided but caricatural.  ', 'The reparations campaign has the further bonus of excusing Caribbean politicians for incompetence and corruption by blaming everything on Britain.  This annoys those reformers in the Caribbean who want good and honest government.   ', 'The basis of reparations is simple justice. If damage is done, those responsible for the damage should repair it, to restore the situation as it was before.  This is both impossible and undesirable.  ', 'Although one of the Caricom commission demands is for a repatriation programme to Africa, this seems unlikely to have many takers, considering the superior economic, social and educational levels in Caribbean countries compared with their African “homeland”.  Barbados, from where Beckles hails, has, according to the IMF, over 25 times the average income of Nigeria, despite what he calls the “colonial mess” left in the Caribbean.  ', 'As both the perpetrators and the victims of slavery are long dead, the reparations demand is broadened out into two main areas.  First, that Britain’s wealth today is based on 18th century slavery, and that the contrasting poverty of some other countries stems from that same exploitation.  ', 'Second, that the distant descendants of slaves still suffer psychological consequences and continue to be damaged by systemic racism, said to have been created by the slave trade.  ', 'Such assertions are not, in principle, impossible.  An American study suggests that the Norman Conquest might still be a cause of inequality in England, in so far as people with French-sounding names are better off than those with English-sounding names. As of post-Conquest serfdom, there could be lingering consequences of the slave system.  ', 'However, those demanding reparations are not interested in a careful and honest assessment.  Their preference is for untestable dogmatic assertions, and angrily dismiss evidence that does not support their claims.  ', 'First, the idea that the wealth of Britain and the developed world was and somehow still is derived from slavery has long been discounted by serious economic analysis.  But even if it were true, the whole world, including today’s descendants of slaves, benefitted from the huge rise in living standards that began in the 18th century.  Second, the accusation that Britain is systemically racist has been repeatedly disproved, including by a comparative EU study that showed Britain as Europe’s least racist country.  ', 'Pitfalls of reparations are seen in the Church of England’s ill-judged attempt to lead the way and push others into following.  The Church Commission earmarked £100 million for reparations, and wants other institutions to make it up to a billion.  The Commission at first stated that it possessed a large ‘pool of capital’ earned from the slave trade and hence ‘tainted’ and suitable for reparations.  ', 'It later emerged that no such “pool of capital” from slavery existed. But the decision had already been made and would be highly embarrassing to reverse.  ', 'As for the “victims” to be compensated, they appear to be drawn primarily from the black middle class, who include the descendants of slaves, of slave owners, of slave traders, and of people with no connection with slavery at all.  To call this policy incoherent is generous.  But it will undoubtedly be used to put moral pressure on other institutions.  ', 'Those demanding reparations invariably call on Britain to “face up to its past” and apologise. William Pitt the Younger, as Prime Minister, did apologise in Parliament as long ago as 1792, calling for “atonement for our long and cruel injustice” towards Africans.  ', 'Atonement was not just words but actions: abolishing the slave trade and then slavery, constantly pressing other governments and indigenous rulers to end slave trading, sending the navy to intercept slave ships round the globe, and exerting constant diplomatic and even military efforts to curtail the huge slave trade to the Muslim world.  This was ‘facing up to our past’ : a long and cruel injustice followed by a long and unique atonement.  ', 'If there really were a solid case for reparatory justice, most of the world would be liable, including the successors of the many African rulers who made the slave trade possible, and the states that have long persisted in it, some until our own day.  ', 'Slavery may have been a crime against humanity, but it was one in which much of humanity was complicit. Britain was the pioneer abolitionist. To make it the principal target of reparation demands today is cynical opportunism. The Government should say so.  ', 'Robert Tombs is professor emeritus of history at the University of Cambridge']"

Despite or because of this, there has been enough sense of common cause to keep them in the same large tent and sports arena.', 'This was in full knowledge of the history that led them there, and the fact that for many it included slavery. It is far from clear why, at this particular moment, it should become the defining point of these relationships, except in order to sustain a fashionable demand for impossible sums of money.', 'Advertisement', '', 'The answer may lie in the fact that all three candidates to become next Secretary General of the Commonwealth – from Ghana, Lesotho and Gambia – are campaigning to make reparations the big issue. If so, future relationships will be fraught and built around division rather than the rather remarkable spirit of unity which has prevailed.', 'Rejecting the reparations demand does not equate to a denial of history; only the means of recognising it, which are many and varied.

Why the call for slavery reparations is a scam,https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-the-call-for-slavery-reparations-is-a-scam/,"['', '', 'It would be a shame if Britain were forced to leave the Commonwealth, given the great work it has done over the decades – especially under the guardianship of the late Queen. But our departure is swiftly going to emerge as an option if grasping Caribbean governments continue with their threat to ambush Keir Starmer at the Commonwealth summit in Samoa and press for reparations for slavery. This is an issue which is not going to go away among Commonwealth countries, given that all three of the candidates to replace Baroness Scotland as the organisation’s Secretary General appear to be in favour of pressing for billions of pounds in ‘reparatory justice’.       ', 'So far, Starmer has been blunt in his rejection of the demands, saying that he would rather talk about the problems facing the world now than try to put right things which happened 200 years ago. It may well be that he is holding his foreign secretary at bay over the issue, given that David Lammy has previously spoken in favour.', 'If the government of the Bahamas feels short of cash, it could always raise its taxes', 'But the Prime Minister needs to go further and make the case for the utter intellectual feebleness of the campaign for slavery reparations. He will need to do so because of the creeping efforts on the Left to try to make reparations an inevitability.', 'Starmer certainly can’t look to the BBC for a balanced debate on this, after this morning’s Today programme, which featured the foreign minister of the Bahamas invited to make his case. He was given the prime interview slot on the subject and egged along by the presenter, with no other guests quizzed on it other than several brief questions to Lisa Nandy at the tail end of another interview earlier in the programme. You might have expected the BBC at least to put reparation demands into context, and point out that the £18 trillion suggested by UN judge Patrick Robinson last year is nearly seven times UK GDP in 2023. But sadly that was too much to hope.', 'As has been argued many times before, Britain did not invent slavery – indeed it was endemic within many of the peoples from whom Caribbean slaves were taken. What Britain did do, on the other hand, was to abolish the global slave trade, at considerable cost and risk to the Royal Navy.', 'But the case against reparations doesn’t end there. Obviously slavery was wrong and any victims of modern slavery (such as Uighurs reported to be employed in slave-like conditions in factories in North West China, or unpaid, imprisoned domestic servants who come to light from time to time in Britain and other countries) are due compensation from those who have enslaved them. So, too, you might make a case that the immediate family of slaves are due compensation for having their family members enslaved. But after 200 years you inevitably arrive at a fundamental problem: who is compensating whom? Go back eight generations and we all have 256 direct forbears. Among them, in a growing number of cases, will be both slaves and slave masters – so they will presumably have to compensate themselves. Why stop at transatlantic slaves? Many of us – probably most of us in Britain – will have medieval serfs in our family tree, so do we all get compensation for that?', 'Moreover, for what exactly would you be compensating the descendants of slaves? If you have victims of the transatlantic slave trade among your ancestors you are very likely the citizen of a high or middle-income country – rather than a low-income one as you would likely now be had your ancestors remained in West Africa. You personally, in other words, are better off thanks to the slave trade, even if your distant ancestors suffered deeply.', 'But the Commonwealth countries are not proposing reparations between individuals; what they want is direct financial transfer between the UK and Caribbean governments. But this is an even more problematic concept, not least because Caribbean governments are the successor organisations of the colonial authorities which oversaw the plantations.', 'Should it not be they who are paying compensation to the countries of West Africa from which the slaves are taken? If the foreign minister of the Bahamas ever did get his way and Britain was persuaded to cough up billions, inevitably raised through taxes on UK citizens, my first thought would be right, that’s it: I’m off to live in a tax haven. But that, of course, is exactly what the Bahamas is – which raises another problem. Many UK citizens are themselves descendants of slavery. Why should their pockets be picked in order to help subsidise a tax haven, especially one inhabited by large numbers of white British tax exiles?', 'If the government of the Bahamas feels short of cash, it could always raise its taxes, such as by imposing even a penny of income tax or VAT. But no, how much more attractive to jump on the reparations bandwagon and try to appeal for handouts in compensation for ancient wrongs. And how ironic that many of the countries demanding slavery reparations are themselves quite happy to do business with China, in spite of that country’s record on modern slavery.', 'The whole concept of slavery reparations is a scam – and the UK government should not shy away from saying so.
