Rogan bluntly told Trump it was because he “said a lot of wild shit.” The UFC commentator and comedian-turned-podcaster then said part of Trump’s appeal when he ran for president in 2016 was that he didn’t speak with “bullshit, prepared politician lingo.”', '“One of the beautiful things about you is that you freeball,” Rogan said, calling his impression of President Joe Biden “funny stuff … it’s standup.”', '“You need at least the attitude of a comedian when you’re doing this business,” Trump replied. “This is a very tough business.”', 'Trump said his biggest mistake when he got to the White House as a novice politician was that he “picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked” for his administration. The former president called his former chief of staff John Kelly, who in recent days cast Trump as an authoritarian, a “bully.” He said he thought his former national security adviser John Bolton was an “idiot,” though he said he actually ended up being “great.”', '“He was good in a certain way, he was a nut job,” Trump said. “Any time I had to deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said, ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’”', 'Trump repeated a recent suggestion he made about the prospect of tariffs replacing the income tax, calling tariffs “the most beautiful word.”', 'Lead Art: An attendee holds up a sign as they wait for former President Donald Trump to arrive at a campaign rally at Cherry Capital Airport on Oct. 25, 2024, in Traverse City, Michigan. | Alex Brandon/AP', ""He was three hours late to his own event.

Yes, her own president faces a sour mood from voters, only 36 percent of whom told CNN they approve of the job he’s doing. And yes, Trump is set for his own mega rally at Madison Square Garden on Saturday evening.', 'But inside a pulsing Shell Energy Stadium in Houston, the first presidential candidate in three decades to campaign in Texas in the closing days of a race, Beyoncé and “Texas voter” Willie Nelson — joined by a raucous crowd of 30,000, which a campaign official said was their largest to date — silenced the Democratic bedwetters.', 'And Harris won the day.', 'Trump saw his own liabilities fully exposed in Friday’s twin polls. Harris’ closing message seemed to be breaking through: Trump trailed her by 12 points on who is more honest and trustworthy, in the CNN poll, and by 6 points on who cares about people like you and who will put the country’s interest above their own.', 'As Harris rallied in Houston, Trump found himself running late from a Texas departure where he recorded Joe Rogan’s podcast to a rally in Traverse City. There, his presence was already something of a local faux pas, coming on the same night as The TC Patriot Game — TC West vs. TC Central. The game “combines a focus to honor Veterans, first responders, active-duty military and area heroes who died while serving our country.” Some of his supporters streamed out of his event there before it had even started.', 'One of the big questions about the Harris campaign since the summer has been whether hers is a movement candidacy — a continuation of the Obama era, only interrupted by years of Trump and Biden — or whether her candidacy is better understood as a blip in a larger Republican, Trump-infused era.', 'On Friday, it sure seemed like the former.', 'We ask ourselves every night: Who won the day?

But at a rally Friday evening, Walz leaned into “Scranton Joe’s” remaining popularity in the region, telling the crowd the country owes “a huge debt to Joe Biden,” as he warned about the “dangerous complacency” of Americans who “misremember” what the country was like during Trump’s first term and believe the country can make it through another.', '“Even though we know better, they think the Donald Trump of 2016 is the Donald Trump of 2024,” Walz said. “He is not.”', '“This Donald Trump has called for the termination of the Constitution,” Walz argued.', 'Walz referenced Trump’s former top administration officials warning about what they’ve said are his authoritarian tendencies, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine General John Kelly who recently claimed that Trump admired “Hitler’s generals.”', '“Hitler and his generals were on the other side of this thing, and it was the sons of Minnesota and Pennsylvania that were carrying the stars and stripes that kicked his ass and saved this world from fascism,” Walz said, to cheers.', ""Trump's campaign denies that the former president ever made the comments Kelly has recently recounted. A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment."", 'And, somewhat surprisingly in the Catholic-heavy region, Walz leaned into his closing message for men: abortion rights.

Appeals are likely.', 'By KYLE CHENEY, ZACH MONTELLARO and JOSH GERSTEIN', 'A federal appeals court ruled Friday that votes in federal elections must be received by state officials by the time polls close, striking down a Mississippi law that allowed ballots to arrive after Election Day.', 'The ruling could have sweeping implications for the way many states have administered elections for years, but it’s unclear if the decision — made by three Trump-appointed judges on the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — will apply on Nov. 5 or only in future elections. Likely appeals could also slow the impact. Still, the effect could be enormous if other courts uphold its rationale that long-standing federal law requires all ballots to be received by Election Day.', 'Recognizing the significance of its decision, the panel also left it up to a lower-court judge — who initially sided with Mississippi — to determine when the ruling should take effect. The panel underscored the longstanding legal principle that courts should avoid changing election policies on the eve of the vote.', 'For now, the circuit court’s ruling only applies to Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi — a list that does not include any core presidential battlegrounds but includes a key Senate race. It also tees the issue up for the Supreme Court, where a similar ruling would have a far more dramatic impact.', 'Judge Andrew Oldham wrote in a 22-page opinion, joined by Judges James Ho and Kyle Duncan, that Congress had set one national Election Day and that “text, precedent, and historical practice confirm this ‘day for the election’ is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.”', 'If upheld, the decision would have a significant political effect. Mail-in voting has become increasingly popular, and broadly more Democrats vote via mail than Republicans since former President Donald Trump and his allies began attacking the process in the run-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election. Any decision that results in fewer mail ballots being counted will disproportionately affect Democratic-leaning voters.', 'Most states require that ballots be in the possession of election officials by the time polls close, but 18 states and Washington, D.C. have a grace period. Those states allow for ballots to count as long as they are postmarked by Election Day and received soon after, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The time ranges from a day after in Texas to up to 10 days in Alaska. (Federal law sets different time periods for military and overseas voters.)', 'The ruling Friday came in response to a pair of lawsuits: one brought by the Republican National Committee and the Mississippi Republican Party, and another brought by the Libertarian Party of Mississippi.', 'The RNC celebrated the decision calling it a “major win for election integrity.”', 'A spokesperson for Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, whose office defended the state’s grace period for receipt of absentee ballots, did not immediately commit to challenging the ruling.', 'Lead Art: Mail-in voting has become increasingly popular, and broadly more Democrats vote via mail than Republicans. | Matt Rourke/AP', ""It's deadlocked.

Broadly, ballots are not counted if voters do not follow all the instructions.', 'Earlier this week, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that voters whose mail ballots are rejected are entitled to cast what’s known as a “provisional ballot” at their polling place instead. Provisional ballots are federally required “last chance” ballots that are only counted once election officials confirm that a voter is both eligible to vote and has not already had a ballot counted.', 'Under the state court’s decision, those voters who submit flawed mail ballots still have the chance of participating in this year’s election by going to their polling places and casting provisional ballots that will then be counted after officials rejected their submitted mail ballots.', 'The consequences of that decision could be significant in this swing state. More Democratic voters than Republicans will vote via mail in Pennsylvania this year — so even if voters from both parties faced a similar rejection rate, the raw number of Democrats having their mail ballots deemed invalid will be higher.', 'In a filing with the state Supreme Court Friday, Republicans asked the court to pause its own judgment, pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the court doesn’t stay its own decision, Republicans asked for those provisional ballots to be segregated from the rest of the votes cast.', 'Notably, Republicans’ Friday filing seeks to revive the “independent state legislature” theory. The once-fringe theory argued that state courts have little — to no — authority to question state legislatures on decisions for federal elections.', 'Broadly, a cross-ideological grouping of justices rejected a robust reading of the theory last year. The high court found that state courts still have the power to review election laws under state constitutions, while urging federal courts to “not abandon their own duty to exercise judicial review” and rein in state courts that federal judges deem may have overstepped.', 'The fight here mirrors a last-minute fight, also in Pennsylvania, over mail ballots in 2020. That year, the state Supreme Court ordered ballots that were postmarked by Election Day but received up to three days after polls closed to be counted, citing concerns around the pandemic and the U.S. Postal Service’s delivery challenges. Typically, Pennsylvania ballots must be in the possession of election officials by the time polls close to count.', 'Republicans similarly challenged that order as well. And U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito granted the extraordinary request that those ballots be segregated and counted separately.', 'Ultimately, those ballots were immaterial to the results because President Joe Biden’s margin was larger than the total number of late-arriving ballots.', 'Lead Art: Broadly, ballots are not counted if voters do not follow all the instructions. | Gene J. Puskar/AP', 'The Justice Department says the state has illegally removed American citizens from its voters rolls.', 'ZACH MONTELLARO', 'A federal judge halted Virginia’s efforts to remove at least 1,600 people off the state’s voter rolls, after the federal government and voting rights groups alleged that American citizens were being struck amid an attempt at stopping non-citizens from voting.', 'The court challenges come as Donald Trump and other Republicans claim, without evidence, that large numbers of non-citizens are trying to vote in this year’s election.', 'Non-citizen voting is already illegal and is exceedingly rare. A report from the liberal Brennan Center from the 2016 election estimated 30 incidents of suspected non-citizen voting across 42 jurisdictions that saw a total 23.5 million votes cast.', 'This summer, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, issued an executive order requiring daily updates to the state’s voter list. Individuals who were identified as non-citizens by the state Department of Motor Vehicles were removed from the list of registered voters.', 'The Department of Justice and civil rights groups sued, alleging that Virginia’s processes here violated the federal National Voter Registration Act, which requires a 90-day preelection “quiet period” in which states are not allowed to “systematically” remove voters from the rolls.', 'The lawsuits alleged that Virginia had removed several American citizens from the rolls through Youngkin’s program. The groups said some Virginians were identified as non-citizens because of bureaucratic errors or their own mistakes — like checking the wrong boxes on a form — or had received their citizenship since interacting with the DMV.', 'On Friday, U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the Justice Department and those groups. As expected after a court hearing earlier in the week, she ordered the state to stop the program and restore the voter registration of anyone whose registration was canceled as part of the program after Aug. 7.', 'Her order does not prevent the state from removing names from the rolls based on “individual correction,” but targets the sweeping nature of the program.', 'Youngkin immediately filed an appeal to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. “Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals — who self-identified themselves as noncitizens — back onto the voter rolls,” he said in a statement.', 'Lead Art: Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance listens to Virginia Gov.

We urge you to investigate whether Elon Musk’s cash prizes are prohibited payments for voter registration and take appropriate enforcement action, including prosecution, if his actions prove to be illegal,” the duo wrote.', 'DOJ sent a warning letter to Musk this week amid conflicting opinions within the legal community about whether the giveaways violate the law.', 'ANTHONY ADRAGNA', 'Most Democratic Senate candidates substantially outspent their opponents, new reports show', 'JESSICA PIPER', 'Democratic Senate candidates spent much of the cycle outraising their Republican opponents. Now, they get to outspend them.', 'In nearly all of the most closely watched Senate contests, Democratic candidates outspent their GOP counterparts over the first two weeks of October, according to new campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. In Ohio, Montana and Michigan, the ratio was more than 3-to-1 over the crucial stretch of the election.', 'The cash advantage has been a bright spot for Democrats in an otherwise brutal Senate map this cycle, allowing them to spend heavily as they look to defend a slew of states. And their candidates largely continued to put up strong fundraising numbers, led by Rep. Colin Allred, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas and brought in a whopping $11.3 million in 16 days compared to $9.9 million for Cruz, who was by far the top-raising GOP senator and the only GOP candidate in a race that has attracted significant money to outspend his opponent.', 'The two most endangered Senate Democrats, Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, respectively brought in $9 million and $7.8 million over the same period, compared to $2.3 million and $1.9 million for their Republican challengers. That left the Democratic incumbents with more cash on hand for the final days of the election despite far greater spending over the past few weeks.', 'In three other states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — Democratic Senate candidates similarly raised at least three times as much as their Republican counterparts over the first half of the month.', 'And in Nebraska, independent candidate Dan Osborn raised just over $3 million compared to $560,000 for incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer in a surprisingly competitive race that has attracted last-minute defensive spending from national Republicans.', 'With Democrats’ cash advantage, Republicans have relied heavily on outside groups to boost their candidates across competitive states, including $3 million coming to Fischer’s aid in the past week.

‘A lot of fun’: will Trump’s rambling Joe Rogan interview rally young men?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-joe-rogan-interview-analysis,"['Trump came across as old and unintelligent, but he was politically unscathed by a softball interview', 'In an interview in which Donald Trump said that he wants to be “a whale psychologist”, made the case for replacing income tax with tariffs and praised Confederate general Robert E Lee as a “genius”, the most striking thing about the former president’s encounter with podcaster Joe Rogan wasn’t the content as much as the length.', 'Over three hours, perhaps the longest ever campaign interview with a presidential candidate, Trump said very little that was factual but revealed a surprising amount about his disposition and his thinking should he return to office.', 'The Republican nominee’s appearance on Rogan makes smart political sense. Rogan, a commentator on Ultimate Fighting Championship broadcasts and comedian, began podcasting in 2009 and is now the most successful host in history. The Joe Rogan Experience is continually atop the global charts on both Apple and Spotify, earning almost half a billion dollars from deals with the latter.', 'For months now, the Democrats and their nominee, Kamala Harris, have been polling surprisingly poorly with young men compared with previous election cycles, creating consternation among party insiders. Rogan reaches the kind of politically skeptical young men with low trust in Washington DC – and in the news media that both parties believe could help them reach the White House.', 'That’s why at the start of the week, with polls tightening and Democrats concerned they may be “blowing” the election, the rumours were that it would be Harris who would appear on the podcast. It could have been one of the few media appearances that actually shifts the conversation and could have won over some undecideds. But her team eventually backed out of an appearance, perhaps concerned about the long freewheeling format. So it was announced that it would be Trump who would appear on the show.', 'Rogan’s initial questioning of Trump was inquisitive and unexpected. He asked about what it felt like entering the White House with no political experience. Trump responded honestly, saying it was more surreal than later being shot in the tip of one of his ears. He said that he “had made his money largely on luxury” and that he was amazed by how beautiful it was inside. He talked about the difficulties of transition for a non-politician who had “no experience and no idea who to appoint”. He sympathised with Mary Todd Lincoln’s “melancholia”. It seemed like Rogan’s inquisitive style might get something new from the former president.', 'But very quickly the interview descended into a long, rambling and often boring venture through Trump’s greatest hits. He demonised migrants, spoke warmly about Vladimir Putin and falsely claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Rogan tried to push him on nuclear power and the environment. But Trump only wanted to discuss how ugly he finds windfarms – and how their vibrations upset the whales – and the ways in which environmental regulations would stop him getting permits for his buildings in New York.', 'In May, pollsters for the New York Times/Siena College analysed their data to see what were the key predictors for why a voter who supported Joe Biden when he defeated Trump in 2020 might defect to the Republican against Harris.', 'They found that the No 1 predictor was whether the voter was born in the Middle East, a reflection of the Democrats’ position on the war in Gaza. The No 2 predictor was whether they had a favorable view of Rogan. For some young male voters, he’s their main source of political information.', 'Rogan himself is a political riddle. He’s a conspiracy theorist and an anti-vaxxer and so is often painted as rightwing or Trump-supporting – but he’s actually got a complex and often conflicting set of beliefs. He fiercely defends abortion rights, gay marriage and gun rights. He’s gravitated toward outsider candidates like Bernie Sanders and RFK Jr – he voted for the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in the previous election. In 2022, Rogan described Trump as an “existential threat to democracy”.', 'Harris, who has been struggling to define herself with voters, may have found the relaxed atmosphere helpful – especially as Rogan tends to always agree with what his guests say.', 'He allowed to Trump brazenly lie – about election fraud, the deficit, his tax policy and many other issues – without ever challenging him. He also appeared to agree with him on many positions that he’s previously taken the opposite stance and painted election deniers as an oppressed group, saying: “You get labelled, it’s like being labelled an anti-vaxxer.”', 'Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition', 'The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election', '', 'The pair discussed Rogan’s previous support for RFK Jr, who Trump promised could do “whatever” when it came to health policy in his administration, which placated the podcast host but may concern the mainstream scientific and medical community against whom Kennedy has railed.', 'Rogan had one good moment as an interviewer, asking Trump if he was ever going to “present” his supposed evidence of election tampering. But he let Trump ramble on to a different topic: Hunter Biden’s laptop.', 'Because of this easy ride, Trump came off sounding old, doddering and unintelligent – but politically unscathed. He was allowed to blame all of America’s ills on Democrats and paint himself as a great leader. He attacked Harris, calling her “low IQ” and that she “couldn’t put two sentences together”. She was one of a number of women whom Trump and Rogan dismissed as “stupid”, perhaps with a nod to the young misogynist voters who could be persuaded to vote for the former president.', 'For the most part, Rogan – not the smartest cookie himself – simply nodded along. He finished by saying having Trump on was “a lot of fun”.', 'For anyone else who made it through all three hours, that might have been the biggest lie of all.']"

[+]', 'After days of speculation and regular posts hinting at the conversation from the “Joe Rogan Experience’s” X account, Trump is expected to go on the show, Politico first reported, citing unnamed sources close to the matter.', 'In a July interview with political commentator Michael Malice, Rogan called Harris “the worst” and an unpopular vice president, said he was bothered to see her suddenly viewed as a “hero” and “solution,” wondered if she was medicated with anti-anxiety medications because of “disconnected ramblings,” but still said he thinks she will win the presidency because people think she’s a stronger alternative than Trump.', 'In a September interview with comedian Tom Segura, Rogan said, “whoever’s coaching her, whoever’s the puppet master running the strings” is doing a “f****** amazing job.”', 'In 2022, Rogan said to podcaster Lex Fridman that he’s “not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form” and has “had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once” but said no each time because he doesn’t want to help him, explaining that his show can “revitalize and rehabilitate” their public image in a “shocking way.”', 'The “Joe Rogan Experience” has never hosted Trump on the podcast, and Rogan has been outspoken about the candidate, calling Trump a “polarizing figure” and “existential threat to democracy,” although Rogan — a staunch defender of free speech — has also defended Trump supporters and criticized the internet’s portrayal of Trump.', 'Both candidates have decided to forego traditional media interviews and instead targeted specific—and large—niche audiences through popular podcasts.', 'Rogan, whose podcast is the largest in the U.S., touts a large audience of young men—including a large Black audience—a coveted demographic for both candidates.', 'Harris visited host Alex Cooper on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, routinely ranked as Spotify’s second largest podcast next to Rogan’s and one of the 10 most popular podcasts for women, according to Edison Research. Cooper said the podcast has a “very mixed” political audience and typically does not discuss politics with its celebrity guests like Miley Cyrus or Post Malone. The episode with Harris episode now ranks as one of the most popular podcast episodes on Spotify. Harris also went on the ""All the Smoke” podcast, hosted by former NBA stars in a growing segment of athlete podcasts that discuss sports and lifestyles. ""All the Smoke” has hosted guests like Will Smith and Kobe Bryant and has more than one million followers on YouTube. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Harris’s vice presidential pick — went on the “Smartless” podcast, a high-ranking show hosted by comedians Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes with several hundred thousand followers on Instagram and YouTube. “Smartless” has also hosted President Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, among other Democrats.', 'Trump’s media blitz included the “All In” podcast, a business and technology-focused with more than half a million followers on YouTube; Lex Fridman’s podcast, a high-ranking show with a strong male audience that has hosted Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg for its more than 4 million followers on YouTube; Theo Von’s podcast, which has hosted dozens of comedians and Sen. Bernie Sanders alike for its more than 3 million YouTube followers; YouTuber Logan Paul’s “Impaulsive” podcast, which caters to a male audience in its nearly 5 million YouTube followers by routinely hosting boxers and wrestlers; the “Full Send Podcast” from the YouTube stars called the “Nelk Boys,” who became popular among its nearly all-male audience of 8 million followers on YouTube for prank videos; and the “Flagrant” comedy podcast, which has more than 1 million followers and hosts guests ranging from actor Peter Dinklage to UFC’s Dana White. Trump has also appeared in a Kick.com live-stream for controversial internet personality Adin Ross, which was later posted to his YouTube audience of more than 4 million followers. Most recently, Trump appeared on a podcast hosted by former NFL players called “Bussin’ With The Boys” — owned by digital media company Barstool Sports, which caters to sports and college-culture — which has more than half a million followers on YouTube.', 'PROMOTED', 'Comedian Theo Von — who hosted Trump several weeks ago on his podcast — held a two-hour-long episode with billionaire Mark Cuban, who discussed his support of Harris. Von mentioned in the episode that the Harris campaign reached out for a possible episode.', 'On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Harris’ campaign has been in touch with Rogan’s team, adding another popular podcast to her media blitz in the final days before the election. An interview with Rogan could boost Harris’ campaign as she looks to appeal to more male voters, an identified campaign goal. Trump has said he intends to go on the podcast, revealing last week in an interview with the “Nelk Boys” podcast that he has considered the move. The Twitter account for the “Joe Rogan Experience” has also hinted that Trump may be on the show, posting articles daily about Trump potentially being on the show and asking on X this Sunday if Trump should be a guest. Rogan, who stated he was not politically affiliated with the Republican party, said in early August that he liked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a person and a candidate, although he wasn’t endorsing his presidential bid. In 2020, the podcaster shared his appreciation for Bernie Sanders and later said he would rather vote for Trump than President Joe Biden. He revealed on his show that he voted for libertarian candidate Jo Jorgenson in 2020. Rogan has often been criticized for the conversations he hosts on his show, which often give a platform to far-right commentators and potentially dangerous conspiracy theorists. He has also been criticized for spreading false information during the Covid-19 pandemic and the vaccine.', 'Further Reading', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', '', 'One Community.

Trump’s interview with Von is one of the most viewed in recent months, reaching more than 14 million views on YouTube. This podcast strategy stems from the Trump campaign’s goal to reach undecided or unlikely voters and specifically target young male voters and Black voters.

Trump faced two impeachments toward the end of his term: the first accusing him of soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election and the second alleging Trump incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.', 'Kelly is a ‘Bully,’ Bolton a ‘Whack job’ ', 'When asked whether he hired the wrong White House advisers, Trump said he regretted some of his choices. He named John Kelly as one example, deriding his former chief of staff for being a “bully” and a “weak person.”', 'Earlier this week, the Atlantic published a story alleging that Trump once told Kelly: “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had. People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders.” A spokesperson for Trump denied he ever made the remark.', 'In an interview with the New York Times also published this week, Kelly said he believed his former boss is a “fascist” and a “dictatorial leader” who has no empathy. “Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators—he has said that,” Kelly told the newspaper. “So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.”', 'The reports inspired Vice President Kamala Harris to dedicate a speech likening Trump to Hitler less than two weeks before the November election.', 'Kelly departed the White House in January 2019 amid reports of heated disagreements with Trump, who later claimed he fired his longest-serving chief of staff.', 'Trump also took aim at his former national-security adviser, John Bolton, calling him an “idiot” yet acknowledging he was “great” for the job.', 'During the podcast interview, Trump recalled a phone call with businessman Phil Ruffin, who told the former president to not pick Bolton to serve in the White House because “he’s a bad guy” and “it always works out bad with that guy.” Trump then quipped, “I wish you told me this two weeks ago. I already hired him. He’s here.” Trump noted Ruffin was correct in his assessment of Bolton.', '“But he was good in a certain way. He’s a nut job,” Trump said of Bolton. “And every time I had to deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’”', 'Asked about Kelly’s comments earlier this week, Bolton argued Trump is incapable of governing as a fascist.', '“I think his behavior alone is troubling enough,” Bolton told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. “To be a fascist, you have to have a philosophy. Trump’s not capable of that.”', '“I’m not trying to understate the dangers of a Trump presidency. I think it’s important to focus on the dangers themselves.”', 'Trump the ‘Whale Psychiatrist’', 'Trump and Rogan dedicated a significant portion of the interview to environmental issues, one policy area where they showed slight disagreement.', 'Start your mornings with expert political insights from NR’s Jim Geraghty.', 'Asked why progressives oppose fracking and the development of other natural resources in the U.S., Trump explained that there’s a cottage industry of environmentalists and lawyers who make a living by obstructing development and weighing down the economy.', '“But there are legitimate concerns about environmental impact, correct?” Rogan interjected.', '“Sure,” Trump conceded, insisting on the importance of clean air and clean water while pointing out that the U.S. is sacrificing its economic vitality in the name of the environment while China and other major polluters are still relying heavily on coal.', 'Rogan and Trump returned to shared territory with the mention of wind energy, which both men argued was inefficient and actively harmful to the environment.', 'The mixed martial arts commentator raised the subject of wind farms, which he referred to as “pollution,” and the impact they’ve had on whale and bird populations off the East Coast.', '“I think windmills are really disruptive. When you talk about the environment, they kill the birds,” Trump said. “You want to see a bird cemetery, go under a windmill someday that hasn’t been cleaned out with all the bird carcasses.”', '“The whales are washing up on shore,” he continued. At least 18 whales were found dead along the East Coast since December 1, 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported in February 2023.', 'Moreover, consortium researchers recently confirmed that five North Atlantic right whales have died so far this year and four calves are presumed dead. The right whale species is considered critically endangered, given there are approximately 370 left.', 'Trump vowed in May to eliminate offshore wind power on “day one” of a potential second term, again claiming the floating wind turbines are killing whales and birds.', 'There is no evidence yet directly linking whale deaths to the construction and operations of offshore wind farms. However, the marine mammals are affected over time. According to a University of Maryland study, whales can be harmed by the low-frequency sounds and vibrations of pile-driving turbines into the ocean floor.', '“They say that the wind drives ’em crazy. You know it’s a vibration because you have those things that 50-story building,” Trump said of the whales. “The wind is rushing. The things are blowing. It’s a vibration and it makes noise.”', '“I wanna be a whale psychiatrist. It drives the whales fricking crazy. And something happens with them, but for whatever reason, they’re getting washed up onshore and you know, they’re ignored by these environmentalists. But they don’t talk about it.”', 'About two weeks ago, Trump described Democrats and those who have opposed or investigated him as the “enemy from within.” Referring to domestic foes, the term prompted criticism from Harris, comedian Jon Stewart, and the mainstream media who have all pushed the narrative that Trump is a “fascist” for his rhetoric. The former president doubled down on the remark.', '“We had no problem with [North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un],” Trump told Rogan. “We have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within, and it drives them crazy when I use that term.”', '“We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful,” the GOP presidential nominee added, citing the border crisis as an example of how the U.S. is being undermined within the federal government.', '“When other countries are allowed to enter their prisons into our country with murderers — we had 13,099 murderers dropped into our country over the last three years,” he said. Trump labeled illegal immigrants pouring into the U.S. under the Biden administration as “rapists, drug dealers, drug lords, terrorists, people from mental institutions.”', 'Rogan then brought up recent news reports of Tren de Aragua gang members taking over apartment buildings in San Antonio, Texas, and Aurora, Colo. Trump said that is “just the beginning,” suggesting the illegal activity would continue if Harris becomes president.', 'Life on Mars', 'Rogan predictably used the opportunity of interviewing a former president to learn more about one of his favorite topics: extraterrestrial life.', 'Trump was eager to indulge Rogan’s curiosity, telling the host that he learned “a lot” of top secret information about the emergence of UFO’s and the possibility of alien existence during his time in the White House, although he said it’s not a big interest for him.', '“I’ve never been a believer,” Trump said of alien life.', ""“I interviewed jet pilots, solid people,” Trump said, “and they said, ‘We saw things, sir, that were very strange.'”"", 'In recent years, the Pentagon has made public reports filed by several Air Force pilots who say they encountered flying objects during missions that defied the known laws of physics. The Pentagon has not taken an official position on what those objects might be, and theories range from genuine extraterrestrial craft to military technology developed by a rival power.', 'Asked whether he believed in aliens, Trump said he was open to the possibility.', '“There’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life,” Trump said. When Rogan pointed out that research on Mars has produced no evidence of alien life, Trump responded, “Maybe it’s another form of life we don’t know about.”', 'Send a tip to the news team at NR.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2024 National Review', 'Newsletters', '']"

Harris has discussed appearing on the “Joe Rogan Experience,” according to Reuters. Rogan’s show—known for its long and often meandering interviews—regularly ranks as the most listened-to podcast in the U.S. The host said in 2022 that he would refuse to have Trump on his podcast because an interview might help Trump by “revitalizing and rehabilitating” his public image in a “shocking way.” Rogan also admitted in 2020 that he refused to vote for both President Joe Biden and Trump, and Rogan has been critical of Trump and Harris. However, he predicts Harris will win in November, and he has criticized the internet’s relationship with Trump, saying it suppresses positive stories.', 'Each week has brought a slew of new episodes and quotes from Trump, including an episode with the “PBD podcast,” where Trump continued to mock Harris’ race, a now-routine ploy from the Republican. The podcasts also reveal Trump’s relationship with fighting and boxing: many of the podcast hosts interviewing Trump are friendly with UFC’s CEO Dana White (including Trump himself), Hulk Hogan spoke at the Republican National Convention in July and Trump famously shaved WWE Founder Vince McMahon’s head in an WrestleMania event in 2007. Trump also said his son Barron has contributed to finding who the “hot” celebrities are, pointing to the hosts of “Bussin with the Boys” during his interview with the former NFL players. Another potential guide in Trump’s decisions, as Vanity Fair reported, is 18-year-old Bo Loudon, a patron of Trump’s famous Florida club Mar-a-Lago and self-described “pro-Trump influencer,” who is attributed with helping Trump navigate the extent of internet celebrities. Vanity Fair reports that Trump’s interview with Adin Ross was Loudon’s “brainchild.”', '20%. That’s the share of likely voters who say they have watched one of the Trump podcast episodes, according to figures from a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Oct. 23. Another notable polling figure: More than half of voters said Trump’s podcast interviews made them “more likely” or made “no difference” on their decision. In contrast, about 27% of voters said they have watched one of Harris’ appearances on podcasts. But for those who have watched, about 50% of all voters said it made them less likely to vote for her. Meanwhile, radio host Charlemagne The God — who hosted Harris for a conversation — said on his podcast “Brilliant Idiots” Schulz’s interview helped Trump’s chances of winning.', 'Podcast appearances have become a key part of both Trump and Harris’ media strategy in the election’s closing weeks, even as Trump eschews interviews with CNBC and CBS’ “60 Minutes.” These podcasts can reach millions, and may reach a more specific audience—often centering on younger male fans who may be less likely to vote—compared to the mainstream appeal of traditional media outlets. “Engaging with podcasters, comedians and influencers allows people to see that human side of President Trump that the mainstream media deliberately won’t cover,” Alex Bruesewitz, a campaign advisor on Trump’s team, told Forbes over email. Many of Trump’s podcast interviews also allow him to share his talking points regarding the border, tariffs or the state of the U.S.—and tell personal anecdotes—without journalistic follow-up questions. Trump’s campaign also is hoping to target a demographic of younger male voters, identifying the segment as “critical” to Trump’s chances because of the predicted loyal base of young women voting for Harris, according to Politico. Harris has also decided to pursue podcasts in her campaign, although on a less frequent basis, by only interviewing with two podcasts that are immensely popular to the voter bases she’s hoping to reach. Harris appeared with host Alex Cooper on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, Spotify’s second-largest podcast, on Oct. 6, and she went on the ""All the Smoke” podcast, a popular sports podcast hosted by former NBA stars, on Sept. 30.', 'Harris’ campaign has posted excerpts from Trump’s podcast interview on its X account, often mocking his comments. After Trump’s “Bussin with the Boys” episode, Harris’ account posted the controversial moment in which Trump explained why he didn’t like football. The account also posted the clip from the “Flagrant” podcast of Schulz laughing at Trump for saying he’s “basically a truthful person.” In contrast to the wrestlers supporting Trump, actor and wrestler Dave Bautista acted in an ad on Oct. 17, calling Trump “whiny” and string of comedic insults.', '', 'One Community.
