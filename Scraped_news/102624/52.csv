Without further ado, let’s dig in to the TNF fantasy preview!', 'The Tennessee Titans are trading veteran receiver DeAndre Hopkins to the Kansas City Chiefs.', 'This trade could greatly impact both sides. For the Titans, it’s a downgrade for whom is playing quarterback. Hopkins had 17% of the total receiving yards for the Titans per Fantasy Points Date Suite. It will give a fantasy boost to Tyler Boyd (now a risky flex option for our lineups). Fantasy managers who have been upset by Calvin Ridley will hopefully rejoice, as Ridley should continue to see a high target share without Hopkins on the field. We won’t want to rely on any of the Titan’s passing game for fantasy success.', 'Patrick Mahomes is averaging a career-low 31 pass attempts in 2024 per Pro Football Reference. Sadly, Hopkins isn’t joining a pass-happy Chiefs offense we’ve known in years past, but he is a reliable pass catcher with strong hands for the football in contested situations. Hopkins’ arrival is unlikely to boost Mahomes into an elite fantasy producer once again. However, it should aid Travis Kelce and Xavier Worthy to have another player that opposing defenses have to game plan for. I wouldn’t expect a significant bump to their weekly fantasy value.', 'Hopkins joining the Chiefs is likely better for NFL football than fantasy football. He is still a potential flex option in fantasy. The important question is where will Hopkins line up for the Cheifs? Chief’s slot WRs averaged15.1 FPPG this season. In the past 3 seasons, Hopkins ran 16.27% of his routes from the slot. Hopkins isn’t much of a YAC receiver as since 2018, he has averaged 263 yards per season (PFR), and this year, he has 7 yards after the catch. This season, Hopkins is ranked 106th vs. Man and 63rd vs. Zone in average separation score (FPDS).', 'If you don’t require a flex wide receiver’s services, I’d look to sell high on DeAndre Hopkins for a 2025 (or 2026) 2nd round pick.', 'If you’re looking for more advice on how to traverse the new fantasy landscape after the recent trades of Amari Cooper and Davante Adams, be sure to check out Senior Nerd Mychal Warno‘s Dynasty Trade Advice for Week 8:', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The Titans are eating $2.5M of his salary to make the deal work.', 'Chiefs fantasy impact: The Chiefs WR situation has taken an ugly turn of late, so Hopkins is a very welcomed edition. In his immediate reaction piece—Ian said he now offers “WR3 upside with the potential for WR2 spike weeks”—which sounds about right to me. This also kills whatever production JuJu Smith-Schuster managers had been counting on of late.', 'Titans fantasy impact: On the other side, Calvin Ridley was already getting as much work as he could handle (he leads the league in unrealized air yards) and will continue to deal with horrendous QB play.

In Week 1 with Tagovailoa, Hill did his usual thing with 26 fantasy points, but since then, he has averaged only 7.4 with finishes of WR46, WR48, WR46, WR26, and WR66.', ""Oddsmakers are also on board with a quick bounceback–Miami has the fifth-highest team total (26 points). From a Pick'em perspective, Hill's receiving yardage is 87.5 yards on Underdog in a quality matchup against a Cardinals' defense, allowing the fifth-most receiving yards per game (247)."", 'Hill UPGRADES to high-end WR1 status if Tagovailoa plays. I have Hill No. 3 in my WR ranks.', 'We only saw Kupp for ~1.5 games before a high-ankle sprain knocked him out of action. However, in that small sample, he looked as Cooper Kupp as ever, with a blistering 36% target share and 41% air yards share. In Week 1, he had a near-perfect 9.9 Utilization Score!', ""Like Hill, Kupp wastes zero time zooming back up the rankings. However, we need a little more caution, given it is his first game back from injury. The Rams could limit his workload as part of a ramp-up plan, and/or Kupp might not be as effective if he isn't 100% yet."", 'Of course, we also have some trade rumors swirling around the uber-productive slot WR. If the Rams are serious about a trade, that could be another excuse for not fully unleashing Kupp. While those factors keep me from pushing Kupp as high as Hill in the ranks, it is almost impossible to keep him out of the top 10.', ""The Vikings allow the sixth-most passing yards per game. While some of that is due to their leading game scripts, Minnesota doesn't have a shutdown defender they can depend on to lock up Kupp. Even if they did, Kupp is the most matchup-proof WR in the NFL. Sean McVay knows how to protect his No. 1 target with motion at the snap and favorable alignments."", 'Note: Puka Nacua is listed as questionable for Thursday night.', 'Kupp UPGRADES to mid-range WR1 status.', ""Kamara registered his lowest Utilization Score (6.8) of the season last week against the Broncos. He had a 58% snap share and only handled 39% of the rushing attempts, with Kendre Miller soaking up 33%. The issue wasn't quarantined to late-game snaps, either. Kamara accounted for only 55% of the rushing attempts in the first half after averaging 70% over the previous five contests."", ""Kamara isn't going away, but Miller could help lighten the load, and that is enough to move him down the ranks with a tough matchup against the Chargers on tap. The Bolts have allowed only 95 yards per game on the ground. On a positive note, they play the second-most zone coverage, which could lead to more looks in the passing game."", 'The Saints carry the second-lowest team total (15.8) on the slate.', 'Kamara DOWNGRADES to mid-range RB2 status.', 'I want to throw in a few names for all my fellow fantasy managers that are in a SICKO league.

The Chiefs, after all, plan to play him Sunday in Las Vegas, which puts some urgency on this three-day window.', 'Hopkins made an impression before he even uttered a word.', 'With a handshake.', '“I have pretty big hands, and he like swallowed my hands,” Nagy said. “He has massive hands.', '“There’s a reason why he’s catching these footballs.”', 'It’s a lighthearted observation, but there’s some particular relevance to it. Hopkins is known for his large catch radius and low drop-rate, notable qualities for a Chiefs offense that possesses neither.', 'At the top, the Hopkins acquisition is a low-risk move for a team in need of some help after losing Rashee Rice and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown — and even one of their replacements, JuJu Smith-Schuster — to injuries.', 'Why not take a short-term flier and see what Hopkins can still provide at age 32?', 'But let’s make something clear: Hopkins is not a replacement for something the Chiefs have lost to injury. He is not the missing piece to the typical Andy Reid offensive puzzle. He replaces what they have rarely sought during Patrick Mahomes’ tenure. He comprises a different puzzle altogether.', 'The catch radius.', 'And, more specifically, a contested-catch wide receiver.', 'Hopkins is no longer an elite separator, even if he is adept at knowing how to operate in zones. But he can pull down some catches in traffic.', 'He has 93 contested receptions in his career, per PFF data, and in his prime caught 25 in one year. Spotting coverage near him is not always a reason to look for another option. He is sometimes still the best option.', 'But it’s one the Chiefs virtually never use.', 'Which makes this marriage — Hopkins and a Chiefs offense coached by Reid and quarterbacked by Mahomes — an unusual fit. And that’s meant to be taken literally — as in, Hopkins isn’t the Chiefs’ prototype at the position.', 'Here’s what I mean: In every year of his career, Mahomes has ranked among the bottom-three in the NFL in percentage of tight-window throws, per Next Gen Stats ... and he’s taken that to the extreme this year.', 'Only 7% of his throws have been labeled “aggressive,” or those made when the receiver has minimal or no separation — the lowest such number of his career, and half the league average for tight-window throws. He’d rather throw to the open guys than take a risk.', 'You could spin that two ways: that the Chiefs are unwilling to throw the very passes on which Hopkins has thrived in his career — and particularly its later stages; or that the Chiefs just haven’t had the type of receiver to justify taking those kinds of chances.', 'Yes.', 'And yes.', 'It’s both.', 'Which is what makes this acquisition so intriguing. Experimental, almost.', 'If the Chiefs are to gain the maximum value from their trade, Mahomes will need to adapt his willingness to make throws into tight windows, because it’s a spot where Hopkins can excel. He finished 13th in the NFL in tight-window receptions as a 31-year-old in 2023.', 'Mahomes’ willingness, logically, could increase with the change in personnel. Maybe. We’ll see. But Sammy Watkins had eight contested catches in 2019, and while that’s just one-third of Hopkins’ career best, no KC receiver has topped that number since.', 'The most memorable pass Mahomes has thrown this season came in Los Angeles, a 62.2-yard flight to Xavier Worthy for a touchdown. There was a notable backstory to that play — Mahomes’ adopting his “(bleep) it” attitude ahead of that particular throw.', 'With all the focus on that pass, there’s an element we sort of glossed over: It was a contested catch.', 'It’s also the only contested catch the Chiefs have been credited with all season.', 'They are, quite unsurprisingly, dead last in the NFL in contested catches, from a quarterback who offers his receivers fewer opportunities than anyone. In fact, every other team has at least one player with at least three. The Jets have been credited with 24 such catches.', 'Twenty-four to 1.', 'The Chiefs have a need for a receiver with Hopkins’ skill-set, but that’s been true for awhile. They hadn’t exactly seemed in a hurry to acquire it, instead returning to the likes of Mecole Hardman when they have a roster spot.', 'So, yes, they have a use for it. But will they use it?', '“I think in my time, we’ve had receivers that can make some of those contested catches, and once you build that relationship and build that trust, you put them up there and let guys go out there and make plays,” Mahomes said when I asked him vaguely about this on Wednesday, hours before the trade became official.', '“I think that’s what’s special about Coach Reid’s offense — it adapts to whoever’s in there.”', 'There’s more to the story, of course.', 'Hopkins, as Reid described, has a “very good understanding of how to work in space.”', 'And if you couple that with the extended catch radius, you’ve got a good fit on the opposite side of the formation as tight end Travis Kelce. He’s sure-handed, with a drop rate that’s half of what Mahomes has been working with over the past six seasons.', 'Those are attractive traits. Hopkins is a Hall of Fame-caliber receiver, and even if he isn’t what he was five years ago, the cost isn’t what it was five years ago, either. That’s attractive, too.

Can DeAndre Hopkins reverse Chiefs' trend of poor midseason WR trades?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/can-deandre-hopkins-reverse-chiefs-trend-poor-midseason-wr-trades,"['The Kansas City Chiefs have found their new WR1 for what feels like the fifth time in a year.', 'With Kansas City trading for DeAndre Hopkins, Patrick Mahomes will look to get the most out of the 32-year-old wideout. The deal, which will send a conditional fourth-round pick to the Titans, follows injuries to Chiefs receivers Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice and JuJu Smith-Schuster.', ""Hopkins was on the final year of his contract with the Titans, who, per multiple reports, took on roughly half of the receiver's $5.05 million base salary to accommodate the Chiefs' cap limitations. Hopkins was off to a slow start with the 1-5 Titans, with 15 catches for 173 yards and a touchdown."", ""This is the third straight year in which the Chiefs have traded for a receiver midseason. It was Kadarius Toney in 2022, Mecole Hardman in 2023 and now Hopkins in 2024. The trade for Hopkins is an indication of how the previous two trades have not worked out. (And for that matter, it's an indication of how the recent draft picks of Xavier Worthy and Skyy Moore have not brought immediate returns — though it's far too soon to determine Worthy's long-term prospects.)"", ""With Andy Reid and GM Brett Veach struggling to get returns out of midseason trades for wideouts, it's fair to question whether Hopkins can get it done for the Chiefs."", 'Hopkins is currently tied for 28th with Gabe Davis and Brian Thomas Jr. on ESPN Analytics\' ""open"" rating that measures separation. That\'s not bad company, by any means. But it\'s a decline from 2023, when Hopkins was one of the top separators in the NFL, tied with Garrett Wilson and A.J. Brown for fifth, per ESPN Analytics. Hopkins also managed to put up more than 1,000 receiving yards last season despite an adverse quarterback situation.', ""Given that Hopkins is on the older side, it's concerning that his production has waned significantly to start the 2024 season. It's clear that Will Levis, one of the NFL's worst starting quarterbacks, is largely to blame for Hopkins' disappearance. But we won't know how big a reason until Mahomes starts throwing to Hopkins."", ""Smith-Schuster experienced a similar decline over the past few years in New England, where he couldn't produce in the same way that he did with the Chiefs — and certainly not at the same level as he did with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But when asked to do more for the Chiefs offense in 2024, Smith-Schuster put up seven catches for 130 yards against the New Orleans Saints. Mahomes doesn't have that effect on every receiver, but there's no doubt that the quarterback can raise the production of the right wideout."", ""Hopkins is a good fit for the Chiefs. He has the size and athleticism to get open in every area on the field, and will likely step into the role of the injured Rice — a possession receiver who can attack the deep third of the field when the time is right. That'll make space for Worthy over the top and, perhaps, could reduce the number of double-teams on Travis Kelce."", ""Even with Kansas City struggling to acclimate receivers midseason, and even with Hopkins showing signs of age, it's hard to bet against a Hopkins-Mahomes combination — particularly with Reid designing plays. Just look at what the Buffalo Bills did with Amari Cooper, who joined the team in a trade and, within days, had 60 yards and a touchdown in his debut."", '[Related: NFL Trade deadline tracker]', ""The good news for the Chiefs is that they didn't risk much to make the deal work. They'll pay Hopkins at a discount for the remainder of the season. The draft-pick compensation is a fifth-round pick that jumps to a fourth-rounder depending upon Hopkins' playing time and a Chiefs Super Bowl win. Those are conditions that would make K.C. happy to give up an early Day 3 pick."", ""It's the type of trade that's good for the NFL."", ""Late in the Titans' blowout loss to the Bills in Week 7, Hopkins was standing near head coach Brian Callahan — and not joining his offense on the field. He was dealing with a knee injury, but it seemed clear the Titans were holding out in an abundance of caution and because they had no chance of winning the game in a season when they have no chance of making the playoffs."", ""We were seeing Tennessee waste the final years of Hopkins' prime."", ""Now, this isn't to say Hopkins had some agency in the process — he picked the Titans over the Chiefs (among others) in free agency in 2023, per FOX Sports' Peter Schrager. But it's great to see teams working to move their stars (like Hopkins, Davante Adams and Cooper) off irrelevant teams (like the Titans, Raiders and Browns) to improve the quality of play of contenders. Until recently, these were the kind of deals that fans would dream about at the deadline but would not get, because of the NFL's overall trade inflexibility."", 'The league is so much better for the movement on the trade market. Now the question is how much better Hopkins can make the Chiefs.', 'Prior to joining FOX Sports as an NFL reporter and columnist, Henry McKenna spent seven years covering the Patriots for USA TODAY Sports Media Group and Boston Globe Media.

This week we’ll talk about some trades, rookie receiver usage, and more.', 'The DeAndre Hopkins trade to the Kansas City Chiefs gives the reigning back-to-back Super Bowl champions the best outside receiver and ball-winner that they’ve had on the roster with Patrick Mahomes. It gives an element of a bigger body — though it should be noted that Hopkins is only 6-foot-1 but plays about a foot bigger — that gives the Chiefs a legitimate threat to every level of the field on the outside.', 'For a conditional 2025 fifth-round pick, it’s more than worth it for adding the receiver Hopkins has been this year. ', 'But what I’m more interested in is the potential increased usage of Hopkins in the slot. Through his years in Arizona, Hopkins was strictly a receiver lined up on the outside left because no one moved in that offense. But there was some sign of what he could do inside when he got the chance.', 'In 2023, when Hopkins went to Tennessee, there was a slight increase in slot usage, and that’s arguably where he was his most impressive. Hopkins lined up in the slot on 19 percent of his snaps in 2023 and averaged 2.42 yards per route run from the slot. But with the signings of Calvin Ridley and Tyler Boyd this offseason, the Titans hadn’t used Hopkins in the slot as often, just 14 percent of his snaps.', 'Any team wanting to get the most out of Hopkins is going to want him to do his thing on the outside, but as Hopkins gets a bit older — he turned 32 years old in June — getting him inside and matched up on linebackers or smaller slot defenders could be a huge new advantage. ', 'Think about some of the spacing Rashee Rice was getting in the middle of the field. Hopkins might not have the same juice after the catch, but he’s more than capable of using his body control to win in the middle of the field and take advantage of that space.', 'We know what Hopkins can be, but how differently the Chiefs use their new receiver could determine how big the impact of this trade will be this season.', 'Through the first seven weeks of the season, Marvin Harrison Jr. is fourth among rookie wide receivers in receiving yards. It’s not a shame to be behind the likes of Brian Thomas Jr., Malik Nabers, and Keon Coleman, but the way the fourth overall pick and first receive taken in April’s draft has gotten there has been disappointing.', 'We’ve already lived multiple lives in the Marvin Harrison Jr. discourse this season. It started with the GPS tracking speed in Week 1 and now we’re into his usage and deployment in the offense. There’s a much better cause for concern in the latter for the former.', 'Arizona has lined Harrison up on the outside for 83 percent of his snaps this season and he’s been used as the vertical threat on the outside. So far, 28.6 percent of his routes have been go routes — just sending him down the sideline. Those haven’t been particularly efficient so far this season and that’s not great at that volume. Overall, a combined 54.8 percent of Harrison’s routes this season have been go’s or hitches.', 'He’s running go routes at almost double the rate of other rookie receivers like Thomas and Nabers.', 'Part of the issue is the current environment in Arizona, where the Cardinals are rightfully riding with heavier personnel packages. Just 69.2 percent of Harrison Jr.’s routes have come in 11 personnel, which is higher than only Xavier Worthy among rookies with at least 100 routes and Worthy is supposed to be that vertical outside threat like that. ', 'That personnel does play a part in some of these targets. Harrison Jr. has run some crossers off play-action and has been open, but when Kyler Murray turns back around after the fake, Trey McBride is also wide open in the flat with room to run. It’s not the wrong throw, but it does not use the strengths of the No. 1 receiver.', 'Defenses have been playing Harrison Jr. like he’s a true No. 1 but the Cardinals haven’t been treating him that way in his own offense. There’s a disconnect that should hopefully be worked out soon.', 'The Las Vegas Raiders have not done a lot right this season, especially on offense. The quarterback situation is a mess. Davante Adams was traded. The run game is the league’s worst by a mile.', 'One thing they have gotten right? Brock Bowers. Specifically, the Raiders have crushed Bowere’s usage so far this season. Motioning a tight end from one side of the field to the outside receiver in a trips bunch on the other, then getting him on a whip route against a corner to create space for a bunch of yards after the catch? Yea, that’s pretty freaking cool.', 'So far this season, Bowers has lined up in the slot for 48.9 percent of his snaps, inline for 35.4 percent, and out wide for 14.5 percent. As expected, he’s done most of his receiving work from the slot, but he’s just averaging 1.8 yards per route run from there. That’s the lowest of his alignments but it’s more than passable for the bigger plays he’s able to create when he lines up as a traditional tight end (3.47 YPRR) and outside (2.42).', 'Bowers has been in motion on 56 routes, per Next Gen Stats, which is the third-most for a player this season. ', 'Without Davante Adams on the field, Bowers has a 30.6 percent target share and 2.46 yards per route run. He’s already 13th in yards per route run (2.26) among players with at lest 100 routes on the season.', 'He’s now firmly the Raiders’ top receiving option and could continue to carry that efficiency while he’s peppered with more targets because there’s not a great way for opposing defenses to cover him.', 'Somehow, the Philadelphia Eagles are the only team in the NFL without an opening drive point through the first seven weeks of the season. Five other teams haven’t scored a touchdown on an opening drive but the Seahawks, Bears, Dolphins, Jaguars, and Jets have at least kicked a field goal.', 'It’s not just that the Eagles have failed to score on opening drives; they’ve barely come close. During the Eagles’ run to the Super Bowl two seasons ago, they were the best opening-drive team, fueled by aggressiveness and fourth-down conversions, which often led to the end zone.', 'Every stat one could pull out for Philadelphia’s opening drives makes them look worse than the last. No points would obviously be bad enough, but the Eagles have punted on 83.3 percent on their opening drives. The drive the Eagles didn’t punt? Week 1 when Jalen Hurts was intercepted by Xavier McKinney. Only the Patriots have a higher rate of punts (85.7 percent) but even they scored a touchdown.', 'It’s difficult to fully analyze the Eagles’ struggles on opening drives because they don’t last that long. Philly has averaged 3.33 plays per drive and 4.8 yards per drive on its first possessions this season—four point eight. The next worst team, the Jets, has averaged 4.57 plays and 13.6 yards per drive.', 'The most plays the Eagles have run on an opening drive this season is four. Every other team in the league has at least two opening drives with five or more plays.', 'When there’s been a successful play, it’s been hitting an open receiver in the middle of the field but there are few of those, obviously, with pressure and negative runs often derailing the drives. ', 'One of the great things about the Baltimore offense this season is how many different looks it can give out in a game while doing whatever the offense wants from them. The Ravens have such an advantage in personnel because so many of their players are versatile. That’s so clear when they go into 22 personnel (two backs and two tight ends).', 'The Ravens have used 22 personnel on a league-leading 16.8 percent of their offensive snaps this season. On those plays, they’re averaging 7.4 yards per play and 0.20 EPA per play. It’s an effective personnel grouping to run and pass. That’s what makes it so dangerous.', 'Patrick Ricard is the second back in these looks, and he can line up as a fullback, tight end, or basically be used as a sixth offensive lineman. He’s the key to most of these looks. Because of how much he moves around, there’s no tell for what the Ravens are going to do on a given play.', 'Baltimore has only passed 21 percent of the time from 22 personnel, but they’ve been effective enough on the ground that defenses have to respect the big bodies coming at them with Derrick Henry or Lamar Jackson a threat to carry the ball. The Ravens have averaged 0.10 EPA per play on runs from 22 personnel, insane efficiency with an 80 percent run rate.', 'With that focus on the run, the pass has opened up in a big way. Watch this screen to Zay Flowers from Monday night against Tampa Bay. The Ravens faked a toss to Henry and the entire defense flowed to the run action. Flowers set up for the screen while Ronnie Stanley snuck out to get in front of him. ', 'We’ll see more of this and more big plays throughout the season. ', 'Wan’Dale Robinson is a fun player. The 5–foot-8 former second-round pick has wiggle and speed to be a weapon in the open field. He, however, should not be the centerpiece of an offense.', 'He’s not technically that for the New York Giants because Malik Nabers is the top receiving option for the offense but Robinson is currently fourth among all receivers in target share at 29.1 percent.', 'Part of that is due to the two games Nabers missed because of a concussion — and even with those two games missed, Nabers is ninth in target share at 26.1 percent — but even when Nabers was on the field, Robinson had a significant role in the passing game, especially on third downs.', 'Robinson has been targeted on 44.6 percent of the Giants’ third down passes, easily the highest rate in the league. George Pickens is second at 38.2 percent. But just 27.6 percent of those targets have seen a success by EPA. That’s quite the drop-off. ', 'There’s a line between how Robinson can be used efficiently and what the Giants are trying to get out of him. A lack of receiving talent is certainly part of the issue here but it’s not so much of a gap that the smallest receiver on the team should be seeing almost half of the third down targets.', 'Darius Slayton has been useful his whole career, even when the Giants don’t want him to be. Jaylin Hyatt has juice but the Giants don’t put him on the field. These are great answers, but a sub-30 percent success rate on over 40 percent of third down attempts also seems less than ideal.', 'This feels like an indictment of the players, the quarterback, and the play-caller for not having something better going in these high-leverage situations. This isn’t the biggest problem the Giants face, but it does help explain some of the others. ', 'The Seattle Seahawks needed a linebacker. Their duo of Tyrel Dodson and Jerome Baker just wasn’t working. Both had the traits of athletic, rangy linebackers but the run fits weren’t fitting. With the Titans in sell mode after 1-5 start, the Seahawks acquired linebacker Ernest Jones, who Tennessee had acquired in a trade with the Rams right before the season started.', 'Jones, who we pegged as one of the league’s most underrated players, should be a perfect fit in this Seattle defense. The expectation is that Jones will play the Mike as Dodson will slide out of the middle of the field, a move that should benefit all involved.', 'Throughout his career, Jones has been one of the better run-defending linebackers. This season, 63.6 percent of Jones’s tackles have produced positive EPA for the defense. That rate is the sixth-highest among 77 defenders with at least 40 tackles this season.', 'Jones can cover, while doing so from the line of scrimmage, and has been an effective blitzer throughout his career, increasing that rate and role each season he was with the Rams. He gives more juice in those mugged-up pre-snap looks and sim pressures because he can be a legitimate threat as a pass rusher but can also handle dropping back into coverage. ', 'By coming from Tennessee under Dennard Wilson, he already got a taste of a Mike Macdonald system. This could be a great buy-low fit for a defense that has desperately needed a better presence in the middle.', 'Harping on Houston’s early-down offense has been common, especially if you read 1st & 10 every week. It’s one thing to have an inefficient run-heavy approach on early downs but it’s another to lose yards in the way Houston has done so this season.', 'No team has been stuffed at a higher rate of first down runs than the Texans at 26.5 percent. More than a quarter of their first down carries are getting stopped for zero or fewer yards. That puts the Texans in such a difficult place for second and third down and that impact is starting to show.', 'On anything between the tackles, the Texans have been hopeless on the ground. Per Next Gen Stats, Houston has averaged -1.1 rushing yards over expectation on first down runs between the tackles. They’ve been stuffed 35 percent of the time.', 'Outside runs have gotten a better chance at breaking through, but those have still been stuffed 21 percent of the time, which is 22nd in the league.', 'We often talk about how this makes thighs difficult to convert on third down, but what it really does is make things harder on second down. The Texans are tied with the Seahawks averaging a league-worst 8.7 yards to go on second down. Yet, Houston still has the fourth-lowest pass rate on second down. Seattle, at least, throws the ball 70.7 percent of the time on second down, the third-highest rate in the league.', 'The best offenses try to avoid third down at all costs but the Texans are playing themselves into long ones.', 'SHARE:', 'NFL Analyst', 'NFL ANALYSIS', '10/25/24', '13 min read', 'Welcome to Four Ups and Four Downs, our new weekly column diving into the good…', 'By Dan Pizzuta\nNFL Analyst', 'NFL ANALYSIS', '10/25/24', '5 min read', 'The 2024-25 NFL season is close to the midpoint of the year already, and injuries…', 'By Ian Valentino\nNFL/NFL Draft Analyst', 'NFL ANALYSIS', '10/25/24', '10 min read', 'We are nearly halfway through the 2024 season, and one of the most challenging aspects…', 'By Marcus Mosher\nNFL Analyst', 'NFL ANALYSIS', '10/25/24', '9 min read', 'The 2025 NFL Draft will enjoy a robust infusion of running backs into the league…', 'By Kyle Crabbs\nNFL Draft Lead', '', 'The 33rd Team', '© 2024 The Thirty Third Team.', 'Site made in collaboration with CMYK.

Tennessee would receive a conditional draft pick in exchange for the 32-year-old wideout — a fifth-rounder that could become a fourth.', '', 'The Chiefs have understandably been looking to upgrade their passing attack. Patrick Mahomes is averaging a career-low 231.5 passing yards per game and has six touchdowns to eight interceptions, as injuries have sidelined wide receivers Rashee Rice and Hollywood Brown. In Sunday’s 28-12 win over the 49ers, Kansas City wide receivers combined for just five receptions on 12 targets.', 'Hopkins would be looking to shake off a slow start to his season. In six games, he has 15 receptions for 173 yards and one touchdown. After suffering a sprained knee during the preseason, Hopkins’ snap count was limited early; he caught just one pass for minus-2 yards in Sunday’s 34-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills.', 'The Chiefs are expecting Hopkins to land later this afternoon, and they are preparing for him to be in the lineup against the Raiders on Sunday. More here.', 'Jacob has more on the receiver deals below, including potential Cooper Kupp destinations after The Athletic broke news of the Rams receiver’s availability.', 'Back to you, Jacob.', 'We are less than two weeks out from the NFL trade deadline. By 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, November 5th, any deal that could happen, will happen. Below are eight receiver trades that should (not the same as will) happen, ranked from most to least realistic.', 'Chargers acquire Mike Williams from the Jets, sending a 2025 fifth-round pick for the receiver and a sixth-round pick. Would a reunion with Williams make sense? As beat reporter Daniel Popper put it, from a roster-fit perspective, it’s a resounding yes. And that was before Monday night’s loss to the Cardinals, when WR Jalen Reagor fumbled away a potential score and LA finished with seven drops. Their struggling, injury-plagued group could use Williams. Badly.', '49ers acquire Kendrick Bourne, sending the Patriots a 2025 sixth-round pick. This is one of Chad Graff’s five moves New England could make to stockpile draft picks amid a losing season.

Yes, if Kupp doesn’t head to Tampa, Pittsburgh GM Omar Khan should make the call. He has a history of trading with the Rams (2023 deals for Kevin Dotson and Allen Robinson) and reportedly tried to send a similar package for Aiyuk this offseason. Kupp would give them the perfect complement to George Pickens in OC Arthur Smith’s play-action-heavy offense.', 'Patriots acquire Diontae Johnson, sending the Panthers a 2025 third round pick. The Panthers have zero reason to accept anything less, as they’ll receive a third-round compensatory pick if Johnson signs a decent contract elsewhere in 2025. The Patriots have an extra third and $35 million in cap space this year and $137 million next season (tops in the league), so they may be willing to extend Johnson immediately. Drake Maye deserves at least one WR who can separate:', '', 'Commanders add John Metchie, sending the Texans a 2025 sixth-round pick. This saves the 24-year-old from irrelevancy in Houston’s deep receiver room, where he’s seen has one target this year. And at this price, it makes sense for Washington to take a flier on a former second-round pick.', 'Saints acquire Darius Slayton, sending the Giants a 2025 conditional fifth-round pick and receiving a sixth. Slayton’s 12.8 air yards per target since 2020 are evidence of his the field-stretching ability — sorely needed in New Orleans with Rashid Shaheed (14.7 air yards per target) out for the season. The perennially underrated 27-year-old is also a free agent in 2025, which would lower the cost for GM Mickey Loomis.', 'Vikings add Adam Thielen, sending the Panthers a conditional 2026 sixth-round pick. The 34-year-old — who is expected to practice this week — would return to his native Minnesota and to a franchise he didn’t intend to leave. Back in purple and gold, he can man the slot position for Kevin O’Connell’s offense. But this feels like the Panthers doing the Vikings (and my fantasy team) a favor.', 'For more, you can read The Athletic’s Mike Jones and Jeff Howe’s trade deadline wish list, with Mike proposing a Haason Reddick move to the Lions. 👀', 'If you haven’t been reading Derrik Klassen’s Quick Outs column, you’re missing out on an NFL-worthy education.

Hardman caught the touchdown pass in overtime to secure the Chiefs a Super Bowl LVIII victory over the San Francisco 49ers.', 'These trades have a way of working out the way the Chiefs intend, which is why they tried it again this season by making a deal Wednesday with the Tennessee Titans for DeAndre Hopkins, whom they acquired for a conditional fourth-round pick.', ""It's going to take even more from the 32-year-old Hopkins, who unlike Toney or Hardman is an established if aging star, to make this trade work in the Chiefs' favor. The Toney deal was aimed more at the future, to help bolster a receiving group in the wake of the Tyreek Hill trade. That part didn't work out so well for the Chiefs, who released Toney at the end of training camp this year."", 'Hardman was acquired for depth. The Chiefs need Hopkins to be their No. 1 wide receiver by the playoffs -- if not sooner.', 'The initial candidates to be the top wideout, Rashee Rice and Hollywood Brown, are out with injuries. Rice is done for the season with a right knee injury. Brown, who suffered a sternoclavicular injury during the preseason, could return by the postseason.', ""Before the Hopkins trade, the Chiefs were left at wide receiver with Xavier Worthy, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Justin Watson, Hardman and Skyy Moore. At this point of their careers, at least, there isn't a No. 1 wide receiver in that bunch."", ""Worthy, the Chiefs' 2024 first-round draft pick, may eventually get to that point, but for now he's a 21-year-old rookie. He has been what the Chiefs expected at this stage of his career, which is a high-impact but low-volume receiver. He has 15 receptions for 198 yards and two touchdowns, averaging 13.2 yards per catch."", ""Smith-Schuster has a hamstring injury that popped up in practice last week and knocked him out in the first quarter last week against the 49ers. The Chiefs have said he won't play on Sunday in Las Vegas against the Raiders. He will be back later in the season, but the Chiefs didn't bring him back with the expectation of being their No. 1 wideout. Despite his recent big game against the New Orleans Saints, he's more of a complementary player."", 'Watson and Hardman also fit into the complementary category. Moore has produced little since joining the Chiefs in 2022.', ""So Hopkins can't be a gadget piece unveiled on special plays tailored for him, as Toney was. He can't be a backup who on the final play of last year's Super Bowl was in the right place at the right time, as Hardman was. He has to produce big numbers, which he has in the past. Hopkins has had 1,000 or more yards receiving in seven of his 11 seasons in the league including last season with the Titans. He is also a five-time first- or second-team All-Pro."", 'The Chiefs made it to 6-0 with this group of receivers. But giving it a more critical eye, as general manager Brett Veach and coach Andy Reid are paid to do, did they have enough to beat a series of top-quality opponents in the postseason?', 'By making the Hopkins trade, the Chiefs gave their answer on that question loud and clear. Whether the Chiefs eventually look back on this trade favorably -- and more importantly whether they win an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl championship -- depends on Hopkins and what they can get from him.']"

But don’t think this will re-ignite Hopkins into the fantasy star he was earlier in his career.', 'Hopkins, 32, simply isn’t the same superstar he was during his time in Houston and Arizona.

He had been on the verge of being dropped in a lot of leagues, averaging just 6.4 points per game. Part of that has to do with playing in a terrible Titans pass attack that is dead last in the league in passing yards per game (145.8). The Chiefs are 12th, at 221.5 passing yards per contest.', 'So, if Hopkins was dropped in your league, go ahead and grab him.

By trading their Wide Receiver 1 of 2023 DeAndre Hopkins for a conditional 4th/5th Round pick to the undefeated Chiefs, they have enabled this 3-peat much to the ire of other contending teams league-wide, as well as committed to gaining as much draft capital for the future.', 'The Titans paired Hopkins, who was on the last year of his contract, with Calvin Ridley (4 year, $92 million deal) and Tyler Boyd (1 year, $2.4 million deal) to form the oldest Wide Receiver trio in the NFL, with each over the age of 30 at some point in the 2024 season. They also spent more total contract money and guaranteed $ than any other team in the NFL in the 2024 offseason. The desire to give Levis, who struggled down the stretch of 2023, a better supporting cast after the Titans defense regressed, their Offensive Line ranked at the bottom of the league in pass protection metrics, and their receiving targets were highly underwhelming outside of Hopkins, made sense. But recognizing they don’t have the right frontman on the roster right now, the Titans have decided to begin to break up the band they assembled in less than 2 into the season.', 'Hopkins wasn’t the only trade this week for the Titans, as they traded away Linebacker Ernest Jones IV to the Seattle Seahawks for Linebacker Jerome Baker and a 2025 4th Round Pick. The Titans traded for Jones earlier in the offseason on the last year of his deal and got a 6th round pick as well, but had to give up a 5th round pick to acquire him.

However with only 9 games into his career thus far, already noted inexperience prior to the NFL Draft, his young age at 22 (youngest Week 1 starting QB each of the past 2 seasons), and the need for more snaps to gain more technical consistency in his throwing base, the Colts are expected to be more patient with Richardson and his development. Anticipating bigger growth in 2025-2026 at the end of his rookie deal with full offseasons potentially dedicated to his technical development rather than rehab, the Colts will trust in Shane Steichen’s pedigree of developing young QBs (Justin Herbert and Jalen Hurts) to help aid Richardson’s growth.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

For perspective, 49ers No. 3 receiver Jauan Jennings had more yards in one game (175) than Hopkins has in the entire 2024 season. The passing attack simply hasn't been there for the Titans in Brian Callahan's first season with Will Levis and Mason Rudolph under center.

Patrick Mahomes has just one 300-plus-yard passing performance on the season thus far. Despite being out for two games, Rice still leads K.C. in receiving yards."", ""With the lack of threats on the outside, teams have been able to smother star tight end Travis Kelce, taking away Mahomes' security blanket for most of the season.

That means when the Bills and Chiefs face off in less than a month, Hopkins will likely be on the field and up to speed with Andy Reid’s offense.', 'Hopkins has been linked to the Bills for more than a year as Buffalo was trying to improve their wide receiver room. In early October, Hopkins became a more attractive option than the very expensive Davante Adams. The Bills ultimately traded for Amari Cooper a week ago, and he scored his first touchdown for the Bills on Sunday.

He suffered a partial medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear in the offseason, which he has been able to play through this season, albeit in a limited role. Along with the MCL tear this season, Hopkins has a lengthy injury history over his 12-year NFL career.', 'Obviously, the injury is not of significant concern — or the Chiefs would not have traded for the former All-Pro receiver. However, it has limited Hopkins to this point in the season. Hopkins had only played in 47% of the Titans’ total offensive snaps in 2024. However, his role had increased in the past two weeks. In Week 6, he played in 70% of the offensive snaps — and, in Week 7, he played in 60% of the team’s snaps.', 'His ability to maintain a higher workload the past two weeks, along with the nature of an MCL tear indicate that Hopkins should be ready to contribute as a Chief.', 'The MCL is one of the four primary stabilizing ligaments surrounding the knee joint. It is a thick, flat band of tissue that attaches from the femur (thigh) to the tibia (shin). The MCL provides valgus stability at the joint, meaning it protects the knee from lateral-medial forces that would cause it to cave inward. A forceful blow to the outside of the knee is a common mechanism of injury for the MCL.', 'As with all ligamentous injuries, MCL tears are graded based on the severity of the injury.', 'If reporting is accurate, Hopkins suffered a grade II MCL injury. A grade II tear will present with mild instability of the knee joint, causing some pain and making it difficult for cutting or juking, but still with the ability to suit up and play.', 'The MCL is afforded good blood supply at the knee, meaning it can heal itself without surgical intervention. Typically a grade II MCL injury will take four to six weeks for recovery. With Hopkins well outside that timeframe, he may be fully recovered from the injury. This is barring any setbacks or aggravation while he has been playing.', 'Hopkins should be ready to contribute in whatever capacity the coaching staff feels he is prepared for. He has been absent from the injury report in preparation for the Raiders — a good sign in his recovery from the knee injury. His ramp-up of snap counts throughout the season, and the timeline for recovery from an MCL tear should allow him to be a contributor quickly.', 'Being on the back end of his career at the age of 32, and with his injury history, Hopkins will likely not be the star receiver he once was. His production this season would suggest this, although he has been playing with subpar quarterback play in Tennessee, as well as dealing with a knee injury. On the bright side, just a season ago, Hopkins was a 1,000-yard receiver. And despite limited playing time, he has at least one catch in each game this season.', 'He brings a veteran presence to the receiver room and, by far, the most career experience and talent the Chiefs now have at the position.
