A day earlier, EU spokesman Peter Stano stated a day earlier that the discussions to move the process forward ""largely depend on the readiness of both parties to meet."" Petkovic and Bislimi met last month to try and arrange a similar high-level meeting, but those talks collapsed with both sides blaming each other for the lack of progress. Kosovo and Serbia have been negotiating normalization since 2011 through the Brussels dialogue, supervised by the EU. They reached an agreement on normalization steps in early 2023, but key elements of the deal remain unfulfilled. Kosovo insists that this agreement must be signed first, although the EU says it is binding on the parties regardless of signature.
