The defense team believes that the crime scene shows clear signs of ritual murder that point to a branch of Norse paganism called Odinism. ', 'The state has argued that investigators dismissed that theory and successfully argued for special judge Frances Gull to block the defense from telling the jury about their alternative killer theory. ', 'In the new filing on 8:50 a.m. on Oct. 23, the defense is asking again permission to tell the jury about the theory. ', 'The defense attorneys cited testimony on Tuesday, Oct. 22 that Indiana State Police crime scene investigator Brian Olehy gave that the sticks over the bodies of Abby and Libby were meant to hide their bodies. ', '""They appeared to be placed there by an individual,"" Olehy said, noting it seemed to be an ""attempt at concealment"" but ""they were not completely covered.""', 'According to the filing by the defense team, ""the sticks on the girls appear to be arranged in a pattern/arrangement or (at a minimum) using a person’s own eyeballs, common sense, logic and reason could cause a reasonable person to believe that the sticks were formed into some pattern/arrangement and weren’t being used to conceal the bodies.""', 'The defense also wants to allow testimony from Dr. Dawn Perlmutter, who is an expert on Odinism. ', ""The attorneys argue that blocking the Odinism theory and explanation would violate Allen's constitutional right to provide alternative explanations to the ones the state plans to present in the case. "", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Broadly, the word refers to a belief system that centers Odin, the Norse god of war and death. That a seemingly ancient term rooted in the beliefs of medieval European pagans would show up in a document filed by attorneys in a Carroll County courthouse does not come as a shock for scores of civil rights advocacy organizations keeping tabs on white supremacist organizations throughout the United States.', 'Hate groups have been pulling symbols, words and ideologies rooted in European pagan belief systems to advance racist beliefs for decades. Criminologist and civil rights attorney Dr. Brian Levin has won awards for his experience tracking hate groups and extremism at California State’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism and said, throughout nearly 37 years of continual work in that space, he receives requests to define Odinism about once every three years.', 'Those first inquiries about ‘Odinism’ first began in the mid-1970s when, Levin explained, a widespread renewed interest in earth centered, pre-Christian belief systems percolated throughout the United States. White supremacist groups sought to realign themselves with more contemporary subcultures.', '“Odinism has been around, in the American far-right white supremacist world for decades, but with different strata in regards to whether some folks just get a tattoo of these gods or symbols, or if they fully adhere to it,” Levin explained.', ""In the early 2000s in Indiana, a racist skinhead group called the Vinlanders Social Club, who identified as Odinists, formed in Indiana. That grew to be one of the largest and most hardcore, racist skinhead groups in the country. But, by the mid 2010s, membership had largely filtered out. Still, others remain entrenched in the state's prison system. "", '""Odinism is fairly common among white supremacist prison gang members in Indiana. You\'ve got two large gangs, the Indiana Aryan Brotherhood and the Saxon Knights present in the Indiana prison system. It gets a little complicated, because religious groups in prison can get certain privileges like meetings and so forth. And so some people claim to be of a particular religion without necessarily wholeheartedly believing in it,"" said Dr. Mark Pitcavage, who a historian and authority on extremism in the United States with the Anti-Defamation League. ', 'He, too, reiterated not all Norse paganists are white supremacists. The overall desire for white supremacists to claim facets of European paganism as a philosophical harbor for racist beliefs took off in earnest in the mid 19th century, as European states sought to reclaim a sense of shared national identity and reached back to a perceived - often erroneous - shared heritage to do so. Symbols were an easy way to do that. ', '""White supremacists like symbols, they borrow or symbols from a lot of different places, or create their own symbols, and then use them in a variety of ways. And that includes, but it\'s not limited to Norse pagan symbols,"" Pitcavage said. ', 'Despite the prevalence of terms referenced now by U.S.-based white supremacist groups, Nordic, heathen or broadly European pagan belief systems do not reflect the racist ideals of the organizations now coopting their symbolism. ', '“This kind of Nordic mythology fit in well with groups who talked about conquering, and being a warrior for your cause, and your homeland, and your race. So, it really was bastardized and then exploited in a new toxic venom,” Levin said.', 'By World War II, leaders of the Third Reich would often incorporate symbolic elements of European paganism into nationalistic ideologies to the extent that it was “relevant for them to do”, according to Dr. Matthias Nordvig, who is a professor specializing in pre-Christian Nordic mythologies at University of Colorado Boulder’s Nordic Department.', '“It was more language and symbolism that could signal to the general population that we represent this thing as Germanic heritage. And they did the same thing with Christianity, and used the churches in Germany to spread their propaganda,” Nordvig said.', 'Still, of all the terms rooted in European paganism contained in the court filing, Odinism is the one experts today said hints most strongly at affiliations with white supremacy. It is rarely used in Europe. ', ""“There's a thing to keep in mind with Odinism. That is that has, from the beginning, been associated with the white supremacist interpretation of [Nordic paganism]. So, there are very few people who call themselves Odinists who don't admit to some level of sympathy for white supremacy,” said Nordvig.  "", 'The word ""folk"" or ""folkish"" also hints at ties to white supremacy groups. ', 'A more complicated term is Asatrú, which also pops up in the Carroll County filing. That term refers to the general worship of Nordic gods and goddesses, and Asatrú has been officially recognized as a religion in Iceland since 1972.', 'In tracking whether certain groups have ties to white supremacist organizations, Nordvig said he tends to find European references to Asatrú are talkinga bout the original, European pagan belief system. Those groups are often not racist. ', 'However, references to Asatrú in the United States are more likely to have ties to white supremacist groups. The use of the word Asatrú by white supremacists has prompted many of pagan faiths to do away with the term altogether. ', '“I have seen in recent years that people who identify with more liberal ideology lean towards Norse paganism as a term, and shy away from Asatrú, because as they say, it has been tainted by being co-opted by different white supremacist, and extreme right organizations. But, on the other hand, in Europe, Asatrú is the common term. In Europe, if you say Asatrú, people would not necessarily associate that with any form of extremism,"" Nordvig said.', ""Allen's attorneys claim several people with direct ties to Odinism were dismissed as potential suspects early on in the investigation without reason."", '""Law enforcement’s failure to actively pursue the obvious links between the crime scene and Odinism is confounding,"" Allen\'s defense team wrote in the filing.', 'Allen’s defense team claimed lead investigators involved in the Delphi murder investigation consulted with a Purdue professor concerning what resembled, according to them, pagan symbols possibly Odinist in nature that were left behind at the crime scene, no later than February 2018.', '']"

The Delphi Murder Trial Is the Biggest Case TikTok Will Never See,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/delphi-murders-tiktok-true-crime-1235143328/,"['BY CT JONES', 'ON FEB 13, 2017, teenagers Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13 were dropped off near Monon High Bridge, a popular hiking trail in the small community of Delphi, Indiana. Their plan was to walk the trail before being picked up to go home. During their walk, German posted two photos on her Snapchat account, one of a bridge and another of Williams. It was the last time anyone saw the pair alive. The next day, authorities found their bodies in a wooded area several miles from the trail,  sparking a years-long investigation that captured the attention of local and national investigators. Now, seven years later, 52-year-old Richard Allen is on trial for German and Williams’ murder. And less than a week into the Delphi Murders trial, it already has the makings of becoming a mystery — or mess — online. ', 'The deaths of German and William became an immediate priority of the Delphi police as soon as their bodies were discovered. But as police struggled to find a viable suspect in the days following the girls’ murder, the case grew an outsized legacy in national news. Police first released a photo of a man they identified as a prime suspect in the murders. Days later, police revealed that the photo and an additional video had been recovered directly from German’s cellphone. The audio in the clip is muffled, but a man can be seen walking behind them, and he appears to tell the girls to go “down the hill.” Police offered a $41,000 reward for anyone who could identify the suspect, who became known online as “Bridge Guy.” “This young lady is a hero, there’s no doubt,” Indiana State Police Sgt. Tony Slocum said of German at the time. “To have enough presence of mind to activate that video system on her cellphone, to record what we believe is criminal behavior that’s about to occur.”', '', 'But it took another five years for police to arrest a suspect. Allen had been interviewed by authorities days after the girls’ murder and confirmed he was on the bridge at the same time, but just to “watch fish.” A witness at the bridge reported seeing a man matching Allen’s description covered in mud and blood — and after seeing a video of “Bridge Guy,” connected the two. According to a probable cause affidavit that was unsealed in 2022, investigators tied Allen to the scene with an unused .40 caliber round that was found next to German and Williams’ bodies. The ammo matched a gun found at Allen’s home. He pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder while “committing or attempting to commit kidnapping,” according to the Associated Press. ', '', 'Much of the delay in trying Allen’s case has come from both authorities’ problems with identifying a suspect and the intense national interest in the case. In 2022, photos of the crime scene and additional evidence were leaked, which led to a legal battle over what party was responsible. Allen’s legal team initially withdrew from the case after the evidence was leaked, but was reinstated by a judge because finding a new legal team would drag the case on longer. In 2022, Allen County Superior Court Judge Fran Gull issued a gag order for the trial, barring the defense, prosecution, witnesses, and family members from making any public statements. No cameras or audio recording devices are allowed in the courtroom. And the jury will also be held under strict sequestration, meaning they’re unable to use social media or watch any news while the trial is taking place. ', '', 'Because of the strict gag order and lack of filmed content, true crime enthusiasts on TikTok who post about the case have begun compiling information from both reputable and unchecked sources. There are hundreds of videos regurgitating trial information that has been filtered from new sites to journalists, to bloggers, and now content creators. The prosecution and defense both agree that the girls were brutally murdered. But while the prosecution is arguing that Allen kidnapped and murdered the girls, hiding them in the woods to cover his tracks, Allen’s defense claims that the girls were ritually murdered as a part of a practice of Norse paganism called Odinism. This theory of pagan sacrifice has been heavily fixated on by true crime enthusiasts interested in the trial. ', '', 'While established true crime accounts on TikTok often pride themselves on only disseminating information from reputable sources, like CNN, local news, or the Associated Press, the interest in the case has turned dozens of amateur watchers into sleuths. Some claim the length of time it took to find a suspect heavily indicates a coverup — one possibly linked to Odinism. Others have taken to implicating witnesses in the case, including members of Williams’ and German’s families. (When reached for comment by Rolling Stone, a spokesperson for TikTok noted that the app’s community guidelines prohibit harmful misinformation and conspiracy theories and that content containing these are not eligible for the for-you-feed.)', 'This isn’t the first time TikTok’s true crime community has banded together to try and solve a case. In 2023, following the murder of four University of Idaho students, it took police six weeks to name and arrest Bryan Kohberger, a suspect in the case. But during the time before Kohberger’s arrest, some true crime enthusiasts on TikTok began accusing and publicly naming strangers as responsible for the killings — even blaming some of the students who survived the murders. The 2024 trial of Karen Read, a Massachusetts woman accused of running over her boyfriend with a car, also became a fixation on the app, with true crime accounts raking in millions of views by dissecting testimony and trial evidence. Now they’ve moved on to the Delphi Murders.', '', '“The fascination of true crime on social media is just an extension of the fascination about crime,” Jeffrey Lin, a criminology professor at the University of Denver, previously told Rolling Stone. “We want to be able to control crimes that feel out of control. We have this intense desire to help and be heroic, and yet we have no opportunity to do so. Most of us are not able to become high-level researchers [for the FBI] but we can get on TikTok and look for [Brian Laundrie’s] van. This is just the fulfillment of the fantasy that’s been presented to us for decades.”', 'Allen’s trial began on Oct. 18, and is expected to last a month. But online, the same interest and speculation that made the Delphi Murders a national news story is ramping up again — and laying the groundwork for potential misinformation in the process.', 'We want to hear it.

Jerry Holeman’s continued cross-examination by defense attorney Andrew Baldwin.', 'Holeman told the jury he told Richard Allen two lies during the Oct. 26, 2022, interview.', 'One of lies? Holeman wasn’t lying to him.', '“‘I’m not lying to you, Rick, that’s unethical,’” Baldwin quoted, saying this was a quote from Holeman to Allen.', 'Holeman then said he told Allen, “You’re going to drag your (expletive) wife and daughter through this because you’re too (expletive) bullheaded to get out in front of it.”', 'Baldwin claimed Holeman said this to get into Allen’s head about how this would impact his family. Baldwin also said Holeman did not send the unspent cartridge to another agency for a second test to see if it matched Allen’s Sig Sauer. He continued by saying Allen’s drive home after the interview was recorded, but a quote Holeman claimed Allen made earlier in October was not recorded.', 'Baldwin then questioned Holeman on his theory about where Richard Allen’s car was parked on Feb. 13, 2017. Holeman answered that he didn’t have a theory, but couldn’t name witnesses who knew where his car was. He also said he didn’t watch security camera footage that showed Allen’s car near the trail.', 'Various law enforcement officers said they believed Allen left the crime scene by 3:30 p.m. and his role in the murders was finished by 4 p.m. The officers also did not believe Allen took Libby German’s phone from the scene, which Baldwin mentioned to the court that Libby’s phone would give a good timeline.', 'Holeman then told the jury he believed only one person killed Libby and Abby, but first thought more than one may have been involved. Holeman commented on remarks made by past law enforcement about Libby’s death, then said they tried to analyze the height of “Bridge Guy” from the video, but didn’t think it would be accurate. Baldwin chimed in to say that service would have cost around $10,000.', 'Baldwin asked Holeman if he knew about the hair found in Abby’s hand that wasn’t fully DNA tested until last week. Holeman responded that “timing and resources needed to be used in other areas.”', '“There’s been mistakes made, yes,” Holeman said about the overarching investigation.', 'Baldwin and Holeman discussed the sticks found at the scene and on top of the girls’ bodies. Holeman said the sticks were used to the conceal the crime, but they weren’t positioned any special way.', 'Holeman then told the jury he thinks that the killer heard people on the bridge and then killed the girls. “It’s just a theory,” he said. Holeman added that two witnesses, Betsy Blair and Sarah Carbaugh, were believable, and also said they once considered the idea that there were two people on the bridge.', 'Baldwin mentioned Libby’s phone last pinged from a cell phone tower at 5:44 p.m. Feb. 13. Holeman mentioned that Libby’s sister, Kelsi Seibert, did not have her phone data extracted, but “he didn’t need that information to arrest Allen.”', 'Holeman also agreed he believed the phone stayed underneath Abby’s back from 3:30 p.m. to when they were found on Feb. 14.', 'State prosecutor Nick McLelland chimed in to ask if there were “any signs the girls died then were put into a car and moved.” Holeman said no.', 'The session ended with two questions from the jury. The first question asked if there was a way bridge to get where the girls were without crossing the bridge, and Holeman answered, “There’s an unapproved way.” Ultimately, Holeman said everyone was on the bridge.', 'The second question was if he knew if Libby’s dad was shouting for the girls. He said no.', 'Court returned Saturday at 9:03 a.m. According to notes provided by News 8’s Kyla Russell, the alternate juror who had been dismissed Friday morning did not return to court. She also says the jurors had supervised access to their phones Friday evening.', 'The state called Indiana State Police Lt. Jerry Holeman to the stand. He interviewed Richard Allen on Oct. 26, 2022.', 'Holeman first commented on Melissa Oberg’s statement Friday where she said a firearm tool kit test was like a paternity test, and said that her statement was “not correct” and he misunderstood her. Oberg was a former forensic firearm analyst who examined the unspent cartridge, or “magic bullet,” found near the bodies of Abby Williams and Libby German. She had determined it was cycled by Allen’s gun.', 'Holeman explained to the jury the process of interviewing suspects and different techniques he’d learned, including “lying to (suspects)” about the amount of evidence investigators have and how to read a suspect’s body language to determine if they are lying.', 'He said he interviewed Allen at the ISP Lafayette Post following . Allen’s wife Kathy came with him. Holeman said, at first, he didn’t plan on arresting Allen at the start of the interview, but read him his Miranda Rights anyway.', 'Holeman said they started by talking about firearms and past military experience, and if anything was damaged when investigators searched his home. He asked Allen if anyone borrowed his car, clothes, or gun for long periods of time, to which Allen said no. Allen also denied having his firearm on him on Feb. 13, 2017 – the day of the murders.', 'Holeman told the jury he told Allen that Oberg’s report matched the bullet to his gun. Allen denied this. Holeman said after denying it, Allen’s “demeanor changed.”', 'The lieutenant asked Allen about a few comments he made during the search, and Allen retaliated, saying “his life was already ruined because all of his friends and community ‘thought he did it.’” Holeman asked about the “Bridge Guy” video, and the witnesses and experts who said that was him. Holeman then told the jury he lied to Allen about this, as it wasn’t true. Allen denied at least 20 times that he was the killer and that his gun was there, according to Holeman.', 'After further back-and-forth, Holeman said Allen told him, “I am not going to tell you something I didn’t do…I don’t care what you do to me. I am not going to ever tell you something I didn’t do.”', 'Allen continued denying knowing the girls, both men throwing expletives at each other during the interview. Holeman added that Allen did not explain why the cartridge was cycled through his gun.', 'Holeman said Allen did eventually confirm he was on the High Bridge on Feb. 13, 2017. They took a brief break during the interview. Holeman said he overheard Allen speaking with his wife, Kathy, telling her if she asked for a lawyer, they’d let her go.', 'Continuing the interview, Allen told Holeman that he had a side holster and carried his firearm with one round in the chamber. He continued to deny ever knowing Libby and Abby or knowing how his bullet got there.', 'Holeman briefly explained to the jury his training to know when someone is lying. The common cues he said to look for involved body language, such as touching of the face or looking away. He said there were “few signs of deception” from Allen, but they were “very subtle.”', 'Allen, at one point, reportedly told Holeman during the interview, “What kind of good person would kill two girls?”', 'Holeman said during the end of the interview, he told Allen he “thought he did it.”', 'Allen replied, “Then take all of your evidence and arrest him already.”', 'After meeting with other investigators, Richard Allen was placed under arrest.', 'Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin began his questioning, mentioning that though Holeman said he read Allen his rights, the beginning of the interview wasn’t recorded. Holeman confirmed it wasn’t recording, but when they got the camera to record, there was a delay in the footage which doesn’t show Holeman walking into the interrogation room.', 'Baldwin told the court this was one of the “many missing videos in this case.”', 'Baldwin then moved to admit Allen’s two October 2022 interviews for evidence. Special Judge Fran Gull agreed to show the interviews to the jury sometime next week.', 'At 9:05 a.m., the state called its first witness to the stand: Melissa Oberg, a operations data analyst for a clinical asset health management company. Oberg previously worked as a forensic firearm analyst for the Indiana State Police, but resigned in 2013.', 'Oberg explained to the jury the process of analyzing a firearm, the different impressions made on bullets, the parts of the gun, and more. The state then showed pictures of an unspent .40-caliber bullet, or the “magic bullet” found near Libby German and Abby Williams’ bodies near Deer Creek. Oberg identified the bullet as a Winchester .40-caliber cartridge that had no biological substance on it. She also noted possible ejector marks and compared it to ejector marks from a Glock 22, another .40-caliber weapon.', 'After a brief recess, Oberg showed the jury a presentation that concluded that the gun collected from Richard Allen’s home in 2022, a Sig Sauer, had cycled the cartridge that was found near the bodies. She compared tool marks from the unspent cartridge and a test cartridge, saying “several marks were in sufficient agreement.” Oberg finished by confirming the cartridge found at the scene had not been fired.', 'Oberg said earlier that toolmarks are “features imparted on an object by the contact and force extended from a tool.”', 'Court recessed for lunch and returned around 1:15 p.m. Friday. News 8’s Kyla Russell reported an alternate juror did not return from lunch and was excused, leaving 12 jurors and three alternates.', 'Oberg continued testifying as the defense began their cross-examination. Defense attorney Brad Rozzi asked Oberg to define “sufficient agreement” and discussed how PCAST (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology) has been studying if the “tool mark industry” is valid science.', 'Oberg and Rozzi entered a back-and-forth, with Oberg defining how pressure is what is different between cycling or versus firing a cartridge. She again confirmed that the marks on the cartridge helped her determine it matched Allen’s gun. Rozzi, at some point, mentioned Oberg’s previous comment that the tool kit test was “like paternity test.” Rozzi asked Oberg if it’s possible that an unspent round could have been cycled through multiple firearms; she agreed.', 'After a short break, Oberg presented exhibits and answered questions from the jurors. The questions included one about the cycled bullet found near the girls’ bodies and others about the bullets taken from Allen’s home and cycled as part of Oberg’s testing.', 'Oberg concluded by saying “the results of those tests did not result in an exact match.”', '', '', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

Defense to firearms expert: “It’s all speculation”,https://www.wane.com/top-stories/delphi-gun-expert-testimony-on-magic-bullet/,"['WANE 15', '', '', '', '', '', 'by: Marcus Truscio, Alyssa Ivanson', 'Posted: Oct 25, 2024 / 01:52 PM EDT', 'Updated: Oct 25, 2024 / 08:10 PM EDT', '', '', '', 'DELPHI, Ind. (WANE) – Friday’s entire day in court was the testimony of state witness Melissa Oberg, a former Indiana State Police forensic firearms examiner.', 'Oberg came to the conclusion, based on her testing, that the unspent cartridge found near Abby Williams’ and Libby German’s bodies, came from a gun taken from Richard Allen’s home during an October 2022 search. That gun, a .40 cal SIG Sauer P226 handgun, is a big part of what the prosecution believes connects Richard Allen to this case.', '*”Cartridge” refers to a single round of ammunition. A cartridge is made up of a bullet and its casing. The bullet is the projectile that comes out when the gun is fired, and the casing is left behind. In this case, it’s referred to as a cartridge because it cycled out of a gun, but was not fired.', 'Oberg spent the first hour of her testimony explaining how a firearm is examined and the parts of a handgun. Since the cartridge found at the scene was unspent, she demonstrated to the courtroom three different ways a cartridge can be cycled through that gun and ejected without being fired. She demonstrated with dummy .40 cal rounds in the SIG Sauer P226 found in Allen’s house. Wearing blue gloves, she took the handgun out sealed evidence box, put in a magazine of dummy rounds and cycled out three cartridges. The type of cartridge found at the scene was a Winchester 40 Smith & Wesson round.', 'When examining markings on a cartridge, bullet or casing, there are three kinds of characteristics: class, sub-class and individual. Oberg explained class characteristics are from the manufacturer, sub-class often happen from inconsistencies during the gun-making process and then individual most often occur from using the firearm, but can sometimes be caused during manufacturing.', 'Before Oberg received the cartridge on Feb. 17, 2017, three days after the girls were found, it had been screened for DNA and fingerprints in a different state police lab.', '“I’m a DNA and fingerprint destroyer,” Oberg said on the stand.', 'Oberg said when she received the cartridge on the 17th, it was in “good condition” and “non-remarkable.” She also didn’t see any biomaterial on it and didn’t think it had been in contact or corrosive material or outside for any length of time.', 'Oberg also noted three marks on the head of the cartridge that she said were from the ejector. There were also three marks under the rim of the cartridge that she said were created by the extractor. She also noted miscellaneous marks on the primer and miscellaneous materials in the rim around the primer on the headstamp area.', 'Oberg testified that she tested three other handguns that were given to her by investigators before October 2022, including a Glock 22, a Smith & Wesson MP 40 and a SIG Sauer P239. While she couldn’t exclude any of them, she concluded that the SIG Sauer produced similar class markings and was a closer match than the other two. In later testimony, Oberg testified that had she been given those three weapons and Allen’s SIG P226 all at the same time, she would have been able to exclude the Glock and the Smith & Wesson.', 'Examiners use what’s called a comparison microscope to look at both the test round as well as the round in evidence at the same time. The microscope allows them to line up different areas to see them next to each other as well as take pictures.', 'Those pictures, however, are not intended to be used to make a match determination. Instead, she testified, they are intended to jog the examiner’s memory of what they saw.', 'She compared looking through the microscope to watching a movie and the pictures the microscope takes would be like only seeing a few still frames of the movie.', '“It’s a 3D object and we’re trying to capture it with 2D. You won’t get everything in the picture,” she testified. “The pictures themselves don’t represent everything we see in the examination process.”', 'After looking at the comparisons, an examiner will either rule it as an “identification,” meaning a match, an “exclusion” meaning it’s ruled out as not a match, or as “inclusive.”', 'On Oct. 14, 2022, the day after Richard Allen’s home was searched, she received his SIG Sauer MP226 40 S&W handgun, along with the one Winchester 40 S&W cartridge found in a “keepsake” box on a master bedroom dresser, one Blazer 40 S&W cartridge found in the closet and two magazines with Blazer 40 S&M rounds in them. One magazine had eight cartridges inside and the other had nine.', 'After determining that the gun from Allen’s home had no broken parts, she cycled and fired rounds of stock ammunition at the state police lab from Allen’s weapon to compare with the unspent cartridge found at the scene. Oberg testified that she cycled six rounds and fired four for a total of ten.', 'Oberg then used a comparison microscope to look at the cycled and fired founds and said marks on a round that she fired from Allen’s gun matched the marks on the cycled cartridge found at the scene five years earlier.', '“I was able to identify [Allen’s gun] as having fired, I’m sorry, cycled [the crime scene cartridge],” Oberg testified. “It was based on a sufficient amount of quantity and quality marks.”', 'She said she found individual characteristics that matched in three different areas on the cartridge made from the ejector, the extractor and from the chamber face area of the barrel. Oberg had explained that the ejector and extractor are what take a round from the magazine and bring it up into the chamber.', 'Oberg said having matching marks in three different areas was significant and strengthened her determination of an identification.', 'Her work was then verified by a state police forensic firearms examiner supervisor who agreed with her conclusion.', 'One of defense attorney Bradley Rozzi’s main points of contention was that Oberg used a FIRED round to compare to CYCLED round, saying it’s different circumstances and environments inside the firearm when the round is fired versus just cycled out.', 'Oberg testified several times, however, that the markings on a cartridge would be the same from cycling and from firing because the mechanism of the extractor and ejector still act the same. Just the pressure changes, making markings from the fired round more deep or distinct, but not inherently different.', 'She and Rozzi went back and forth on that point a few times, with Rozzi calling her unresponsive to the judge because Oberg would answer a yes or no question with more explanation.', '“Two environments. Two different results,” Rozzi said.', '“I will keep repeating myself. It’s the same way just different pressure,” Oberg responded.', 'Ultimately, Rozzi got the last word in that line of questioning by simply emphasizing that her conclusion was based on a test fired round not a test cycled round and she said yes.', 'Rozzi also argued that the test cycled cartridges had some extractor marks, but had limited or no ejector marks, emphasizing again that they were not the same as the crime scene cartridge.', '“I don’t consider them different. They just didn’t have the marks as well. They weren’t different, just not enough of them,” Oberg said.', 'Rozzi also took issue with Oberg not examining and documenting the stock ammunition used for the test rounds before cycling or firing them to know if they had any markings on them before her tests were performed.', 'Through Rozzi’s questioning, it was also clarified that the three extractor marks on the cartridge found at the crime scene could have been caused by it being cycled three different times. Oberg also admitted it’s possible it could have been cycled through other firearms or how long ago it had been cycled.  ', 'During the cycling discussion, Rozzi said he’d demonstrate again and put on blue gloves by the defense table and walked up to the small table below the judge’s bench where Allen’s gun was sitting in the evidence box. As he started to touch the top of the box, he said something to Judge Gull and Prosecuting Attorney James Luttrell joined them. After some discussion at the bench, Rozzi just turned around and took the blue gloves off.', 'Another main defense argument called into question the “science” of ballistics and firearm examinations. There’s a large community, Rozzi said, that disagrees with the accuracy of firearms experts at determining a match with a bullet and a gun.', 'There was debate over the accuracy and validity of what are called “blackbox” studies that test examiners. They are just matching rounds in the tests, not rounds to a weapon. Those studies report a 2.2% false positive rate, meaning a match was determined when it should have been excluded and a 2.8% false negative rate, meaning an exclusion was determined when it should have been an inclusion.

Delphi Murders Trial: Day 7 | Gun Examiner: Bullet found at crime scene had been in Richard Allen's gun,https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/delphi-murders-trial-day-7-firearms-examiner-focuses-on-40-caliber-cartridge,"['Menu', '53°', 'Day seven of the Delphi Murders Trial began with the testimony of Melissa Oberg. She is a former firearms examiner for the Indiana State Police. However, by the end of the day, there were only 15 jurors. One of the four alternates was excused by Special Judge Fran Gull due to a family emergency. That leaves 12 jurors and three alternates.', 'As for the testimony, Oberg took the stand as an expert for the prosecution. She said during her career she has examined more than 66,000 weapons. She was responsible for examining the single .40 caliber Smith & Wesson Winchester cartridge found at the crime scene near the Monon High Bridge Trail. The cartridge was on the ground between the bodies of Abby Williams and Libby German. The bodies were found in woods near the Delphi bridge on February 14, 2017.', ""The unspent bullet (or cartridge as some people call it) is significant evidence for the state's case against Richard Allen. The prosecution claims it ties Allen to the murder of the girls."", ""Oberg testified for more than an hour during Friday's morning session. She discussed how a firearm works and explained the various parts of a cartridge."", 'She explained to the jury that cartridge characteristics differ and why it is important. She demonstrated to the jury how a semi-automatic pistol cycles a cartridge — from the time the cartridge is in the magazine, moved into the chamber, and ultimately ejected — either automatically if the round has been fired or manually by someone racking the action.', 'Oberg talked about her initial observation of the cartridge found at the crime scene. She said she could see three ejector marks on the head, three extractor marks under the rim, miscellaneous marks on the primer, and various particles in the rim around the primer.', 'She showed a diagram of firearm parts.', 'She said an ejector pushes the cartridge out of the magazine and an extractor pulls the cartridge out. The two internal tools work together.', 'She showed three ways the cartridge could be ejected from the handgun.', 'Oberg explained her exam process.', ""Level 1 analysis involves checking the weapon's condition and what she calls class characteristics. She determines if the gun is broken or working properly. She also considers biometrics and whether any parts might be broken or missing."", ""Level 2 analysis involves test-firing the weapon with live ammunition, and then using a comparison microscope to compare characteristics found on the cartridge/shell casing. It also includes comparing the shell casings fired from Allen's Sig pistol to the bullet found at the crime scene."", 'Level 3 is the conclusion phase. The options are 1) identification which means the markings match 2) inconclusive which means there is not enough evidence or 3) exclusion which means the markings are not the same and do not match.', 'Oberg testified she used a 60x magnification to observe markings on what the defense called the ""magic bullet."" That is the cartridge found at the crime scene.', ""She said unique characteristics of a specific gun's surface could come from abuse, use, or corrosion. Those characteristics make unique impressions on cartridges fired by the weapon or cycled through it."", '""Looking through the microscope is like watching a movie,"" Oberg said. ""Pictures themselves don\'t represent everything we see in the examination process.""', 'Oberg compared a fired round from Allen\'s gun to the ""magic bullet."" She said there were three specific places where the markings match the cycled round found near the bodies.', 'She said she saw three ejector marks on the head, three extractor marks under the rim of the shell casing, miscellaneous marks on the primer, and various particles in the rim around the primer.', ""Oberg cited numerous studies in her findings. She admitted the research was not for the identical model or the extractor in Allen's pistol. Oberg said the data she collected from Allen's gun — combined with research cited on the manufacturing process — allows her to feel confident the .40 caliber Smith & Wesson cartridge found at the crime scene had been in Allen's gun."", ""Defense Attorney Brad Rozzi objected to Oberg's testimony arguing the examples cited were not for the exact model of Allen's gun. Judge Gull chose not to overrule them, saying she would let the jury decide how to weigh the studies."", ""The gun tested from Allen's house was a SIG Sauer MP226 .40 Smith & Wesson. It included:"", ""Because Allen's gun was taken five years after the crime scene, ISP did a longevity test to see how the cartridges would hold up.\nOberg said the longevity could depend on whether a person cleaned their gun with a brush that could break down parts of the gun."", ""She examined Allen's gun and found no broken points."", '""I was able to identify [Allen\'s gun] as having cycled the on-the-scene cartridge,"" Oberg said.', 'But her statement came with heavy scrutiny from the defense who questioned the science behind it. Her assessment, she said, was based on four rounds fired from Allen’s gun and six more that were manually ejected. On cross-examination by the defense, she acknowledged the markings on cartridges manually ejected from Allen’s gun were not prominent enough for her to conclude if the markings matched. The defense stated it is like comparing apples to oranges.', 'Jurors are likely going to hear from a DNA expert as testimony continues tomorrow in Delphi. It will be a shorter day court as the Saturday session is scheduled from 9 a.m. to noon.']"

Shank said the individual who left the tip stated they saw three girls.', 'However the tip was reportedly \'misfiled\' - given Allen lived on Whiteman Drive - with \'Whiteman\' not a part of his name. Carroll County Sheriff Tony Liggett alleged this oversight means Allen had been ""hiding in plain sight"" for years.

Kohr noted Abby’s clothing, any physical injuries, and performed a rape kit. He said that Abby had a 1-inch deep, 3-inch long incision wound on her neck. She also had a faint mark under her mouth, which Kohr said could be from duct tape or cloth. Abby showed no signs of blunt force trauma or restraint wounds. He said that though the rape kit showed no “overt injury patterns,” it does not mean that sexual contact didn’t occur.', 'Libby German’s autopsy was performed second. Kohr also noted her clothing, physical injuries, and performed a rape kit. The autopsy report said Libby had anywhere from three to five incision wounds on the right side of her neck, the largest being around 3.5 inches long. She also showed no signs of overt sexual trauma or defensive wounds.', 'Kohr estimated that the girls died approximately 41 hours before the autopsy.', 'Defense attorney Brad Rozzi began his cross examination and discussed Kohr’s deposition from February 2024. Kohr’s deposition included information about the attack and speculations on the girls’ reactions after being attacked. He said in the February deposition that he couldn’t determine if the killer was left or right handed and that a serrated knife may have been used.', 'Kohr then said after his deposition that a box cutter may have been used instead of a serrated knife, but did not inform the defense. News 8’s Kyla Russell said Rozzi showed upset in the courtroom after Kohr admitted his uncertainty about the weapon used and did not file a new report.', 'The state’s first witness Wednesday morning was 35-year-old Sarah Carbaugh, a lifelong Delphi resident who lived near the trail. She told the jury she visited the trail every day with her dogs.', 'Carbaugh said she did not know Libby German and Abby Williams, but learned they were missing through an Amber Alert sent out on Feb. 13, 2017. She didn’t walk the trail that day, but drove by to see how busy it was. While there, she said she saw a group of people at the Mears entrance, including a girl wearing pink who appeared visibly stressed. She also saw a man covered in “mud” and “blood” walking along a country road. She said she drove past the man, who did not acknowledge her, but says she later recognized him as “Bridge Guy.” She waited three weeks to report who she saw to police, saying she was afraid.', 'Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin began his cross-examination, asking questions about discrepancies in her descriptions of “mud” and “blood” and her June 2017 interview with police that had an hour of it missing. Carbaugh responded that the details “were as simple as it is” and that “outside of this testimony, I want nothing to do with this.”', 'Baldwin asked further questions about Bridge Guy’s hair texture and eyes. “You’re romanticizing this,” Carbaugh said.', '“You said he had very effeminate eyes,” Baldwin said.', '“I did not say that,” Carbaugh said.', 'News 8’s Kyla Russell reported that the jury appeared “put off” by Carbaugh’s reactions. After her cross-examination, state prosecutor Stacy Diener asked about discrepancies in how Carbaugh described Bridge Guy’s hood and hat.', 'Carbaugh replied it “feels like a Tinder profile of hats” with how many hats she’s been shown. She continued by discussing her June 2017 interview and the portion that had been missing. She said that the part where she was asked to mark the Bridge Guy photo was a part of the missing interview block. She mentioned, though, that the Bridge Guy’s jacket was dark enough to where she wouldn’t have seen blood on it, and but his jeans were light enough to show the mud on them. The jury finished by asking how close she was to Bridge Guy when she saw him at the Mears entrance, to which she answered he was within three feet of the passenger side.', 'Online court records show that Richard Allen’s defense has filed a motion to admit evidence in the court regarding Odinism and the theory the girls were murdered as a “ritualistic killing.”', 'The defense first presented evidence of Odinism in the Delphi Murders case in September 2023. The team filed a 136-page memorandum, claiming that “members of a pagan Norse religion, called Odinism, hijacked by white nationalists, ritualistically sacrificed Abigail Williams and Liberty German.”', 'The Odinism theory was one of many the state pushed to bar from the jury during the trial, along with references to Kegan Kline, geocaching, and other third-party suspects. Following the state’s motion, the defense retaliated, fighting for those arguments to be allowed in court.', 'The court struck down the Odinism theory in September, the order saying that evidence “must not be based on speculation, conjecture, rumors, or hearsay, rather than admissible evidence.”', 'It wasn’t clear how the court would rule on the motion or if it would be discussed during Wednesday’s session.', 'Tuesday began with cross-examination of ISP Trooper Brian Olehy, who discussed a large exhibit of crime scene evidence, most contained in sealed, brown paper bags. During the exhibit, Olehy said he was not aware of any DNA found that was connected to Richard Allen.', 'According to News 8’s Kyla Russell, a tense back-and-forth between the defense, prosecution, and Olehy followed, prompting objections from the prosecution. He also discussed the unspent bullet found at the scene, a piece of evidence the defense referred to as the “magic bullet.”', 'After lunch, ISP Lt. Brian Bunner, a state forensic examiner, explained the process of cellphone data extraction and discussed the infamous “bridge video” found on Libby German’s phone. Bunner said in only some screenshots taken from the video can a man be seen behind the girls. The man in the video has been given the moniker “Bridge Guy” by many.', 'The defense asked about the GPS data from the video, to which Bunner answered that the coordinates were close to the bridge, but he did not look at the data. Following Bunner, audio-visual forensic expert Jeremey Chapman testified about enhancing audio in the bridge recording to pinpoint where the “Bridge Guy” was heard saying “Down the hill.”', 'Then, three witnesses who said they saw “Bridge Guy” on the High Monon Trail the day Libby German and Abby Williams went missing testified.', 'One witness, Railly Voorheis, said she saw “Bridge Guy” on the trail and told him “hi,” but he didn’t respond. When describing what “Bridge Guy” looked like, she noted he was taller than her. Voorheis told the jury she was 5 feet 7 inches tall. Richard Allen is 5 feet 4 inches tall.', 'The second witness, Breann Welber, said she made a post to Snapchat when she went to the bridge on Feb. 13, 2017.

Delphi Trial: Firearms examiner says cartridge cycled through Allen's pistol,https://www.pharostribune.com/news/article_77aab87c-932e-11ef-8044-fbe6ce82b98a.html,"['', '', '', '', '', '', 'Was an unspent .40 caliber Smith & Wesson cartridge located near the bodies of Abby Williams and Libby German cycled through a gun seized during an October 2022 search of suspect Richard Allen’s residence?', 'That was the one particular line of questioning that stood out Friday in Day 7 of testimony in the jury trial of Allen, a Delphi man accused of killing the two teenagers in February 2017.', 'According to Melissa Oberg — a forensic firearms examiner called upon Friday by the prosecution — it was.', 'Oberg was the lone witness Friday, and she began the day with a lengthy Power Point presentation, which included explaining to the jury the process of examining firearms, the general parts of a firearm and how ammunition works when cycled or fired through a firearm’s chamber.', 'But after several minutes of her presentation, talk turned to the unspent cartridge and the SIG Sauer firearm located at Allen’s home.', 'Oberg first analyzed the unspent cartridge, which Defense Attorney Brad Rozzi has previously referred to as the “magic bullet,” on Feb. 17, 2017.', 'That was three days after the girls’ bodies were located.', 'Oberg was also quick to point out in her Friday testimony that she was provided the .40 caliber unspent cartridge after investigators analyzed it for fingerprint and DNA.', '“I’m a DNA and fingerprint destroyer,” she told the court, mainly because of the surfaces and procedures used doing her own analysis.', 'Oberg also noted in her testimony that the unspent round appeared to show no corrosion, and it was in relatively “good condition.”', 'In earlier hearings in the case, the defense has often questioned that theory of the unspent cartridge being fresh and possibly from Allen’s gun, noting it was lodged into the ground.', 'But Oberg seemed to disagree Friday.', '“It was non-remarkable,” she stated, adding that the unspent round also didn’t appear to show signs of weathering or being outside in the elements very long.', 'Oberg also noted that her first observation of the unspent round found three ejector marks on the head, three extractor marks under the rim, miscellaneous marks on the primer and miscellaneous particles in the rim around the primer.', 'Then over the next five years, Oberg said she obtained several different firearms — around eight in all — in the hopes of matching those firearms to the marks found on the cartridge.', 'And while she said she couldn’t exclude those firearms during her analysis, she told the court she didn’t believe those firearms were a match.', 'Then, in October 2022, Oberg said she was provided a .40 caliber SIG Sauer P226 that was obtained during a search warrant of Allen’s residence.', 'And Oberg said she believed it was a match.', '“I was able to identify Allen’s gun as having fired, I’m sorry, cycled the crime scene cartridge,” she testified.', 'The firearms examiner then spent several more minutes explaining why.', 'It had to do with what Oberg called “areas of agreement.”', 'The jury was then shown pictures comparing where the marks on the crime scene cartridge were with one of the rounds that she test fired from the SIG Sauer seized from Allen’s house.', 'Oberg said she also did four test firings and six test cycles from Allen‘s SIG Sauer during her analysis, explaining the increased pressure with firing round markings would be more distinct, but the action of a cartridge coming from a magazine with both the extractor and the ejector touching it would be the same whether it is cycled or fired.', 'But during cross-examination, which lasted around three hours, Rozzi questioned Oberg’s testimony and analysis of the unspent cartridge, as well as the science behind it.', '“Would you ever tell a law enforcement officer in this case that firearms testing, just like paternity testing, is 99% accurate?” Rozzi asked.', '“No,” Oberg responded.', 'But then she stuck by her findings, adding that the error rate in the firearm testing industry is around 2%.', 'It was Feb. 14, 2017, when the bodies of German and Williams were found near the Monon High Bridge area in rural Carroll County.', 'In November 2022, Allen was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and two counts of felony murder for his alleged connection to the case.', 'Allen’s trial is slated to run through Nov. 15 inside Carroll Circuit Court.', '', 'Richard Allen', '', '', '', 'First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.', '']"

She'd previously read that a girl had reported seeing a man on the trail on the afternoon of Feb. 13, 2017, when Abby and Libby went on a hike and were never heard from again. Allen, according to the document, told police three days after the girls disappeared that he was also on the trail that afternoon."", ""▶ A call, Snapchat photos, the video:Delphi trial offers timeline of girls' activities"", '""I thought there could be a correlation,"" Shank testified Thursday.', ""Shank and a few other witnesses took the stand Thursday, the sixth day of testimony in the double murder trial, telling jurors of the series of events that led to Allen's arrest on Oct. 26, 2022, just a little over a month after the volunteer clerk found the old tip sheet about Allen and alerted investigators about it."", ""Allen, who appeared in court in khaki pants and teal shirt, is charged with two counts of murder and two counts of murder while kidnapping the girls. His long-awaited trial comes more than seven years after the girls' deaths and two years since his arrest."", 'On Feb. 16, 2017, Allen self-reported to investigators that he was on the trail the same afternoon Abby and Libby disappeared. He was later contacted by Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain who was helping with the investigation at that time, and the two met at a grocery store.', 'Allen said he was on the trail between 1 and 3:30 p.m. on Feb. 13 and saw three girls near the Freedom Bridge as he headed toward the trail, Dulin testified.', 'Allen, though, was ultimately cleared, and the paper trail of his interaction with investigators was put away in a box.', ""On Sept. 21, 2022 ― a date Shank still remembers because it's her husband's death anniversary ― she came across a box of tip sheets in a desk drawer, she told jurors.

He went home to get a jacket and headed to the trail. He saw three girls near the Freedom Bridge as he was walking toward the trail. When he got to the high bridge, he looked down Deer Creek and watched the fish."", 'Mullin also told jurors that Allen said he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie.', 'At some point during the interview, Allen became agitated and walked out of the room, Mullin told jurors.', 'Mullin also said he asked Allen if he was ""Bridge Guy,"" the man seen in the infamous photo and video following Abby and Libby on the high bridge.', '""His response was, \'If the picture was taken with the girls\' camera, there was no way it was him,\'"" Mullin testified.', ""There were some inconsistencies in Allen's statements."", 'In 2017, he said he arrived at the trail around 1:30 p.m. and left around 3:30 p.m. In 2022, he said he arrived there around noon and was not on the trail later than 2 p.m.', ""Investigators searched Allen's home shortly after that interview with Mullin and Liggett.

But he said it ""shouldn\'t have been"" cleared.', 'During his cross-examination, defense attorney Bradley Rozzi seemed to suggest that Liggett wanted an arrest because it would benefit his career.
