A Georgian Dream victory is possible but not certain. ISW will offer assessments of Georgia's prospects subsequently if Georgian Dream does not win."", ""Georgia’s October 26, 2024, parliamentary elections will likely be one of the country’s most significant elections since its independence and present the Kremlin opportunities to derail Georgia's long-term Euro-Atlantic integration efforts and reestablish Russian influence over Georgia. The Georgian 2024 parliamentary elections will be the first since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the first since Georgia obtained EU candidate status in December 2023.[1] The election outcome will likely determine whether Georgia abandons its longstanding policy of aligning with the West and instead deepens economic and political ties with the Kremlin in line with the pro-Kremlin positions the ruling Georgian Dream party has increasingly taken. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili has said that the elections will have “existential” importance given the increasingly polarized state of Georgian politics and suggested that the elections will determine the fate of Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.[2]"", 'Georgia constitutionally enshrined its goal of joining the EU and NATO after the 2003 Rose Revolution — a pro-democracy revolution that sparked Georgia’s pro-Western trajectory. The elections after the Rose Revolution brought the pro-Western United National Movement (UNM) party to power, and its leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, became President of Georgia in 2004.[3] NATO supported Georgia\'s and Ukraine\'s aspirations for membership and their applications for a NATO membership action plan in the April 2008 Bucharest Declaration.[4] Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008 and occupied the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in part to derail Georgia\'s path to NATO membership and to enhance Russia\'s rapidly waning influence in the country. Georgia nevertheless continued Euro-Atlantic integration efforts following the Russo-Georgian War and the 2012 parliamentary elections, which transferred power to Georgian Dream. Georgian Dream initially continued Georgia\'s path towards the EU and NATO, but started to undo some of the progress Georgia had made in its Western aspirations shortly after coming to power.[5] Georgia signed an Association Agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area Agreement (DCFTA), with the EU in June 2014 triggering a set of Russian trade embargoes and information operations aimed at discrediting Georgia’s enhanced EU partnership.[6] Georgia and NATO agreed to deepen cooperation in September 2014 when the alliance endorsed the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package (SNGP) aimed at strengthening Georgia\'s defensive capabilities and developing closer security cooperation and interoperability with NATO members.[7] Georgia applied for EU membership in March 2022, and the EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023, although the European Council announced in June 2024 that Georgia\'s accession process was ""de facto halted"" due to ""backsliding on the steps set out in the Commission’s recommendation for candidate status.""[8] Georgian Dream has accelerated its attempts to derail Georgia\'s Euro-Atlantic trajectory following Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.', ""The EU has set key milestones that Georgia must pass before starting actual EU accession talks and progress towards membership can begin, including ensuring a free and fair parliamentary election in October 2024.[9] The October 2024 parliamentary elections will show the elected government's ability, willingness, and interest to advance this pro-Western agenda amid the increasingly Russia-friendly rhetoric that the Kremlin will try to exploit to expand Russian geopolitical influence in Georgia."", '', 'The Kremlin intends to leverage a Russia-friendly Georgian government to enhance strategic Russian interests and Moscow\'s geopolitical objectives of asserting control over Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia. Russia has repeatedly attempted to influence the domestic political landscape of neighboring states formerly part of the Russian Empire and/or the Soviet Union in an effort to exert influence, build a coalition of states opposing the US-led international order, and demonstrate its claimed great power status. Post-Soviet Russian leaders coined the expression ""near abroad"" to describe the former Soviet states as part of an effort to assert Russia\'s supposed right to view those states within its “sphere of influence.”[10] The ""near abroad"" spans the entirety of the post-Soviet space (and Russia\'s claimed sphere of influence reaches into Eastern Europe), and targets of this concept notably include Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Russia aims to establish pro-Kremlin governments in these states in order to secure many of its strategic foreign policy objectives. Russia has attempted to mold the domestic politics of many nearby countries with varying degrees of success since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia has used economic coercion, information operations, political pressures, and most notably military force to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries in its efforts to establish de facto Russian control over the foreign policy and local resources of nearby sovereign states. Russia has occupied Transnistria in Moldova since the fall of the Soviet Union, invaded Georgia and occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, and invaded Ukraine in 2014 to establish breakaway pro-Kremlin territories in eastern Ukraine through which it can project its influence in the victim state. (Russia illegally annexed Crimea outright in 2014 but did not annex occupied areas in Ukraine until September 2022.) Russia’s occupation of territories in these countries has generally followed domestic developments in these states impelling them away from Russian control and toward the West.', ""Russia has increasingly lost its influence in the South Caucasus in recent years, likely explaining its concerted efforts to re-establish this influence particularly through Georgia because of Georgia's pivotal strategic location. The South Caucasus — comprised of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia — has increasingly become an important region for global trade routes, particularly following Western sanctions related to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and has become a space of geopolitical competition and an energy transport hub.[11] Armenia, once one of Russia’s closest allies and one of the countries most dependent on Russia, has attempted to diversify its foreign policy alignments at the expense of Russian influence since its pro-democratic revolution in 2018.[12]"", ""This process accelerated after Azerbaijan launched the 2020 Nagorno-Karabkah War, during which Armenia expected to receive Russian support or at least support from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance, of which it is a member.[13] Moscow did not come to Armenia's assistance in that conflict despite the presence of Russian military bases and forces in Armenia because of the complexities of the relationships among Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkey. Russia responded to Armenian anger over the betrayal with information operations blaming Armenia for the war and defeat.[14] Russo-Armenian tensions have grown, leading Armenia to distance itself from security and political ties with Russia including effectively freezing its membership in the CSTO, against the backdrop of Armenia’s pro-democratic trajectory that has often negatively impacted the influence and interests of domestic pro-Kremlin elites.[15] Armenia has recently pursued closer economic, military, and socio-cultural ties with the EU, United States, and non-Western partners in order to reduce its dependence on Russia.[16] Armenian officials have also hinted at the possibility of a hypothetical future Armenian EU membership.[17]"", ""Azerbaijan, for its part, has become an increasingly important energy partner for the EU, particularly following Russia’s re-invasion of Ukraine, increasing its energy supplies to the EU through established trade routes involving Georgia.[18] Azerbaijan has pursued military and political relations with NATO member (and one of Azerbaijan's key patrons) Turkey and has only aligned itself with Russia on select issues while in general maintaining greater geopolitical autonomy facilitated by its geostrategic location on the Caspian Sea, oil-rich economy, and relationships with other powerful states.[19] Russia had limited influence in Georgia after the 2008 Russian invasion and occupation of Georgian territories, but souring Russo-Armenian relations and a more assertive Azerbaijani foreign policy have likely caused Moscow to try to use Georgia to regain influence in the South Caucasus. The Kremlin likely seeks to maintain its political power projection and influence over key trade routes that pass through the South Caucasus as well. Moscow will likely seek to leverage the Georgian 2024 parliamentary elections as a key opportunity."", ""The election results will be crucial in demonstrating Georgia's dedication to implementing reforms related to democracy, the rule of law, and judicial independence that are essential to deepening Georgia's Euro-Atlantic relations. Georgians will elect 150 members of parliament through a fully proportional system, with parties needing to surpass a five percent threshold to win seats.[20] This is the first time that Georgia will be conducting parliamentary elections through a fully proportional system after constitutional changes transitioning Georgia from a semi-presidential republic to a parliamentary system entered into force in 2018.[21] Georgian Dream expressed support for the 2020 elections to be held under a fully proportional system, although Georgian Dream appears to have postponed implementing the change until 2024.[22] The October 2024 election rules prohibit party blocs (pre-election groups of parties that can claim pluralities for the purpose of government formation) – unlike previous Georgian parliamentary elections – and an Edison Research poll indicates that the ruling Georgian Dream party is likely to secure a plurality of the votes.[23] Georgian Dream likely implemented constitutional changes in 2018 to limit party blocs and require a five percent threshold in order to make it more difficult for opposition parties to win seats in parliament or use coalitions as the basis of government formation. Several pro-Western opposition parties, including but not limited to the main opposition Unity - National Movement coalition, are expected to win enough seats in total to comprise a majority in the parliament, but the picture differs from a Georgian Dream-affiliated poll suggesting otherwise[24] Imprisoned former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili founded the pro-West United National Movement party, which leads the Unity - National Movement coalition. The pro-Western Strategy Aghmashenebeli and European Georgia parties are also a part of this coalition. The pro-Western opposition parties are currently fractured, however, reducing the likelihood of an outright defeat of the Georgian Dream party and the victory of a united pro-Western front in the Georgian parliament, possibly setting the stage for Georgian Dream to garner more support in the actual elections than the polls.[25] The Georgian Dream party has ruled Georgia since 2012 with clear or near parliamentary majority.[26]"", ""The Kremlin intends to exploit Georgian Dream to advance Russian influence in Georgia, although the exact extent of Moscow’s current relationship with and possible influence over Georgian Dream and its founder, former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is unclear. The degree of coordination between Kremlin and Georgian Dream is also unclear, and ISW is not prepared to assess the Kremlin's involvement in specific Georgian Dream policies or decisions, although ISW assesses that Ivanishvili very likely has Kremlin ties.[27] The Kremlin will likely attempt to leverage Georgian Dream's rhetoric and actions to strengthen Kremlin influence in Georgia and derail Georgia's path to Euro-Atlantic integration, whether or not the Kremlin is directly coordinating with Georgian Dream officials. Russian officials and milbloggers have launched information operations portraying Georgian Dream as the stable choice for Georgia’s future, while suggesting that the party’s victory could lead to territorial reconciliation, including potential compromises on Russian-occupied regions like Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[28] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hinted at this possibility on September 29, signaling that Russia may be open to withdrawing troops under certain conditions.[29] Russia has also eased trade and migration restrictions since 2012 when Georgian Dream came to power, suggesting Kremlin sympathies toward the party.[30]"", ""The assessments in this ISW report consider the most dangerous course of action that the Georgian Dream party can secure an electoral victory and achieve a parliamentary majority. This course of action, although uncertain, remains plausible and would have significant consequences for Georgia's political landscape and Russia’s role in Georgia and the broader South Caucasus. A Georgian Dream parliamentary majority would enable the party to implement its policies derailing Euro-Atlantic integration efforts, which the Kremlin will likely leverage to advance its influence in Georgia and the South Caucasus. Should Georgian Dream fail to gain control of the government, ISW will offer subsequent assessments and forecasts of Georgia's trajectory and Kremlin responses."", 'The Kremlin will likely attempt to leverage the ruling Georgian Dream party\'s increasingly pro-Russian narratives that justify Russian violence against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of post-Soviet countries such as Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. This shift in Georgian Dream rhetoric also offers a possible blueprint for deepening Russo-Georgia cooperation and potential reconciliation without Russian accountability, further distancing Georgia from its Western orientation. Georgian Dream has increasingly positioned itself as favoring the Kremlin, explicitly promoting enhanced Russia-Georgia bilateral ties while gradually distancing the country from its long-standing pro-Western trajectory. Georgian Dream has mirrored Kremlin-driven narratives to justify Russia’s aggression and enhance its voter base by fear mongering. On August 13, Georgian Dream accused Saakashvili of provoking the 2008 Russian invasion and subsequent illegal occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, blaming these Russian actions on Saakashvili\'s UNM party and unspecified ""external actors,"" likely alluding to Western states.[31] Georgian Dream\'s Political Council also pledged to ""inform"" the public about Saakashvili\'s and the UNM\'s allegedly ""treasonous actions,"" blaming them — rather than Russia — for the 2008 Russian invasion. This narrative echoes Kremlin information operations seeking to shift responsibility away from Russia, despite international condemnation of Russia\'s occupation of Georgian territory and violation of its territorial integrity. Russia has frequently alleged that pro-Western and pro-democratic leaders in neighboring countries collaborate with ""external forces,” presumably Western actors, to undermine Russian interests.[32] Russia has simultaneously engaged in lawfare as a means of legitimizing invasions, occupations, and hybrid operations against these sovereign states. A well-known Kremlin-linked Russian military blogger echoed Georgian Dream\'s remarks and reinforced earlier Kremlin accusations against Saakashvili and the West, indicating that this narrative might gain further momentum in the broader information space.[33]', 'Ivanishvili again attributed the 2008 Russian invasion to external actors and the UNM during an election rally held in September 2024 in Gori, a city bordering Russian-occupied South Ossetia.[34] Ivanishvili ostentatiously failed to mention Russia’s aggression and vowed that Georgian Dream would hold UNM accountable should Georgian Dream secure a majority in the upcoming 2024 elections. Ivanishvili notably stated that the Georgian government, under the Georgian Dream party, would seek ""reconciliation"" with South Ossetia and work towards ""forgiveness"" for the alleged violence that UNM caused. Ivanishvili’s rhetoric aligns with the broader Georgian Dream campaign, which portrays the party as a force for peace while framing the opposition, particularly the UNM, as agents of instability and war. Georgian Dream\'s rhetoric explicitly excuses Russian aggression in Georgia and plays into Russian information operations attempting to shift blame from Russia\'s violation of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity onto domestic actors. This Georgian Dream rhetorical line directly copies the Kremlin\'s position on Russia\'s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Russian invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and supports Moscow\'s claims that the domestic policies of post-Soviet states are by themselves sufficient casus belli to justify Russian invasions.', ""Georgian Dream’s electoral campaign has also recently used controversial visual propaganda, featuring images of buildings that the Russian military has destroyed in Ukraine, including the aftermath of the Mariupol Drama Theatre strike, under the caption “choose peace.”[35] These ads further emphasize Georgian Dream's supposed narrative of peace, contrasting it with the alleged war-mongering of opposition parties, all while aligning with pro-Kremlin rhetoric by implicitly blaming Ukraine for Russia's full-scale invasion and for the horrors and war crimes Russia has committed in the course of that invasion. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry (MFA) condemned on September 26 Georgian Dream's new campaign banners criticizing the instrumentalization of Ukrainian suffering.[36]"", 'The Georgian government has also reiterated standard Kremlin information operations accusing Georgian citizens who had served as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces of ""terrorism"" and ""conspiracy to overthrow the government"" in an attempt to portray associates of Ukrainian forces as threatening Georgian national security. The Georgian State Security Service (SUS or SSSG) reportedly recently summoned several Georgian citizens who had served as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces for questioning on charges of ""conspiracy to overthrow the government"" and ""terrorism"" on July 19.[37] Article 410 of Georgia\'s criminal code forbids mercenarism, but Georgian authorities notably did not charge these former volunteers under that article. The Kremlin routinely uses the narrative of a “violent coup” in Ukraine to misrepresent Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity and protests for Ukrainian European integration, and SUS activities increasingly mirror Kremlin rhetoric. The decisions by Georgian authorities and the SUS to question and charge its citizens who have fought in Ukraine indicate that the Georgian Dream ruling party likely intends to derail long-term Georgian efforts for Euro-Atlantic integration, which plays into continued Russian hybrid operations to divide, destabilize, and weaken Georgia.[38]', 'Georgian Dream has already forwarded pro-Russian policies and enacted laws that mirror Kremlin-style governance, thereby setting conditions to strengthen relations with Russia while distancing Georgia from its Western allies. The Georgian parliament passed a “foreign agents” law in May 2024 requiring NGOs receiving at least 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as ""foreign agents,"" with penalties for non-compliance.[39] The law bears a strong resemblance to Russia\'s foreign agents law that also requires civil society bodies to register as “foreign agents” to let the Kremlin monitor and restrain pro-democracy, anti-Kremlin activities in Russia.[40] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov defended Georgia\'s Parliamentary majority for reintroducing the foreign agents law, stating that it is normal for sovereign states to prevent foreign interference in their domestic politics.[41] EU High Representative Josep Borrell warned in March 2023 and May 2024 that the adoption of the bill would ""negatively impact"" Georgia\'s membership prospects — likely the desired effect from the Kremlin\'s perspective.[42] Georgian parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili announced on October 3, 2024, that he had signed a ""family values"" law, echoing Kremlin-style initiatives to implement restrictive measures under the guise of protecting ""traditional values"" from alleged foreign threats.[43]', 'Georgian Dream announced on August 20 most significantly that it will ban all pro-Western opposition groups — particularly targeting the main opposition party, UNM — if it secures a constitutional majority (113 out of 150 parliamentary seats, as opposed to 76 seats to create a parliamentary majority).[44] Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze stated that the ban would include all major opposition parties essentially leaving Georgia with a one-party parliament.[45] Such a ban would eviscerate representative government in Georgia and presumably establish the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party permanently in control.', ""Georgia has notably refrained from joining Western and international sanctions against Russia despite supporting UN resolutions and offering limited rhetorical support for Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion.[46] Then-Prime Minister and leader of the Georgian Dream party Irakli Garibashvili publicly rejected the idea of sanctions in February 2022 and argued that they were ineffective and would harm Georgia’s economy.[47] Members of the Russian Federation Council's International Affairs Committee subsequently praised Garibashvili's position.[48] Although Georgia’s economy is indeed dependent on Russia in key sectors such as trade, tourism, and remittances, Georgian Dream officials have not only highlighted these economic realities but also leaned on pro-Russian rhetoric to justify their refusal to join international sanctions.[49] Georgian Dream rhetoric has often mirrored Russian talking points, downplaying the effectiveness of sanctions and adopting a more sympathetic stance toward Moscow, rather than focusing solely on Georgia's economic interests and needs."", ""The Kremlin will likely leverage success in realigning Georgian foreign policy with Moscow to advance Russian political, military, and economic influence in the South Caucasus and Black Sea region and leverage these areas to support its war effort in Ukraine. Since Georgian Dream came to power in 2012, and particularly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, trade relations between Russia and Georgia have notably increased. Russia has emerged as one of Georgia's largest import and export partners, ranking among the top five in both categories.[50] Russia gradually lifted previous trade embargoes, including those on Georgian wine, signaling its willingness to cooperate with the Georgian Dream party despite the fact that the two countries have not had formal diplomatic ties since the 2008 Russian invasion.[51] Transparency International's Georgian bureau reported in February 2024 that Russia accounted for 10.8 percent of Georgia's total exports and 13.3 percent of its total imports.[52] The study also noted a large increase in Russian businesses registered in Georgia since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian citizens have been able stay in Georgia without a visa for a year since 2012 — one of the most liberal residency laws for Russian citizens in the world.[53] Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted the ban on direct flights between Russia and Georgia in May 2023 and abolished the visa regime for Georgian citizens to stay in Russia first in 2023 and then expanded the scope to include Georgian labor migrants in October 2024.[54] "", 'Russia may seek to exploit improved economic relations with Georgia to expand its sanctions evasion capabilities and mitigate the impacts of Western and international sanctions. Reports suggest that Georgia\'s increased trade with Russia and the flow of goods through its borders could be aiding Russia\'s war effort in Ukraine. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\'s (RFE/RL) Georgian Bureau, echoing a February 2024 US Senate Investigation, reported on March 5, 2024, an analysis of Georgia\'s import and export data from the past two years.[55] The analysis indicated that Georgian imports of crucial Western dual-use ""critical components"" required for Russia\'s military operations have significantly surged since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine suggesting that Russia may be acquiring them via Georgia. The Georgian government denied these allegations noting that the importation of dual-use commodities was well below the levels of pre-COVID pandemic years and that the surge was simply a sign of economic recovery and re-establishment of trade.[56] A Georgian opposition outlet noted, however, that while the Georgian government’s claims are likely true, Georgian re-exports of critical dual-use components have notably increased to countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan through which Russia has acquired dual-use materials.[57] A Georgian Dream victory in future elections is likely to continue this trend, positioning Georgia as one of the bases for possible Russian sanctions evasion and further entrenching Russia\'s economic influence in the South Caucasus. This deepening relationship risks undermining international efforts to isolate Moscow economically and could shift the region’s balance of power in favor of Russia.', ""The Kremlin will likely seek to leverage the potential of a Russia-friendly Georgian government to secure long-term access to Georgian territorial waters and ports in the Black Sea after Ukraine's Summer-Fall 2023 strike campaign against the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) successfully curtailed Russian naval operations in the Black Sea. Ukrainian missile and drone strikes targeting BSF assets in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea, in Summer and Fall 2023 forced Russia to relocate vessels to Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai. Ukrainian drones also targeted Novorossiysk in August 2023, demonstrating Ukraine's growing ability to disrupt Russian operations across the Black Sea.[58] Russia subsequently began to shift some naval assets to the eastern Black Sea and to expand the small Russian military port in occupied Ochamchire, Abkhazia. Georgian leadership, including former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, condemned Russia’s actions in occupied Ochamchire, and the Georgian MFA called the port a violation of sovereignty and urged compliance with the 2008 EU-mediated ceasefire.[59] Breakaway Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania announced on October 5, 2023 an agreement with Russia to construct a permanent naval base in occupied Ochamchire[60] Deputy Chief of the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Major General Vadym Skibitskyi reported on October 23 that Russian authorities started dredging and constructing port infrastructure in Ochamchire in order to construct a base for some warships currently stationed in occupied Crimea, which could not be redeployed to Novorossiysk[61] The base's expansion will reportedly take over two and a half years to complete, but the Russian BSF reportedly began utilizing the Ochamchire port even before full construction, suggesting the urgency for Russia of gaining access to Georgian Black Sea facilities. International naval activities-focused outlet Naval News reported in July 2024 that satellite imagery from July 2024 purportedly showing a Russian Project 22870 support ship docked at Ochamchire, indicating Russia’s commitment using the port.[62] The Russian military is likely intending to develop the existing port into a subsidiary rather than a main base since the surrounding terrain largely consists of sandy beaches unsuitable for the construction of naval infrastructure.[63] Russia might seek to use this small port for small-scale operations and to allow a limited number of vessels to evade Ukrainian strikes, even though Georgian officials have thus far opposed these actions. A Russia-friendly Georgian government that ceases to voice meaningful criticisms of the Russian port in occupied Abkhazia would likely allow Russian authorities to more rapidly expand port infrastructure with fewer denunciations from the Georgian government and the international community."", ""The Kremlin may also be interested in long-term access to larger Georgian Black Sea ports to expand Russia's economic and military influence in the Black Sea region. The Kremlin may attempt to leverage a Russia-friendly Georgian government to gain access to larger Georgian ports such as Batumi and the planned deep seaport in Anaklia. A Russian flagged cargo ship entered Batumi Port in July 2022, and the Georgian Maritime Transport Agency and Economy Ministry stated that international sanctions against Russia for its war in Ukraine did not apply to the ship or the shipping company.[64] A Russian cruise ship attempted to dock in Batumi Port in July 2023, raising concerns and causing controversy about Russia’s increasing presence in Georgian territorial waters.[65] Russia likely has long-term interests in expanding commercial and military access to larger Georgian Black Sea ports that can dock large military and commercial vessels — unlike the Ochamchire port — in order to address current Russian vulnerabilities and expand influence in the Black Sea region at large. These ports offer no military support and limited commercial support in the short term but over time could play a key role in Russia’s broader Black Sea strategy. If Georgian Dream's policies favor rapprochement with Moscow, it could further enable Russian commercial and naval operations in the Black Sea. Georgian Dream's pre-election rhetoric emphasizing reconciliation with Russia and downplaying Moscow’s responsibility for the 2008 war could rhetorically set conditions for increased for Russian access to regional ports and enhanced Russian influence in this sector of the Black Sea."", ""The Kremlin may seek to secure long-term access to Georgian territory, airspace, and ports by normalizing relations with Georgia though negotiating the return of Georgia's occupied territories. RFE/RL, citing unspecified Russian and Georgian analysts, reported in June 2024 that Russia could negotiate a return of occupied Georgian territories under the condition that Georgia renounces its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.[66] ISW cannot independently confirm the veracity of the claims. The floating of such rumors, however, clearly mirrors the ongoing Russian demands in Ukraine intended to coerce Ukraine to give up its Euro-Atlantic and particularly NATO aspirations in return for Russia's cessation of its invasion.[67] Russia notably did not attempt to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russia after illegally seizing them despite select Russian officials' threats to do so since 2008.[68] Russia likely refrained from annexing the occupied territories in order to attempt to integrate the Russian-controlled territories into the Georgian state as a means whereby Russia could exert direct control over Tbilisi. The Kremlin attempted to leverage the Russian-preferable 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements with Ukraine to integrate Russian occupied territory into the Ukrainian state to destroy an independent Ukrainian state and bring it under Russian control.[69] Russia would likely leverage such an agreement with Georgia to justify its occupation of and influence over Ukraine and Moldova, if Georgia and Russia started such negotiations, moreover, using Tbilisi's surrender as a model for Kyiv and Chișinău.[70] Russia could instrumentalize Georgia’s coerced renunciation of Euro-Atlantic integration to enhance its influence in Georgia and particularly Georgian territorial waters and infrastructure in the Black Sea without facing meaningful domestic and Western pushback if such rumors are accurate. Russia could also leverage land and air routes passing through Georgia to facilitate sanction evasion schemes and expand access to trade routes, including to Armenia and Iran. Rumors suggesting Georgian territorial reconciliation, however, could also be a part of Georgian Dream campaign effort to sway voters in their favor or a Russian information operation intended to affect the outcome of Georgian elections as the Russian Foreign Ministry continues to portray warming Georgia-Russia relations as false.[71]"", '', ""Russia's strategic efforts to enhance its economic influence in Georgia could serve a broader agenda of infiltrating key elements of the Middle Corridor, an informal but increasingly vital trade route connecting Europe and Asia circumventing Russia. The Middle Corridor offers a promising alternative to traditional trade routes between Asia and Europe amid increasing Western and international sanctions against Russia. With worsening EU-Russia relations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation in the Middle East, the EU is eager to reduce reliance on Russian-controlled and other unstable trade routes, making the Middle Corridor, a set of trade routes which passes directly through the South Caucasus, increasingly important for European trade and security.[72] This trade route, supported by major Western infrastructure investments and the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Belt and Road Initiative, has significantly reduced transit times. The Middle Corridor cuts transit times to 14 to 18 days, compared to 19 days through Russia or 22 to 37 days via southern sea routes, making it an attractive option.[73] Cargo volumes through this corridor increased by nearly 65 percent in early 2023, surpassing one million tons. Georgia has emerged as a pivotal hub in this network, playing a vital role in transporting oil, gas, and goods along the Middle Corridor. Russia’s growing interest in Georgian ports, its occupation of Georgian territories, and its increasing trade ties with Georgia pose significant risks. These efforts could enable Russia to destabilize the Middle Corridor, using Georgia to undermine the trade route and reassert its influence in the region. The success of the Middle Corridor hinges on the stability and security of Georgia and the surrounding region, leaving it vulnerable to Russian interference, despite significant investments by the PRC and the EU. Russia could indirectly disrupt this key trade route and undermine efforts to establish a stable alternative to Russian-controlled corridors if Russia gains influence over the Georgian government."", ""A Georgian Dream parliamentary victory giving it a majority and the subsequent possible pursuit of an overtly Russia-friendly Georgian foreign policy would be a major setback for the West, as it would enable Russia to enhance its war effort, bolster its economic capacity, and showcase soft power, all the expense of Western interests. A Caucasus Barometer survey conducted by the Caucasus Research Resource Centers (CRRC) in April and May 2024 reported that 70 percent of Georgians support EU membership and 57 percent of Georgians support NATO membership.[74] Despite this widespread support for Western integration, the policies and rhetoric of the ruling Georgian Dream party have already caused Western countries to limit aid and cooperation with Georgia. The US Department of Defense (DoD) reported on July 5 that it would indefinitely postpone the Noble Partner joint military exercise with Georgia due to the Georgian government’s accusations that the US and Western entities pressured Georgia to open a second front against Russia and participated in coup attempts against the ruling Georgian Dream party.[75] In light of these allegations, the US also initiated a comprehensive review of its bilateral relations with Georgia.[76] EU Ambassador to Georgia Pawel Herczynski announced on July 9 that the EU had suspended Georgia's accession process.[77] The EU delegation in Georgia announced on October 8 that the country would lose 121 million euros ($130 million) in EU funding due to democratic regression.[78] The European Parliament overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on October 9 condemning Georgia's democratic backsliding and threats to political pluralism.[79] The resolution called on the European Commission to assess Georgia’s adherence to visa-free regime criteria and urged EU member states to impose targeted sanctions on Ivanishvili. UK Ambassador to Georgia Gareth Ward announced on October 15 that the UK had frozen its annual security dialogue with Georgia and canceled defense talks over concerns about the country's democratic backsliding.[80] This suspension comes after widespread criticism of Georgian Dream’s legislative actions. Such developments indicate that the trajectory Georgia is on — should Georgian Dream secure a majority — will not only likely reshape the country’s EU and NATO ambitions but also fortify Russia's influence at the expense of the aspirations of the Georgian people and Western strategic interests in the region."", 'A parliamentary victory for a more Russia-friendly party in Georgia would represent a significant soft power victory for Russia, showcasing its ability to coerce neighboring countries and deter them from pursuing Western integration paths in the long run. It would also show that the Kremlin is able to leverage the invasion and partial occupation of neighboring states to shape their political orientations. Increasing Kremlin alignment in a post-Soviet country that has long sought Western integration would further cement the long-standing Russian portrayal of its now-sovereign former colonies as vassal states – a framing that seeks to deter both domestic interest in Western cooperation and Western willingness to pursue closer relations with these countries. A victorious Georgian Dream that pursues more Kremlin-friendly policies would also demonstrate a remarkable Kremlin capability to reverse decades of European integration efforts in a country that Russia has attacked and victimized, which would likely embolden Kremlin efforts to pursue hybrid operations and open aggression against Ukraine, Moldova, and other post-Soviet countries.', ""The Kremlin's attempts to assert control over Georgia through hybrid operations are part of a broader coordinated Kremlin effort to gain control over post-Soviet countries to form a coerced coalition of vassal states against the West. The Kremlin's efforts to gain suzerainty over Georgia are part of an interconnected effort to use hybrid and military means to destabilize Ukraine and Moldova and forcibly coerce them into Russia's asserted sphere of influence. Russia could achieve its objective of influencing Georgia through soft power and non-kinetic hybrid means should the Kremlin succeed in leveraging a potential Russia-friendly majority in the Georgian Parliament. Such a success through soft power and non-kinetic hybrid means would likely inform future Kremlin calculus and decision-making on operations against target countries including, but not limited to, Ukraine and Moldova."", '', '[1] https://www.consilium dot europa.eu/en/policies/enlargement/georgia/', '[2] https://civil dot ge/archives/621729', '[3] https://www.dw com/en/georgia-the-thorns-of-the-rose-revolution/a-67536678', '[4] https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_8443.htm', '[5] https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/georgia-russia-internal/georgia-and-russia-why-and-how-save ;

Putin is saying to Ukraine sure, fight us. You die, we die - but in the end you will be like Georgia.'"", 'There is, however, one factor the scheming oligarch apparently did not anticipate – Gen Z. ', 'Far from the apathy he expected after years of rot, hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets to protest his plan. ', 'The crowds were the largest the country has ever seen – bigger even than those that sparked the Rose Revolution. ', ""Ivanishvili was forced to deploy 'domestic terror' against his own people to push through the 'foreign agents' law in May, almost certainly stifling any hopes of winning a free and fair election."", 'All this left the Boa Constrictor in a bind. Unable to win fairly, rigging the elections could spark a revolution.', 'In such a scenario, an intervention from Moscow is unlikely. Both parties would be unwilling to invite Russian troops to uphold order as it would harden Western resolve in Ukraine and unite Georgians. ', 'That is if they could even spare the troops, which is unlikely given their struggles with Kyiv.', ""Crucially, the use of violence to betray the people's will prompted the EU and the US to threaten the ruling party with sanctions. "", 'A European travel ban would be particularly devastating to Ivanishvili and his four jet-setting children, and signal to his Georgian Dream minions that their Messiah might be human. (He promised them the West would not follow through). ', ""Most importantly, restricting the movements and money of these politicians would signal to the people, so disheartened after the first failure of mass protests in Georgia's modern history, that their voices had been heard."", ""But over the past five months, Europe has allowed Ivanishvili to wriggle free. America has largely pulled its punches too, however at least Washington hit a few dozen Georgian Dream members with travel bans and has reportedly debanked Ivanishvili's family."", ""Across the country Georgian Dream election billboards have been erected with pictures of Ukrainian cities destroyed by Russian bombs under the simple caption: 'Choose peace'"", 'In Brussels, nothing of any note has materialised. Despite the rhetoric, no European country has even imposed a travel ban.

The man behind Georgia’s pro-Putin turn,https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-man-behind-georgias-pro-putin-turn/,"['', '', '‘He wasn’t my first billionaire, so I kind of knew my way around him’, a senior US diplomat who plied his trade in Georgia told me at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. ‘And the weirdest thing? He was starry-eyed about Nato and the West in the beginning. I remember at one meeting with a US delegation, he outright asked, “So what I” – notice the I, not we – “what I gotta do to get into Nato by 2016?” We all looked at each other, then gave him the usual line about democratic reforms and so on. He listened for a while, then interrupted, “But what do I really have to do?”’', 'The billionaire in question is Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia’s richest and most influential figure. The man who, by sheer force of his vast fortune, became a pivotal figure in Georgian politics, a de facto ruler in all but name. After making most of his fortune as one of the ‘made men’ of Russian perestroika, he returned to Georgia, first as a reclusive billionaire funding art and science (and the government itself), only to run a tour de force of an election campaign in 2012 that saw him and his party, the Georgian Dream, oust the increasingly unpopular Mikheil Saakashvili and his United National Movement. Ever since, even now he is out of government, Ivanishvili is the man who steers the country, whether formally or behind the scenes.', 'In the last few years, however, particularly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there’s been a marked shift in Ivanishvili’s approach. No longer content to rule from the shadows, he has steered Georgia, via his ruling Georgian Dream party, toward a pro-Russia stance. Mass protests erupted as his government moved to adopt a Kremlin-inspired ‘foreign agents’ law, sparking fears of a looming authoritarian turn. He has grown embittered, concludes Lincoln Mitchell, his erstwhile informal adviser turned critic.', '‘Bidzina has enough of Homo Sovieticus in him that he believed Russia was going to win that war and therefore didn’t want to go all in with the West’, he told me. With Georgian Dream increasingly tilting toward Moscow, Ivanishvili’s ‘long game’ has been sparking protests and unrest as his party introduces policies that seem plucked straight from the Kremlin. But the oligarch’s goals, Mitchell warns, remain fluid, subject to his whims and grudges.', 'For many Georgians, today’s election feels like a referendum on the country’s future. Will it solidify Georgia’s pro-European identity or steer it further toward Moscow? And among the ranks of Ivanishvili’s allies-turned-enemies, there is one that is standing particularly tall: former prime minister Giorgi Gakharia. Standing on the frontlines of Georgia’s upcoming election with his party For Georgia, Gakharia is calling out what he sees as the creeping authoritarianism of his former boss. For him, these elections aren’t just a referendum on Ivanishvili’s leadership – they’re a defining moment for Georgia’s democratic future. I met with Gakharia to discuss the stakes of this critical election, and the long shadows cast by his former patron. ', '‘The choice is simple,’ he tells me, with his trademark resolute expression. ‘This is about democracy or autocracy. Our geopolitical future is at stake, and with it, our European identity.’', 'Since leaving Georgian Dream in 2021, Gakharia has become one of Ivanishvili’s most outspoken critics. This election, he insists, could determine whether Georgia’s EU membership aspirations are set in motion or shelved indefinitely. His departure from the ruling party was, he acknowledges, a moment of reckoning: ‘I was Ivanishvili’s most effective tool in consolidating power. That was my mistake. I deeply, deeply regret it. I owe it to the [Georgian] people to set things right.’ He also claims he was duped, personally lied to by Ivanishvili: ', '‘My deal with him was, when I agreed on second nomination in 2020, I had the list of structural reforms, also agreed with our American and European partners. Our deal was – if you are OK with these reforms, then I will stay. His obligation was that he would leave politics, he promised that, made public statements. We shook hands and in three weeks’ time, I began to realise I was lied to. When I understood that he left politics only to rule the country in the gray zone, I said, well, this won’t do, thank you very much, I am done and I resigned.’', 'But going up against Ivanishvili is fraught with personal risk. The oligarch has publicly vowed to prosecute Gakharia if his Georgian Dream party wins. Gakharia, however, remains unfazed. ‘This isn’t the first time he’s threatened me,’ he shrugs. ‘He’s done it privately before. It was: leave the country, leave politics, or else! Now he’s gone public. Largely because he is afraid. Well, I won’t be intimidated.’', 'Gakharia acknowledges that his time in power was marred by controversial incidents', 'For Gakharia, Ivanishvili’s motives have become clear over time. ‘He needs an indefinite stay in power to protect himself’, Gakharia argues. ‘And to keep control over his business empire.’ Georgian Dream, he says, increasingly echoes Moscow’s tactics of media control and political suppression, tactics that may yield short-term stability but fail to sustain a country like Georgia. Ivanishvili’s plan is to turn Georgia into his own version of Azerbaijan, Gakharia claims, but he thinks it’s wishful thinking. ‘It cannot be done’, he says. ‘Georgia doesn’t have gas and oil. Georgia has only one resource: its people.’', 'If elected, Gakharia’s strategy would be to avoid provoking Moscow, whose influence remains significant. Russia may not roll tanks into Tbilisi again, he says, but their indirect support of a pro-Moscow ‘gray zone’ serves Putin’s agenda well enough. He insists that his vision of a European Georgia does not mean breaking off dialogue with Russia, but placing it on the foundation of a secure partnership with the West. ‘We can’t stop talking to Russia,’ he concedes. ‘But we need to do it from a position of strength, with Nato and EU backing.’', 'Reflecting on his tenure, Gakharia acknowledges that his time in power was marred by controversial incidents, notably the 20 June protests, where his administration faced criticism for using excessive force. Some call him the ‘eye-gouger,’ a nickname that he got after the June clashes, when several people lost their eyes. ‘Yes, mistakes were made on a technical level, and yes, in the short term, it damaged my reputation,’ he says. ‘But ideologically, my priority was to protect the constitution and prevent the kind of street revolutions that undermine rule of law. In the long term, I believe it was critical to stop the mindset that every political disagreement should be solved on the streets.’', 'This campaign, Gakharia knows, is as much about Ivanishvili’s increasingly autocratic grip on Georgia as it is about salvaging what is left of the country’s rapidly dwindling ambitions of EU/Nato membership. ‘We have a rare window of opportunity to begin EU accession negotiations,’ he insists. ‘If we miss it now, we may not get another chance for decades.’ Much of Georgia’s eventual fate will also depend on the war in Ukraine. Gakharia thinks that the war will end with some sort of an agreement between democracies and autocracies, a grand arrangement, and Georgia needs to be on the right – western – side of that deal. ', '‘We will be a part of that deal, question is which side we will end up on. The right side, with the West, or left alone, face-to-face with Russia. We already paid for our ticket with our blood, in 2008. But our government seems intent on forfeiting it, just so that they can stay in power and continue corrupting themselves and the country with it.’', 'Lincoln Mitchell believes the stakes for Ivanishvili are equally high. ‘He’s unpredictable, capricious, and his grip on the government is intensely personal.’ This mercurial nature, Mitchell warns, could be Georgia’s undoing. ‘How far can they [Georgian Dream] go? As far as they need to. The violence we’ve seen so far may continue, and much like Putin or any authoritarian leader, as long as Ivanishvili thinks he can win, he will continue.’', 'Subscribe to unlock 3 months of unlimited access for just £3', 'Already a subscriber?

"As Georgia votes, fears of a stolen election and a return to the Kremlin’s orbit loom large",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/europe/georgia-election-russia-europe-intl/index.html,"['', 'At the Joseph Stalin Museum in Gori, the small Georgian town where the Soviet dictator was born, a line of guides is waiting to tell you the story of the local boy who made it big.', 'They can list the birthdays of Stalin’s family and recite the poems he wrote as a schoolboy (for Stalin “could have been a poet, but chose to be a great leader”). But on other things, they are less exact. Of the millions killed in the gulag, “mistakes were made.” Of show trials, they have little to say.', 'So revered is Stalin by some that when the government thought it time to remove his towering statue in 2010, they did so unannounced at night, lest locals protest. But while some older voters in rural towns like Gori might harbor fond memories of life under communism and pine for a Soviet past, they seemed set to be swept away by younger generations who have grown up knowing nothing but democracy, and who are happy to see Stalin consigned to history’s dustbin.', 'Now, as voters in the Caucasus nation cast their ballots in Saturday’s parliamentary election, the specter of authoritarianism looms large once again.', 'Many observers fear the ruling Georgian Dream party will resort to anything to stay in power. It has buried the liberal values it espoused when it took office 12 years ago and effectively torpedoed Georgia’s bid to join the European Union. Its founder, the secretive oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has threatened to imprison his political rivals after the election and ban the main opposition party.', 'After spending years in the shadows, Ivanishvili – who made his billions in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union and served as Georgia’s prime minister from 2012 to 2013 – returned late last year as the party’s honorary chairman and has since given a string of conspiracy-tinged speeches. He claims Georgia is being controlled by a foreign “pseudo-elite” and that the opposition belongs to a “Global War Party” bent on dragging the country into conflict with Russia. This year, Georgian Dream pushed through a Kremlin-style “foreign agent” law, which critics say aims to shut down watchdogs who call the government to account.', 'For many, Ivanishvili’s rhetoric is eerily reminiscent of the past from which many Georgians are keen to escape. And the anti-Western posturing of Georgian Dream, along with the country’s controversial foreign agent law, directly mirrors President Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on domestic political opposition in neighboring Russia.', '“It’s incredible how much of this old Bolshevik, Stalinist language is back. Everybody’s a traitor, everybody’s a foreign agent,” Natalie Sabanadze, a fellow at the London think-tank Chatham House and former Georgian ambassador to the EU, told CNN. She described some of the statements made by Georgian Dream officials as a “copy-paste” of those from Stalin’s show trials. “Have people forgotten what it was like?” Sabanadze asks.', 'In a speech last month in Gori, Ivanishvili also broke a taboo in Georgian society. He said Georgia should apologize for the 2008 war with Russia, for which many Georgians blame Moscow. Russia fought the five-day war in support of pro-Kremlin separatists in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, just north of Gori. Combined with Abkhazia, another breakaway region, Russia today de facto occupies 20% of Georgia’s territory.', 'Ivanishvili said apologizing to Russia would help preserve “12 years of uninterrupted peace” the country has enjoyed under Georgian Dream’s leadership, which he warned the opposition could jeopardize. The message has some appeal to his rural base but sparked a political firestorm.', 'Mikheil Saakashvili, who was Georgia’s president during the war but has been imprisoned since 2021 for abuse of power while in office, called the comments a “betrayal.”', 'Younger, more pro-European Georgians were also outraged. Their earliest memories are not of easier lives under communism, but of Russian tanks rolling into Gori and towards the capital, Tbilisi. Walking out of the Stalin Museum – past his personal railway carriage, past the hut in which he was born – it is easy to find buildings still scarred with bullet holes from the 2008 war. Many buildings still lie in ruins, while Stalin Avenue has been kept pristine.', 'For these Georgians, Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 rekindled memories of Russian aggression in their own country. They want nothing more than for Georgia to slip from the Kremlin’s orbit and continue its march toward a European future.', 'But many fear the government is now heading in the opposite direction, and that Georgia could be on the cusp of returning to the one-party rule from which it escaped a generation ago.', '“The election will be crucial,” Davit Mzhavanadze, a researcher at the Governance Monitoring Center in Tbilisi, told CNN. “If this government keeps power, Georgia will become more Belarusian than European.”', 'At a press conference in Tbilisi on Thursday, Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili – a pro-Western but largely ceremonial figure who has urged Georgians to vote against the government – said she “rules out any outcome other than a victory for the pro-European forces,” citing polls which routinely show that only around a third of the public support Georgian Dream.', 'A question puzzling many is why the formerly center-left Georgian Dream has made a sudden authoritarian pivot.', 'The party’s origin was unusual. It takes its name from a rap song by Ivanishvili’s son, Bera. Although some suspected Ivanishvili – whose net worth is equivalent to about a quarter of the country’s GDP – might pursue a pro-Russian path, during his brief premiership he tacked close to Europe and even promised eventual NATO membership.', '“A modern civil society has been a cherished goal of the Georgian people since we regained our independence 20 years ago,” Ivanishvili wrote in an email to then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012, subsequently leaked. “Unfortunately, old habits are hard to overcome.”', 'That has proved true for his own government, Sabanadze of Chatham House told CNN. Her career is a measure of Georgian Dream’s ideological shifts. As recently as 2021, Sabanadze served as Georgia’s ambassador to the EU. Now, she says she’s troubled by the party’s shift to the right.', 'Having abandoned its liberal origins, Sabanadze said, the party is now “clearly copying” the model of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest this year, Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze praised Orban as a “role model,” parroting his claims to defend “homeland, language and faith.” The government has also passed legislation curbing LGBTQ+ rights.', 'But now it is poised to go much further. Ivanishvili has promised a “Nuremberg trial” against members of the opposition, who have been subject to increasing persecution. During street protests in Tbilisi against the foreign agent law, Levan Khabeishvili – chair of the pro-Western United National Movement (UNM) – said he was brutally beaten by police. He appeared the next day in parliament, his face blackened and swollen.', 'Khabeishvili has since stepped down as chairman, citing the effect the beating had on his health. He said the assault was meant to intimidate Georgia’s opposition. “Ivanishvili has a Soviet mentality. He’s a Soviet guy,” he told CNN.', 'The Georgian government did not respond to a request for comment.', 'A consequence of Russia’s war in Ukraine was the EU’s decision to offer Georgia candidate status. Brussels, keen to stem Russia’s influence in former Soviet countries, put Georgia – along with Ukraine and Moldova – on an accelerated path to membership.', 'Many say this was despite Georgian Dream, rather than because of it. During protests against the “foreign agent” law, the images of citizens waving EU flags being buffeted back by water cannons put pressure on Brussels to reward the Georgian people, of whom more than 80% support EU membership, polls show.', 'Whether Ivanishvili wanted candidate status is not clear. Joining the EU would require cleaning up the country’s judiciary and giving up power if Georgian Dream is voted out on Saturday. His opponents doubt he is willing to do this.', 'Under the country’s new proportional voting system, Khabeishvili of the UNM says Georgia’s fragmented opposition will have no trouble forming a coalition after the election. But he fears that Ivanishvili will seek to cling to power after an election loss.', 'If this happens, he predicts huge protests in Tbilisi and throughout the country. Here, things could get ugly. Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, said in August that Georgia’s Western allies are plotting a coup to remove Georgian Dream from power. He warned Russia will be on standby to prevent this.', 'For Sabanadze, the stakes could not be higher: How Georgians vote on Saturday, and how the government responds, will determine whether the country remains on a path to Europe or becomes more like Belarus.', '“When I was in Brussels, I thought that Georgia would never become an authoritarian state again, because it’s just something that we find very difficult to accept,” she said. “Georgians will put up a fight. The Belarus scenario will not happen easily.”', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.\nCNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.', '', '', '']"

', 'Close watchers of Georgian politics say Saturday’s election is a pivotal moment for a country that, like other former Soviet republics, has found itself pulled between a future aligned with Russia or the West, and where political polarization has become pronounced.', '“All sides agree the upcoming elections are a critical moment for Georgia’s future,” Ketevan Chachava, non-resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said in commentary earlier this month.', '“The governing Georgian Dream Party’s rhetoric toward the West — its founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, calls the West the “party of war” and says it forced Georgia and Russia into confrontation — has alarmed pro-European groups, international partners and observers, highlighting a broader struggle between pro-European and pro-Russian forces,” she noted.', 'The Georgian Dream-led government has enacted various policies of late that have gone against the grain of its previous ambitions to join NATO and the European Union and have instead aligned it with Moscow, with the introduction of what critics and opposition parties decry as repressive laws stifling media freedoms, civil society and the rights of sexual minorities.', 'The introduction of a Russia-style law on foreign influence in May — and a brutal police crackdown on subsequent protests at the bill — was particularly contentious, and seen as the most obvious example of Georgian Dream’s slide toward a Kremlin-like style of governance.', 'The government has since doubled down on perceived Western influences in domestic politics, saying it would seek to ban all pro-Western opposition groups if it secures a constitutional majority in this weekend’s election.', 'Despite its increasingly anti-Western rhetoric, Georgian Dream insists it still wants Georgia to join the EU and its election posters feature the party’s logo along with the symbol of the EU.', 'The party’s founder and de facto leader, the billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has said the country should only become a member of the EU “through dignity,” and must not go to war with or sanction Russia, or harm its economy in the process.', 'Polls suggest the majority, around 80%, of Georgia’s population support membership of the EU, with around 67% supporting membership of NATO, putting a significant proportion of Georgia’s 3.8 million people at odds with a government that has appeared to turn its back on those aspirations.', 'The Georgian government’s perceived backtracking on human rights and democratic principles have put it in direct conflict with Washington and the EU, which have imposed sanctions on Georgian officials, and put Tbilisi’s EU accession talks and funding on ice as a result. It’s a rapid fall from grace as Georgia only obtained EU candidate status in December 2023.', 'European lawmakers warned this month that “democracy is at risk” in Georgia, and have told Georgian Dream it must “roll back undemocratic legislation in order to make progress in its relations with the EU,” a statement from the European Parliament earlier in October noted.', 'European lawmakers see the upcoming parliamentary elections as “decisive in determining Georgia’s future democratic development and geopolitical choice” and its ability to make progress on its EU member state candidacy, the European Parliament noted.', 'Analysts have widely described Georgia’s election as a referendum “for or against Europe,” but it could also be viewed as a vote for or against remaining within Russia’s sphere of influence and closer geopolitical and economic relations with Moscow.', 'The specter of Georgia’s former Soviet overlord certainly looms large over the vote, with Moscow seen to have exerted a stronger influence over the ruling Georgian Dream party in recent years, and particularly since it launched its invasion of fellow former Soviet republic and pro-Western Ukraine in February 2022.', 'Georgian Dream refrained from joining Western and international sanctions against Russia after the war began and founder Ivanishvili has pitched the election as a choice between peace and war, casting the West as a “Global War Party” that would suck Georgia into a conflict with Russia, as he said it had done with Ukraine.', 'Moscow will be watching the outcome closely, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Monday, noting that the Kremlin intends to leverage any Russia-friendly Georgian government “to enhance strategic Russian interests and Moscow’s geopolitical objectives of asserting control over Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia.”', '“The election outcome will likely determine whether Georgia abandons its longstanding policy of aligning with the West and instead deepens economic and political ties with the Kremlin in line with the pro-Kremlin positions the ruling Georgian Dream party has increasingly taken,” the ISW noted.', 'Georgian Dream and pro-EU groups have both looked to rally supporters ahead of the vote, holding rallies in the capital Tbilisi in the last week.', 'Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili, staunchly critical of the ruling party, addressed crowds of supporters last weekend, telling them that the vote would “demonstrate people’s will for freedom, independence, and a European future.”', '“Here today is the society, the people, the Georgians who are going to Europe,” Zourabichvili told the crowd, many of whom were draped in EU and Georgian flags.', 'Meanwhile, Georgian Dream founder Ivanishvili sought to demonize the pro-Western opposition at a rally Wednesday, telling crowds of pro-government supporters that if Georgian Dream won the election it would make opposition parties “answer with the full rigor of the law for the war crimes committed against the population of Georgia,” Reuters reported, without specifying what crimes they had committed.', 'Tbilisi’s pre-election environment has been increasingly polarized, analysts say, setting the stage for heightened tensions around the election result, whatever the outcome.', 'An additional complicating factor is recent electoral reform, which means the 150 seats in Georgia’s parliament will be awarded under a fully proportional system, with parties needing to surpass a 5% threshold to win seats.', '“In addition to recent poll results, the switch to a fully proportional electoral system makes it difficult to imagine GD’s [Golden Dream’s] outright victory or the opposition’s complete defeat,” Tina Dolbaia, Benjamin Shefner, and Maria Snegovaya of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in analysis last week.', '“The most likely scenario, according to this logic, would be a coalition government in Tbilisi, curbing GD’s power. However, there are significant concerns over electoral malfeasance, including vote buying, ballot stuffing, carousel voting, misusing the state and administrative resources, and depriving citizens living outside of Georgia of the right to vote,” the analysts noted.', '“Additionally, even if the civil society manages to overcome these obstacles on election day and GD fails to secure a majority of seats, the political environment in Georgia is still deeply polarized. If the opposition refuses to form a single bloc after the elections, GD may remain the most powerful party in the parliament.”', 'Got a confidential news tip?

One path leads towards Europe, the country’s orientation — backed by overwhelming public support — for the last two decades. The other towards authoritarianism, backsliding and ever-closer ties with Russia, Georgia’s longtime colonial master.', 'For the past 12 years, Georgia has been ruled by the Georgian Dream (GD) party. Founded and led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the party has been underwritten by the oligarch’s vast personal wealth, equal to roughly one-quarter of the country’s entire GDP. While GD had been a pro-Western party — at least in words, if not always deeds — for most of its existence, the past two and a half years have seen it tilt sharply towards Russia and an anti-democratic bent. Following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, GD and Ivanishvili became increasingly aligned with the Kremlin and at odds with Georgia’s erstwhile European partners. Relations with the West have dropped off precipitously in recent months, as the ruling party tightened its domestic control ahead of October 26’s vote.', 'Ranged against the authorities is an array of opposition coalitions. Welded together by the political leadership of Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who has emerged as a staunch government critic over the past year, four main opposition groupings are jointly contesting the ruling party. The largest of these, the Unity coalition, includes the United National Movement, which led Georgia from 2003 to 2012 under then-president Mikheil Saakashvili. Others include For Georgia, headed by former GD leader-turned-opponent Giorgi Gakharia; Strong Georgia, led by banker Mamuka Khazaradze; and Coalition for Change, with major Georgian personalities like Nika Gvaramia and Elena Khoshtaria.', 'The vote itself was marred by widespread evidence of fraud, intimidation and unfair competition. In one instance, a group of unidentified men attacked opposition voters in a suburb of Tbilisi; in other, Georgian Dream organizers were filmed distributing cash in exchange for votes in the western city of Zugdidi. The most brazen incident occurred in the southern city of Marneuli, long a centre of electoral fraud, where a local Georgian Dream official was filmed stuffing a large handful of ballots into a ballot box.', 'Despite these challenges, voter turnout was high, coming in at nearly 59% of the electorate, just behind 2012’s record highs. There was widespread optimism in opposition circles that this would enable a genuine defeat of the government, regardless of the hurdles.', 'Opposition optimism ', 'The first pivotal moment came as polls closed at 8PM local time, immediately followed by the announcement of exit poll numbers on local television. The Coalition 4 Change headquarters, one of the leading opposition blocs, was a frenzy of activity as the countdown to the poll announcement trickled downwards. As the tension grew to a fever pitch, the newscasters on the pro-opposition Mtavari Arkhi suddenly appeared on the screen. Behind them, a graphic showed the exit polls commissioned by their affiliate. In first place: Georgian Dream, with a total of 42%. Then came Coalition 4 Change at 18%, Coalition Unity with 13%, Strong Georgia at 9% and For Georgia at 8%. Together, the opposition bloc had — presumably — captured 48% of the vote, enough to enable them to form a government.', 'The room erupted into cheers and chants. The result predicted would mean the defeat of Georgian Dream, the victory of the opposition, and the toppling of the authoritarian government at the ballot box. Hugs and high-fives were exchanged, ecstatic slogans chanted. “We did it all in just six months!” roared one party member in English.', 'Nika Melia, one of the C4C leaders, was collected but confident as he addressed the media once the initial excitement had subsided. “Today, Georgia has decided to remove the Russian government,” Melia said, using a common pejorative for the ruling party. “Georgia’s new political culture has been established today — a coalition government for the first time ever. Many regimes have resisted the people, and Georgian Dream is no exception, but today, more than two million Georgians voted. They made their voice clear and said ‘no’ to the Russian Dream,” he said.', 'Amidst the optimism, opposition leaders understood that a long road still lay ahead.', '“We realise that now is the most important part: defending the votes and actually solidifying our victory,” said Marika Mikiashvili, foreign affairs adviser with the Droa party, a C4C member. “There’s still a lot of room for the government to cheat right now. I would not be surprised for them to fake the results, because we’re not facing politicians. We’re facing thugs, criminals who do not care about their legacy — only power. Clarity from Western observers and Western governments will be crucial in securing our victory,” Mikiashvili said.', 'Unlike in countries such as Belarus and Venezuela, Georgian authorities do not have the repressive capacity necessary to destroy a mass protest movement against electoral fraud, Mikiashvili added.', '“[Georgian Dream] does not have an army,” Mikiashvili said. “The support of the police is also not unconditional. Violence resonates very deeply in Georgian society, and not many police officers would be willing to outright shoot people or something. It’s not how it works in Georgia — not speaking in an idealistic sense, but practically,” she said.', 'A different picture ', 'Across town, a different picture of the election — and its results — was unfolding.', 'At GD headquarters, their own exit polls painted exactly the opposite picture. In this scenario, the incumbents had received a full 56% — enough to easily defeat the opposition and dominate the new parliament. The two results were completely at odds, making the incoming official vote count by Georgia’s Central Electoral Commission (CEC) more uncertain than ever.', 'As the CEC’s results rolled out, they painted a picture that was not a rosy one for the opposition. The first announcement stated that with 70% of the vote counted, Georgian Dream had received nearly 53%. While paper ballots were yet to be counted (only electronic voting has so far been tabulated), both the remaining ballots and the final tabulation seem unlikely to transform the ultimate tally into an opposition victory. Georgian Dream — at least for the moment — appears to have won.', 'The entire country now waits to see what will come next. Georgia’s opposition parties have not accepted the results of the election, but neither have they yet announced plans for how they intended to contest them. Mass street protests — long a feature of Georgian political life — seem inevitable, but they have not come yet. As the clock struck midnight on Tbilisi’s Rustaveli Avenue, the capital’s main thoroughfare and epicentre of every demonstration, there was nothing but silence on the streets. Voting in Georgia may have finished, but the country’s future still hangs in the balance.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
