"With battleground states up for grabs, Trump oddly returns to NYC for Madison Square Garden rally",https://www.yahoo.com/news/battleground-states-grabs-trump-oddly-182600068.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'NEW YORK — With the presidential campaign entering its final stretch, Donald Trump is making an odd choice. He’s turning his focus to New York City — where he will rally supporters on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.', 'His deep-blue hometown is a curious place to home in on in the last days of the election as the GOP nominee has the slimmest chances of winning New York.', 'But strategists on both sides agreed the rally provides an opportunity for Trump to do what he loves most: Put on a spectacle. And where better than the nation’s signature arena?', 'In fact, New York City may even make perfect sense as a backdrop for Trump’s showmanship. The city is at the center of several signature issues of the former president’s 2024 campaign.', 'The most obvious is immigration, as the city has struggled with the strain and costs of a massive influx of migrants over the past two years. Trump has frequently claimed the crisis was created by the Biden-Harris administration and has hurt all manner of Americans.', 'Trump loves to rail about the “rigged” U.S. Justice Department and how he’s been victimized with one prosecution after another. New York is where Trump was convicted in the hush money prosecution over payouts made to porn star Stormy Daniels.', 'He also has made a habit of talking about how crime-ridden and lawless the streets of New York are, despite crimes being much lower than in the 1980s and ’90s, when Trump was building his real-estate empire in the city.', '“To come in here like a conquering hero, having withstood all the slings and arrows over the last year, and to stand right there, in Madison Square Garden, in front of tens of thousands of people, and to say, ‘Here I am on the verge of being victorious. I’m gonna be president of the United States again,’ is something that everybody in the country is going to be watching,” said Robert Hornak, a Republican political strategist.', 'The former president is reportedly slated to speak on Sunday about how Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden failed voters on the economy, immigration and other issues.', 'Trump has promised a blockbuster event that will play up his star power in the final stretch of the election. The unusual choice for a rally is intended to put on a show for swing state voters looking on from afar, experts said.', '“Part of it is the spectacle, the showmanship, him trying to highlight the business success,” said Democratic strategist Trip Yang. “Part of it just seems to be on a personality level, on an ego level, he really likes the whole MSG spectacle. If you work in show business, and you can say you sold out MSG, that’s a huge feather in your cap.”', 'It’s a way to get attention — plus some campaign cash, with Trump hawking an “Ultra MAGA experience” that runs attendees $924,600 for top-tier access at the rally.', 'Mike Morey, a Democratic consultant said that generating a “circus” at the venue, which has a capacity of nearly 20,000, is exactly the point: “This will be a circus, but that’s his intention, because Donald Trump has never attempted to actually talk about policy or issues.”', 'Trump previously hosted a rally in Long Island in September, and a May rally in the Bronx drew hundreds of both supporters and protesters.', '“We’re wrapping it up,” Trump said of the campaign at a Greensboro, North Carolina rally on Tuesday, adding that he wanted to close out “with a beautiful bang” at the Garden.', 'At rallies, Trump has repeatedly claimed that he has a chance at winning the Empire State.', 'That’s extremely unlikely: The state hasn’t voted Republican in a presidential election since 1984, when New York voted Ronald Reagan for reelection, and Harris has a 16-point lead over Trump in New York, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll.', 'But Trump, in New York and elsewhere in the country, has been cheered on by supporters while painting an apocalyptic picture of New York City, calling it representative of the failings of liberal rule.', 'He’s regularly lobbed attacks Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his hush money case against Trump, which kept the former president mostly confined to the city for much of this past spring. Trump, who was convicted by a Manhattan jury of 34 felonies, has claimed Bragg and other prosecutors have led a politically motivated “witch hunt” against him. He has also used concerns about crime as a bludgeon against Bragg and other prosecutors and lawmakers.', 'Moreover, Trump has stirred fear with rhetoric around the influx of migrants entering the country from the southern border. He has campaigned on unsubstantiated claims of a “migrant crime wave,” using New York City, which saw over 200,000 migrant arrivals since spring 2022, as an example of what the dangers of unchecked immigration could look like.', '“We’re going to make a play for New York,” Trump said at the North Carolina rally. “It hasn’t been won in many, many decades, but with what’s going on in New York, between the illegal migrants and the crime they’re causing and hurting people so badly, and all of the problems in New York, we’re going to give it a hell of a shot.”', '“He knows full well that he has zero chance of winning in New York, but what he wants to do is put on a spectacle for the rest of the country,” Morey said.', 'While Trump faces basically no chance of winning the state, many of the points he’s campaigned on still have relevance to some voters.', 'Republicans hope his presence at Madison Square Garden might lend some momentum to House Republicans like Mike Lawler and Marc Molinaro who are fighting for reelection.', 'Hornak, the Republican strategist, said Trump and other Republicans have used the issues of immigration, public safety and cost of living to create a foothold in New York.', 'During the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats lost five seats in districts surrounding the city and saw a tight race between Gov. Kathy Hochul and her Republican challenger, Lee Zeldin.', '“There’s definitely a move that’s been building in New York, which has only gotten worse over the last two years with this massive and super expensive influx of migrants coming into New York City,” Hornak said.', 'The rally has caused controversy among local Democrats, including state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Signal, who on X earlier this month slammed the event as “equivalent to the infamous Nazis rally at Madison Square Garden on February 20, 1939.”', 'Hoylman-Sigal, whose district on the west side of Manhattan includes the Garden, said that Trump’s decision to campaign in New York in the last stretch of his campaign appears futile.', '“Trump is pushing to his hard-right-wing choir in, of all states, deep-blue New York,” Hoylman-Sigal told the Daily News. “I’m not a political strategist, but it doesn’t seem to make much sense in the closing days of the election.', '“It’s a waste of his time and precious campaign resources, if you ask me. So I guess I’m happy whenever he’s not in a swing state that actually matters.”']"

Both candidates will similarly portray their opponent as a threat to the nation.', 'Trump has long wanted to hold an event in the arena and attract press attention in the media capital of the country. But it will also serve as a major fundraising event, with the campaign offering donors backstage access at the arena with some top-tier access costing $924,600, according to campaign officials, and a chance for Trump to give a boost to down-ballot Republicans in the state.', 'In the final stretch of the election, the former president is trying to emphasize his star power with the rally at the Garden, where he’ll deliver a closing message that Harris “broke” America and he will “fix it.""

When JD Vance sings Trump’s fulsome praises to introduce him, his ominous tribute will not inspire comparison to the night in the Garden of 19 May 1962, when Marilyn Monroe sang Happy Birthday, Mr President to John F Kennedy.', 'Trump’s climactic rally will not be in the spirit of any past presidential event ever held there. His gathering for the great racist replacement theory will be the culmination of his spiraling descent since the Charlottesville rally in 2017 when neo-Nazis chanted, “Jews will not replace us.” “Fine people on both sides,” Trump said then. Now, at his night at the Garden, Trump will revive the memory of the infamous American Nazi mass rally held there on 20 February 1939 through his reflected Hitlerian rhetoric.', 'In the last week, Trump has pledged to deploy the military against “the enemy within”, domestic opponents he claims are worse than foreign adversaries – those Hitler called “Feind des Volkes”, or “enemy of the people”. Trump has threatened to destroy CBS, ABC and the New York Times. About ABC, after it conducted the debate in which he performed disastrously, he called to “take away their license”. After Kamala Harris’s 60 Minutes interview, having refused his own, he tweeted on 10 October: “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE.” About the Times, he said on 9 October: “Wait until you see what I’m going to do with them.” He has singled out by name journalists for the Times and the New Yorker as “FAKE OBAMA LOVING ‘JOURNALISTS”. At every rally he denounces the “fake news”, a drumbeat for years, echoing Hitler’s pejorative slur, “die Lügenpresse” – “the lying press”.', 'Trump traveled on 11 October to Aurora, Colorado, where he claimed a Venezuelan gang had seized control, “scum” and “animals” who have “invaded and conquered” and “infected” the town, a description dismissed as false by its Republican mayor. “We have to clean out our country,” said Trump. His language represented the Nazi idea of “Rassenhygiene” – “race cleansing” that required purification, not an academic interest in genetics but a program of eugenics for designating inferior races to be isolated or eliminated.', 'As Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf, “A people that fails to preserve the purity of its racial blood thereby destroys the unity of the soul of the nation in all its manifestations. A disintegrated national character is the inevitable consequence of a process of disintegration in the blood.”', 'The former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, retired general Mark Milley, according to Bob Woodward in his new book War, told the veteran journalist: “No one has ever been as dangerous to this country as Donald Trump. Now I realize he’s a total fascist. He is the most dangerous person to this country.” Trump had stated that for Milley’s communication with his counterparts in China on January 6 to reassure them that the US military was stable, he deserved “DEATH” – to be executed.', 'On 14 October, retired general Mike Flynn – Trump’s former national security adviser, whom he pardoned for failing to register as a foreign agent and obstructing justice – was asked at a Christian nationalist rally for Trump whether he would preside over military tribunals in a second Trump term to “not only drain the swamp, but imprison the swamp, and on a few occasions, execute the swamp”. “Believe me,” Flynn replied, “the gates of hell – my hell – will be unleashed.”', 'T\nrump has been inevitably drawn to the Garden, in the city that made and unmade him. He is irreversibly entrapped in his endless neurotic syndrome of desperately seeking approval there that he constantly repels and success he inexorably undermines, a cycle of failure, rejection and humiliation. He wants New York to love him unreservedly, but his relationship with the city has been one long unrequited romance. His true love affair has always and only been with himself. When he does not receive the adoration he feels he deserves, he hates New York. Then, he tries to win its love again by performing a disgusting act, which, when he is predictably rejected, triggers his anger once again. And, then, he engages in gestures of infantile defiance, like holding a Nazi-esque rally. Trying to show himself triumphant over the city, he invites its scorn once again, and again, and again. He never comprehends that he is the cause of his continuing narcissistic injuries.', 'Trump’s rally, through the rhyme of history, will be a rebuke to the greatest campaign speech delivered by Franklin D Roosevelt, which, though given 88 years ago in the Garden on 31 October 1936, rings remarkably contemporary, a speech for “the restoration of American democracy” and its “preservation”.', '“We have not come this far without a struggle and I assure you we cannot go further without a struggle,” FDR said. “We know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob. Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me – and I welcome their hatred.”', 'Three years after FDR spoke at the Garden, another rally was held there, on 20 February 1939, under the sponsorship of the German American Bund, raising the slogan of “America First”, to advance the great replacement theory that Jews and other “inferior races” were displacing white Aryans. The Nazis claimed the mantle of true Americanism and Christian nationalism. Swastikas framed a gigantic portrait of George Washington as the backdrop to the stage. From the balcony hung a banner: “Stop Jewish Domination of Christian America.” “Wake up!” shouted the Führer of the Bund, Fritz Kuhn, “you, Aryan, Nordic and Christians, to demand that our government be returned to the people who founded it!”', 'Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, the Bund’s public relations director, declared that white supremacy was the essential basis of the nation. “The spirit which opened the west and built our country is the spirit of the militant white man,” he said, citing racial segregation and immigration quotas as its bulwarks. “It has then always been very much American to protect the Aryan character of this nation.”', 'In 2019, a seven-minute documentary about the Nazi rally of 1939, A Night at the Garden, was nominated for an Academy Award. To promote it, a 30-second TV ad was produced with the tagline: “It Can Happen Here.” The line was a reference to Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel, It Can’t Happen Here, about a populist demagogue defeating FDR and imposing a fascist regime. Lewis’s wife, the famous journalist Dorothy Thompson, a columnist for the New York Herald Tribune, who had reported on the rise of Hitler, pointedly attended the Nazi rally. “I saw an exact duplicate of it in the Berlin Sports Palast in 1931,” she wrote.', 'When the film distributor of A Night at the Garden sought to buy time for a spot on Fox News, its CEO, Suzanne Scott, rejected it as “not appropriate for our air”. After the 2020 election, during Trump’s ramping up to the January 6 insurrection, she ordered that Fox News suppress factchecking his lies because it was “bad for business”.', 'Now, in his announcement of his night at the Garden, Trump advertised a clipped version of the replacement theory, declaring that New York was “reeling” from “Kamala’s reckless open-border policies”, “flooding” the city with criminal “illegal migrants”. For nearly a $1m contribution to attend the event, the top tier, donors are promised an “Ultra MAGA Experience”, details to follow.', 'Trump’s Maga rally will be the first time since the 1939 Nazi rally that the same themes of the replacement theory will echo in the Garden. But his closing argument is more than Nazi cosplay. He cannot help but reveal his deepest desire to be loved and then to fling the middle finger to the city whose unconditional admiration he has sought since he first crossed the Queensboro Bridge.', 'Trump’s permanent physical move to Palm Beach after his failed coup in 2020 has not transformed him into a contented Florida Man. To the inveterate New Yorker, the Sunshine state is strictly for snowbirds, God’s waiting room for shuffleboarders. Mar-a-Lago, his winter escape, has become his unnatural embittering palace-in-exile. Florida represents disgrace to Trump.', 'Trump’s emotional journey back to the White House must travel through New York. He has nothing but contempt and indifference for Washington. He despises policy, flaunts his ignorance and detests anyone who has ever tried to temper him, from four-star generals to Republican congressional leaders. He wants the pomp without the circumstance. January 6 played out Trump’s true view of the capital.', 'Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition', 'The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election', '', 'Trump plots his night at the Garden as the climax of his comeback tour. He may have been president, but never top of the heap. Roy Cohn could tell him how to skirt the law and ingratiate himself with the mob, but Cohn was not a Virgil to guide his protege to respectability. Trump’s lowlife publicity antics, tutored by Cohn, made him into one of the revolving cast of characters populating tabloid trash. The larger the headline of the sordid story about himself, the bigger Trump’s delusion that kitsch burnished his class. He was always crestfallen when his frolics did not win his admission into the club.', 'Trump has only been truly comfortable strutting in his old New York, conning and threatening, greasing the palms of the mafia, stiffing his contractors and workers, while trying to buy his way into society affairs. Time and again, the city spat him out. He was ridiculed and reviled. He went bust six times. He defaulted on the Trump Shuttle. The banks denied him loans. He had to sell his yacht named for his daughter, The Princess. His brutish father, who financed his wild ventures, throwing good money after bad, had to buy chips illegally to momentarily float his sinking Atlantic City casino. He dumped two wives. He allegedly sexually assaulted dozens of women. When he tried to lowball Frank Sinatra, an idol, Ol’ Blue Eyes told him, “Go fuck yourself.”', 'After Trump had plunged in what seemed to be his final bankruptcy, he was rescued by a TV producer, Mark Burnett, who created the reality TV show The Apprentice, which depicted Trump as a business genius reigning over the Manhattan skyline. The sheer fiction was the veneer that enabled his grubby lucrative product placement side deals. His motive for running for president was a branding scam gone haywire.', 'Don’t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts', 'Now, he has returned to the city on his road to redemption. Yet, so far, he has been held accountable for his vast crimes only in New York. He has been found liable for defamation and sexual assault and termed an adjudicated rapist by the judge in the E Jean Carroll case, and ordered to pay $83.3m in damages plus continuing interest; found liable of widespread financial fraud and ordered to pay $364m for ill-gotten gains plus continuing interest; and convicted of 34 felony counts of financial fraud for hush-money payments, to a porn star and Playboy model with whom he had affairs, in order to affect the outcome of the 2016 election.', 'Once again, he intends to prove himself in the city that never sleeps, the city that will give him another shot at murdering someone on Fifth Avenue and getting away with it. A star is reborn.', 'These little town blues are melting away\nI’m gonna make a brand-new start of it in old New York\nAnd if I can make it there, I’m gonna make it anywhere\nIt’s up to you, New York, New York', 'Trump now says that if he loses he will blame the unappreciative Jews – he hasn’t been “treated right” by the Jews and their support for Democrats is a “curse”. But Trump, who has picked up a few Yiddish words, uses them unconsciously like a native New Yorker. On 2 January 2021, he displayed his proficiency in his notorious telephone call with the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which he sought to intimidate him into committing election fraud to switch the state’s voting results.', '“So look,” said Trump. “All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.”', 'Raffensperger resisted Trump’s strong-arming, the Georgia outcome stood, and four days later Trump incited the assault on the Capitol in a last-ditch effort to thwart the certification of the election: “Hang Mike Pence!” Trump has since been indicted in Georgia for election fraud, a case in legal purgatory until after the 2024 election.', 'Twice, during his call with Raffensperger, Trump derided the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, who refused to be complicit in Trump’s scheme, by calling him a “schmuck”. Perhaps the word was lost on Trump’s listeners. According to Leo Rosten’s The Joy of Yiddish, it carries several meanings, including “penis” and “a dope, a jerk, a boob, a clumsy bumbling fellow”. Rosten wrote that “few impolite words express comparable contempt”.', 'Now, New Yorkers can only wonder, what kind of schmuck holds a Nazi-esque rally in Madison Square Garden?', 'Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth.

Four buildings have actually carried the name. The current Garden has hosted both Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

Kennedy, adding to the lore surrounding what the New York Knicks announcer calls “the world's most famous arena!”"", 'Here are a few highlights from the political history of Madison Square Garden, which has occupied four buildings over time.', 'Grover Cleveland stages a comeback', 'Grover Cleveland is the only U.S. president to have served two nonconsecutive terms. Trump hopes to become the second.', 'After the 1892 Democratic National Convention met in Chicago and nominated Cleveland — then out of office after serving from 1885 to 1889 — he accepted the nomination with a speech at Madison Square Garden — the second one — in his home state of New York.', 'The Evening World reported that “a band stationed in one of the balconies played popular airs, the audience joining in the refrain of “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay” and “Four years more of Grover.”', 'Cleveland promised to lower tariffs, whereas Trump has said imposing huge tariffs on foreign goods would boost the U.S. economy. Cleveland then defeated Republican Benjamin Harrison, becoming both the 24th and 22nd president.', 'A record-setting 103 ballots', 'The Democratic Party that met at the second Madison Square Garden in 1924 was deeply divided over immigration, Prohibition and the growing prominence of the Ku Klux Klan. The race was deadlocked between William Gibbs McAdoo of California and New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith, whom the Klan opposed because he was Roman Catholic.', ""From June 24 to July 9, ballot after ballot failed to secure a nomination. The Associated Press reported on July 2 that McAdoo “passed the much sought goal of 500 votes by dint of much frantic work and persuasion and maneuvering on the part of his floor managers, who declared they hadn't finished their work yet.”"", ""It wasn't enough. After both McAdoo and Smith dropped out, a compromise candidate, former West Virginia Congressman John W. Davis, was nominated on the 103rd ballot; he later lost to Republican Calvin Coolidge."", 'Speeches by Hoover, Roosevelt', 'While the first two Gardens were near Madison Square — where Broadway and Fifth Avenue meet at 23rd Street — the third was northwest of that neighborhood, on Eighth Avenue and West 50th Street. It opened in 1925, and hosted both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in their campaigns.', 'Facing Roosevelt, a Democrat promoting “a New Deal for the American people,” Hoover, the incumbent Republican president, said in an Oct. 21, 1932, speech that he opposed “the proposal to alter the whole foundations of our national life.""', 'Roosevelt beat Hoover, then spoke at the Garden again during his 1936 and 1940 campaigns.', 'He railed against “the old enemies of peace — business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering” in a fiery Oct. 31, 1936 speech. “Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,” Roosevelt said. “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”', 'Nazis, communists rally', 'More than 20,000 people attended a Feb. 20, 1939 rally at the Garden organized by the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group that hung swastikas alongside a huge portrait of George Washington.', 'The group\'s national secretary, James Wheeler-Hill, claimed that if the first U.S. president were alive, he “would be friends with Adolf Hitler."" Wearing a Nazi armband, Bund leader Fritz Kuhn called for “a socially just, white, gentile-ruled United States” and ""gentile-controlled labor unions, free from Jewish Moscow-directed domination.”', 'A Jewish protester, 26-year-old Isadore Greenbaum, rushed the stage. The AP reported on what happened next:', '“Instantly, a dozen or more Storm Troopers set upon him, knocking him down and beating him as he held his head in his arms, his black, wild hair flying. A squad of police pushed the Storm Troopers aside, picked him from the floor of the platform and, holding him high above their heads, ran to an exit. Most of his clothing was torn from his body. Later, he was booked for disorderly conduct.""', ""The 1930s also were the high point of the Communist Party's U.S. popularity. Police estimated that 16,000 to 17,000 people attended a communist rally at the Garden one week after the Bund gathering. CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder said accusations that American Communists took their orders from Moscow constituted “a slanderous attack,” spread by supporters of “the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo anti-comintern alliance of war makers,” the AP reported."", 'Presidential birthday bash', 'A Democratic Party fundraiser and John F. Kennedy birthday celebration, with Marilyn Monroe wearing a skintight dress to serenade the president, was held at the Garden’s third iteration on May 19, 1962.', 'It had been the hottest May Day in New York City history, with temperatures rising to 99 degrees (37 Celsius). “Heat waves still rose in the Garden when, after a sultry rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ by Marilyn Monroe, the President remarked: ‘I can now retire from politics,’” the AP reported.', ""Monroe and Kennedy were both dead within a year and a half, she from a drug overdose and he from an assassin's bullet."", 'George Wallace campaigns in New York', ""The current Garden opened in 1968, about a mile south of its predecessor, home to the NBA's Knicks and the NHL's Rangers, and host to musical performances, prize fights and other spectacles."", 'George Wallace, the former and future governor of Alabama, gave a speech during his 1968 presidential race as the candidate of the American Independent Party, featuring a “Stand Up for America” pitch for the kind of populist nationalism that defines Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.', 'The Wallace campaign was less explicitly racist than it had been Alabama, but he was pushing law and order: When protesters interrupted the Garden rally, Wallace asked why Democratic and Republican leaders “kowtow to these anarchists.”', '“We don’t have riots in Alabama. They start a riot down there, first one of ’em to pick up a brick gets a bullet in the brain, that’s all,"" Wallace said.', 'Republican Richard Nixon then beat Democrat Hubert Humphrey and Wallace to win the presidency.', 'Convention site for Democrats, Republicans', 'This Garden was also the site of the 1976, 1980 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions and the 2004 Republican National Convention.', 'Jimmy Carter alluded to the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal as he accepted his nomination. “Our country has lived through a time of torment,” Carter said. “It is now a time for healing. We want to have faith again. We want to be proud again. We just want the truth again.”', 'Carter returned in 1980 facing a challenge from Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, who lacked the needed delegates. AP reporters observed that Kennedy’s “futile battle to reverse the odds was symbolized at the convention center, where his tiny suite of rooms contrasted with five large, white trailers decorated in Carter’s campaign green, from which the president’s men ran the convention.”', 'Carter won the nomination but lost the election to Republican Ronald Reagan.', 'As Democrats met again in 1992, Bill Clinton accepted his nomination in a 52-minute speech that “tested the attention of many in the partisan audience,” according to AP political writer David Espo. Clinton promised “a government that is leaner, not meaner; a government that expands opportunity, not bureaucracy.”', 'The Republican Party held its only Madison Square Garden convention in 2004, when New York was still shaken by the attacks at the World Trade Center.', '“We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back,"" President George W.
