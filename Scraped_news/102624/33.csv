Black Ops 6 campaign ending and post-credit scene explained ,https://www.sportskeeda.com/call-of-duty-game/black-ops-6-campaign-ending-post-credit-scene-explained,"[""Call of Duty Black Ops 6 comes with a new campaign and a rather immersive storyline involving the secret organization known as Pantheon. Throughout the game, confendital information is revealed about this org and its immoral ways. Eventually, the narrative concludes with a gripping cutscene at the campaign's end."", 'This article will explain the Black Ops 6 campaign ending and post-credit scene.', 'Disclaimer: This article contains major spoilers regarding the ending of the Black Ops 6 campaign. Proceed with caution.', 'In the Black Ops 6 campaign, you take on the role of the silent protagonist, William “Case” Calderon. The entire campaign revolves around the clandestine organization known as Pantheon.', ""Through the many missions in the game, it is discovered that Pantheon had been making arms deals with Saddam Hussein. It's also suspected early on in the campaign that the CIA has a mole. Through rigorous missions and after many gunfights, Case and team discover The Cradle, a bio-weapon in Saddam Hussein's palace."", 'This is an important bit of information as the story comes down to The Cradle, Pantheon, Case, and, finally, Jane Harrow. Here is what leads to the Black Ops 6 campaign ending:', ""Jane Harrow turns out to be the mole in the CIA, as it is revealed that she's working with Pantheon right before the team kidnaps her. She had planned to attack the Capitol Building by detonating The Cradle to discredit Livingstone. This would've achieve two things:"", ""Harrow's motivation to lash out against the CIA was simple: vengeance. She believed that her parents had been killed by Adler under the orders of the CIA. These details are revealed by Harrow herself after the team kidnaps her and Adler injects her with the truth serum at the Rook. This leads us to the Black Ops 6 campaign ending."", 'At the very end, after Harrow is injected with the truth serum, her allies from Pantheon eventually reach the Rook and attempt to rescue her. As she tries to flee the scene, Case chases after her and manages to climb aboard her helicopter.', 'Under the influence of The Cradle bio-weapon, the protagonist and Harrow have their final brawl, which eventually leads to the Helicopter crashing. Case seemingly chokes Harrow to death and presumably takes his last breath after the helicopter crashes. However, their deaths are never fully confirmed. This is the official Black Ops 6 campaign ending. The next section highlights key takeaways from it.', 'In the end, Livingstone saves face and evacuates the Capitol Building. He also manages to restore The Cradle safely, meaning he will remain the CIA Director for good.', ""Case and Harrow are likely dead. The Cradle has finally been recovered and the Capitol Building is safe, along with Livingstone's position and reputation. However, the Pantheon's whereabouts are unknown, and the members of its upper echelons are still shrouded in mystery. This is essentially what happens in the Black Ops 6 campaign ending."", 'Finally, a cutscene takes us two weeks into the future from the Capitol Building attack. After the Black Ops 6 campaign ends, Woods, Marshall, and Adler reunite with Livingstone, who tells them that Pantheon is still a major threat to global security.', 'Livingstone pushes them to continue their work as an independent secret organization to find a way to destroy Pantheon one way or another. All resources, finances, and firepower can be accounted for as long as the team is working against this evil force.', 'The cutscene ends with Jackson Caine seemingly accessing important files on a computer that could have belonged to none other than Livingstone himself.', 'Caine’s identity is largely unknown but it is fairly possible that he could be connected to Ryan Jackson from the previous Black Ops games. For now, this character remains shrouded in mystery.', 'Quick Links', '']"

‘Call of Duty’ Is Back. Here’s What to Know About ‘Black Ops 6’,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-explained-1235142787/,"['BY CADE ONDER', 'AS ANOTHER YEAR draws near its end, it’s time yet again for another Call of Duty game. For 2024’s iteration, Activision is taking fans back to a fan-favorite sub-series with Black Ops 6. However, if you’re new to the franchise or a lapsed fan looking to return after years away, the Call of Duty landscape may be a bit confusing. ', 'Unlike most games, Call of Duty has ditched individual applications and adopted a centralized hub, kind of like how Fortnite offers multiple game modes in a single ecosystem. When you launch the game, you’ll see multiple options to choose from, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Warzone in addition to Black Ops 6. Players only have access to the respective games they own, which are purchased piecemeal. It can be convenient if you’re regularly going back to different versions of the game, but might be off-putting if you’re just looking to pick up and play.', 'Even though they’re lumped together in the same app, Black Ops and Modern Warfare are vastly different games — despite what some fans may suggest. Not only do they feature different characters, stories, and tones, but they offer very different styles of gameplay too.', '', 'For the better part of a decade, Call of Duty was more or less a World War II anthology series. It was less focused on characters or big story arcs and more about allowing players a way to experience historical battles/military operations by way of an interactive take on Saving Private Ryan. In 2007, that all changed with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The game was inspired by real life conflicts ripped straight from the headlines and would result in the franchise’s first direct sequel with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009). ', 'That sequel was the first time the series had reinvested in its characters and given players people to attach to. Modern Warfare would become known for its bombastic, contemporary stories with Michael Bay-sized set pieces and bravado, with larger than life characters defined by thick accents, bushy mustaches, and cool masks. After both games became monstrous hits, it was clear that fans wanted more serialized entries. However, for the sake of the developers (as well as the audience’s attention) it would be difficult to roll out a Modern Warfare sequel every year.', '', 'Activision opted to produce a semi-sequel to Call of Duty: World at War (2008) that would help launch another sub-series: Black Ops. This sub-franchise is far less focused on all-out warfare and more interested in espionage, honing in on conspiracy-laden takes on history and fictional shadowy operations carried out by the government. Call of Duty: Black Ops tackled all kinds of brainy subject matter such as Russian sleeper agents, the surgical role of the CIA in major world events in the Sixties, and even the assassination of John F. Kennedy. ', 'Both sub-franchises would continue to further develop their own identities as the years went on with Black Ops going to the far flung future to battle robots while the original Modern Warfare trilogy wrapped up in the early 2010s. Modern Warfare developer Infinity Ward would go on to try a few other new ideas for the series, such as Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016), but ultimately circled back to Modern Warfare to cash in on nostalgia.', '', 'In 2019, Infinity Ward released a Modern Warfare reboot that offered a more realistic take on its initial premise. If the original Modern Warfare trilogy was like an over-the-top Michael Bay film, the rebooted trilogy is more akin to grounded films like Zero Dark Thirty and Sicario. As such, Modern Warfare has become more of a casual military-sim that tries to balance realism with fun while Black Ops is the more “arcade-y” shooter that’s a bit easier to pick up and play.', '', 'It’s obviously a bit confusing for newcomers to keep track of the differences between the two Modern Warfare trilogies, as they literally shared the same name aside from a set of roman numerals. However, it’s understandable why Activision chose to keep using the Modern Warfare name. It’s an incredibly strong brand, synonymous with making Call of Duty a pop cultural juggernaut.', 'Similarly, Treyarch has never even attempted to ditch the Black Ops brand because of the power it holds for the series. It’s something fans trust and hold in high esteem.', 'The Call of Duty: Black Ops timeline is a bit chaotic as it takes place across roughly 100 years and also features a branching storyline. In Black Ops 2 (2012) and Black Ops Cold War (2020), the player can make choices that allow critical characters to live or die, nuke countries, and let the villains win or lose.', 'On top of that, the rebooted Modern Warfare (2019) series exists within the same universe as the Black Ops games. A lot of these connections have been made in seasonal post-launch cutscenes tied to the multiplayer of these games, but a key character from the Modern Warfare series also appeared in a cameo in the campaign for Black Ops Cold War.', 'With all of that said, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is more or less right in the middle of the timeline. Black Ops 6 is a sequel to Black Ops Cold War and the Eighties-set levels of Black Ops 2. Black Ops 6 picks up in the early Nineties and follows Cold War character Russell Adler on the run after being framed as a mole in the CIA. Sometime later, he sends a cryptic message to Frank Woods — who is now wheelchair-bound following the events of Black Ops 2 — to warn him of a dangerous group that has infiltrated the CIA. ', '', 'Key franchise characters like Alex Mason and Jason Hudson will not return in Black Ops 6 due to some choices players can make in Black Ops 2 now being officially canonized in the overall narrative. Below, you can find a chronological timeline of the Black Ops franchise’s story which should hopefully make things a bit easier to follow. The bolded entries on the list are the ones that you should play before Black Ops 6 if you want to have the best understanding of the story.', 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has had the longest development cycle of any Call of Duty game to date with Treyarch and Raven Software leading the charge on production. The series has historically allowed its different studios two to three years to make new games, but Black Ops 6 was afforded the luxury of four years. Ideally, it could result in a more polished, content-rich game than previous years.', '2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III was reportedly made in 16 months and was heavily criticized for its painfully short campaign (roughly three hours long) and a multiplayer that launched exclusively with content from previous games such as maps from Modern Warfare 2 (2009).', 'Of course, there will be a robust campaign with missions that allow players to choose the kind of playstyles they want to utilize. Raven Software, the campaign developer for Black Ops 6, has also confirmed this year’s single player component will be longer than Black Ops Cold War’s which was under 6-hours long.', 'Zombies also returns with two new round-based maps, including one giant map set in West Virginia. Black Ops 6 will introduce a plethora of new features including a mech suit for players to utilize, new GobbleGums (a perk system exclusive to Zombies), and all kinds of whimsical weapons and gadgets to slay the undead with. To really sweeten the deal, a third Zombies map will also be released for Black Ops 6 by the end of 2024 at no extra cost.', 'The fan-favorite mode was introduced in World at War (2008) and has allowed the series to have a radically different co-op mode in addition to its single-player and PvP offerings. It became popular for its simplicity of surviving hordes of the undead, but evolved to become a campy experience that saw players as President John F. Kennedy, going to the moon, and fighting an undead version of horror director George Romero across different games.', '', 'Needless to say, it would seem like the chaos of this mode is kept in its own self-contained universe and doesn’t directly impact the campaigns of the Call of Duty games.', 'The co-op mode has grown substantially since its initial days of being a simple wave-based shooter and now touts elaborate puzzles, progression systems, and an ongoing storyline. For some fans, Zombies is the meat and potatoes of Call of Duty and they don’t really dabble in the other modes. There are even entire YouTube channels with millions of subscribers that are dedicated to covering Call of Duty’s Zombies mode.', 'And it wouldn’t be Call of Duty without multiplayer. The classic 6v6 action returns with 16 maps (including a remake of fan-favorite map, Nuketown) and all kinds of new mechanics. Most notably, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 boasts a new movement system which allows players to run, slide, and dive in any direction, giving them more precise control over their character. This “omnimovement” also results in much faster, more frenetic combat with more opportunities to make slick plays. ', 'Later this year, this system will also be implemented into Call of Duty: Warzone, a free-to-play battle royale spin-off, which should dramatically overhaul how the beloved battle royale plays. After releasing in 2022, Warzone has become something of the connective tissue between games, continuously updated each year to reflect some of the major gameplay changes introduced in the annualized entries.', 'Both the mainline entries and Warzone are iterating upon each other as Warzone takes on mechanical innovations such as movement changes while titles like Modern Warfare III have utilized the battle royale’s maps and armor system within their campaigns. ', 'For those that have heavily invested in Call of Duty over the last few years by purchasing skins and aggressively leveling up their gear, there’s some bad news. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 does not feature the “carry forward” system that was introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The system allowed players to bring their skins, guns, and relevant gear from Modern Warfare II to Modern Warfare III.', '', 'This was partially done because Modern Warfare III was more like Modern Warfare 2.5 rather than a full-fledged sequel, making it easier for the developers to include content from a previous game.', 'However, Black Ops 6 plays a lot different from Modern Warfare III and features a different art style, so it wouldn’t make sense for all of the stuff from the last two games to be accessible here. Modern Warfare III featured some a ton of contemporary crossovers with skins for real life celebrities like Devin Booker and Nicki Minaj as well as characters from big films like Dune: Part Two.', 'Naturally, it would be weird for a game that’s set in the Nineties to feature characters like this, though there will probably be some other crossovers in Black Ops 6’s post-launch content. Thankfully, all content from past games will still be usable in Call of Duty: Warzone. Similarly, Black Ops 6 skins and weaponry will also be usable in Call of Duty: Warzone.', '', 'While all of that is certainly a lot to take in, you’re ready to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It may be overwhelming at a glance, but Call of Duty is popular because it is first and foremost very accessible. It’s meant to be a shooter that anyone can pick up and play. While you may be a bit fuzzy on some specifics if you’ve never played another Call of Duty or you’ve taken some years off, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

New ‘Call of Duty’ Is First Big Test of Microsoft’s $69 Billion Purchase of Activision Blizzard,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-25/-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-first-big-test-of-microsoft-s-69-billion-deal,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The latest game in the series is the first to release day-one on Microsoft’s subscription service, Xbox Game Pass', 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in the series, is out today', 'Hi everyone. Today is the most pivotal day for Microsoft’s Xbox since it purchased Activision Blizzard, but first...', 'This week’s top gaming news:', 'Just over a year ago, Microsoft Corp. closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. This week, the tech giant will begin to discover if that whopping price tag was justified.', 'Today marks the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in a series of shooter games that have come out every fall like clockwork since 2005 (even when the developers are under the impression that they’re instead making an expansion). Call of Duty is one of the most lucrative video-game franchises of all time, consistently topping the charts and generating more than $30 billion in revenue since its inception.', 'But this release will feel different in a monumental way. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the first entry in the series to have a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s subscription service, which is often described as “Netflix for video games.” For between $10 and $20 a month (depending on the tier), players get access to a catalog of hundreds of games that they would otherwise have to buy individually. Xbox puts all of its new releases on the subscription service, a list that, thanks to the acquisition, now includes Call of Duty.', 'In other words, people can pay $20 or less to sign up for Xbox Game Pass and access the new Call of Duty rather than spending $70 to buy the game outright. Microsoft hopes that any potential sales losses from this strategy will be alleviated by Game Pass signups, and the company is expecting a huge day for the subscription service.', '“Call of Duty to Game Pass day 1 is, of course, the Big Bet, and what the last few years have all been leading to,” Mat Piscatella, an analyst with Circana, told me in an email this week.', 'Game Pass has been the centerpiece of Xbox’s strategy for years, driving the company to make huge bets on Activision Blizzard and other purchases both big and small. But its subscriber count peaked in 2021 following the Covid-19 boom and has remained flat since then. As of August, video-game subscription spending in 2024 was only 1% higher than for the same period last year, Piscatella said.', '“We have not seen growth in the video game subscription space that many had predicted,” he added.', 'Today will be the first test of Xbox’s ability to reverse that trend, although the strategy comes with some big questions. Will the Game Pass release lead to softer sales? Will fans sign up for Game Pass just to get the new Call of Duty but unsubscribe in December when they’re done playing it? Will the never-ending multiplayer modes keep them in Microsoft’s ecosystem for the long haul?', 'Some analysts expect the new Call of Duty to lead to a significant boost in Game Pass subscribers. Piscatella, for his part, said there are too many variables to make concrete predictions. “I’m not expecting a seismic shift in where things stand being driven from the release of Call of Duty on Game Pass,” he said. “However, if I’m completely wrong on that I also won’t be surprised.”', 'The new Call of Duty release comes at a tumultuous time for Microsoft’s gaming unit, which has been slashing costs all year due to overall flat growth. Xbox has laid off thousands, shuttered studios and canceled projects.', 'All that cost-cutting is largely the result of pressure from Microsoft’s higher-ups, Bloomberg has reported, and that pressure is largely due to a certain $69 billion expenditure.', 'It’s not clear what Xbox will view as a success for this release. The company did not respond to requests for comment. So it may still be a while before we can gauge whether Activision Blizzard was worth that gargantuan cost. But one thing is for sure: It’s all been leading up to this day.', 'I’m not a Call of Duty person (and I’ll be spending the weekend playing a different game that I’ll tell you more about next week). But Black Ops 6 is receiving strong reviews so far. IGN called the story portion “the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years.”', 'You can reach Jason at jschreier10@bloomberg.net or confidentially at jasonschreier@protonmail.com.', 'Get Tech Daily and more Bloomberg Tech weeklies in your inbox:', '']"

With that in mind, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has decided to take the plunge and release Black Ops 6 as a day one Game Pass game, albeit restricted to the Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers.', 'This is a momentous moment not just for Call of Duty but for Game Pass, which has struggled for growth in recent years. Latest official figures put Game Pass subscriber numbers at 34 million. That’s 34 million paying subscribers across console, PC, and cloud. Indeed Microsoft removed its $1 introductory Game Pass trial just weeks before Black Ops 6’s launch, as it did with last year’s Starfield — further evidence, after recent price hikes and tier changes, that the pressure is now on for Game Pass to make the absolute most of the power of Call of Duty.', 'Will it pay off for Microsoft? In interviews with GamesIndustry.biz, analysts predicted Black Ops 6 could boost Game Pass subscriber numbers by between 2.5 million and 4 million. However, analysts also predicted a significant impact on sales of Black Ops 6. Call of Duty is usually the best-selling game of the year, but there is now a big question mark over whether it will achieve that record once again with Black Ops 6 given it’s available as part of Game Pass.', 'Wedbush boss Michael Pachter told GI that putting Black Ops 6 into Game Pass could result in up to six million lost sales, based on the idea that 25% of Game Pass subscribers might have bought the game anyway. Countering this, Pachter said Game Pass could swell by between three to four million subscribers.', 'This is a perhaps expected shift, but is it overall better for Microsoft and Activision? The theory is that getting more players through the door than ever before, even at the cost of sales of the game, will eventually pay out because of Call of Duty’s lucrative live service, which is fueled by premium battle passes and costly cosmetic packs. Microsoft may be playing the long game here, even though it risks negative headlines about Call of Duty sales being down compared to previous years.', 'Of course, now Microsoft has taken the plunge with Call of Duty little is off the table when it comes to Game Pass. The expectation now is that each year’s premium Call of Duty game will launch day one on Game Pass, and fans are still waiting for the back catalog to be added.', ""We’ve got plenty more on Black Ops 6 ahead of launch, including its strange arachnophobia mode, built-in support for better audio tech that costs $20, Activision’s new ambitious plans to beat cheaters, and confirmation it doesn't include the dreaded Riot Shield."", 'If you’re jumping into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, check out our Essential Multiplayer Tips and Tricks to help you get started.

It looks back at what has historically made the best CoD single-player modes so great and throws its own exciting and novel ideas into the mix, to fantastic effect. Telling one of the most engaging stories the series has ever seen, Black Ops 6’s enticing variety and impressive scale provide a stellar return to form."", 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 reviewed on Xbox Series X by Simon Cardy.', '']"

That puts it well above Modern Warfare 3’s 190,273 players at launch in 2023 and is approaching Modern Warfare 2’s 262,875 player peak in 2022, according to Steam Charts and Dexerto.', 'This is big news for Call of Duty, as it has slowly been bleeding players since MW3 launched last year, even with Warzone present in the HQ launcher. Prior to BO6 launching, CoD’s Steam numbers had reached an average of 57,376 average players—putting it close to a new all-time low, which is still held by September 2023’s 55,145 average.', 'Ahead of what will likely be a weekend surge in numbers, BO6 is already sitting as a top five game on Steam by player count, just behind PUBG. This also puts it ahead other popular shooters like Deadlock and Apex Legends. ', 'These numbers don’t reflect the massive Call of Duty audience playing on console and is further diluted this year because BO6 is the first Call of Duty game available day-and-date on Xbox Game Pass.

Black Ops 6 Campaign Review (Xbox) - Supernatural Surprises Elevate This Year's Call Of Duty,https://www.purexbox.com/features/black-ops-6-campaign-review-xbox-supernatural-surprises-elevate-this-years-call-of-duty,"['Guest', '', '', 'Pure Xbox', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Dark ops', ""Call of Duty is back, this time with another Black Ops entry for the first time since 2020's Black Ops Cold War. Just like that four-year old COD title, Black Ops 6's campaign has been put together by Raven Software - but this time around you can really feel the extra development time. Four years in the making and featuring an actual, genuine surprise for a Call of Duty campaign, this year's release shouldn't be missed - especially now that it's launching on Xbox Game Pass."", ""Having said that, you won't be feeling particularly surprised when Black Ops 6 first blasts its way onto your screen. After a short introduction, you're quickly thrown into the deserts of Kuwait to take out loads of bad guys with very little context. The first 10,15 minutes of Black Ops 6 are very 'Call of Duty', but let this one slowly work its magic, and you're in for a spy thriller-meets-supernatural shooter by the time its 8-10 hour story concludes."", ""And just like that, the game's second mission throws you into a big old stealth level - with a final target to takedown; à la Hitman or something. Okay, look, it's certainly not as sophisticated as IO Interactive's steely bald dude simulator, but Black Ops 6 is confident with its stealth levels - there are a few of them sprinkled into the full adventure. You're trusted to actually take your time a little bit here, and you probably want to do just that, because getting caught in these scenarios can be brutal."", ""In fact, Raven's campaign this year does feel tougher than your average Call of Duty game, which is just something to keep in mind. It's not super difficult, and the game does enough hand holding to get you by, but if you're a bit rusty with your Call of Duty shooty shooty, you might notice yourself succumbing to quite a few digital deaths by journey's end. This is particularly felt when the game gets a little bit supernatural, but more on that later."", ""Before we can get there, Black Ops 6 has another big old brown desert to throw at you in the form of a sprawling Iraq level, and this is definitely the weakest bit of this year's Call of Duty campaign. It's reminiscent of last year's 'open fire' missions from Modern Warfare 3, but where those fitted okay into a looser Call of Duty story, this one doesn't here in Black Ops 6. This year's story is a lot tighter and more cinematic, and for us, the Iraq level — with its vast map stuffed full of optional objectives — just didn't feel quite right. It also featured lots of weird geometry you could get stuck on — either in your vehicle or on-foot — meaning it felt somewhat unfinished sat in the middle of an otherwise super polished story mode."", ""Speaking of things that are super polished, it goes without saying that the gunplay here is fantastic. Pairing typical Black Ops weaponry with Infinity Ward's newer branch of the COD engine is a lovely marriage - and whatever weapon you're using, Black Ops 6 feels tight and snappy to play. We particularly enjoyed sniping here, where the game applies a little bit of slo-mo whenever you steady your scope to take out bad dudes. You gets lots of cool gadgets and equipment to play with too, all accessed by a big old weapon wheel, and yeah, you rarely feel short changed when it comes to combat options in Black Ops 6."", ""In terms of the overall storyline, BO6 is engaging, and it certainly kept us intrigued throughout. However, we can't say that some of the character interactions and little nods to past experiences didn't go over our heads a little bit. We've played every single COD campaign available on Xbox, and it all feels a little hard to keep track of in 2024. From what we can remember, there are strong links to Black Ops Cold War in this one, so it might be worth playing 2020's Call of Duty as well for a bit more context. That isn't essential of course, but you might get a stronger grasp on the BO6 story if you've more recently played the previous Black Ops title."", ""We don't really want to spoil story elements much beyond that, but we have to mention one particular section of Black Ops 6. Around the halfway mark or so, Raven gets all weird and supernatural with a hallucinogenic portion of the game, and we genuinely haven't been this surprised by a Call of Duty game since at least 'the numbers, Mason' in the original Black Ops. Again, that's as far as we'll go because we'd like to keep the surprise largely under wraps, but just know that if you like your COD campaigns to get weird, Black Ops 6 is for you."", ""Tech wise, this is a very solid affair, again built off Infinity Ward's newer Call of Duty engine. We had the 120Hz mode enabled because we use it in multiplayer, and while this certainly isn't rock solid here in the more demanding campaign mode, VRR was there to smooth over any dips. If you want a more solid campaign experience, it's probably worth making sure you're running at 60Hz instead. Aside from the weird geometry issues in that Iraq level, we only really encountered one other major bug too, where a character disappeared during a conversation at our interstitial hideout. It wasn't part of a major mission or anything so it was more amusing than anything else, but yeah, it's just something we thought to mention."", ""Overall then, Black Ops 6 features a really good campaign mode that's certainly worth the download on Xbox Game Pass. The story has a lengthy runtime — roughly eight hours at least — and is crammed full of interesting, varied missions - including one huge surprise that left us with a cheeky grin as we played through it. This is a big step up from the other COD campaign currently available on Game Pass in MW3, and fans of big, bombastic AAA experiences should have a right old blast with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign."", '', 'Great 8/10', 'Please note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Review,https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review,"['Note: This review specifically covers the single-player campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our multiplayer review in progress and our Zombies mode review in progress.', '', ""A spy thriller worthy of the name, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's campaign is a hugely welcome reinvigoration of the long-running first-person shooter series. It looks back at what has historically made the best CoD single-player modes so great and throws its own exciting and novel ideas into the mix, to fantastic effect. Telling one of the most engaging stories the series has ever seen, Black Ops 6’s enticing variety and impressive scale provide a stellar return to form."", ""Ever since the 2003 original, CoD campaigns have been heavily influenced by military action movies – starting in a logical place with classic WW2 cinema like The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan before moving on to more contemporary influences, in particular the panoramic yet still claustrophobic camerawork of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down."", ""But the lens shifted focus away from theatres of full-scale war and onto spy thrillers in the mold of the Mission: Impossible and Bourne series, beginning with 2010’s Black Ops and evolving into a refined, enthralling form with Black Ops 6. It’s in this distinctive direction that the returning Adler and Woods team up with a new team of skilled operators, this time in 1991, to combat an emerging new threat called The Pantheon, amid rumors of the creation of a potentially history-changing bioweapon. Sure, 2020's Cold War had its fair share of espionage action, but the majority of Black Ops 6's missions don't take place on the flashes and bangs of the frontline, but in the shadows that lie deep behind it."", ""Two missions in particular showcase this brilliantly: the infiltration of a political gala in Most Wanted, and the casino heist of High Rollers. The former presents three different options for how you want to go about completing your objective - I had a great time tinkering with a silent auction, but other paths are available that will test your spy skills - and while your choice has no lasting impact on the story, it does add an element of replayability to otherwise linear levels. The heist, by contrast, has you swapping between multiple members of your blacklisted team, spread across lavish slot machine-filled surroundings and the dank underground waterways beneath. You don't get to swap freely, but the slick character baton-passes add another dash of cinematic flair."", ""There's an enjoyable amount of flexibility to how you can approach other missions as well. Stealth is often encouraged, but going loud is almost always an option (with insta-fail stealth thankfully only rearing its ugly head on one or two occasions). Keeping to the shadows or hidden underwater made me feel like a silent assassin, but when I let that slip I had to swiftly switch to a more combative style."", 'Gunplay, crucially, delivers in both areas, with suppressed headshots satisfyingly pinging brains out of heads in one trigger pull and rattling SMGs and punchy shotguns feeling great when manically dashing in and out of cover thanks to the exciting new “omnimovement” system. This completely revamped movement mechanic allows you to sprint in any direction, as well as leap into the air sideways while firing to pull off your best gun-fu-esque stunts.', ""There's a great sense of improvisation as well. Weapons need to be constantly discarded and replaced with whatever gun is within grasp due to ammo sometimes being kept cleverly sparse. That also applies to the more DIY methods of dispatching enemies that are available, such as grabbing knives from chopping boards to then send them flying into skulls. Again, it evokes that espionage action movie feel, letting me briefly cosplay as John David Washington brutalising his way through a restaurant kitchen in Tenet."", ""The variety of its levels and top-tier presentation makes sure that it's never once dull, but this is a feat of stamina as well: By the historical standards of Call of Duty campaigns Black Ops 6 is one of the longest, clocking in at just around eight hours for me (roughly twice the length of Modern Warfare 3’s dud of a mission chain). It’s no Baldur’s Gate 3, certainly, but that’s a respectable runtime for a shooter campaign."", 'I do wish, though, that Call of Duty had more tricks up its sleeve by now when it comes to adding difficulty and differences to enemy encounters. Even now, after so many games, it’s still resorting to simply chucking a juggernaut or two your way to unload full magazines into when it wants to ramp up the stakes, but this time these challenges are occasionally solved via more interesting means thanks to a range of spy gadgets handed out at regular intervals. A throwing knife that can home in on targets adds a welcome dose of Batman energy to proceedings, and the trusty explosive remote control RC-XD cars make a fun return. Naturally, if all goes wrong, you can always rely on the more rustic C4 option to blow up anything you need it to.', 'When downtime is had between outings, the writing hits a fun sweet spot between cliché and self-awareness and is supported by a cast that fully buys into their roles. Bruce Thomas in particular is in great form as the brazenly enigmatic Russell Adler, and Y’lan Noel and Karen David make a great first impression as Marshall and Sevati, respectively. The latter has a lot of fun in her chameleon-like role as a master-of-disguise assassin, with new personas taken on from mission to mission.', '', ""You'll spend more time with them when you return to the safe house, where you can learn more about your teammates' backstories, solve puzzles, and purchase valuable upgrades using cash found on missions. These perks range from standard stuff like explosive damage negation to ones that are more traditionally found in multiplayer modes, such as Last Stand, which gives you a temporary health and speed boost when close to death. It's a further example of the increased flexibility in game design and the way that developer Raven Software is encouraging you to adopt your own playstyle."", ""Your sizeable Bulgarian manor is also home to dormant KGB secrets, which I had a great time uncovering. While none of the puzzles are too brain-testing – usually amounting to just memorising a series of numbers or using trial and error to unlock terminals – they successfully add even further variety to an otherwise (expectedly) gun-heavy time. It's surprisingly involved, and a fantastic improvement on an idea that began as a small abandoned garage in 2020’s Cold War, serving as a great place to plan for heists, undercover operations, and the completely unexpected."", ""Speaking of which… I won't say too much here so as not to spoil it, but perhaps the best mission of the whole campaign riffs off of previous Black Ops hallucinogenic episodes to create something that touches on the likes of BioShock, Prey, and Control in both its aesthetic and level design. It's hard to know which of Black Ops 6's many great missions will ultimately be remembered most fondly, but I have a feeling it might just be the weirdest that cements its place as an all-timer."", ""That isn't to say you're kept completely out of more traditional combat zones. The first Gulf War serves as the backdrop for Black Ops 6's story, and you do spend a couple of missions in the ‘90s Middle East. This allows for the mission design to return to its modern military roots, but does so by innovating on the Call of Duty formula, which is best exemplified in a mid-game mission that is as ambitious in its scale as any I've ever seen from this series of campaigns."", ""Taking place over a vast desert map, you're given the task of destroying three SCUD missile sites in any order and by any means of your choosing. Feel like driving straight through the front door in a jeep? Go for it. It may be much more advisable to pick off a few targets from afar and think about things more methodically, though. Points of interest are also dotted around the map, and those can reveal themselves to be anything from special equipment supply drops to SAS scouts who show you enemy locations. These areas are worth exploring, too, as certain side objectives are built into the larger main mission design, such as when I blew up three different enemy SAM encampments to free up the airspace and allow me to take control of a helicopter's buzzsaw of a machine gun later on. This choice and consequence system is further explored in an equally exciting later mission, too, and is one of Black Ops 6’s true masterstrokes."", 'It\'s a fantastic use of everything Call of Duty does at its best, and a ludicrously better example of how it can borrow from its Warzone and multiplayer modes to build something truly exciting in an open space that blows last year’s feeble attempt out of the water. It frankly puts Modern Warfare 3\'s ""open"" mission design to shame, and shows the worth of granting a development team more than a handful of months to cobble together a campaign.', ""Although enthralling to play, the fact that these missions take place during Operation Desert Storm doesn't serve the story in anywhere near as fulfilling a way, making the controversial conflict come across more like window dressing. They don't delve into, or address in a meaningful manner, any of the human issues at play that surrounded the conflict in 1991 Kuwait, Iraq, and the larger Gulf area. Black Ops 6 tries to have its cake and eat it too; you can't “keep politics out of video games” when the game in question painstakingly recreates several real-life world leaders and the wars their governments partook in to set the stage for its ensuing fireworks."", ""Modern Warfare 3’s campaign commits the biggest sin possible for a globe-trotting action thriller: it's boring. What had the promise to be an intriguingly spun web of mystery instead ends up being a dusty cobweb you'd find at the back of your shed, clinging onto 15-year-old garden toys you once had fun with. It's a pale imitation of the past, made up of underbaked story moments that clash with attempts to introduce new open combat missions designed to encourage player freedom that instead fall flat on their face. Yes, the gunplay is still great and the graphics and sound design are top-tier, but I couldn't help but feel I was playing a shinier, less subtle version of something I've played too many times before. If this is the quality we've come to expect from Call of Duty campaigns, maybe it's for the best if a year or two is taken to reset and raise this low bar back to the heights of old. - Simon Cardy, November 3, 2023"", 'Read the full Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Review', ""Instead, this is a story that’s far more concerned with being a popcorn spy thriller than it is with examining or even reacting to its own subject matter, which in and of itself isn't a fundamental issue – but after Modern Warfare’s weak argument against chemical weapons in 2019 and Modern Warfare 3's refusal to use terrorism for anything more than cheap thrills just last year, Black Ops 6 follows an unfortunate trend of recent CoD campaigns declining to offer an emotionally nuanced reading of the settings they take on. It's no doubt entertaining, and I’m not exactly looking for (nor expecting) a deep, forensic examination of the cultural cost of global conflicts here, but it still feels like the latest instalment in a series of missed opportunities. There is room to both entertain and say something real, as so many of the war and spy movies CoD emulates already do, and 2012's Spec Ops: The Line is often praised for (even though its conflict is fictionalised)."", 'What is delivered is a constantly engaging spy thriller story as the exiled Woods, Adler, and a string of new faces go off the record to decipher the links between the CIA, Saddam Hussein, and The Pantheon. What begins as a fairly standard cloak-and-dagger plot really comes alive in the back half, managing to weave in personal stakes and treats for long-time Black Ops fans. The nature of its closing chapter crept up and honestly surprised me, somehow managing to balance a bombastic crescendo with genuine emotive strain. It’s as good as a Call of Duty plot has been in a long, long time.', '', ""A shout-out must also go to the quality animation on display, a technical area that can sometimes be taken for granted when it comes to Call of Duty. Whether it's intricate gun reloads and the mechanical finesse of your weapons when fired during gameplay, or the sheer fidelity of the cutscenes, it truly is best-in-class work."", 'An excellent string of missions that offer variety and flexibility come together to make the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years. Black Ops 6 is a fantastic return to form for the series, allowing the designers at Raven to delve deep into their bag of tricks and keep you guessing at every turn. It successfully makes each chapter distinct from one another, whilst maintaining a strong level of quality across the board. Packing a thoroughly engaging story that gets better the longer it goes on, it exceeds expectations regarding level design and creativity, showing that when given the time to craft them properly, CoD campaigns still have what it takes to be up there with the best first-person shooters.', '']"
