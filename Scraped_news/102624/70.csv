The new guidance strengthens that recommendation by encouraging practitioners to offer the vaccines twice a year.', '“The COVID vaccine, while very effective in preventing severe disease, that protection wanes rather quickly over four to five months in older people and people who are immune compromised,” William Schaffner, MD, a spokesperson for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Verywell.', 'There appear to be two peaks in COVID cases in a year, according to data presented at a CDC advisory committee meeting this week.

And it’s best to wait at least two months between COVID vaccines.', '“Flu and COVID are going to be around this winter, causing a lot of illness, and we would like as little of that to be severe as possible,” Schaffner said. “In order to ensure that, we all have to get vaccinated.”', 'Vaccination can protect you against severe outcomes from a COVID infection and reduce the likelihood of developing long COVID.

People who are immunocompromised may require even more doses, depending on their personal health and doctor’s advice.', 'CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said the updated recommendation “allows people to make the best decisions possible to keep themselves and their loved ones safe from COVID-19.”', 'Is this year’s COVID booster a good match for new variants?', 'This update comes as health experts continue to monitor respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, the flu, and RSV. As of mid-October, the CDC said COVID-19 hospitalizations and emergency room visits were declining overall, and respiratory virus activity remained low nationally.', 'Although there is uncertainty about how much COVID-19 will spread during the colder months, the CDC is hopeful that hospitalizations and severe cases will remain similar to, or lower than, those in 2023. It believes vaccinations will play a key role in keeping numbers manageable.', 'The CDC also noted that getting the updated vaccine can help protect against newer variants and reduce the risk of Long COVID, which causes ongoing symptoms after the initial infection.', 'While the latest vaccines aren’t a perfect match for the newest variants, experts say they still provide strong protection. Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health, previously explained that the 2024 vaccines are about 80% matched to current variants and should be much more effective than previous versions.', 'Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
